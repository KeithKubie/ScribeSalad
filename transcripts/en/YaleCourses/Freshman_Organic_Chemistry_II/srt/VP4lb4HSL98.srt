1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:02,581
Okay,

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:07,581
so more today about the lore of acid
derivative acids and acid derivatives,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,610
which you'll find in chapter 17,
18.

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,850
We'll get on maybe at
the end to chapter 19,

5
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:18,900
but probably that's for Friday.
Okay.

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:22,460
At the end last time we were
talking about uh, having, uh,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,740
an r minus that isn't organic metallic
molecule react with an acid and showed

8
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,580
that of course the first thing
it does is act as a base,

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,100
not as a nucleophile
and pull off the Proton.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,200
But even at that stage it's possible to
for another one to come in and add to

11
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:44,310
the carbon oxygen double
bond to give this dye salt.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,350
And then when this is hydrolyzed, at
the end of the day, you get a ketone.

13
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,350
So you can convert an
acid to a ketone that way.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,030
But it's difficult because uh,

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,930
sometimes it's not possible
to do it in two stages.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,890
Here you stopped at the,
at the dye lithium salt,

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,460
then you got rid of the r minus when
you added acid and got the ketone.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,950
But in the case of using hydride rather
than our minus as the base nucleophile.

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,210
Again, you first make the salt,
but the second time around, uh,

20
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,100
you can get the aluminum also
is the salt of the oxygen.

21
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,940
And when you have that, it's possible.
That's not a bad leaving group.

22
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,530
It's better than the old lithium,

23
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:36,531
the Oh aluminum so that it's possible
to do an elimination reaction where the

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,530
electrons of the lithium oxygen bond or
the oxygen and I can help push out the

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,980
aluminum, oxygen and ion. So that in situ,

26
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:49,590
well while you're doing the reaction,

27
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:54,591
it forms the Aldehyde bear in mind in
the first step in the first reaction when

28
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:56,340
we use the alcohol lithium,

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,670
we got the carbon eel group back only
after adding acid here at forms again,

30
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,050
while the reaction is going on.

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,370
And of course aldehydes or reactive
with literally Mulloon and hydride.

32
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,960
So you don't stop at the carbonyl,
you go all the way to the alcohol,

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,360
adding two H's.
Uh,

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,580
now we'll see a little bit later
or ways to try to control that.

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,350
Now decarboxylation is another, uh, uh,

36
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,210
interesting reaction of carboxylic acids.
And in particular of dialysis,

37
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,050
like melodic acid, which has two, uh,

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,060
two acid groups attached to the same
carbon. This is the scheme that, that,

39
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:42,930
uh, Mitsui Nobu used in his
paper to talk about, uh,

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,570
making the compound at the bottom
right that we discussed, uh, uh,

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,780
Dave last time or the time before that.
Now remember he first,

42
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:56,781
he got this compound by forming that
carbon carbon bond and it has two esters

43
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,800
and a CN triple. But we said that
it was possible to convert the, uh,

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,630
the ester into an acid.

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,890
We'll talk about this a little bit more
and the other Esther into an acid and

46
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,460
the cyanide also the NIH
trial group into an acid.

47
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,890
Now I've drawn that asset
at an interesting cotton
formation here because you

48
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:21,340
see a possibility this doesn't
happen when you have the an eye on.

49
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,130
But when you have the,
the protonated carboxylate,

50
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,350
then it's possible to do
and you have to have them.

51
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,510
It's possible to do this reaction.

52
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,890
So you use these electrons to form a
bond to that hydrogen. These go here,

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,750
these go down here. What's the
product at the top from this cycle?

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,980
Can you see what it is?

55
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:43,870
Yeah,

56
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,850
what did the carbon at the top become?

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Carbon dioxide. Right? So,

58
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,870
so you have co two that'll fly off.

59
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:58,160
It's a decarboxylation and you're
left with this, which is an Ian.

60
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,170
All right?

61
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,000
And of course that can undergo
an alloy rearrangement to the,

62
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,830
to the ketone form of the enormity
and the h go on here, right?

63
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:12,080
And then you have the product.
So that,

64
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,100
so when you have to a carboxyl
groups on the same carbon and,

65
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:21,410
and it's protonated so that you can do
this cyclic mechanism to transfer the

66
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,244
proton,

67
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,570
then you can easily lose co
two and do a decarboxylation.

68
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,970
Okay. But there are other ways
to do decarboxylation from acids.

69
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,260
The Co two can be a leaving
group also from Xco,

70
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,440
two minus where x is something that can
tolerate a negative charge or from the

71
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:44,270
RCO too radical.
So for example,

72
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:49,271
carbonic acid though that hydrate
of CO2 got gotten under can,

73
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,740
uh, if it, uh, it's an acid, it's also
a base. So if you, if you get this,

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,060
uh, form, then you can see how it
can undergo the decarboxylation.

75
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:02,000
So that's just the reverse.
If the hydration of co two,

76
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,930
so carbonic acid and CEO to go
back and forth, uh, Civil Elisa,

77
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,810
that's a case where the x can can leave
with the, uh, with an unshared payer.

78
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,740
Okay.
Or Car Bam make acid where the,

79
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,100
where it's nitrogen that does the trick
and you can see the same kind of thing

80
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,010
to get a decarboxylation,
right.

81
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,340
Or we actually mentioned last semester
already a Colby electrolysis where it's a

82
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:31,400
free radical that does it.
So you start with a carboxylate an ion,

83
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,440
but you do an oxidation to remove an
electron from it, which then makes this,

84
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,270
this free radical. But that free
radical is fabulously unstable.

85
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:45,140
When r is an eal group
and it undergoes this,

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,790
a shift of the electron, single
electrons, it's a radical process,

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,430
which is fast.
Even at four Kelvin,

88
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,910
you can't see Ya ESR
spectrum of this thing.

89
00:05:55,911 --> 00:06:00,911
Even at that very low and immediately
lose a CEO too and gives the stable that

90
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,280
the free radical, even if it's not a
particularly stable, free radical. Uh,

91
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,150
so you remember Colby used that,
uh,

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,940
unbeknownst to him to make
r two R two was ethane.

93
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,770
Remember he thought he had
made the methyl radical,

94
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,530
but once molecular
weights were determinable,

95
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,750
it turned out that he actually had
the dimer, uh, ethane. And in fact,

96
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:28,100
that reaction can work fairly well
synthetically to take two acids,

97
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,210
knock out two CEO twos and
have the rs come together. Uh,

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,970
that was done in 1848, but in 1973, uh,

99
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,910
they got a 50% yield by doing electrolysis
that generates this free radical by

100
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:44,150
losing CO2 from it and
the dimer was formed.

101
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,910
Okay. So there are examples
of decarboxylation, uh,

102
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,220
but also there's another
one that's interesting,

103
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,930
which is to treat an acid,
uh, with silver oxide,

104
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:00,500
which gives a silver salt of the acid.
Right?

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,120
Then if you treat that with bromine,
you get our br.

106
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,040
So you can convert a carboxylic
acid to the are to the,

107
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,250
to the [inaudible] bromide
with one less carbon atom.

108
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,910
A decarboxylation has been involved,
okay.

109
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:20,090
And it's pretty easy to see how
that would work if you react.

110
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:25,091
The salt with br to the o minus can do
a nuclear filling substitution on bro,

111
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:28,720
been with bromide leaving to give this,
uh,

112
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,330
to give this a bro
brominated intermediate.

113
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,590
But now if you have a
free radical in there,

114
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,750
it can attack the bromine to form the
RBR bond and generate this radical,

115
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,060
which is we've already seen
immediately lose a CO2 and give.

116
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:52,020
So we have a free radical chain
that allows, uh, this, uh,

117
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,670
brominated acid to become our br.

118
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,430
Now this, this reaction to
convert an acid to a, an Lpo,

119
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:06,320
bromide is called the Hunt's Deeker
reaction for a sort of curious reason.

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,970
It seems to me in between 1936 and 1944,

121
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,740
uh, the hunts dickers husband
and wife, uh, published,

122
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:20,741
I think something like six patents for
doing this and one paper in the open

123
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:24,260
literature. Right? But in fact,

124
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,680
the same reaction had been done in
1861 and published in a leading German

125
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,750
Journal and Nolen,
uh,

126
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:37,751
by Alexander Porphyria of Bora Dean
who was obviously much earlier than the

127
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:41,510
hundred stickers. This
is his, uh, his, uh,

128
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,640
Tulum in Saint Petersburg.

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,240
And notice that it doesn't have anything
about doing this reaction on it cause

130
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:54,470
he was not only a chemist, he was
also a musician. Uh, so can you those,

131
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,280
I know some of you are good musicians.

132
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,470
Can you see what this
line is up at the top?

133
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,353
What is it?

134
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,190
Paula. Betsy and dances by Bora
Dean from Prince Igor. And in fact,

135
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,260
although he didn't get any recognition
in terms of the reaction being named for

136
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,860
him, these people that came along
75 years later got their credit.

137
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,690
He did get a posthumous Tony
Award because that tool, you know,

138
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,440
Dadada Dadada Dadada is the,

139
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,080
is the theme of the musical Kismet.

140
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,660
So he came out, okay. Anyhow, okay.

141
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:35,010
But now when we think about,

142
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:39,450
so here's a way to take our CEO
too and make it into our br,

143
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,620
right? When you're thinking
about possibilities or synthesis,

144
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:44,760
you should think about is there,

145
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,910
is there a way to go the other direction
to start with our br and go to our,

146
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,260
to go to the acid with one
additional carbon. So can
you add a carbon to do that?

147
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Can anybody think of a way of doing that
to take our br and substitute the br

148
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,900
with an acid groups, you know, to
put another carbon on the chain.

149
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,923
Okay,

150
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,920
we'll actually talk about this
some more later, but we, we,

151
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,050
we had shown an example that
if you have cyanide, which,

152
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,340
which is a nuclear file,

153
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:22,060
so you could do an sn two
reaction and put cyanide there.

154
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,590
But cyanide has the same oxidation
state of the carbon as the acid does.

155
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,740
So just treating it with
water and either acid or base,

156
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,620
and we'll talk about this a little
later on and he can do that.

157
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:33,820
So you can go either direction,

158
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:37,120
you can take the acid to the
bromide or the bromide to the acid.

159
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,650
And that's not the only way. Notice
that this involves the are being our,

160
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:46,030
plus the thing with the Lumo, the sigma
star that gets attacked by the cyanide.

161
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,360
But there's another way to start with Rbr,

162
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,340
whereas our is r minus, it's
a homo that does the, the uh,

163
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,720
the attacking.

164
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,470
So how would you convert RBR
into something that's like
our minus something that

165
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,010
has a high homo?

166
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:04,680
Yeah.

167
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Under what circumstances does ar have
behave like our minus is it associated

168
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:11,790
with a high homo?

169
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,440
Yeah.

170
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,820
When it's associated with a halogen,
it's a low Lumo right. What is it?

171
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,830
And it's the, uh, it's the sigma star,

172
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,950
but how can you get the
sigma to be high energy?

173
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,333
Pardon me?

174
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,530
A greenie. Ari Agent. Okay, good. So
you, if you want our minus, you read,

175
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,050
make a Greenie our reagent and now you
have to react that in order to get an

176
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:37,820
acid,
what will you react it with?

177
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,990
What will it attack in order
to put the carbon oxygens on

178
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,850
Roy [inaudible]?

179
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,310
Yeah, sure. Carbon dioxide.

180
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:53,920
It's exactly the reverse of the
reaction we're talking about. Right?

181
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,100
So you bring carbon dioxide in,
you got the salt,

182
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,260
treat it with acid and you do it.
So there's,

183
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,240
there are many ways to skin these cats.
Okay,

184
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,220
so we're talking about acid derivatives
that we've just been talking about

185
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:13,270
acids, but acid derivatives are things
where you have some other group,

186
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:17,770
their x with an unshared
pair. Not, uh, not ooh.

187
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,560
Okay. So, uh,

188
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,870
one example that's called it an acid
derivative is a night trial that we just

189
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,080
talked about. Uh, another
one is a key team.

190
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,150
Now let's think about how these are
regarded as acid derivatives there.

191
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,950
As we just mentioned in the last slide,

192
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,830
the carbon has a plus
three oxidation level,

193
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,010
cause x is electronegative something
with the unshared pair there.

194
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,350
And in night trial it's also plus three.
So you can go between these things,

195
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,860
that acid just by treating
them with water. Okay.

196
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,370
Although you may need catalysts than
a high temperature in order to do it.

197
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,390
Night trials are not so easy
to, do. You remember he,

198
00:12:57,391 --> 00:13:02,390
he a reflux that for 24 hours or
something like that in order, uh,

199
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,490
Mitsui, Nobu did in order to
do this. Okay, that's fine.

200
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,560
But over here the carbon is,
is plus two in its oxidation level.

201
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,980
It doesn't look like you're
dealing with the same thing, right?

202
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,220
However this other carbon is minus two
and if you add water to it and if you go

203
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:25,390
to the acid, it's minus
three plus three. So it's,

204
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,050
it's again no change in our
overall oxidation levels.

205
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:33,190
So you don't need an oxidizing
her reducing agent and
you can just do that with

206
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:37,510
water. So key teen will react with
water to give a carboxylic acid.

207
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,160
So all these things are called
acid derivatives. Okay? First,

208
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,350
just the word about the spectroscopy.
In fact,

209
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,910
I'll go in about three seconds through
the first slide cause we've already done

210
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,020
it in some detail.

211
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,310
I remember we looked at carbon eel
stretching frequencies in the IRR and saw

212
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:57,100
that aldehydes and ketones were similar,

213
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,870
but the amid was much lower frequency
because of the unshared pair on the

214
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:06,871
nitrogen being involved stabilized
by the carbon oxygen Pi Star.

215
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:12,460
And therefore weakening it to make it a
weak bond. But it's in the case of, uh,

216
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,870
but in the case of the Ester,
the bond was in fact strengthened a bit.

217
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,140
And in the case of acid chloride,
it was strengthened quite a bit.

218
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,000
And that the reason for that was that you
could get this other curious resonance

219
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,290
structure.
Okay,

220
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,670
so we already did this and
I'm not spending any time
just reminding you of it,

221
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,260
but the one thing I'll
talk about that's new is,

222
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,750
is the an hydride,

223
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,560
which is of course an acid derivative
where the x group that can,

224
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,250
that's attached to the
carbon eel is another acid.

225
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,280
So here we see an IRS spectrum and
here is the percent transmission.

226
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,740
So that's,
so this is very little light.

227
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:59,000
Getting through a strong absorption
means a means. A small number here.

228
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,750
And if we look in this, this region,
here's the carbon eel region,

229
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,310
we see that there are two peaks,

230
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,460
which isn't surprising because
there are two carbon eels, right?

231
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:10,340
There's one at 1819 which is very strong.

232
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,730
And another one at 1750
which is considerably weaker
right now to carbon eels to

233
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,280
IRR frequencies to IRP because that
seems to make sense except that it's

234
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,720
symmetrical.
Wouldn't you expect them to be the same?

235
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,100
Pardon me?
Asymmetrical frequency.

236
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,120
Okay, so they couple, right? The two,

237
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,740
they could either both be stretching at
the same time or one can be stretching

238
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,400
while the other shrinking.
And if they're close enough together,

239
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,710
separated only by ox one oxygen,

240
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,150
they can interact mechanically one another
and one of those is easier than the

241
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:56,480
other. So the normal modes,
there are two normal modes.

242
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,720
Both involve both of the COO bonds.
Right.

243
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,050
And we can understand how it
would be because if they're,

244
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,620
if they're in phase both
stretching at the same time,

245
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,000
then the light will interact
very strongly with it. Okay.

246
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,510
Because both of them were being stretched
by the same direction of the electric

247
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:19,340
field and the light. So, and it turns
out that that's difficult to do.

248
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,280
It's difficult to stretch
them both at the same time.

249
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,150
It's better to have one stretch when
the other shrinks in terms of energy.

250
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,660
So this one is hard to do.
That means it's at high frequency,

251
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,160
but it's quite intense
because the, the uh, the,

252
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,620
but they're both going the same direction.

253
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,540
The other normal mode would have one
going up while the other's going down.

254
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,910
Now if they were strictly parallel,

255
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,180
there would be no net interaction
to the light for that.

256
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,680
But if they're twisted a little
bit or splayed out a little bit,

257
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,140
then there will be some
interaction with light.

258
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:57,620
They won't exactly cancel one another.
And that's what happens here.

259
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:01,610
So you have a strong peak where they're
both stretching at the same time and a

260
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:06,350
week or peak where one is stretching
and the other is shrinking. Okay.

261
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,710
Now if you compare that
with this sick leak image,

262
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,150
which is another acid derivative where
nitrogen is attached to the ACL group.

263
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,760
And now we looked at the,
at the peaks here,

264
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:21,440
and you see a strong peak at low frequency
and a week peak at high frequency.

265
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,000
So it's exactly the opposite.
Can you see why it would be the opposite?

266
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,100
Cause now when they both
stretch at the same time,

267
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,590
when when one stretches
and the other shrinks,

268
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,140
the oxygens are moving the same direction.

269
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,050
So they're both in being pushed the way
light wants them to go. Right where,

270
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,980
so that one,
which is now,

271
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,500
which is now the easy one to do where
stretch one and shrink the other is now

272
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,880
very strong.
It interact strongly with light.

273
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,960
But the one where they're in
phase here is now a very weak,

274
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:00,600
they nearly cancel one another.
Okay.

275
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,950
So that's just an interesting
additional example of, of uh, of,

276
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,350
uh,
IRR coupling.

277
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,620
But it helps you see how you use the IRS
to interpret stuff about structure as

278
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:16,920
the weather to carbonyls are parallel
or anti parallel most of the time.

279
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,290
Okay. Now the Inter conversion, the
chemistry of the acid derivatives.

280
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,640
So the idea is that some nucleophile
comes in and forms the bond and then the

281
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:33,990
other one leaves day.
So that's a substitution.

282
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,910
But of course it involves a tetrahedral
intermediate. It's not like sn two.

283
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,920
You actually have an association
to give it in a stable,

284
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,230
intermediate followed by dissociation.

285
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,990
So it's not a pentavalent
transition state.

286
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:52,350
It's a tetrahedral Tetra
Vaillant carbon intermediate.

287
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,260
Now, which group will leave from
that intermediate x or y? Well,

288
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,090
there's a hierarchy of these things.

289
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:05,091
The easiest thing to leave as chloride
than carboxylic acid than an alcohol and

290
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:11,130
I, and then nitrogen and I.
And so, uh, and you can, uh,

291
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,770
you can see why this would be why so?

292
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,470
Because that's the order of stability
of the Anti Ins, right. As, as,

293
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,780
as exemplified in the PKA.

294
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,260
So if you could make
the most energetic one,

295
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,030
the top one. Yeah, the acid chloride.

296
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,600
Then by adding the others
successful successively,

297
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:37,200
you could make it into any of
the other three or the next one.

298
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,190
The asset and hydride into,

299
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:43,740
in either of the other two or
the ester into the amid or,

300
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,310
and so on.

301
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,050
So the important thing is to get up at
the top of the ladder at the beginning.

302
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,880
And you can do that the same way
you'd converted alcohol to do RCL.

303
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,830
You can get rid of the acid to the
acid chloride by using SOCL too.

304
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,540
And as I was saying, out of
order before the, the, this,

305
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,230
this order of the hierarchy
is clear because of the pks,

306
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,000
they're in the order of the
stability of the Anti Ions, right?

307
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,020
But it's not just the stability of the
anti ions that makes them have that order

308
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,970
because as we saw before,

309
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,630
you get resonance stabilization of the
electrons that are on why that is the,

310
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,170
the, uh, whatever this group is here,
chlorine, oxygen, oxygen, nitrogen,

311
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,560
right is those electrons are stabilized
by the vacant orbital here as denoted by

312
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,640
these resonance structures.

313
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,450
So even if you didn't have the question
of the stability, the, and ions,

314
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,870
this stability of the derivatives would
still be the same that it likes most to

315
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:50,200
be with nitrogen because it can get the
special stability from stabilizing the

316
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:55,030
high energy electrons of the nitrogen.
It's lower. If it's an oxygen,

317
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,370
it's still lower if it's a carboxylate
group because although it's an oxygens

318
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:03,940
unshared pair, as in the case
of alcohol, those electron,

319
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,970
that electron pair on that oxygen has
already stabilized by its own Carbonell

320
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,630
group. So it's not as available
for being stabilized by,

321
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,950
by the one here. So it's not, so
this one is not as stable as that.

322
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:19,600
This one is not as stable as that.

323
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,520
And what that means is you don't have to
do this with base in order to get these

324
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:27,280
anti ends in order to have
this reactivity scale.

325
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,830
You could do the same thing if you,

326
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,970
if you had acid catalyzed and we've
already seen it in the case of Fischer

327
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:37,160
esterification where you convert,
uh,

328
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,010
an out where now it's a question
of alcohol and water. That is,

329
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:46,540
are you going to put on Oh, are or are
you going to put on o h right. And we've,

330
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:51,010
we've gone through the acid catalyzed
and mechanism of Fischer esterification

331
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:56,011
which converts Oih to Orr
or o r o h and the equal.

332
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,100
And you can also do transistor effication.

333
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,110
You can take one Esther and a different
alcohol and have the o our prime replace

334
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,880
or double prime or something like that.

335
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,160
You could go back and forth
from one Esther or the other.

336
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,560
But the equilibrium constant for this
acid catalyzed processes about one.

337
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:16,940
There's not much difference
among the different ares,

338
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,600
but you make it go the way you want in a
Fischer esterification by using the law

339
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:26,870
of mass action, you put in a whole bunch
of alcohol, then you get that Esther.

340
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,061
Okay.

341
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:31,990
Or are you put in a whole bunch of water
and then you get the carboxylic acid,

342
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,151
right?

343
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:39,151
So the going back and forth between a
alcohol between Esther and acid also is,

344
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,120
is very much like these
transistors applications.

345
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,070
But if you use base, it's
a different story, right?

346
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,350
So you can have a hydroxide come in
and or minus go out. That's fine.

347
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,060
And it looks like it should be, uh,
an equilibrium constant of about one.

348
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,530
But in fact,

349
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,590
this reaction has a special
name [inaudible] and it has
an equilibrium constant,

350
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,020
much greater than one.
Now,

351
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:12,430
why should there be a difference between
o r and o h? An enormous difference.

352
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,880
It's because this isn't
the end of the line.

353
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,830
That O r minus that disappeared can
get back in the act. In what way?

354
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,243
Okay,

355
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,870
Sebastien. Right? This is it.

356
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,810
This is not called an acid
for nothing, right? So it can,

357
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,120
it can transfer the
proton to the or minus.

358
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,490
And now that's very favorable because
the pka of the acid is about five.

359
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,730
The PKA of a typical alcohol is about
16 so they differ by 11 orders of

360
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:48,644
magnitude.

361
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,810
That means the equilibrium constant is
about 10 to the 11th when you take factor

362
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:54,470
in that you,

363
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,550
that you don't stop at the acid but go
to the anti end of the acid and to the

364
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,250
alcohol. Okay? Now,

365
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,200
why does this thing have a special name?
Saponin effication this particular,

366
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:06,830
uh,

367
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,830
substitution reaction because you have
these things called triglycerides,

368
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,070
which are long chain acids,
right?

369
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,170
Attached as Esther's to a
three carbon unit, right?

370
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,000
Do you know what else you call
those things besides triglycerides,

371
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,540
but fats? Okay, so that's fat.

372
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,120
And if you treat fat with lie,

373
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,720
you're doing something that's
been known through Millennia,

374
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,020
right?

375
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Because lie is what you get when
you take the ashes from a fire and,

376
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,500
and filter water through it, right?
And then evaporate the water.

377
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,980
You know what you get?
What lie is?

378
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,663
Yeah,

379
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,520
it's potassium hydroxide.

380
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,493
Okay?

381
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,130
So you treat it with Koh and you
have this reaction take place.

382
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,970
So you get carboxylic acids,
long chain carboxylic acids,

383
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,520
and you get alcohols on all those,
those three.

384
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,020
So these long chain fatty acids,
the salts of them,

385
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:15,910
the potassium salts are called what?

386
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,470
Yeah.

387
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,930
Why is it called [inaudible]?
Pontification what's Savo owner?

388
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:27,030
South Porn. Yeah. Right. It's so, right.

389
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:31,890
So that's how soap was made
and still is made. Right.

390
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:36,891
And that stuff is called glycerin that
try alcohol right now there's a very

391
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:42,351
interesting book about lore in the
Appalachian Mountains called the Fox fire

392
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,490
book.
Has Anybody seen that?

393
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,160
There was a movie made from
it a long time ago actually,

394
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,020
but a bunch of high school,
uh, uh, English class,

395
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,890
uh,

396
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,760
had the project of going out and talking
to people who knew how to do things and

397
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:58,740
then write the traditional lore.

398
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,940
And one of the people they talked to was
the grandmother of one of the girls who

399
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:06,570
was, uh, whose name was Pearl
[inaudible] Martin and who made soap.

400
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:11,930
And so she showed the girl, she had a big
kettle and put in Lard and put in lie.

401
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,390
And, and stirred it up. And, and she says,

402
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:18,480
and then there she says now
the soaps making and so on.

403
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,890
And so she got the soap out and she
said, you know, I can wash my hair in it.

404
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,090
And the girls were,

405
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,010
were astounded that she would wash her
hair in this stuff that came from lie.

406
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,560
Right.
But

407
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,990
she said,
I eat afraid to wash my hair in it.

408
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,150
She said that their lard eats the lie.

409
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,970
What did she mean by she? She of
course, hadn't studied chemistry,

410
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:48,570
at least I don't believe, although she
had very good practical knowledge of it,

411
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,510
that she knew that she could
wash her hair with this stuff.

412
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:56,310
Even though it you'd put lie in it.
The girls were dumbfounded at this.

413
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,720
Right. But the reason is that
the large eight, the lie,

414
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,040
the lie was like Aro
minus, right. PK about 16.

415
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,890
But this last stage that
makes the reaction go,

416
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:11,130
it makes it a Karbach slate
with the PK of only five.

417
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:15,720
So it doesn't hurt your hair. Yeah.
So there's some tradition for you

418
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,090
now. Uh, an interesting, uh, uh,

419
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,430
question is how to,

420
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,460
is what happens when the nucleophile is
r o minus our apartment is r minus or h

421
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,650
minus rather than these other things.

422
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,710
So I'm going to put a little bit
of this on the board and there's a,

423
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,320
let's see us get this up.
Put this thing over on the other screen.

424
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,710
Actually it's supposed to
be there. Yeah, there it is.

425
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,030
Okay,
so let me put this up

426
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,403
and

427
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,050
get some light here.
Yes,

428
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,310
yes. This no, this,

429
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,503
there we go.

430
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,660
Okay.
So what if you have

431
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,200
r minus
or h minus

432
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,860
as the nucleophile.

433
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,420
Okay,

434
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,900
so suppose we start, these are for
reactions with acid derivatives.

435
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,390
Suppose we use the acid chloride
then if we use hydride for example,

436
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,070
lithium aluminum hydride

437
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,390
so the alh four minus hi homo there.
Okay,

438
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:59,560
so that's good. So hydride can come
in here, put minus on the oxygen,

439
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,060
chloride can leave

440
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:09,900
and we get Aldehyde. Okay. But,

441
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,440
uh, the reaction won't stop there, right?

442
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:17,670
Because we already know that aldehydes
are reduced by lithium aluminum hydride.

443
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,040
So we'll go on to put two,
uh,

444
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,670
pardon me to put two hydrogens on and,

445
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,200
and make ultimately make this.

446
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:31,170
And ultimately when you add acid,

447
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,320
you'll get all the way to the
alcohol, not just to the, sorry,

448
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,850
not just to the, uh, to the Aldehyde.

449
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,690
So it's not just our substitution
of chloride by hydride,

450
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:51,691
but you go on all the way to the product
or if you have an al kill lithium

451
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,320
or an LPL magnesium bromide.

452
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,900
Okay.

453
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,080
You'd do the same kind of thing.
You get the out the, the, uh,

454
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,000
now would be a ketone first.
Cause this is an art group.

455
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:07,810
Yeah.

456
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,170
But again,
you go on and get the alcohol

457
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,580
having put on two new our groups.

458
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,910
So if that's the kind of alcohol
you want with two our groups,

459
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,940
there's a good to our groups have the
same kind that you can get from an Lpo.

460
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,100
Hey, lied then, uh, that's
a good way to do it.

461
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,140
Now if you do use an Ester,

462
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,333
yes,

463
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,340
I'll just write ditto.

464
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,863
Yes.

465
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,140
Right. If you, if you react it
with Alyssa, Google hydride,

466
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:45,730
you get all the way to the alcohol.

467
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:50,731
Replacing now the or minus instead of
the cl or if you use LPL lithium or I'll

468
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:54,400
kill magnesium bromide.
You all go all the way to the alcohol.

469
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,720
In fact on a particularly
interesting one is to use to chlorine

470
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,350
or two asters.

471
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,990
Can you see what would happen
in that case if you use,

472
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,780
if you react to those with
the hydride or with the uh,

473
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,470
or with the r minus at Lpl metal compound,

474
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,080
what's going to be different?

475
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,590
Well, if you went through,
uh, yeah, you, you, you,

476
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:39,620
you replace the chloride by r minus,

477
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:42,590
same kind of trick we're
doing here or h r h minus.

478
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Then you replaced the other
chloride by h minus or are minus,

479
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,350
get an Aldehyde or a ketone and then you
do the, then you add to the carbon eel.

480
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,210
So now we put three groups on.

481
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,170
So we have a c o h at the end

482
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,250
with three our groups. You could
do the same thing with the hydride,

483
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,430
but there wouldn't be much point
in making methanol that way.

484
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:13,340
You're using expensive reagents
to make something cheap.

485
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,450
But if you want something that has
three of the same art groups on it,

486
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:21,580
that could be a practical
way of going about it. Okay.

487
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,410
It's slightly different.

488
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,520
Yeah.

489
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,070
If you're using an ami and a mid,

490
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,840
so suppose you is,
let aluminum hide

491
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,890
dried.
Now we'll get,

492
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,370
uh, just, uh, all this are here.

493
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,000
So we have Nh two

494
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:02,270
and h minus that came in right now what
we've done above is then deludes this

495
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:09,720
group that was originally there,
Louis chloride or lose. Oh,

496
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:14,340
minus R o minus. Right. But
it's a little different here

497
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,700
because with the aluminum

498
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,720
salt here,

499
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,100
the aluminum helps make this oxygen
a better leaving group than it would

500
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:28,590
otherwise be.
So in k instead of losing,

501
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,640
instead of coming like this
and losing the nitrogen,

502
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:38,400
what happens is the unshared
pair helps you lose the oxygen.

503
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:45,300
So the, the nitrogen
is not lost. It's still

504
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,183
there

505
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,230
as n a double bond.
Now

506
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,490
H and two h is on there.

507
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,993
Right?

508
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,630
But now that's rather like
the carbon eel group. Right?

509
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,430
So the h minus can get the lithium
aluminum hydride can get in the act again.

510
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay.

511
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,020
And the product

512
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,940
from lithium aluminum
hydride reduction of an amid

513
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,630
isn't a mean.

514
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,611
Okay.

515
00:34:36,611 --> 00:34:41,611
So now these are examples then of going
all the way to the coh carbon deals

516
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:47,170
completely gone. And if you added
two or in one case, three groups, uh,

517
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,790
but you might actually
want the intermediate,

518
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,650
you might want the Aldehyde.

519
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,060
So the question arises is there a
way to stop it so you can get that

520
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,050
intermediate product and you can do that.

521
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,130
You can stop by tuning.

522
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,183
Yeah,

523
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,430
the nucleophile

524
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,440
so that it's able to react in the first
reaction but not reactive enough to

525
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:23,800
react in the second.

526
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,923
Yeah.

527
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,420
So for example,

528
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:39,421
instead of using lithium aluminum
hydride use lithium aluminum hydride,

529
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,280
but that instead of having other hydrogens
on it has OT beautiful taken three

530
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:52,944
times.

531
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,480
Now there are two things about that
having that in place of hydrogen.

532
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
The first is that the oxygen
is electron withdrawing.

533
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,970
It stabilizes and ions.

534
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:08,390
So it makes the electrons here that
are going to be doing the attacking the

535
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,600
sigma electrons. It makes the
blower in energy at less reactive.

536
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,500
What else about having the tea butyl
group here would help in mitigating the

537
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,700
reactivity of that?

538
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,750
Try Tbo toxi lithium aluminum hydride

539
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,273
roll,

540
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,160
right? It's big. So it's
hard to approach. Okay. So,

541
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,050
so it's reactive enough to
do take the acid chloride

542
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,350
to the Aldehyde,

543
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,330
but not to take the
Aldehyde in the second step,

544
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,200
but it's used at very low
temperature at dry ice temperature.

545
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,190
Right?
So that,

546
00:36:57,191 --> 00:37:02,191
that second reaction won't
happen or you can use,

547
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,430
uh, in a very similar, uh, situation,

548
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,620
a reagent called die bow.

549
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,390
Again, you use it at minus 78
degrees and it's, it's again,

550
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,870
uh, uh, an aluminum hydride.

551
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,680
But now again,
it has,

552
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,510
it doesn't have the oxygen's [inaudible]
but it has to isobutyl groups,

553
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:35,150
which again are big and help,
uh, help tame it so that one,

554
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,860
it could be used with the ester

555
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,670
and take it over to the Aldehyde

556
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,400
or,
uh,

557
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:55,030
another way of getting
from the acid chloride, uh,

558
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,850
or, uh, uh,

559
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,880
from the acid chloride and stopping at
the Aldehyde is to do it with h two and a

560
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,210
catalyst.
So the acid chloride

561
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,460
reduce it to put h two
on the ends of the bond.

562
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,110
But of course the Aldehyde
can also be reduced.

563
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:24,111
So you tame the reactivity of the
catalyst by adding a nitrogen containing

564
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:29,610
compounds. Quit on this is
called the Rosen Monday.

565
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,443
Okay.

566
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,340
Procedure.
We saw this before,

567
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:41,341
the idea of of a catalytic hydrogenation
where you make the catalyst less

568
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:45,490
reactive in order to stop it and
remember what that was way back when.

569
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:47,840
Yeah,

570
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,171
right.

571
00:38:48,171 --> 00:38:53,000
The Lid lar catalyst where you wanted
to take a triple bond and go just do a

572
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:55,670
double bond but not from the
double bond to a single bond.

573
00:38:55,671 --> 00:39:00,080
It was again a case of adding something
that would poison the catalyst.

574
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,070
Okay.

575
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,110
And finally,
just as a reminder,

576
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,510
okay.

577
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,640
It's possible to have an acid chloride

578
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:10,840
yeah.

579
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,160
And react it with a very,

580
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:17,161
very weak carbon nuclear file that
only will react if you soup up the,

581
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:19,990
uh,

582
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,990
chloride by using ALC l three to
help make that a good leaving group.

583
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,790
Now you can use a really weak, uh, uh, uh,

584
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,720
carbon nucleophile high homo on carbon,
right.

585
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,110
That will react to give the ketone.

586
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,880
But won't react with the ketone
because it's so weak here.

587
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:49,210
Or you did a special thing to
help make the chloride reactive,

588
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:51,760
but it doesn't help make the
Quito and you get reactive.

589
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,370
Remember what the nucleophile
is you use in this?

590
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,210
Okay.

591
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,520
An ACL chloride, ALC, all three.

592
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,093
What is it?

593
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,420
He's situation.
So you could use benzene

594
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,210
as the nucleophile.

595
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:27,810
We talked about it from the point of
view of something attacking benzene,

596
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,100
but now we're looking at it the other way.
Benzene attacking the something else,

597
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:32,911
right?

598
00:40:32,911 --> 00:40:37,911
So we make the aromatic Quito on
that way by Friedel crafts isolation.

599
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,940
But again, it's a question where you can
do the first one but not the second one.

600
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:45,030
By tuning the reactivity of the,
of the reagents.

601
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,370
Okay. Now, uh,

602
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,590
acid base hydrolysis of RC.
Yeah.

603
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,750
Let me just use the other
board here for it for a moment.

604
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,710
And this one? No, that one.

605
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,590
Okay.

606
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:08,590
So we talked before about about
converting the CN two carboxylic acid.

607
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,540
Okay.
And we can,

608
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:16,130
we can go through acid and base
catalyzed mechanisms of doing that.

609
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
There's, it's, it's very simple. And I've,

610
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,790
I've got a blackboard realization of
that just to trace through it quickly.

611
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,320
Okay? So you have the, the,
the night trial, the CNE group,

612
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,760
protonate it rev a resonance structure.
They ass plus on carbon.

613
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,720
React that with,
so now you've got the COO bond,

614
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,580
lose a proton, okay, so you
have the alcohol here now,

615
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,470
but then protonate the nitrogen.
Now that's uh,

616
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,420
now we have this, but if you take a
take of base and pull off this proton,

617
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:55,280
you have the amid, okay? In other words,
this is an Al Lily curry arrangement.

618
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,080
It's a height, uh, uh,

619
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,160
hydrogen hydrogen here that goes to
the other end of this double bond,

620
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,180
okay? So you, so you could get
partway to the acid you get from the,

621
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:13,040
this acid derivative to this
acid derivative, the amid, okay.

622
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,160
But now suppose you protonate this
back again and get to this one,

623
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:25,690
which I've redrawn here and have
that carbon plus attacked by the,

624
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,900
by water, right? So now a second
water attacking the carbon.

625
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,610
Okay.

626
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,610
And take the Proton off here and put
it on the nitrogen and then have the Nh

627
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:40,520
three leave with the electrons.
All right?

628
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:45,080
You know this cat die and lose a proton
and now you're all the way to the

629
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:49,520
carboxylic acid. So there are two
stages of substituting water here.

630
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,850
First or first adding first adding water
to give the amid and then changing the

631
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:58,820
amid acid derivative
into the asset itself.

632
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,600
So that's acid ketalysis and I
won't spend more time on it now,

633
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,840
but it would be good for you
to be able to do that. Okay.

634
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:10,470
But you can also do it with
base, right? So in base you,

635
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:15,620
you attack the CN triple bond as if it
were a COO double bond and write this,

636
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:20,930
but a proton on right.
And now do the elderly curry arrangement.

637
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,700
The same thing we did before,

638
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,590
except that now instead of being
acid catalyzed, it's base catalyzed.

639
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,410
So we're halfway,
there were two the amid,

640
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,110
I have once we put the last proton
on and now we can go from the amid,

641
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,440
attack it and then lose the
Nh two probably after when
it's inappropriate mated

642
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:47,501
farm and we have the carboxylic acid and
drive it all the way to completion in

643
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,750
base as in the case of Saponin effication
by making the anti in the stable

644
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,180
Carbox lady and I am okay.

645
00:43:56,181 --> 00:44:00,080
So they're both acid and base could be
used but it's a hard reaction to do.

646
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:04,880
It has to be heated a lot
and there sometimes people
even do it using biological

647
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:09,200
catalysts that to try to get it
down to two, a lower temperature.

648
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,440
Now a key teen we said was another,
uh,

649
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,010
another uh,
acid derivative.

650
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,430
So you have an acid chloride
and react it with an a mean.

651
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,510
We've just been talking about
reactions like this where the product,

652
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:31,570
you lose chloride add nitrogen and the
product is an amid the carbon eel with

653
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:33,210
nitrogen next to it.

654
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:38,520
But this is a special case because
there are three alcohol groups on the

655
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:43,000
nitrogen. You'll see how that
makes it special. I, Asia,

656
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,100
we have you put,
if you put,

657
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,970
if you use the nitrogen as a nucleophile
and attack and chloride leaves,

658
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,210
then you have n plus,
right?

659
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:59,211
Because you've used the unshared pair to
make that new bond and normally you'd,

660
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:00,540
what would you do with that?

661
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:04,610
And plus how would you get
rid of the charge north?

662
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,990
Normally you lose a proton from the amine.

663
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:12,330
But this time we used a try out kill.
I mean so it can't do that.

664
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,360
So in fact it doesn't do it right.

665
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,340
Instead instead of doing it
probably attack, sometimes
chloride probably leaves,

666
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,880
but chloride can come back and then
nitrogen leave because it couldn't become

667
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:27,120
stable by losing a proton.
So that probably goes on.

668
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,580
But another reaction can happen instead,
which is for the,

669
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,230
the nitrogen base to attack a proton here.

670
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,930
So you could do an elimination reaction,

671
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:40,500
lose hcl and you generate then key teen,

672
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:44,910
this funny molecule,
which is sort of an analog of co two,

673
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,450
right? Except instead of an
oxygen, you have ch two group here.

674
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:54,180
Now that group then can be attacked
by a nucleophile the same way CO2 is

675
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:55,014
attacked.

676
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,210
And now you have the nucleophile attack
and that attack and that's an analyte so

677
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:03,510
we could draw the resident's form of it,
right?

678
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,860
And we could put a proton on there,
right from the,

679
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,370
from the protonated
nuclear file and get the,

680
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,560
get the product right.

681
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,120
Plus the nucleophile and I in which
has now been able to do it to the next,

682
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,850
uh, key teen. Okay. So what
we've done is convert, uh,

683
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:28,560
keeped heating into an acid derivative
depending on what nucleophile we used,

684
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,430
right? And you can use lots of different
nuclear files. Here's for example,

685
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,610
taken from that, uh, Jones textbook is a,

686
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,610
is a sulfur as the nucleophile.
This,

687
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,700
they said it was done at dry
ice temperature for three
days and gave a thioester

688
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,040
right?
At 93% yield.

689
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:52,650
Or instead of base catalyzed like this,
it could be acid catalyzed.

690
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,540
So reaction with t butyl
alcohol with acids,

691
00:46:56,541 --> 00:47:00,090
so the acid can protonate the oxygen,
then the oxygen,

692
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,340
this oxygen can attack,
right?

693
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:05,620
As a nucleophile lose the
proton and you get the TB,

694
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:10,470
the Lester 87% yield,
or you can use a nitrogen,

695
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,900
right? This has done an ethanol
water and it gives us 75% yield.

696
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,580
Of course these other things could have,
could have reacted right?

697
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:25,581
The O minus or the r h o minus could
have reacted if it were in base,

698
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,890
but it's probably it,
although it's not, doesn't,

699
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,480
isn't said so here it's probably an acid.

700
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,480
So it's probably acid catalyzed reaction

701
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,930
now then you can have a
insertions into ACL. Our bonds.

702
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,110
Let me just start this and
we'll finish it up next time.

703
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,380
So we'll talk about the first reaction.
You remember this picture?

704
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:51,670
Who's interesting in this picture
that we talked about before?

705
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:56,860
This guy here.
Remember who that is.

706
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,670
What did he do?
If you can't remember his name,

707
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:06,850
he made try fennel methyl, right. That's
Gomberg. So this is the same picture.

708
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:11,030
And there's buyer who was the boss of
the lab. But this is Victor Villinger.

709
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,040
I a Swiss who was working in the music
lab at the time and just at 1900.

710
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:20,560
So the same time that that, uh, God
Berg was making try fennel methyl,

711
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,610
the buyer Villinger reaction was,
was invented,

712
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,690
which inserts oxygen into,
uh,

713
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,890
an ACL bond. So let me just, uh,

714
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,620
do that one quickly on the
board and then we'll quit.

715
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:49,310
So what we're doing is taking our oh
bar and we're going to insert on Adam in

716
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:54,330
here to make it r

717
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:59,940
o o r right?

718
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,810
So change a ketone into an ester.

719
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,440
And the way it's done is to
react it with a per oxy acid.

720
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,060
All
right?

721
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:21,420
So now we have our oh minus and it's,
it is acidic.

722
00:49:21,421 --> 00:49:25,630
So we'll take the old liners,
uh Oh.

723
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,543
Oh,

724
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:33,783
okay.

725
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:37,590
And now normally we normally,

726
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:39,870
what we think of as
these electrons come in,

727
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:41,723
okay.

728
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,980
And lose this group. Look,
probably lose this group,

729
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,380
but we don't have a leaving group here,
right?

730
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,550
So instead what happens
is that these electrons

731
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,243
come here.

732
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,443
Yeah.

733
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:02,690
So we have double bond o at the top are,

734
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,760
and now what's attached
here is, oh, this, oh.

735
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:13,030
And attached to that o is the other
r and this good an ion has left,

736
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,260
right?

737
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,120
So we ended up by inserting
an oxygen into the CR bond.

738
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,810
And we're, we're gonna talk
more about that next time.
