00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, let's turn the SIR model into equations.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're doing that one part after the other--first, the recovery.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If I(t) is the number of infectious persons--it's I(t), and R(t) is the number

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of recovered persons--it's R(t), so which of these equations makes the most sense.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The derivative of the number of recovered persons with respect to time equals 5 days

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
times the number of infected persons 1/5 days times the number of infected persons 1/5 days

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
times the number of recovered persons or minus 1/5 days times the number of infected persons.
