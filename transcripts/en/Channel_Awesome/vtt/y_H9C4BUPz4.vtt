00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.740
Really?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.240
You clicked on this?

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.940
You know this is "Pluto Nash", right?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.760
This is, like, one of the biggest box office bombs that ever existed.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.300
I'd much rather you watch a video on the sidescroller than put me to work for this.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.200
It's really okay. I won't mind! There's lots more interesting videos. Look!

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.400
There's Cinema Snob reviewing...

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.860
"How Naked Kirk Cameron Saved Naked Mike Myers on Naked Christmas".

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.780
The twist is, it's really Naked Kwanzaa.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.000
Wouldn't you much rather watch that?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.560
(sigh) Okay.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.420
If you're so insistent, let's go ahead and take a look at this stinker.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.080
TAMARA: Haha, woohoo!

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.060
- Day off, baby!
 - Yes!

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.000
CRITIC: No. No, guys...

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.160
...they're watching the video.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.340
They are?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.340
But... they know it's "Pluto Nash", right?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.400
That's what I told them, but they're still watching.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.920
TAMARA: But, we were gonna get drunker than...

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.840
...someone who watched "Pluto Nash"!

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.340
CRITIC:  Yeah, I know, but they wanna see a review of it, so get in your costumes!

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.100
- Thanks a lot, dickholes.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.000
You can take your love of Eddie Murphy and shove it up your ass!

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.580
CRITIC: Funny. Most Eddie Murphy movies don't stop a drinking bender,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.540
they usually start them.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.300
Known as the most expensive, yet lazy, comedic bomb...

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.980
...since Netanyahu spoke at the U.N.,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.060
"Pluto Nash" lacks any sort of charm, originality,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.920
and yes, even comedy in what's supposed to be a charming, original, and comedic film.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.080
This movie is put on God knows how many "worst films ever" lists,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.980
and in many respects, I can understand.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.620
But in others, it just doesn't seem worth the effort.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.780
Hell, they didn't even put the effort in to convert it to Blu-Ray, they care so little!

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.340
It's so not worth the effort, I am literally phoning in this review right now.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.540
Yeah! I'm not even here! I'm not wasting my time on this shit!

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.200
I'm actually preparing for the next review.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.140
I swear this isn't a clue...

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.680
So let's start off with the joke I know you're all waiting for me to make...

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.600
- Trust me, this is trying harder than anything in the film.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.100
- This is "Pluto Nash".

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.000
CRITIC: After reading a slew of actors thinking to yourself 'Oh yeah, they were a thing because they were in that... thing.'

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.100
we see Jame Moore doing horrible as a musician at a bar.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.800
How do we know he's doing bad? Because he has an accordian, of course!

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.500
Apparently, we still like this nerdy cliche.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.700
Oh, what, was the taped-up glasses, bow tie, and holding books musician not available?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.000
okay this is a tough one because as of the date

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.460
this review is coming out i don't know if this incredibly clever or incredibly dated.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.080
so, for the first time ever i am giving you a multiple choice joke!

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.200
Just come back after November 8 and choose

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.040
from one of these options.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.300
Well they can obviously throw that prop in the fire

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.020
it wouldn't be the first time she felt the burn.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.860
Well she bought the rest of Hollywood to get the Presidency

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.140
Are we really surprised by this?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
Und get to building the Wall!!

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.220
Pluto turns them down and asks his body guard android,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.800
played by Canada's most dangerous criminal: Randy Quaid,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.960
to escort them out.
