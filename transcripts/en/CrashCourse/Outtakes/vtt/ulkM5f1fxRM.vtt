00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.580
That life saving technology is real, and it works
because of two main electrical principles:

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.420
Electric potential, energy, and capacitance.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.220
[Laughter]

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.920
Okay.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:25.100
[Introduction music]

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.280
[Drums]

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.760
Now, remember how you add up all the resistances

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.000
to find an equivalent resistance
for resistances in the series, Oh my god.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.420
[Laughter]

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.660
Between the spot right next to the point charge--

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.300
[Strange noise]

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.540
[Laughter]

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.120
What was that?

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.000
That was weird.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.340
And we did it with the help of Coulomb's law,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.040
the equation that tells us that the force generated
by two charged particles on one another...

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.760
We call these materials s---

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.540
What *bleep* is wrong with me, okay.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.560
We call these materials superconductors, trust me,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.160
when I say the research into these materials
is a very important and lucrative field of study.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.780
[Exhales breath]

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.060
We've used our hypothetical...
hypothoughticals (laughing)...new word.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.220
Since we have two particles that eat generate...
each each generate...

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.180
Since we have two particles that each generate
their own electric fields.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.540
Since we have two particles that each generate ...

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.780
Since we (sigh) si- (laugh) yeah, no
(from offscreen: This is very serious)

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.740
- it is, it's scary.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.980
And since the voltage for each resistor in this is, is,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.720
and since the voltage for each resistor
is the same in parallel you can count Saul

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.840
and since the voltage for each resistor.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.520
And since the voltage for each resistor
is the same in parallel, you can cancel out...

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.680
(ah) and since the voltage is (ahuh). 
(from offscreen: And we're done.)

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.060
A charged object can have electric potential energy when it's held in a electric field,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.980
in an electric...in an election...
in an electric field...

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.520
This means if we place a (laughing) 
you're like (points)

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.400
all I just see is K (laughing)

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.380
for our defibrillator, this energy
is quickly turned potential energy

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
(deep breath) I'm just breathing,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.700
We also learned about Ohm's Law

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.000
and the relationship between voltage current
and redi... resistance.   *bleep*

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.580
[Laughing]

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.040
It just is bringing back but I anxiety

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.840
of like, loving physics and then
getting to electricity and going ugh.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.060
This is what's gonna fail me.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.120
Casey, you'd have loads of lines
coming out of a dot basically.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.280
(offscreen: you've gotten further than I have) (laughs)

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.520
So one way to express capacitance
is to divide the area of each, oh my god (laughs)

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.720
So one way (laugh) I'm scared, I'm actually
scared right now. (deep breath, sigh)

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.500
Can electric field exist in a conductor where electrons
can move around freely in the material?

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.500
That's a very long question.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.680
That's why I'm struggling.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.800
You learn though just know

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.020
when they do, they reach
electro static equilibrium (noise)

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.880
when they do, they've reached 
electro static equilibrium. (ahh) *beep*

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.340
right at the end (off camera: oh man, 
that's a, ok, you can do it)

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.320
When they do, they've reached electrostatic equilibrium

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.720
(off camera: not quite) *beep*

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.900
Let's say we have a 9-volt battery

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.720
and we want to know how much current
it supplies to a light bulb.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.260
When we...complete the circuit.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.800
Always, I'm amazed I never really
breathe during the shoot.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.740
Anyway, (off camera: you should do that) 
yeah i might.  Might consider it

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.720
(off camera: that sounds familure, we just did a lot of that) yes, yeah yeah we just did that

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.320
(off camera #2: ok, alright,cool)

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.000
go back to bed (laughing)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.260
Once the system is at electropshyctriatic... equilibrium

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.380
those observations we made before still hold true.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.660
But when using a  pes...pecasitor.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.800
yeah yeah capacitor...yeah men. (singing)

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.760
Next,  once we can generate the next cu...rrent

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.920
Next once we can generate an electric current... hello

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.920
This value is known as capatitu... capacitance.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.740
compared to the ideal battery
it's only a one mili..m...ampure

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.900
I've just bitten my lip twice doing that saying that,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.420
and a positively charged particle with charge positive.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.740
Is this that Van de Graaff machine experiment I wonder.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.100
(off camera: We're almost done we're two shots
from the end) okay who cares (laughing)

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.120
We use Ohm's Law to go from an equivalent circuit

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.440
to solving every current value
and voltage drop in the system.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.780
Today we saw (laughing)

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.880
I broke him. (laughing)

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.200
(laughing) I broke him. oh god, sorry.
(off camera: did you see what she did?)  no

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.840
(off camera: oh god, she just, you stopped and she went (laughing) come at me script

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.980
sorry, ahh.  (laughing)
