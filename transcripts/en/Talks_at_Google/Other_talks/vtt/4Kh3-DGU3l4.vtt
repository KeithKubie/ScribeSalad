00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:04.720
MALE SPEAKER: All right, thank
you all for coming, everybody.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.860
Mr. AO Scott, or Tony, is the
film critic of "The New York

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.960
Times" and has been since 2004.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.350
He grew up in
Northampton-- actually,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.100
he was born in
Northampton, Massachusetts.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.510
I'm not sure if he actually grew
up there-- and studied English

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.350
and fortunately thought
better of getting a PhD,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.620
and now we have him.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.030
You might have seen him
on TV with Roger Ebert

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.231
and in many other venues.

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.730
I can say personally,
if I'm looking

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.780
to see if I should go
see a movie or not,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.250
I look at two reviews, Tony's
and the Roger Ebert site,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.260
whoever writes that nowadays.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.310
So Tony, have no presentation.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.360
But he'll be glad to
take all your questions

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.060
and sign your books.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.640
And if you want to join us for
lunch afterwards, feel free.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.810
One of us is going to
grab a table out there,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.920
assuming it doesn't
start raining.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180
So without further ado,
please welcome Tony Scott.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.076
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.930
AO SCOTT: Hi.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.360
Thank you all for
coming-- yeah, OK.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.540
I think I'm good-- in the
middle of your work days

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.790
when you could be playing
pool or riding bikes

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.990
or whatever it is that you do.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.650
But I'm really
glad that you came,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.800
and I'm very excited
to have a chance

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.000
to talk about my
new book, "Better

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.410
Living Through Criticism-- How
to Think about Art, Pleasure,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.410
Beauty, and Truth."

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.650
And one of the main ideas
in this book-- which

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.190
is, broadly speaking, about
not so much what critics do,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.335
what professional critics do, as
it is about what criticism is--

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:48.640
is that criticism really
is the conversation

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.030
that we have about the things
that are important to us,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.320
about the meaning and the
value and the status of works

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.380
of art and products of
the human imagination.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.270
So I would like most of what
happens while we're here

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.610
to actually be a conversation.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.620
So I will very shortly
be taking any questions

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.010
you have about, really,
anything you want to talk about.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.870
I'm a movie critic.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.200
The Oscar race is happening.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.240
There are things to
be said about that.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.390
There may be reviews
of mine that you've

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.914
read that you want to thank
me for, or the opposite.

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:24.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.970
Either way, it's all good.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.960
I'm terrible at movie
trivia, so if you

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.490
ask me a question about
a particular movie

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.950
you will embarrass me.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.160
But you can do that also.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.290
But I do want to
start out by talking

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.380
a little bit about the book
and how I came to write it,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.150
and what it's
trying to do and why

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.180
I think that the
topic of criticism

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.060
is worth talking about
and the idea of criticism

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.460
needs defending or
needs articulation.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.760
Now, I started writing-- I
kind of got the idea for this

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.060
around 2011 when I was reading
a lot of stuff in newspapers

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.800
and magazines and online that
was basically proclaiming

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.000
my own imminent
extinction-- that because

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.090
of social media, because of
a digital culture, because

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.800
of Facebook and
Twitter and Google

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.450
and all of these,
and Amazon and Yelp

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.710
and these wonderful
algorithms that were coming

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.730
into existence-- critics as
they had existed for a very

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.630
long time wouldn't
be necessary anymore,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.830
and that for a lot of people it
seemed like a very good thing,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.350
because who needed us
anyway and wasn't nice

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.920
that all of those kind
of annoying people

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.940
who were spoiling
everyone else's fun

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.350
were going to have to
look for real jobs?

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.450
And there were other people who
lamented the fact that, well,

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.180
now this form of
writing and thinking

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.970
and this way of discerning
what is excellent

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.140
and what is valuable in
the world of the arts

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.650
is going to go
away, and all we're

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.300
going to have is just people
hitting the Like button

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.172
and civilization will collapse.

00:04:21.172 --> 00:04:21.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.580
So I was trying to figure out
where I stood on this question.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.360
And as often is the
case, it was kind of

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.780
a little more complicated
than the extremes of opinion

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.020
would suggest.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.800
But I thought, well, what
is it that critics do?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.310
What is it that I do?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.320
And why might that matter apart
from anyone's particular job

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.890
or professional situation?

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.440
That is, if there
were no critics,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.195
would there still be criticism?

00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:53.820
And I thought, well,
yeah, there would.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.490
Criticism as I understand
it is bigger than and more

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.250
important than the particular
jobs of people like me.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.570
So I thought,
well, maybe it'd be

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.820
interesting to try to figure
out for myself some good answers

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.290
to these questions.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.490
What is criticism?

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.420
What are critics for?

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.040
Why does any of this matter?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.600
And that very quickly lead
me into much more difficult

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.640
and more interesting
questions having

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.300
to do with taste,
with art, with how do

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.820
we know something is beautiful.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.320
What happens to us
when we experience

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.250
a movie or a painting
or a book or a poem,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.180
and we find that
we are moved by it,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.390
or we fail to be moved by it?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.960
How is it that we
can simultaneously

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.230
say, well, there's no
disputing taste, right?

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.910
Everybody likes something else.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.770
Everybody likes what
they like, and there's

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.150
no point in arguing about it.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.550
How do we reconcile
that belief, which

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.250
seems very polite and very
tolerant and very civilized,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.830
with the fact that we argue
about it all the time?

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.920
When we leave a movie
with our friends,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.620
we don't necessarily just limit
ourselves to saying, well,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.910
I liked that.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.350
It's too bad you didn't.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.710
We say, what do you
mean that was great?

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.660
That was terrible.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.910
And we fight about it.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.870
And that fight, that
argument, is a very important

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.750
and a very kind of,
I began to think,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.870
deeply central to who we are
as a species, that it lies

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.510
very close-- the impulse to
argue, to judge, to evaluate,

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.270
to interpret, lies very close to
the impulse to make, to create,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.610
to produce works of
art and representations

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.580
of our human experience
in the world.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.790
So I thought, well, if I could
just explain all of that then

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.640
that might be an
interesting book.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.530
So I went and I started
doing some research

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.840
and trying to figure out
who might have said some

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.820
of the things that I would be
trying to say in such a way

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.510
that I could get away
with stealing it.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.340
And I found my way, as one does,
to Oscar Wilde, who's really

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.690
one of the great critical
spirits in this book--

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.270
an amazing writer, a polymath,
a playwright, a poet,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.590
an essayist, a dandy, an
aesthete, a critic, the person

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.970
probably with the
best and most perfect

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.697
taste in the history
of human beings.

00:07:29.697 --> 00:07:30.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.520
And I found that he had
written a short book, kind

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.710
of almost a pamphlet, called
"The Critic As Artist."

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:45.850
And as some of his essays
are-- the other most famous one

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.610
that's like this is called
"The Decay of Lying,"

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.540
which is also brilliant
and important in this book.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.040
But "The Critic as
Artist" takes the form

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.360
of a dialogue between two
Victorian gentleman of leisure

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.160
who spend the
whole night arguing

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.200
about the Ancient
Greeks and philosophy

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.840
and painting and music.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.250
One of them is named
Gilbert, and he's

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.540
kind of the critic figure.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.170
He's the Oscar
Wilde stand-in who

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.800
has all of these outrageous
opinions and judgments

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.230
and says these shocking
and provocative things.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.960
And the other one, his kind
of straight man or foil,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.380
is Earnest, which is the great
Wildean name for someone who

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.500
is perhaps too much in earnest.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.490
So right at the end
of the dialogue in one

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.490
of the epigraphs for this
book, Earnest kind of sums up

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.200
what they've been talking about.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.320
And he says, "You have
told me many strange things

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.210
tonight, Gilbert.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.310
You have told me that it is more
difficult to talk about a thing

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.750
than to do it, and that
to do nothing at all

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.190
is the most difficult
thing in the world.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.850
You have told me that all art is
immoral, all thought dangerous,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.680
that criticism is more
creative than creation,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.190
and that the highest criticism
is that which reveals

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.540
in the work of art what the
artist had not put there,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.740
that is exactly because a man
cannot do a thing that he is

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.280
the proper judge of it, and
that the true critic is unfair,

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.550
insincere, and not rational."

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.100
And I thought, well,
that sounds about right.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:21.080
So if I could just
prove that, I would have

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.340
made a successful argument.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.010
It turned out to be harder
to prove than I thought,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:33.600
but I did really want to
get into those questions

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.930
in that paradoxical spirit
about the relationship

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.380
between criticism and art
that didn't just see criticism

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.430
as parasitic, as
secondary, as negative,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:51.110
but actually as making a
central contribution to the way

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.640
that we think and
the way that we live.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.350
And Oscar Wilde was very
important in this process.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.640
Another important inspiration
on the way to writing this book

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.580
came through Twitter.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.370
It's all right to talk
about-- the other?

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.070
Yeah, it's OK?

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.780
All right, you're all cool?

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.450
You're all friends?

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.749
I never know.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.540
Because if you go into
"The New York Times"

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.350
and you just start talking about
Buzzfeed or "The Washington

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.680
Post," they'll throw you out.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.060
So I'm glad it's more
open-minded here.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.712
But so I wrote a review of an
obscure little movie called

00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:35.337
"The Avengers."

00:10:35.337 --> 00:10:36.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.800
Yeah, I don't know.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.612
Some of you might have seen it.

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:42.550
And it was OK.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.420
And I said in the
review it was OK.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.429
There were parts of it that I
liked, and some things about it

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:49.220
that I didn't like.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.000
And I was a little
frustrated at just kind

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.020
of some of the
blockbuster cliches

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.480
that sort of, I
thought, drowned out

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.530
the more entertaining, more
whimsical, more inventive parts

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.480
of the movie.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:12.370
So I guess the day after my
review went up, I went online.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.170
I was looking at
Twitter to see if there

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.770
were any cute dogs that
people had taken pictures of.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:24.330
And I saw my Twitter feed was
full of angry people calling me

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.370
all kinds of names.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.860
And I thought, what is going on?

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.680
And invoking, as the authority,
the name of Samuel L. Jackson,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.650
Nick Fury himself, Mace Windu,
Jules Winnfield, all these--

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.976
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.890
And he had put up a
tweet, although he'd not

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.780
treated it at me.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.050
He had just kind of sub-tweeted
me by using my name,

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.650
where he said, Avengers fans,
we need to find AO Scott a new

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.970
job, one he can--

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.745
--one he can actually do.

00:11:57.745 --> 00:12:00.214
And so everyone was like,
yeah, you need a new job.

00:12:00.214 --> 00:12:01.130
Yeah, you're an idiot.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.630
Yeah.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.012
And I thought, well,
god, what would that be?

00:12:06.012 --> 00:12:07.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.460
I don't know.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.480
I think I might have
sent a resume over here.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.930
But nothing came of it.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.820
But it actually got
me thinking after we

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.770
had had our fun little Twitter
fight that followed from that

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.071
and I wrote something.

00:12:22.071 --> 00:12:23.820
I can't even remember
what I tweeted back,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.260
but it must have
been very clever.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:25.760
Anyway.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.230
But I thought, well,
what is the job?

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.480
How do you actually do it?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.446
And apparently, Samuel L.
Jackson kept thinking about it

00:12:37.446 --> 00:12:38.820
also, because six
months later he

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.510
did a interview in
"The Huffington Post"

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.010
where sort of
unprompted, he came back

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.260
to the review nice
and kind of spelled

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.360
out everything that was wrong
with the way I was doing

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:59.030
my job-- which was, first of
all, that I was kind of tearing

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:03.060
down what was a perfect film,
a wonderful, great movie that I

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.880
just sort of didn't get,
and that also I was wasting

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.770
too much time thinking about,
intellectualizing, what was

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.930
his word, a piece
of pop culture,

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.960
just sort of something
that existed for fun.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.262
And why bring so
much thought, so much

00:13:19.262 --> 00:13:20.720
scrutiny, so much
skepticism to it?

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.340
And I thought, well, that's
kind of a perfect summary

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.830
of the problems that people
have with critics and criticism.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.990
On the one hand, here
is this beautiful thing

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.840
that somebody made, whether
it's a movie or a book

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.780
or a painting or a poem.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.500
And why do you
want to mess it up?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.450
Why do you want
to knock it down?

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.500
Why do you want
to take it apart?

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.110
Why can't you just
leave it alone

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.680
and let it be the
exquisite thing that it is?

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.390
And who the hell are you anyway
to come along and say anything

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.480
about it?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.470
And then on the other side, what
happens often when you write

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.351
about popular culture is people
say, hey, this is just for fun.

00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:01.100
This is like, we want
to go to the movies.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.360
We want to have a good time.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.526
We want to eat some popcorn.

00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:05.690
We want to watch some action.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.450
And why do you have
to come in here

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.210
and ruin that fun by
either by finding fault

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.930
or by over-analyzing?

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.550
And I thought those are
very serious challenges,

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.945
and they can't be dismissed.

00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:26.530
It was, it seemed to me,
worth it to really think

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:32.310
about, what is the relationship
between our pleasures

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.860
and our search for
entertainment, for meaning,

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.940
for beauty, for whatever
it is that we get out

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:47.630
of works of art, popular
or fine, and the impulse

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.940
to think about them,
to analyze them,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.990
to take them apart
and see how they work,

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.690
to compare them to each
other, to rank them?

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.080
And my answer, in a way, was
that these things go together,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.090
that for me personally, the
thinking about works of art

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.920
and what they do and how
they work and enjoying them

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.670
are part of the same impulse,
part of the same act.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.530
And my other thought is that
these works of imagination--

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:22.920
whether they're big budget
movies or ancient statues

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.110
or paintings or poems or
pieces of popular music

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.810
or symphonies-- are
important, are representations

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.390
of how we as human
beings are making sense

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.020
of our conditions
of life and what

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.070
it is to be human
in this very strange

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.920
and complicated and
ever-changing world,

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.550
and that taking that
seriously is very important

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.210
and trivializing it seems
to me a terrible mistake.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.570
So I wanted to
write a book that I

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.800
hoped would encourage
people to do that thinking,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:08.110
to take our own experiences
seriously in a situation where

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.000
we're overwhelmed
with competing claims

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.120
on our attention of stuff
that we're supposed to like,

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:25.019
to maybe slow down and activate
our minds a little more.

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:26.560
There's one other
thing that I'd like

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.720
to read before taking questions
and hearing what you all

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.300
have to say.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.200
And it is-- as I was
writing this book,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.010
I kind of did a lot of
reading and research

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:50.930
looking for ideas and for work
in the past that would help

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.810
me think about these issues.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.620
And some of it I found in
the history of philosophy

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.340
and of criticism.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.590
Some of it I found in Aristotle
and in the work of Pauline Kael

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.109
and Susan Sontag and other
contemporary critics.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.730
But I found I often
would discover

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.790
some of the most acute
and interesting statements

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:17.760
of the problems that I wanted to
address in works of literature,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.369
in novels and in poems.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:25.640
And as I was kind
of reading around,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:32.580
I found a poem by English
poet Philip Larkin,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:39.070
who was a wonderful mid-century
poet whose best-known

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.760
poem is the one called
"This be the Verse," which

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.170
begins with the famous
line, "They fuck you up,

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.440
your mum and dad.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.912
They may not mean
to, but they do."

00:17:48.912 --> 00:17:50.620
You can find the rest
of the poem online.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.420
It's one of the most concise
and depressing statements

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.120
of human existence
that's ever been written,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.580
and it's like 12 lines.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.600
And afterwards you're
just like, oh, wow.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.420
There we go.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.181
The last lines are-- not
to spoil it-- "get out

00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:11.555
as quickly as you can, and
don't have any kids yourself."

00:18:11.555 --> 00:18:13.455
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:17.270
So he was a very cheerful guy.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.800
But he was also a
huge jazz fan, and he

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.560
wrote a lot of really
terrific jazz criticism.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.610
And he worked most of his
life as a university librarian

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.490
in Hull in Northern England.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.685
And he wrote a poem
in the early '50s--

00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:38.000
late '40s or early '50s--
called "Reasons for Attendance."

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.240
And it was the poem that
for me kind of really

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.630
crystallized a lot of what I
wanted to say and to understand

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.580
about criticism.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.510
And to set it up a little
bit, the scene of the poem

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.400
is the speaker.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.670
This guy who might be Larkin
is walking down the street,

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.640
and he passes a dance hall.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.060
He hears music
coming from inside.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.427
He doesn't go inside.

00:19:06.427 --> 00:19:08.010
He's kind of looking
through the glass

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.060
and seeing the people in
there dancing and listening

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.680
to the music and reflecting on
the difference between what's

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.630
going on inside, between the fun
that people are having in there

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:26.050
and his own experience of it,
his own reaction to the music

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.380
from outside.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.130
So here's the poem.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.600
It's called "Reasons
for Attendance."

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.620
"The trumpet's voice,
loud and authoritative,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.840
draws me a moment to the lighted
glass to watch the dancers,

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.120
all under 25, shifting intently,
face to flushed face solemnly

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.080
on the beat of happiness.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.450
Or so I fancy, sensing
the smoke and the sweat,

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.230
the wonderful feel of girls.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.880
Why be out here?

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.960
But why then be in there?

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.140
Sex, yes.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.280
But what is sex?

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.940
Surely to think the
lion's share of happiness

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.760
is found by couples--
sheer inaccuracy

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.600
as far as I am concerned.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.190
What calls me is that
lifted rough-tongued bell--

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.810
art, if you like-- whose
individual sound insists

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.650
I too am individual.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.480
It speaks.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.770
I hear.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.840
Others may hear as well, but
not for me nor I for them.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.420
And so with happiness.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.070
Therefore, I stay
outside believing this,

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.690
and they mull to and
fro believing that,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:35.160
and both are satisfied-- if
no one has misjudged himself

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.680
or lied."

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:47.340
So that's-- that poem
is a complicated poem.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.250
For me, it kind of
says it says it all

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:53.580
about how our own experience
is sometimes divided

00:20:53.580 --> 00:21:00.050
between pleasure and something
else-- reflection, thought,

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:06.120
and how it is that art satisfies
both of those impulses, both

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.630
of those desires, and
also leaves us off

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.510
in a state of confusion.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.630
And it's in that
confusion, I think,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.910
that criticism can really begin.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.970
But now I'd like to
hear what you have

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.690
to say and take your questions.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.859
So yeah.

00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:25.400
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.691
Thank you for that very
thought-provoking introduction.

00:21:27.691 --> 00:21:29.350
AO SCOTT: Sure.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.340
AUDIENCE: Many years ago,
when I went to a movie

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.020
and I-- talking about
your "Avengers" review--

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.120
I started this movie, and I
hated it, absolutely hated it,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.975
when all of a sudden it dawned
on me, this is a comic book.

00:21:41.975 --> 00:21:44.460
And then I settled
down and I loved it.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.300
So this preconceived
idea-- I came

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.970
in with a preconceived
idea, or maybe no idea.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.960
Just before this
meeting, my daughter

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.310
texted me from college
saying she's just read

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.210
"The Darling" by Anton Chekhov.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.510
So I quickly looked
up a summary of it

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.970
to have a conversation with her.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.095
She yelled at me and said,
don't look up a summary.

00:22:01.095 --> 00:22:02.860
You've got to read
the actual book.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.140
So I agreed with her.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.080
But my question is,
what about this idea

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.900
that we come to work of art
with preconceived ideas,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.100
with expectations,
with what we've heard--

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.230
or do we come to it with
a completely open mind?

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.760
I mean, you can't not come
to something without--

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.870
AO SCOTT: Right.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.810
But you have to-- it's a
question that comes up a lot.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.580
And it certainly
comes up a lot when

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.360
you're a critic,
because you can't

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.360
help having preconceptions,
prejudices, being who you are.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:38.741
I mean, there is no view from
nowhere or view from 50,000

00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:41.240
feet-- certainly in criticism,
certainly when you're talking

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.040
about works of art and movies
and things that you either

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.660
enjoy or you don't.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.120
There's not an objective
measure of these things.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.450
But I think it is possible.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.190
I know it's possible.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.330
It's something that
I try to encourage.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.645
Exactly what you
described-- because it's not

00:23:03.645 --> 00:23:08.000
that you get rid of everything
that you believe or everything

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.480
you are when you walk in, but
you can also open yourself up.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:17.910
I think it is possible to let
go of some of those prejudices--

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.705
to, just as you described, say,
well, this is something else.

00:23:21.705 --> 00:23:24.920
This is not necessarily
what I thought.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.670
But also, in a way, you
can become someone else.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:33.960
You can put yourself
in the position

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.735
that's different from who
you are in everyday life.

00:23:37.735 --> 00:23:39.110
I mean, I think
one of the things

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.530
that art does that's
so remarkable-- movies

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:50.530
especially-- is provide just
this enormous imaginative

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.460
palette that you can
project yourself onto.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.043
So you can sit there
watching a movie.

00:23:54.043 --> 00:23:55.267
You can be whoever you want.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:57.350
You don't have to be the
person in the movie who's

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.920
"like you," whatever
that would mean.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.920
No one is stopping you,
nothing is stopping you,

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.360
from extending your empathy or
your identification in any way

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.020
that you want it to go.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.660
And I think sometimes
people are afraid of that.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.680
And sometimes people
say, well, I like this.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.810
I'm a guy.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.570
I like guy movies.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.770
I don't like girl
movies, or whatever.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.180
Or I just like action movies.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.430
I don't like romance movies.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.450
Or I only like movies
with subtitles,

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.960
movies that move really slowly,
where the camera just stares

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:37.870
at one thing for a whole
take and everybody smokes.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.350
And I love those movies.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:47.230
But it is possible
and desirable,

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:52.700
and I think in a way, learnable,
to move outside of that.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.750
And one thing that I think--
now in the age of data

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.740
that we live in,
we can very easily

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.480
be classified and
categorized according

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.520
to different algorithms.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.620
So it's like, you like this?

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.700
You might also like that.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.390
People who bought
this also bought that.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.700
And you're being kind of
tracked into-- it's like, oh,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.070
I'm a person who likes this.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.300
I'm a person who bought that.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:19.210
But one of the things that I'm
trying to get at in this book

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.090
and saying that kind of a
properly critical spirit can do

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:26.910
is give you a chance to jump
the tracks and go somewhere else

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.580
and find something else
which you may not like.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.840
You may come running back
to your comfort zone,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.670
but you had the adventure
and maybe learned something.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.490
Yeah?

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.400
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.574
So when I think
of criticism, it's

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.740
kind of a very personal
matter because I always have

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.840
these thoughts on my opinions.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.100
But I was wondering, for someone
whose criticism could, I guess,

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.790
be read by millions, is there a
difference in your criticism--

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.270
like do you consider
the audience

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.810
when you're publishing
versus maybe just when you're

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.700
watching something personally?

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.630
AO SCOTT: There's less
of a distance, in a way.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.400
I mean, I think
if I thought when

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.310
I set down to right about
the audience and about

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.290
the institution that
I was writing for,

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.890
I think I might
just be paralyzed.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.250
If I thought, oh
my goodness, I have

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:26.390
to write about this for
"The New York Times."

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.540
So I think much
more about, well,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.400
how am I going to figure
out what I want to say?

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.410
How am I going to work
out my own thoughts?

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.500
For me, writing is very much
about clarifying and figuring

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.140
out.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.710
I don't really know
what I think until I've

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.590
gotten to the end of the
writing process and it's like,

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.220
OK, now it kind of
makes sense to me.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.160
So when I sit down to
write, I'm doing that.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.070
I'm thinking about myself.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:58.940
I'm thinking about maybe a small
group of friends and family

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:04.840
who I want to impress
or shock, and then

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.900
the other millions of people or
whoever they are will follow.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.030
I mean, I am aware that
I'm doing it in public

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:19.370
and that I have to do it with
a certain degree of craft

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.710
and discipline and that I
only have so many words.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.918
And there are some words
that I'm not allowed to use.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.150
But in general,
as close as I can

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.600
get to that own
personal experience--

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.432
to turning that
into an argument,

00:27:34.432 --> 00:27:36.640
or articulating what happened
to me when I was seeing

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.348
that movie in a way
that could make sense

00:27:38.348 --> 00:27:43.100
to other people-- the better it
is, the more authentic it is,

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.770
the more useful I think it is.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:47.480
Yeah?

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.105
AUDIENCE: How about
those white Oscars?

00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:50.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.470
AO SCOTT: Yes, oh my goodness.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.584
Don't even get me started.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.760
Well, you're all
aware of the issue.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.896
And I mean, I think
a lot of people

00:28:04.896 --> 00:28:06.520
are going to watch
the show just to see

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:14.340
what happens, to see how
far Chris Rock can go

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:20.160
and whether he will, in a way,
be able to redeem anything.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.940
But I think it's a big problem
not just with the Oscars,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.510
obviously.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:28.240
I mean, I think that
there is narrowly

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:35.250
a problem with the Academy
that is structural,

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.840
that has to do with who is
voting and how they're voting,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.980
and also with how they
think about movies.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:50.550
The Academy is 6,000 people,
kind of the elite of the movie

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.310
business, of Hollywood.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:58.440
And their job is really to
project an idea of prestige,

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:06.690
to give the world a picture
of the most respectable, most

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:12.980
high-minded, most artistic and
scientific face of Hollywood.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.840
And their ideas about
what constitutes

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.070
prestige are, I think,
very narrow and very kind

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:23.030
of out-of-date and out-of-touch.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.860
And it's not just
a matter of race,

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.990
although it has a lot to do with
the current racial controversy,

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.830
which is that things
that have too much to do

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:38.470
with popular culture
or that stray

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.540
from that kind of narrow idea of
respectability and seriousness

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.040
are invisible to the Academy.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.610
So for example, comedies
are a great example.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.000
In the last 15 years there
have been amazing comedies.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.600
Some of the most inventive work
in movies have been comedies.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.740
But you're not going
to see, for example,

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.750
Melissa McCarthy getting an
Oscar nomination for Best

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:05.190
Actress in "Spy."

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.550
It's kind of just unthinkable.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.990
But that's a great performance.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.200
I'm sorry, that's an
amazing performance.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:19.070
And similarly,
while the Academy is

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.350
open to movies about
the black experience

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.330
or with African-American
characters,

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:28.040
those movies have to
be kind of sanctified

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.690
by suffering or by
a kind of nobility

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.880
or by being about
social problems.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:42.520
They have to satisfy kind of an
old-fashioned Hollywood liberal

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.060
guess-who's-coming-to-dinner
idea about racial progress.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.260
So a movie about Ray
Charles will win Oscars.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:54.830
A movie about NWA will
not get nominated.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:58.770
A movie like "Creed"-- I think
a remarkable piece of film with

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:06.780
a terrific lead performance in
it in a way will be invisible

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:12.860
to the Academy, because in
addition to being a terrific

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.020
boxing movie, it's a very
low-key and observant

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.030
and sensitive look just at the
realities of African-American

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.160
life in America.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.380
But that's not
about drug dealers.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.030
It's not about-- I mean, it's
just a very straightforward

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.270
movie about the humanity
of its characters,

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:35.820
which is something that the
Academy kind of can't see.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.624
And I think there's
a bigger problem--

00:31:37.624 --> 00:31:39.290
I mean, I could go
on and on about this,

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.510
so I'll try to keep it short.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:45.130
But of course, the bigger
problem is the industry itself.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.160
I mean, the Academy
is one target--

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.800
and I think an entirely
legitimate target--

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.400
for the protest that's going on.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.800
But of course, the real
target and the real point

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.140
of this protest is
the abysmal state

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.780
of things in the film
industry itself--

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.470
not only on matters of
race but gender, too.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:09.220
4% of studio and
studio subsidiary

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.310
released movies are
directed by women.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:17.570
And there's a whole system in
place of how the deals get made

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:23.920
and how the pictures get
greenlit that excludes people

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.290
of color, excludes
women, excludes

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.490
all different kinds of stories
and different kinds of talent.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.700
And right now, television
is doing much better.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.540
One of the reasons
also that television

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.040
seems so much more
creatively vibrant

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.990
sometimes than
movies is because it

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.230
is more open to these stories
and to these storytellers.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:48.080
So this is-- I can't
say it's the beginning,

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.960
but this is a stage
in a much longer

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:56.670
and I think more difficult
process that will have to--

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:01.820
and I think will-- depend
on some real change

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:08.790
in the executive suites and
in the mindset of the industry

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.660
itself-- which is,
compared to a lot

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.560
of other high-profile
industries in this country,

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.970
shockingly un-diverse,
shockingly behind the times,

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.000
shockingly retrograde
in the ways

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.780
that it allows unspoken
prejudices and habits

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.360
of discrimination to continue.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.186
So that's the short answer.

00:33:31.186 --> 00:33:32.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:32.524 --> 00:33:33.420
Yeah?

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.253
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could speak

00:33:35.253 --> 00:33:37.660
a little bit about your
process, the physical process

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.730
of how you watch
these movies and also

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.800
your mental process of since
your criticism is so public,

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.150
does that change your
mindset versus just watching

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:51.930
a movie for pleasure
with your family?

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:57.010
AO SCOTT: I mean, the process
is that a list of movies

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:03.510
comes out of coming
releases like three or four

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.740
weeks ahead of time.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.010
I mean, it changes.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.120
It's always a
little bit volatile.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.239
Things drop of the
schedule, or there are

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:13.360
late things that pop onto it.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.429
My co-chief critic
and I, Manohla Dargis,

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:21.719
take turns picking
our-- this, by the way,

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:25.870
is as an answer to the question
that I'm asked most often.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.687
In fact, almost every time
I've ever given a talk,

00:34:28.687 --> 00:34:31.270
people want to know, how do you
decide who reviews what movie?

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.960
So I'm answering that
question now, even though.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.719
No one has asked it yet.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.090
So we take turns kind
of cherry-picking what

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:42.600
looks most interesting
to us, and also making

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.710
sure that there's
some balance as

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.739
far as the works
of major directors.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.200
So if I did "Inside Llewyn
Davis," she did "Hail Caesar,"

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.380
or I'll do the
next Coen brothers,

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:57.880
and making sure that at
very busy times of year

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.160
the big movies are more
or less equally divided

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.820
and that one of us
isn't dominating

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:08.610
the front of the section or
the top of the home page.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.700
And then we assign the rest
out to other staff critics

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.270
and to freelancers.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:18.450
So the movie screen,
I always watch

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:22.900
them projected on a screen
in a screening room,

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.924
never-- at least once.

00:35:24.924 --> 00:35:26.340
I mean, there are
sometimes movies

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.490
that I will have seen
much earlier at festivals

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.370
or because there
were early screenings

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.980
that if I go back
and watch them again,

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.710
I'll watch them off a
DVD or off the link.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.894
But every time, at
least once unless it's

00:35:43.894 --> 00:35:45.310
completely impossible,
unless it's

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:50.140
such a small release that they
can't book the screening room.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.780
So I'll see it.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.710
And I'll try to
see it, in a way,

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.410
as cold as I can, because
of what you were saying,

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.340
to have as few
preconceptions as I can.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:05.090
I mean, obviously that's
not really possible.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:09.850
And as I go along and see
more and more and more movies,

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:15.680
I will have opinions
already about work,

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.510
previous films by the director
or about the actors and so on.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.090
But even still, I
try to sort of walk

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.440
into the theater
having read as little

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.580
as I possibly can get away
with reading and having

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.110
tuned out whatever my colleagues
have been saying so I can sit

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.210
down and have the experience.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.610
And often I only
see it once, so I

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.810
have to pay extra close
attention and take notes.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.890
And then I kind of leave
and try to figure out,

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.250
what else do I have to do?

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.200
It's not always the
same every time,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.030
but sometimes-- this
was based on a book.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.440
Well, I think I'd
like to read the book.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.320
Most of the time I
like to read the book.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.380
Are there other movies like
this one that I've missed?

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.540
Are there earlier
films by this director

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.570
that I should catch up with?

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:08.400
So just whatever it is-- if it's
is a movie about a real person

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.200
or an episode in history, do
I need to do some research

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.250
to find out about that?

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.885
And I'll do that.

00:37:13.885 --> 00:37:15.260
And that's partly
just also a way

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.090
of procrastinating and
feeling like I'm working

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.280
and putting off writing.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.490
It's like, I'd better check that
Wikipedia entry one more time.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:29.470
And then I kind of--
the writing process

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:36.250
is fairly concentrated
and intensive.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.316
I mean, as everyone who works
for a daily newspaper does,

00:37:39.316 --> 00:37:40.690
I've learned how,
when necessary,

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:41.660
to write very quickly.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.050
Sometimes the deadline
is on Wednesday.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:45.550
The screening is Tuesday night.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:50.490
I have to get up in the
morning and drink my coffee

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.980
and produce the copy in
90 minutes or something.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.110
And I can do that.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.350
That's not my favorite,
but you learn to do that.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:03.534
And I sort of sit
down, and I figure out

00:38:03.534 --> 00:38:04.450
what I'm going to say.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:08.380
And I always have to
have the lead first.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.540
I can't start writing until I
know how it's going to begin.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.547
And I do write in
a fairly linear way

00:38:14.547 --> 00:38:16.630
and then sometimes go back
and move things around.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.470
But it does somehow
have to go in sequence.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:22.140
I have to see the
argument and see

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.340
how I'm going to get
where I'm going to start

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.000
and how I'm going
to get to the end

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.120
and have a chance, in a way, to
surprise myself along the way.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.510
And I guess to the
other question,

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:37.440
the difference
between-- it's not

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.150
really a different experience
of going to the movies.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.990
I mean, I think I
always had the kind

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.870
of critic part of my
brain going long before I

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.600
was a critic professionally.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.960
It's just kind of
part of what I liked

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.770
about going to the
movies, that sort

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:57.140
of thinking and reflecting--
but not to have the obligation

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.399
to write about is a great
freedom, because that's

00:39:00.399 --> 00:39:01.190
what's really hard.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.300
Thinking is fun.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.100
Writing is hard.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.150
And it was fun to go with
my wife to see "The Martian"

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.510
and enjoy "The
Martian" and not have

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:17.740
to think about how to put it
in writing, in 1,200 words

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.900
without spoiling anything,
what I thought of it.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.510
AUDIENCE: So there's this
thing that Roger Ebert

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.500
said once that has stuck with
me when it comes to criticism.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.410
And it was something like, your
intellect may get confused,

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.590
but your emotions will
never lead you astray.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:40.680
And you've alluded
to this distance

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.825
between that first
initial emotional reaction

00:39:43.825 --> 00:39:45.950
that you get maybe coming
straight out of the movie

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:52.370
theater, and later trying to
figure out thinking about it

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.250
and figuring out how maybe
why do I have that reaction,

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.240
intellectualizing it a bit.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.790
And so my question is, how do
you balance those two things?

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:08.110
Because on the one
extreme, you have just

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:11.420
clicking the Like button sort
of purely emotional reaction,

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.890
and then on the
other hand you have

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:16.569
that-- if you
intellectualize too much,

00:40:16.569 --> 00:40:18.360
you run the risk of
getting really abstract

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.990
and people don't understand
what you're trying to say.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.720
AO SCOTT: And I think you
also do risk betraying

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.600
something of your own feeling.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.750
I mean, I disagree a little
with what Roger said there,

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.850
because I think that your
emotions can lead you astray

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:39.520
and that movies are
such an emotionally

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.250
powerful and
sometimes emotionally

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:43.530
overpowering experience.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.490
They can manipulate you.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.430
They can induce
strong feelings in you

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.530
that they might not
deserve or they may not

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.900
be doing for good reason.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.904
So I mean, there are plenty of
movies-- or not just movies.

00:40:55.904 --> 00:40:57.570
I mean, there are
television commercials

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:03.490
that can make you kind of
choke up and feel sentimental.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:07.220
And there are
techniques for evoking

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.500
all kinds of things that
will make you feel that way.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.400
So you shouldn't always
necessarily trust that.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.370
I mean, you should
approach that perhaps

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:20.060
with a little bit of skepticism.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.910
But you can't at the same
time let go of it entirely.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:27.310
I mean, I do think that
feeling is very important

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:33.475
and that it's the thing, in a
way, that you're the most sure

00:41:33.475 --> 00:41:38.440
of-- which doesn't mean that
you always go with it 100%,

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:43.690
but the information
that you have

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:46.440
about a given movie
that you absolutely know

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.232
is how it made you feel.

00:41:48.232 --> 00:41:49.940
You weren't there when
it was being made.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.480
I mean, movies are very
hard to decode in a way.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:58.340
You can certainly
understand the techniques

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.802
and break them down and think
about the shots and the cuts

00:42:01.802 --> 00:42:03.260
and the music and
the performances.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.180
You can analyze them.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.730
You can find out what
kind of lenses were used

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:14.340
and how many takes that scene
took, but you don't necessarily

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.470
know any of that, and you might
never get to the bottom of what

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.540
was actually
happening, or certainly

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:23.760
what the intentions of
the people involved were.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.250
And usually the
immediate intentions

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.190
were to finish the damn thing.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:35.380
So what you know-- a thing
that Gene Siskel used

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.327
to say a lot-- the question
is, what do you know for sure?

00:42:39.327 --> 00:42:40.410
What do you know for sure?

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:43.920
And you ask yourself
about a movie,

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.480
and what you know
for sure is how

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.277
it made you feel-- which, again,
doesn't mean that it's just

00:42:50.277 --> 00:42:52.860
the expression of that feeling
is enough to make it criticism.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.750
I guess this is where the
thought and the intellect

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.800
and the more cerebral
part of it comes in.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.670
Just saying "I felt
something" isn't criticism,

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.960
because it's not necessarily
useful to anybody else.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.860
You just say, I liked that.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.690
I cried.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:07.400
That sucked.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.330
That was hilarious.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.820
You're not doing any work with
it, and you're not, in a way,

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.090
giving anyone else
anything to think about.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:21.140
So it's somehow the
conversion of that experience

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.340
and of those emotions
into something

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:28.650
that is transitive,
that's part of a discourse

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:32.230
that you can talk
about that I think

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.997
is what criticism is good for.

00:43:34.997 --> 00:43:36.580
AUDIENCE: It's a
sort of similar lines

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.260
that we've been talking
to-- when you think

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.280
about the artist's
intent or the filmmaker's

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.640
intent versus the
work itself, how much

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.400
do you consider the intent of
the filmmakers in your reaction

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:50.900
to it?

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.530
Does it matter?

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.402
Does it not matter?

00:43:52.402 --> 00:43:53.610
AO SCOTT: I think it matters.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:44:00.940
I mean, I do sort of think that
what Oscar Wilde or his guy is

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.830
saying is sort of true, that
sometimes you're putting stuff

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.190
in there that the artist didn't.

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:10.150
But you can't necessarily
know the artist's intentions.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.060
And you actually
can't always even ask.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.290
Sometimes it can
be very frustrating

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.700
if you're doing an
interview with a filmmaker

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.904
and you say, well,
what were you doing?

00:44:19.904 --> 00:44:21.070
What were you trying to say?

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.310
And they'll say,
well, I was hoping

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:26.190
that we had enough light
for me to get the shot,

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:32.640
or I was thinking
that I was just

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:38.000
so impatient with the actor who
had flubbed the line 50 times.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.160
But I think you do
want to figure out,

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.920
in a broader sense, what
is this trying to do?

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.330
I think you shouldn't
judge things

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:49.350
according to just completely
arbitrary or irrelevant

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:49.970
standards.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.992
You have to figure out,
well, what is this movie?

00:44:53.992 --> 00:44:54.950
What's it trying to do?

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:55.950
What's it trying to say?

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.840
What are its intentions,
and how well does it

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.020
succeed in fulfilling those?

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.770
That's a step in criticism.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.772
I don't think that's
the whole thing.

00:45:04.772 --> 00:45:06.480
I think there are
other terms that things

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.220
deserve to be judged in.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.710
But they need to be understood
at least in their own terms.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:17.940
I think that thinking about
just the work itself and kind

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:22.080
of what it is apart from those
intentions is very important,

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.940
and I think it's also
important to think--

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.150
and where I kind
of often finally

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:32.320
end up when people ask, well,
what side do you see yourself?

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.420
Do I see myself as
kind of interpreting

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.450
the work of artists or in a
kind of alliance or sympathy

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:44.050
with artists, or
with the audience?

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.860
I think of myself as on
the side of the audience.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.959
I'm talking finally
to the people

00:45:49.959 --> 00:45:52.500
who are going to consume this,
who are going to see this, who

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.330
are going to think about it.

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.480
And that's who I am, too.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.270
And to the extent
that I can think

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:04.670
about what the artist might be
doing, that could be useful.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.850
But that's not the main thing.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.550
And in a way, it goes back
to the earlier question

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.670
and my earlier answer to
it, what do I know for sure?

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:19.590
What can I speak on with some
authority and some confidence?

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.990
It's not what the artist
was thinking in the end,

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.460
because I don't know.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:31.167
It's what I saw, what I thought
I saw, and how I felt about it.

00:46:31.167 --> 00:46:33.250
MALE SPEAKER: Who do you
want to win Best Picture?

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.650
AO SCOTT: Who do I want
to win Best Picture?

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:35.800
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
not who will win.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.470
AO SCOTT: Not who will win.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:37.110
Who do I want?

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.420
Oh, "Mad Max-- Fury Road."

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.000
MALE SPEAKER: That's
the one I haven't seen.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.775
AO SCOTT: All right,
well you should.

00:46:47.775 --> 00:46:49.020
It's good.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:49.944
Well, thank you all.

00:46:49.944 --> 00:46:50.860
This was a lot of fun.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.110
[APPLAUSE]
