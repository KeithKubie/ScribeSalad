00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.260
So the big question at this point is, how

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.010
is this DNA code like a recipe? And how

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.530
is it turned into protein, actually, technically? So this

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.940
is a picture of a typical human cell, and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.460
almost all of the DNA can be found inside

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.680
the nucleus, here you can see represented by the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.130
chromosomes. But out here in the cytoplasm of the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.930
cell. We see these black dots which are representing

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.200
ribosomes, and ribosomes are the machines that will

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.720
build proteins. So if ribosomes are the molecular machines

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.110
that will build proteins from amino acids and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.110
they're located out here in the cytoplasm and the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.340
information that we need to make the protein

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.820
is actually here in the nucleus. How do you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.930
think the cells going to solve this problem of

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.010
having the informations segregated away from the machinery needed

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.870
to actually build proteins. This is a real physical problem

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.310
that has to be overcome. Now some of you may already

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.870
know the answer to this question, but if you don't, I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.150
really want you to think about how you might solve this

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.910
problem if you were at cell. The information's in the

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.670
nucleus, the machinery to build the proteins in the cytoplasm. How

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.350
are we going to solve this problem? So don't worry about getting

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.630
this right or wrong, per se. Just think of a plausible

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.600
way that you might solve this problem, or a way that you think

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.180
a cell could solve it. And enter it into the text box here.
