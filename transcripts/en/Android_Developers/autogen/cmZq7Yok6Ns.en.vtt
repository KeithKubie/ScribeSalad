as well as over here in the scheduled
time heading and the same goes for on a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160
time heading and the same goes for on a
 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.729
time heading and the same goes for on a
tablet the background actually of this

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739
tablet the background actually of this
 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.119
tablet the background actually of this
area is that diagonal line pattern so

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129
area is that diagonal line pattern so
 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.710
area is that diagonal line pattern so
it's just part of the visual language of

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720
it's just part of the visual language of
 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.259
it's just part of the visual language of
the app and we use it throughout as kind

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269
the app and we use it throughout as kind
 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.360
the app and we use it throughout as kind
of like a way to partly communicate or

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370
of like a way to partly communicate or
 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.949
of like a way to partly communicate or
partly introduce contrast rather than

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959
partly introduce contrast rather than
 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.140
partly introduce contrast rather than
using different colors but also just as

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150
using different colors but also just as
 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.680
using different colors but also just as
a kind of a visual stylistic choice so

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
a kind of a visual stylistic choice so
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.849
a kind of a visual stylistic choice so
the next thing I want to talk about was

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859
the next thing I want to talk about was
 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.069
the next thing I want to talk about was
in the schedule we actually have these

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079
in the schedule we actually have these
 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.500
in the schedule we actually have these
borderless buttons these secondary touch

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510
borderless buttons these secondary touch
 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.140
borderless buttons these secondary touch
targets and this is something that this

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150
targets and this is something that this
 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.149
targets and this is something that this
kind of cool if you have you know a

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159
kind of cool if you have you know a
 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.780
kind of cool if you have you know a
common other action for for a line item

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790
common other action for for a line item
 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.479
common other action for for a line item
so here rather than just choosing this

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489
so here rather than just choosing this
 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.250
so here rather than just choosing this
one this session that's in my schedule I

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260
one this session that's in my schedule I
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.050
one this session that's in my schedule I
can just choose to see all items that

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060
can just choose to see all items that
 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.789
can just choose to see all items that
are in my schedule or for that time

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799
are in my schedule or for that time
 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.039
are in my schedule or for that time
we're all items in the all available

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049
we're all items in the all available
 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.399
we're all items in the all available
sessions in that

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409
sessions in that
 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.300
sessions in that
another one of my favorites is the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310
another one of my favorites is the
 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.339
another one of my favorites is the
contextual action bar so let's say you

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349
contextual action bar so let's say you
 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.830
contextual action bar so let's say you
wanted to you know share something

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840
wanted to you know share something
 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.899
wanted to you know share something
immediately rather than jumping into the

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909
immediately rather than jumping into the
 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.480
immediately rather than jumping into the
session you could long press and you

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490
session you could long press and you
 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.219
session you could long press and you
actually get the contextual actions that

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229
actually get the contextual actions that
 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.570
actually get the contextual actions that
you can take on there you can also

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580
you can take on there you can also
 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.240
you can take on there you can also
switch to other sessions and you can't

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250
switch to other sessions and you can't
 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.890
switch to other sessions and you can't
actually select anything else since you

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900
actually select anything else since you
 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.409
actually select anything else since you
can't really do actions on them let's

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419
can't really do actions on them let's
 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.649
can't really do actions on them let's
see so moving on to the explore tab this

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659
see so moving on to the explore tab this
 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.730
see so moving on to the explore tab this
is actually something that's that's

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740
is actually something that's that's
 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.379
is actually something that's that's
fairly subtle and a lot of you that

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389
fairly subtle and a lot of you that
 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.460
fairly subtle and a lot of you that
you've used that may not have noticed

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470
you've used that may not have noticed
 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.249
you've used that may not have noticed
this so we have this map area at the top

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259
this so we have this map area at the top
 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.770
this so we have this map area at the top
and something that we do is on press we

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780
and something that we do is on press we
 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.830
and something that we do is on press we
actually desaturate the background so

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840
actually desaturate the background so
 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.869
actually desaturate the background so
you can see that the yellow these yellow

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879
you can see that the yellow these yellow
 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.379
you can see that the yellow these yellow
Road lines they actually become gray

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389
Road lines they actually become gray
 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.309
Road lines they actually become gray
another app that does this I believe is

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319
another app that does this I believe is
 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.619
another app that does this I believe is
google currents one of the reasons that

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629
google currents one of the reasons that
 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.119
google currents one of the reasons that
we decided to do it and this is just

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129
we decided to do it and this is just
 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:08.439
we decided to do it and this is just
kind of a good neat trick it doesn't

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449
kind of a good neat trick it doesn't
 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.390
kind of a good neat trick it doesn't
really add too much here but it's

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400
really add too much here but it's
 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.430
really add too much here but it's
something that that helps prevent kind

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440
something that that helps prevent kind
 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.950
something that that helps prevent kind
of color collisions between your your

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960
of color collisions between your your
 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.540
of color collisions between your your
touch highlight your kind of like semi

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550
touch highlight your kind of like semi
 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.520
touch highlight your kind of like semi
transplant as trainmen semi-transparent

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530
transplant as trainmen semi-transparent
 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.719
transplant as trainmen semi-transparent
blue touch highlight as well collisions

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729
blue touch highlight as well collisions
 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.540
blue touch highlight as well collisions
between that and the background contents

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550
between that and the background contents
 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.459
between that and the background contents
we also do this in other areas to think

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469
we also do this in other areas to think
 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:28.930
we also do this in other areas to think
for avatar icons which you can show

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940
for avatar icons which you can show
 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.320
for avatar icons which you can show
later and then obviously we're using

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330
later and then obviously we're using
 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.140
later and then obviously we're using
different weights of Roboto here in the

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150
different weights of Roboto here in the
 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.649
different weights of Roboto here in the
tracks list we use Roboto light and

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659
tracks list we use Roboto light and
 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.749
tracks list we use Roboto light and
actually four sessions that have passed

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759
actually four sessions that have passed
 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.010
actually four sessions that have passed
you can't really see this year because

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020
you can't really see this year because
 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.990
you can't really see this year because
it's after the conference but during the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000
it's after the conference but during the
 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.269
it's after the conference but during the
conference past sessions were actually

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279
conference past sessions were actually
 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.430
conference past sessions were actually
type set in Roboto light to give them a

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440
type set in Roboto light to give them a
 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.809
type set in Roboto light to give them a
little less visual weight so that you

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:49.819
little less visual weight so that you
 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.790
little less visual weight so that you
can hear I can naturally kind of focus

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800
can hear I can naturally kind of focus
 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.959
can hear I can naturally kind of focus
on things that are yet to come another

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969
on things that are yet to come another
 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.240
on things that are yet to come another
item in the visual language is we use

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250
item in the visual language is we use
 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.399
item in the visual language is we use
these kind of circle masks and we do

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409
these kind of circle masks and we do
 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:01.629
these kind of circle masks and we do
this throughout we use these in the

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639
this throughout we use these in the
 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.700
this throughout we use these in the
stream here so you'll notice that here

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710
stream here so you'll notice that here
 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.540
stream here so you'll notice that here
in the stream you know each each poster

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550
in the stream you know each each poster
 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.209
in the stream you know each each poster
each Google+ person that's posted

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219
each Google+ person that's posted
 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.209
each Google+ person that's posted
something is in a circle and this

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219
something is in a circle and this
 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:15.760
something is in a circle and this
actually gets is shown as well on a

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770
actually gets is shown as well on a
 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.570
actually gets is shown as well on a
phone if you jump in to say like the

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580
phone if you jump in to say like the
 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.879
phone if you jump in to say like the
track details you'll see that the top

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889
track details you'll see that the top
 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.709
track details you'll see that the top
left we use this kind of track icon

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719
left we use this kind of track icon
 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.749
left we use this kind of track icon
that's inside of a circle and the reason

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759
that's inside of a circle and the reason
 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.010
that's inside of a circle and the reason
for using circles I mean just as a

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020
for using circles I mean just as a
 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.439
for using circles I mean just as a
general selleck stylistic choice is a

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449
general selleck stylistic choice is a
 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:29.710
general selleck stylistic choice is a
mean

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720
mean
 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.320
mean
it's a it's almost like a cleaner visual

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330
it's a it's almost like a cleaner visual
 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.050
it's a it's almost like a cleaner visual
it's a little more light having a lot of

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060
it's a little more light having a lot of
 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.170
it's a little more light having a lot of
boxes and squares can can kind of you

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180
boxes and squares can can kind of you
 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.790
boxes and squares can can kind of you
know instantly make something feel a

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800
know instantly make something feel a
 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.470
know instantly make something feel a
little rigid make your appt feel a

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480
little rigid make your appt feel a
 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.240
little rigid make your appt feel a
little too rigid so just introducing

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250
little too rigid so just introducing
 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.800
little too rigid so just introducing
circles where appropriate it's not kind

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810
circles where appropriate it's not kind
 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.540
circles where appropriate it's not kind
of like a universal thing just throw

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550
of like a universal thing just throw
 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.760
of like a universal thing just throw
circles at stuff and see what happens it

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770
circles at stuff and see what happens it
 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.020
circles at stuff and see what happens it
may help kind of introduce a little bit

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030
may help kind of introduce a little bit
 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.610
may help kind of introduce a little bit
of softness or warm kind of make sense

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620
of softness or warm kind of make sense
 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.290
of softness or warm kind of make sense
for the Google+ stream as well because

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300
for the Google+ stream as well because
 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.420

we added this query refinement which is

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070
we added this query refinement which is
 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.440

actually really easy for developers you

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:20.450
actually really easy for developers you
 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.230
actually really easy for developers you
simply just add a single flag and

the search field of that so you can

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960
the search field of that so you can
 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.290
the search field of that so you can
start with that search and then edit it

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.300

so as we switch between different tabs

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550
so as we switch between different tabs
 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.159
so as we switch between different tabs
you'll notice that the margins there's

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.169
you'll notice that the margins there's
 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:44.110
you'll notice that the margins there's
about a 16-bit margin there and they

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120
about a 16-bit margin there and they
 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.690
about a 16-bit margin there and they
actually use a somewhat beveling effect

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.700

actually use the center crop technique
 

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.460
actually use the center crop technique
there so right so whatever size whatever

this is not something you want to do on

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:19.100
this is not something you want to do on
 

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.350
this is not something you want to do on
on tablets if you have like really wide

various aspect ratio stays within it I
think we talked about that last time

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240
think we talked about that last time
 

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.389
think we talked about that last time
yeah and then two other minor points 1

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399
yeah and then two other minor points 1
 

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:42.759
yeah and then two other minor points 1
as the images load there's a very subtle

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:42.769
as the images load there's a very subtle
 

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:44.889
as the images load there's a very subtle

in and the other thing I wanted to

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:46.760
in and the other thing I wanted to
 

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.360
in and the other thing I wanted to
mention is on this fragment is um it's

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.370
mention is on this fragment is um it's
 

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.860
mention is on this fragment is um it's
very responsive you'll see it used in

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:50.870
very responsive you'll see it used in
 

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.620
very responsive you'll see it used in
many locations in the app and so you

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:53.630
many locations in the app and so you
 

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.939
many locations in the app and so you
know in this case it's sort of the same

00:09:54.939 --> 00:09:54.949
know in this case it's sort of the same
 

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:57.130
know in this case it's sort of the same
with approximately the same width on

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.140
with approximately the same width on
 

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.620
with approximately the same width on
both tablet and phone but in other cases

00:09:59.620 --> 00:09:59.630
both tablet and phone but in other cases
 

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.329
both tablet and phone but in other cases
it may take up a bigger portion screen

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:01.339
it may take up a bigger portion screen
 

00:10:01.339 --> 00:10:03.220
it may take up a bigger portion screen
but it scales nicely depending on the

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:03.230
but it scales nicely depending on the
 

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.480
but it scales nicely depending on the
amount of width it's available to it

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:04.490
amount of width it's available to it
 

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.750
amount of width it's available to it
yeah all right let's jump into a track

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760
yeah all right let's jump into a track
 

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.370
yeah all right let's jump into a track
detail so let's jump into the Android

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:09.380
detail so let's jump into the Android
 

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.970
detail so let's jump into the Android
track here on both screens I really love

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:12.980
track here on both screens I really love
 

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.220
track here on both screens I really love
this demo if demo setup oh it's finally

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:15.230
this demo if demo setup oh it's finally
 

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.420
this demo if demo setup oh it's finally
working yeah hopefully next time it will

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:16.430
working yeah hopefully next time it will
 

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.710
working yeah hopefully next time it will
be less quirky in the beginning with

okay so a couple things in the for the I

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920
okay so a couple things in the for the I
 

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.519
okay so a couple things in the for the I
guess session or track detail as we call

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:24.529
guess session or track detail as we call
 

00:10:24.529 --> 00:10:26.319
guess session or track detail as we call
this so the first is you'll notice that

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:26.329
this so the first is you'll notice that
 

00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:27.699
this so the first is you'll notice that
there are very similar navigational

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:27.709
there are very similar navigational
 

00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:29.829
there are very similar navigational
elements first you know on a tablet we

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839
elements first you know on a tablet we
 

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:32.650
elements first you know on a tablet we
do have to pain you I and a phony about

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:32.660
do have to pain you I and a phony about
 

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.500
do have to pain you I and a phony about
a single pane you lie on a phone you

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:35.510
a single pane you lie on a phone you
 

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.780
a single pane you lie on a phone you
actually have tabs to let you switch

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:37.790
actually have tabs to let you switch
 

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.930
actually have tabs to let you switch
between the different I guess parts or

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:40.940
between the different I guess parts or
 

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.689
between the different I guess parts or
different items within a track on a

00:10:43.689 --> 00:10:43.699
different items within a track on a
 

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:45.519
different items within a track on a
tablet or on a phone you neither on a

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:45.529
tablet or on a phone you neither on a
 

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:48.340

tablet you have a spinner at the top

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:48.350
tablet you have a spinner at the top
 

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.389
tablet you have a spinner at the top
that lets you kind of switch between

00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399
that lets you kind of switch between
 

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.340
that lets you kind of switch between
this so if i go from sessions to office

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:51.350
this so if i go from sessions to office
 

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.260
this so if i go from sessions to office
hours it'll just switch between that

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:53.270
hours it'll just switch between that
 

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.430
hours it'll just switch between that
and sandbox for example one of the nice

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440
and sandbox for example one of the nice
 

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.900
and sandbox for example one of the nice
things that we wanted to mention was

00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:58.910
things that we wanted to mention was
 

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.640
things that we wanted to mention was
that you do have contextual action bar

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:00.650
that you do have contextual action bar
 

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.640
that you do have contextual action bar
support here so you can even select one

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:03.650
support here so you can even select one
 

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.370
support here so you can even select one
item right so view one session and then

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:06.380
item right so view one session and then
 

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.490
item right so view one session and then
long press to select other items and

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:09.500
long press to select other items and
 

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.720
long press to select other items and
then take action on those actually in

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:10.730
then take action on those actually in
 

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.890
then take action on those actually in
this case there's no actions that could

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:11.900
this case there's no actions that could
 

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.110
this case there's no actions that could
take because this one is in my schedule

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.120
take because this one is in my schedule
 

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.440
take because this one is in my schedule
but if I if I only select things that

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:17.450
but if I if I only select things that
 

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.150
but if I if I only select things that
are not in my schedule I can instantly

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160
are not in my schedule I can instantly
 

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.310
are not in my schedule I can instantly
add those Alta my schedule all at once

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320
 

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.860
the so we also wanted to mention that

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:26.870
the so we also wanted to mention that
 

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.260
the so we also wanted to mention that
the track icons again like track icons

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:29.270
the track icons again like track icons
 

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.490
the track icons again like track icons
is one of the things that we added this

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:30.500
is one of the things that we added this
 

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.740
is one of the things that we added this
year we made sure that every track had

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:32.750
year we made sure that every track had
 

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.740
year we made sure that every track had
some sort of visual identifier to kind

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:35.750
some sort of visual identifier to kind
 

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.540
some sort of visual identifier to kind
of help you differentiate it from other

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:37.550
of help you differentiate it from other
 

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.600
of help you differentiate it from other
tracks so we use those track icons in a

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:40.610
tracks so we use those track icons in a
 

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.550
tracks so we use those track icons in a
lot of places on a tablet we use them in

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560
lot of places on a tablet we use them in
 

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.990
lot of places on a tablet we use them in
the header here so if i switch to say

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000
the header here so if i switch to say
 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.670

the Google+ track you want to set the

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680
the Google+ track you want to set the
 

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.080
the Google+ track you want to set the
header actually changes the icon to

header actually changes the icon to
 

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.280
header actually changes the icon to
Google+ let's see what else we have so

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:51.290
Google+ let's see what else we have so
 

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.190
Google+ let's see what else we have so
another minor point is every UI element

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200
another minor point is every UI element
 

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.930
another minor point is every UI element
that is interactive has touch feedback

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:55.940
that is interactive has touch feedback

that is interactive has touch feedback
so if I you know put my finger on here

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:58.400
so if I you know put my finger on here
 

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.830
so if I you know put my finger on here
if I just press down in here you'll

notice that there's that blue overlay
 

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.030
notice that there's that blue overlay
that the covers it too lets you that

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040
that the covers it too lets you that
 

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.260
that the covers it too lets you that
indicates that something is happening

indicates that something is happening
also the same we work if you use a

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:07.340
also the same we work if you use a
 

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.090
also the same we work if you use a
keyboard or something to focus that area

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:12.100
 

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.410
notre minor point is that the on a

this track spinner as well as the
session detail heading they have the

session detail heading they have the
 

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.470
session detail heading they have the
same height and that's kind of too it's

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480
same height and that's kind of too it's
 

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.240
same height and that's kind of too it's
it's not really a it's there's no

kind of a visual way to align things I

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:29.510
kind of a visual way to align things I
 

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.870
kind of a visual way to align things I
don't I don't want to talk about liking

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880
don't I don't want to talk about liking
 

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.070
don't I don't want to talk about liking
of which principle that is because I

it's one way to ensure that there's

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:37.460
it's one way to ensure that there's
 

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.730
it's one way to ensure that there's
visual balance across your new eyes to

visual balance across your new eyes to
 

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.890
visual balance across your new eyes to
align things were possible if there's no

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:41.900
align things were possible if there's no
 

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.660
align things were possible if there's no
kind of natural point of alignment does

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:43.670
kind of natural point of alignment does
 

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.130
kind of natural point of alignment does
it make sense to do that but in this

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:45.140
it make sense to do that but in this
 

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.080
it make sense to do that but in this
case we thought that it would make sense

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.090
case we thought that it would make sense
 

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.519

let's see sliding paint so one thing we

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260
let's see sliding paint so one thing we
 

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.400
let's see sliding paint so one thing we
can't demo here is the portrait mode we

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:55.410
can't demo here is the portrait mode we
 

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.730
can't demo here is the portrait mode we
talked about this very briefly last week

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:57.740
talked about this very briefly last week
 

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.280
talked about this very briefly last week
but in in portrait mode if you were to

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:01.290
but in in portrait mode if you were to
 

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.710
but in in portrait mode if you were to
hold this tablet in portrait you would

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720
hold this tablet in portrait you would
 

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.360
hold this tablet in portrait you would
actually have a sliding pane layout so

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:05.370
actually have a sliding pane layout so
 

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.449
actually have a sliding pane layout so
this left pane would would immediate

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459
this left pane would would immediate
 

00:13:08.459 --> 00:13:11.840
this left pane would would immediate
were would initially be invisible but if

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:11.850
were would initially be invisible but if
 

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.449
were would initially be invisible but if
you were to slide the detail section

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459
you were to slide the detail section
 

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:15.920
you were to slide the detail section
over to the right you would kind of

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:15.930
over to the right you would kind of
 

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.590
over to the right you would kind of
slide out that left pane and this is one

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600
slide out that left pane and this is one
 

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.319
slide out that left pane and this is one
way to kind of reconcile having the

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:21.329
way to kind of reconcile having the
 

00:13:21.329 --> 00:13:24.829
way to kind of reconcile having the
smaller amount of width available on on

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839
smaller amount of width available on on
 

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:26.630
smaller amount of width available on on
a 10 incher centage device in portrait

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:26.640
a 10 incher centage device in portrait
 

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.910
a 10 incher centage device in portrait
but making sure that they you know that

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920
but making sure that they you know that
 

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.870
but making sure that they you know that
you still have access to the same

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880
you still have access to the same
 

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.000
you still have access to the same
contents to kind of maintain the the

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.010
contents to kind of maintain the the
 

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.650
contents to kind of maintain the the
functional parity across portrait and

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.660
functional parity across portrait and
 

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.990
functional parity across portrait and
landscape so again the minor point

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000
landscape so again the minor point
 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.100
landscape so again the minor point
that's not something we can demo right

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.110
that's not something we can demo right
 

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.920
that's not something we can demo right
now and then we already talked about the

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:39.930
now and then we already talked about the
 

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.690
now and then we already talked about the
track icons in the action bar so

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700
track icons in the action bar so
 

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.970
track icons in the action bar so
anything else we should cover for just

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980
anything else we should cover for just
 

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.930
anything else we should cover for just

fundamental action like that something
 

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.310
fundamental action like that something
that should really be immediately

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320
that should really be immediately

schedule another thing is that we

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:28.890
schedule another thing is that we
 

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.829
schedule another thing is that we
actually had it help overlay we had a

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839
actually had it help overlay we had a
 

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:32.930
actually had it help overlay we had a
dialog pop up that said hey press this

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940
dialog pop up that said hey press this
 

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.150

plus button to add the session to your
 

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.920
plus button to add the session to your

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:36.930
schedule and that was just to indirect
 

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.240
schedule and that was just to indirect
so we wanted to make it a little more

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.250
so we wanted to make it a little more
 

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.449
so we wanted to make it a little more
direct and we basically move that item

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:41.459
direct and we basically move that item
 

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:43.850
direct and we basically move that item
from the action bar to an inline button

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860
from the action bar to an inline button
 

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.980
from the action bar to an inline button
here this in schedule button so one cool

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:45.990
here this in schedule button so one cool
 

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.120
here this in schedule button so one cool
thing about this is that it sticks to

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.130
thing about this is that it sticks to
 

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.790
thing about this is that it sticks to
the top so since you know while you're

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800
the top so since you know while you're
 

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.240
the top so since you know while you're
viewing a session session details you at

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.250
viewing a session session details you at
 

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.980
viewing a session session details you at
any point may want to actually decide

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:54.990
any point may want to actually decide
 

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.389
any point may want to actually decide
that hey this is interesting enough on

00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399
that hey this is interesting enough on
 

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.309
that hey this is interesting enough on
edges to my schedule so we decided to

00:14:58.309 --> 00:14:58.319
edges to my schedule so we decided to
 

00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:00.590
edges to my schedule so we decided to
make it stick to the top so that

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600
make it stick to the top so that
 

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.600
make it stick to the top so that
you know as you make a decision it's

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:02.610
you know as you make a decision it's
 

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.240
you know as you make a decision it's
always there and the same goes for

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.250
always there and the same goes for
 

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.460
always there and the same goes for
tablet actually it's a little less

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:07.470
tablet actually it's a little less
 

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.050
tablet actually it's a little less
noticeable for tablet but it's the same

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060
noticeable for tablet but it's the same
 

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.439
noticeable for tablet but it's the same
behavior another thing is that there's

00:15:12.439 --> 00:15:12.449
behavior another thing is that there's
 

00:15:12.449 --> 00:15:14.569
behavior another thing is that there's
the subtle animation this is actually

00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579
the subtle animation this is actually
 

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:18.170
the subtle animation this is actually
only for android 4.0 and higher as soon

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180
only for android 4.0 and higher as soon
 

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.550
only for android 4.0 and higher as soon
as you add something to your schedule

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560
as you add something to your schedule
 

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.920
as you add something to your schedule
there's a very subtle animation the the

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:21.930
there's a very subtle animation the the
 

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.949
there's a very subtle animation the the
plus becomes a checkbox or checkmark any

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959
plus becomes a checkbox or checkmark any
 

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.600
plus becomes a checkbox or checkmark any
kind of animated sent to say hey it is

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:26.610
kind of animated sent to say hey it is
 

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.790
kind of animated sent to say hey it is
now banana it's almost like a subtle

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800
now banana it's almost like a subtle
 

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.680
now banana it's almost like a subtle
reinforcement that the action is really

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:30.690
reinforcement that the action is really
 

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.819
reinforcement that the action is really
taking place it's not really in your

00:15:31.819 --> 00:15:31.829
taking place it's not really in your
 

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:34.400
taking place it's not really in your
schedule very very subtle on earlier

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:34.410
schedule very very subtle on earlier
 

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.199
schedule very very subtle on earlier
versions of the platform we simply just

00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:36.209
versions of the platform we simply just
 

00:15:36.209 --> 00:15:37.790
versions of the platform we simply just
show in height there's some very basic

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800
show in height there's some very basic
 

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.829
show in height there's some very basic
switching laundry to do that let's say

00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839
switching laundry to do that let's say
 

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:44.930
switching laundry to do that let's say
so another thing was just reinforcing

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940
so another thing was just reinforcing
 

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.519
so another thing was just reinforcing
that kind of that visual language of

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:46.529
that kind of that visual language of
 

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.040
that kind of that visual language of
using circles throughout each of the

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.050
using circles throughout each of the
 

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.809
using circles throughout each of the
avatars here each of the speakers are

00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:50.819
avatars here each of the speakers are
 

00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:52.999
avatars here each of the speakers are
circles and if you notice when you press

00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:53.009
circles and if you notice when you press
 

00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:54.650
circles and if you notice when you press
on them they they kind of desaturate

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:54.660
on them they they kind of desaturate
 

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.040
on them they they kind of desaturate
again very very subtle touch if you know

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.050
again very very subtle touch if you know
 

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.240
again very very subtle touch if you know
if you generally have fairly you know

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.250
if you generally have fairly you know
 

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.559
if you generally have fairly you know
simple content you don't really need it

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:03.569
simple content you don't really need it
 

00:16:03.569 --> 00:16:05.600
simple content you don't really need it
in this case four avatars it's probably

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:05.610
in this case four avatars it's probably
 

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.610
in this case four avatars it's probably
not really adding that much but if you

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620
not really adding that much but if you
 

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.379
not really adding that much but if you
have photos if you have like Nia large

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:09.389
have photos if you have like Nia large
 

00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:11.629
have photos if you have like Nia large
photos that may potentially clash with

the overlay you may want to do that you
 

00:16:15.569 --> 00:16:18.650
the overlay you may want to do that you
see what else I guess you'll see the the

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660
see what else I guess you'll see the the
 

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.470
see what else I guess you'll see the the
diagonal lines here in the header again

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480
diagonal lines here in the header again
 

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.730
diagonal lines here in the header again
and then also the the section headers a

could be many of them or few of them

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000
could be many of them or few of them
 

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.409

depend on which session it is yeah so

00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419
depend on which session it is yeah so
 

00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:07.789
depend on which session it is yeah so
one thing I wanted to mention on on a

00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799
one thing I wanted to mention on on a
 

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:09.919
one thing I wanted to mention on on a
tablet I guess is the consistent

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:09.929
tablet I guess is the consistent
 

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:11.260
tablet I guess is the consistent
iconography and this is again

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:11.270
iconography and this is again
 

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.330
iconography and this is again
introducing some consistency

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:13.340
introducing some consistency
 

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.980
introducing some consistency

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:14.990
in the visuals that you use in your app
 

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.900
in the visuals that you use in your app
is just as important as following the

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:16.910
is just as important as following the
 

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.820
is just as important as following the
visual design guidelines of on Android

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:18.830
visual design guidelines of on Android
 

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.470
visual design guidelines of on Android
right to make sure that your app is

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480
right to make sure that your app is
 

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.360
right to make sure that your app is
internally consistent one of the other

ways in which we do that outside of
 

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.750
ways in which we do that outside of
using the diagonal line visual element

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760
using the diagonal line visual element
 

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.790
using the diagonal line visual element
and the circles is this kind of

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:27.800
and the circles is this kind of
 

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.700
and the circles is this kind of
unification of presentation of sessions

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.710
unification of presentation of sessions
 

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.320

that are in your schedule so first

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:32.330
that are in your schedule so first
 

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.460
that are in your schedule so first
you'll notice that there are these

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:33.470
you'll notice that there are these
 

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.220
you'll notice that there are these
little ribbons or I guess bookmarks that

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:36.230
little ribbons or I guess bookmarks that
 

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.800
little ribbons or I guess bookmarks that
have a little check mark in them and

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:38.810
have a little check mark in them and
 

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.240
have a little check mark in them and
these are sessions that are in my

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:40.250
these are sessions that are in my
 

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.730
these are sessions that are in my
schedule and the same is mirrored here

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:42.740
schedule and the same is mirrored here
 

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.830

button if I look at a session that's not
 

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.840
button if I look at a session that's not
added you'll see that kind of the the

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:49.850
added you'll see that kind of the the
 

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.390
added you'll see that kind of the the
inverse the inverse state of that and

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400
inverse the inverse state of that and
 

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.310
inverse the inverse state of that and
pressing that immediately shows the

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320
pressing that immediately shows the
 

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.320
pressing that immediately shows the
little checkbook a check mark there so

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:56.330
little checkbook a check mark there so
 

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.490
little checkbook a check mark there so
these kind of subtle things help

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:57.500
these kind of subtle things help
 

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.560
these kind of subtle things help
reinforce or help create a unified

00:17:59.560 --> 00:17:59.570
reinforce or help create a unified
 

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.830
reinforce or help create a unified
visual language across your your app so

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840
visual language across your your app so
 

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.280
visual language across your your app so
let's see talk about that oh one other

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:06.290
let's see talk about that oh one other
 

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.750
let's see talk about that oh one other
thing was on session details you'll

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760
thing was on session details you'll
 

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.000
thing was on session details you'll
notice that on tablets we use a larger

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.010
notice that on tablets we use a larger
 

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.190
notice that on tablets we use a larger
font as well as Roboto light for the

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200
font as well as Roboto light for the
 

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.770
font as well as Roboto light for the
text here and that's partly because you

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:14.780
text here and that's partly because you
 

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.690
text here and that's partly because you
know it's is generally a little easier

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:16.700
know it's is generally a little easier
 

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.270
know it's is generally a little easier
first of all it's um it helps mitigate

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280
first of all it's um it helps mitigate
 

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.310
first of all it's um it helps mitigate
kind of long line lengths long line

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320
kind of long line lengths long line
 

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.220
kind of long line lengths long line
measure disasters but in this case it

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.230
measure disasters but in this case it
 

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.680
measure disasters but in this case it
really helps make the content feel more

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:26.690
really helps make the content feel more
 

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.630
really helps make the content feel more
balanced since there's a lot of space

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640
balanced since there's a lot of space
 

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.700
balanced since there's a lot of space
here and if this were any smaller and if

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:30.710
here and if this were any smaller and if
 

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.570
here and if this were any smaller and if
this Roboto regular it may kind of feel

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:34.580
this Roboto regular it may kind of feel
 

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.300
this Roboto regular it may kind of feel
a little too dense so so using that

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:37.310
a little too dense so so using that
 

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.860
a little too dense so so using that
really helped on tablets the line

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:38.870
really helped on tablets the line
 

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.720
really helped on tablets the line
Heights a taller as well yeah the wine

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:40.730
Heights a taller as well yeah the wine
 

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.460
Heights a taller as well yeah the wine
Heights are ever so slightly taller we

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:42.470
Heights are ever so slightly taller we
 

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.560

let's quickly look at submit feedback on
 

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.890
let's quickly look at submit feedback on
the phone so submit feedback is you know

let's say you've seen a session and I

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:55.490
let's say you've seen a session and I
 

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.160
let's say you've seen a session and I
can do that in tablet as well but let's

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.170
can do that in tablet as well but let's
 

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.600
can do that in tablet as well but let's
say you've seen a session and now you

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:58.610
say you've seen a session and now you
 

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.490
say you've seen a session and now you
want to look at or now you want to

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:00.500
want to look at or now you want to
 

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.530
want to look at or now you want to
provide feedback so this is actually a

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:02.540
provide feedback so this is actually a
 

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.750
provide feedback so this is actually a
custom control that your own it's very

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760
custom control that your own it's very
 

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.340
custom control that your own it's very
simple it's based on a seat bar there

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:06.350
simple it's based on a seat bar there
 

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.960

are some crazy nine patches in there but

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:07.970
are some crazy nine patches in there but
 

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.360
are some crazy nine patches in there but
it's really just a fancy seekbar the

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.370
it's really just a fancy seekbar the
 

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.650
it's really just a fancy seekbar the
idea is that you know you have this

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:11.660
idea is that you know you have this
 

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.110
idea is that you know you have this
slider it's a kind of sliding scale for

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120
slider it's a kind of sliding scale for
 

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.200
slider it's a kind of sliding scale for
ratings and we use the the standard

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.210
ratings and we use the the standard
 

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.420
ratings and we use the the standard
accent color it's like a we call it io

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:19.430
accent color it's like a we call it io
 

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.850
accent color it's like a we call it io
blue we use the standard accent color

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:21.860
blue we use the standard accent color
 

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.570
blue we use the standard accent color
rather than hollow blue in this

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580
rather than hollow blue in this
 

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.860
rather than hollow blue in this
because we wanted to kind of introduce a

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:24.870
because we wanted to kind of introduce a
 

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.110
because we wanted to kind of introduce a
little bit more kind of color

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120
little bit more kind of color
 

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.180
little bit more kind of color
consistency throughout and then at the

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:29.190
consistency throughout and then at the
 

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.240
consistency throughout and then at the
bottom you'll notice that we actually

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:32.250
bottom you'll notice that we actually
 

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.690
bottom you'll notice that we actually
use that same blue for for the the radio

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:35.700
use that same blue for for the the radio
 

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.790
use that same blue for for the the radio
buttons as well as the text field so the

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:37.800
buttons as well as the text field so the
 

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.470
buttons as well as the text field so the
little underline in the text field is

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480
little underline in the text field is
 

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.720
little underline in the text field is
also the same color and the way we did

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:41.730
also the same color and the way we did
 

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.310
also the same color and the way we did
that we actually used Android holo

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320
that we actually used Android holo
 

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.310
that we actually used Android holo
colors from Jerome vanderlinden I

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320
colors from Jerome vanderlinden I
 

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.590
colors from Jerome vanderlinden I
believe an Android holo colors basically

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600
believe an Android holo colors basically
 

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.630
believe an Android holo colors basically
lets you throw in your accent color and

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640
lets you throw in your accent color and

your designers don't have to sit and
like you know draw out so thing that was

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.090
like you know draw out so thing that was
 

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.360

it for secession feedback let's jump

00:19:59.360 --> 00:19:59.370
it for secession feedback let's jump

into the map but I think we're about at

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:01.680
into the map but I think we're about at
 

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.830
into the map but I think we're about at
about 20 minutes now so we should

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840
about 20 minutes now so we should
 

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.470
about 20 minutes now so we should
probably hurry up but let's look at the

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480
probably hurry up but let's look at the
 

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.500
probably hurry up but let's look at the
map here so here's the map and it's

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:09.510
map here so here's the map and it's
 

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.500
map here so here's the map and it's
using the new maps the Android Maps API

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:12.510
using the new maps the Android Maps API
 

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.720
using the new maps the Android Maps API
v2 I forgot the name of that but yeah

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:14.730
v2 I forgot the name of that but yeah

v2 I forgot the name of that but yeah
it's using the new Android Maps API

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:16.830
it's using the new Android Maps API
 

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.470
it's using the new Android Maps API
you'll notice that some of the

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480
you'll notice that some of the
 

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.300
you'll notice that some of the
interesting things here first each of

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.310
interesting things here first each of
 

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.390
interesting things here first each of
these map markers is customized so it's

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400
these map markers is customized so it's
 

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.520
these map markers is customized so it's
using that standard you know blue purple

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:25.530
using that standard you know blue purple
 

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.850
using that standard you know blue purple
red gradient inside their next is when

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860
red gradient inside their next is when
 

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.580
red gradient inside their next is when
you open up let's say the sandbox area

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:31.590
you open up let's say the sandbox area
 

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.250
you open up let's say the sandbox area
right you'll notice that we use that

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260
right you'll notice that we use that
 

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.990
right you'll notice that we use that
same styling for for showing icons this

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000
same styling for for showing icons this
 

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.550
same styling for for showing icons this
is the same styling on a tablet where

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:40.560
is the same styling on a tablet where
 

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.530
is the same styling on a tablet where
you see kind of the title at the top

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:42.540
you see kind of the title at the top
 

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.080
you see kind of the title at the top
left I guess some sort of subtitle below

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.090
left I guess some sort of subtitle below
 

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.520
left I guess some sort of subtitle below
and then the icon on the top right and

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:46.530
and then the icon on the top right and
 

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.140
and then the icon on the top right and
you use actually a subtle gradient as

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:48.150
you use actually a subtle gradient as
 

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.840
you use actually a subtle gradient as
well to to kind of hint that this is you

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:50.850
well to to kind of hint that this is you
 

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.550

language is there's no real meaning to
it I guess let's see what else for this

00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620
it I guess let's see what else for this
 

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.620
it I guess let's see what else for this
so we actually use bold condensed here

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:00.630
so we actually use bold condensed here
 

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.940

for the text so for very long it's a

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:04.950

condensed helps compress that

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720
condensed helps compress that
 

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.930
condensed helps compress that
horizontally so let's quickly look at

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940
horizontally so let's quickly look at
 

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.610
horizontally so let's quickly look at
the pop-up so let's say I actually

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620
the pop-up so let's say I actually
 

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.190
the pop-up so let's say I actually
decide to look at what's in this

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200
decide to look at what's in this
 

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.470

pop-up it's kind of a floating pain
 

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.200
pop-up it's kind of a floating pain
whereas on a phone you actually get a

whereas on a phone you actually get a
 

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.590
whereas on a phone you actually get a
separate activity now if on a tablet i

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600
separate activity now if on a tablet i

one pain broken out and on the right
 

00:22:44.139 --> 00:22:46.110
one pain broken out and on the right
side there's a split between tabs for

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:49.410
very soon where we're just waiting on a
 

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.810
very soon where we're just waiting on a
couple of things to be sorted out before

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820
couple of things to be sorted out before
 

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.080
couple of things to be sorted out before
we can do that and yeah it's you know

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.090
we can do that and yeah it's you know
 

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.400
we can do that and yeah it's you know
it's been a pleasure working on it there

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:55.410
it's been a pleasure working on it there
 

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.510
it's been a pleasure working on it there
are some things that we'd probably do

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520
are some things that we'd probably do
 

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.490
are some things that we'd probably do
differently right yeah so actually at

00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500
differently right yeah so actually at
 

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.790
differently right yeah so actually at
i/o there was a an app clinic live and

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:01.800
i/o there was a an app clinic live and
 

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.650
i/o there was a an app clinic live and
one of the comments that reader gave us

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:03.660
one of the comments that reader gave us
 

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.050
one of the comments that reader gave us
is about the refresh button right yeah

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:06.060
is about the refresh button right yeah
 

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.420
is about the refresh button right yeah
so uh so we have this manual refresh

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:08.430
so uh so we have this manual refresh
 

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.190
so uh so we have this manual refresh
button at the top and when when you're

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200
button at the top and when when you're
 

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.950
button at the top and when when you're
actually sinking content it'll show a

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960
actually sinking content it'll show a
 

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.290
actually sinking content it'll show a
spinner in place but one of the comments

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:15.300
spinner in place but one of the comments
 

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.030
spinner in place but one of the comments
that Ian and rato gave us was that you

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.040
that Ian and rato gave us was that you
 

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.440
that Ian and rato gave us was that you
know why do you need refresh this should

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:18.450
know why do you need refresh this should
 

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:19.820
know why do you need refresh this should
automatically sync in the background

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:19.830
automatically sync in the background
 

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.950
automatically sync in the background
refresh should not be you know primary

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960
refresh should not be you know primary
 

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.150
refresh should not be you know primary
action should be second there if

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:23.160
action should be second there if
 

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.580
action should be second there if
anything if at all and we do actually

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:25.590
anything if at all and we do actually
 

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.350
anything if at all and we do actually
have a Google Cloud messaging enabled

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360
have a Google Cloud messaging enabled
 

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.200
have a Google Cloud messaging enabled
here so we do refresh you know on I

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:30.210
here so we do refresh you know on I
 

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.110
here so we do refresh you know on I
guess on push from the server so you

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120
guess on push from the server so you
 

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.580
guess on push from the server so you
know we could probably just very simply

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:34.590
know we could probably just very simply
 

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.020
know we could probably just very simply
just remove the refresh button we're

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.030
just remove the refresh button we're
 

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.850
just remove the refresh button we're
moving into the overflow so definitely

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860
moving into the overflow so definitely
 

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.110
moving into the overflow so definitely
you know if you have especially if you

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120
you know if you have especially if you
 

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.330
you know if you have especially if you
have a sync adapter if you have google

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340
have a sync adapter if you have google
 

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.550
have a sync adapter if you have google
cloud messaging turned on you don't

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:43.560
cloud messaging turned on you don't
 

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.440
cloud messaging turned on you don't
necessarily need refresh yeah you remove

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:45.450
necessarily need refresh yeah you remove
 

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.880
necessarily need refresh yeah you remove
that for next yeah i think the the one

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:46.890
that for next yeah i think the the one
 

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.050
that for next yeah i think the the one
other purpose the refresh button was to

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:48.060
other purpose the refresh button was to
 

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.060
other purpose the refresh button was to
refresh the the Google+ stream so we had

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.070
refresh the the Google+ stream so we had
 

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.890
refresh the the Google+ stream so we had
some limitations there in terms of you

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900
some limitations there in terms of you
 

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.840
some limitations there in terms of you
know how we would fetch new content and

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:53.850
know how we would fetch new content and
 

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.330
know how we would fetch new content and
actually display it in line there but

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340
actually display it in line there but
 

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.920
actually display it in line there but
hopefully in a future version we can

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:57.930
hopefully in a future version we can
 

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.210
hopefully in a future version we can
sort of get rid of that refresh button

00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220
sort of get rid of that refresh button
 

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.100
sort of get rid of that refresh button
just intelligently refresher as needed

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.110
just intelligently refresher as needed
 

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.250
just intelligently refresher as needed
yeah all right so that was a whopping

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260
yeah all right so that was a whopping
 

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.530
yeah all right so that was a whopping
demo of the i/o app we probably have

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:06.540
demo of the i/o app we probably have
 

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.570
demo of the i/o app we probably have
like three seconds for the rest of our

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580
like three seconds for the rest of our
 

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.560
like three seconds for the rest of our
content but a lot of good content left

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:11.570
content but a lot of good content left
 

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.270
content but a lot of good content left
let's see so let's jump back into the

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280
let's see so let's jump back into the
 

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.990
let's see so let's jump back into the
slides there they are so that was the

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000
slides there they are so that was the
 

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.280
slides there they are so that was the
i/o app again if you want to install it

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:19.290
i/o app again if you want to install it
 

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.390
i/o app again if you want to install it
now just to play around with it here's a

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400
now just to play around with it here's a
 

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.290
now just to play around with it here's a
QR code but let's jump into sharing all

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:24.300
QR code but let's jump into sharing all
 

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.690
QR code but let's jump into sharing all
right so go through this very quickly

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700
right so go through this very quickly
 

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.260
right so go through this very quickly
this shallow dive on sharing content so

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:30.270
this shallow dive on sharing content so
 

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.170
this shallow dive on sharing content so
I just want to talk about a few things

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:32.180
I just want to talk about a few things
 

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.130
I just want to talk about a few things
sharing something that's very

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.140
sharing something that's very
 

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.070
sharing something that's very
system-wide and so I think convention is

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080
system-wide and so I think convention is
 

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.390
system-wide and so I think convention is
very important when it comes something

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400
very important when it comes something
 

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.690
very important when it comes something
like sharing so hopefully whenever you

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:41.700
like sharing so hopefully whenever you
 

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.430
like sharing so hopefully whenever you
sort of users share action you always

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440
sort of users share action you always
 

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.590
sort of users share action you always
use the the mail

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600
use the the mail
 

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.720
use the the mail
give Android share icon it's actually

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:46.730
give Android share icon it's actually
 

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.250
give Android share icon it's actually
surprisingly something we see done

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:48.260
surprisingly something we see done
 

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.850
surprisingly something we see done
incorrectly many times so definitely do

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:51.860
incorrectly many times so definitely do
 

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.670
incorrectly many times so definitely do
that also avoid hard coding specific

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:54.680
that also avoid hard coding specific
 

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.430
that also avoid hard coding specific
apps or services so you know that there

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440
apps or services so you know that there
 

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.410
apps or services so you know that there
may be a specific use case where it's

00:25:59.410 --> 00:25:59.420
may be a specific use case where it's
 

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.840
may be a specific use case where it's
sort of useful to do that but for the

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:01.850
sort of useful to do that but for the
 

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.240
sort of useful to do that but for the
vast majority of cases you should really

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:04.250
vast majority of cases you should really
 

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.590
vast majority of cases you should really
be calling out to the system share

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600
be calling out to the system share
 

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.390
be calling out to the system share
intent which I'll show you some example

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:07.400
intent which I'll show you some example
 

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.310
intent which I'll show you some example
of that in just a second rather than

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320
of that in just a second rather than
 

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.810
of that in just a second rather than
sort of hard-coding to fire up a

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:10.820
sort of hard-coding to fire up a
 

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.300
sort of hard-coding to fire up a
specific app or a specific service that

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:13.310
specific app or a specific service that
 

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.460
specific app or a specific service that
receives sharing i think android users

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:15.470
receives sharing i think android users
 

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.200
receives sharing i think android users
have just become really really used to

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:17.210
have just become really really used to
 

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.150
have just become really really used to
being able to use whichever application

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:19.160
being able to use whichever application
 

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.490
being able to use whichever application
or service they want to use and so when

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:21.500
or service they want to use and so when
 

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.190
or service they want to use and so when
they don't get that they're just going

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200
they don't get that they're just going
 

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.210
they don't get that they're just going
to be unhappy and it's going to be a

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:25.220
to be unhappy and it's going to be a
 

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.400
to be unhappy and it's going to be a
frustrating experience one other thing I

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.410
frustrating experience one other thing I
 

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.840
frustrating experience one other thing I
wanted to notice that you know sometimes

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:28.850
wanted to notice that you know sometimes
 

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.360
wanted to notice that you know sometimes
you want to do a really rich integration

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:31.370
you want to do a really rich integration
 

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.860
you want to do a really rich integration
with a certain you know network like

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:32.870
with a certain you know network like
 

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.220
with a certain you know network like
Twitter or Facebook that's okay too but

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.230
Twitter or Facebook that's okay too but
 

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.050
Twitter or Facebook that's okay too but
if you do decide to do that then make

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:38.060
if you do decide to do that then make
 

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.730
if you do decide to do that then make
sure that you have an equally prominent

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:39.740
sure that you have an equally prominent
 

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.710
sure that you have an equally prominent
at least kind of equally prominent

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:41.720
at least kind of equally prominent
 

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.950
at least kind of equally prominent
equally obvious visible yeah option to

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960
equally obvious visible yeah option to
 

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.840
equally obvious visible yeah option to
share with other things on the platform

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:46.850
share with other things on the platform
 

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.100
share with other things on the platform
so if you want to do like a rich

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:48.110
so if you want to do like a rich
 

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.570
so if you want to do like a rich
integration that's fine but make sure to

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:49.580
integration that's fine but make sure to
 

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.150
integration that's fine but make sure to
also offer this as a viable until as a

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:52.160
also offer this as a viable until as a
 

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.060
also offer this as a viable until as a
visible alternative yeah and then lastly

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.070
visible alternative yeah and then lastly
 

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.480
visible alternative yeah and then lastly
you know share goes very very well as an

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:58.490
you know share goes very very well as an
 

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.850
you know share goes very very well as an
action bar action or is an action

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:00.860
action bar action or is an action
 

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.590
action bar action or is an action
provider which is something I'll talk

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600
provider which is something I'll talk
 

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.350
provider which is something I'll talk
about in just a second as well or you

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360
about in just a second as well or you
 

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.700
about in just a second as well or you
know alternatively if it's not sort of a

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:06.710
know alternatively if it's not sort of a
 

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.650
know alternatively if it's not sort of a
primary action for your particular

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:08.660
primary action for your particular
 

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.150
primary action for your particular
activity you can go into the overflow

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:10.160
activity you can go into the overflow
 

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.450
activity you can go into the overflow
it's also fun to put it in line you know

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:13.460
it's also fun to put it in line you know
 

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.700
it's also fun to put it in line you know
that's that's a valid option as well I

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:15.710
that's that's a valid option as well I
 

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.000
that's that's a valid option as well I
think just a lot of the time it does

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.010
think just a lot of the time it does
 

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.860
think just a lot of the time it does
suit the action bar very well though you

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:20.870
suit the action bar very well though you
 

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.630
suit the action bar very well though you
know if its primary goes straight there

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640
know if its primary goes straight there
 

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.640
know if its primary goes straight there
in a visible action if not it can fall

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:24.650
in a visible action if not it can fall
 

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.180
in a visible action if not it can fall
into the overflow so let me quickly very

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:28.190
into the overflow so let me quickly very
 

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.400
into the overflow so let me quickly very
quickly talk through the sort of two

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:30.410
quickly talk through the sort of two
 

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.440
quickly talk through the sort of two
main ways that the shearing action goes

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.450
main ways that the shearing action goes
 

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.600
main ways that the shearing action goes
into the action bar so first of all

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:34.610
into the action bar so first of all
 

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.500
into the action bar so first of all
there's the share action provider so

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:37.510
there's the share action provider so
 

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.640
there's the share action provider so
it's kinda have to see here let's zoom

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:39.650
it's kinda have to see here let's zoom
 

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:41.710
it's kinda have to see here let's zoom
in a little bit this is sort of how it

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720
in a little bit this is sort of how it
 

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.750
in a little bit this is sort of how it
looks it's going to be kind of hard to

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760
looks it's going to be kind of hard to
 

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.640
looks it's going to be kind of hard to
see on the video of it just sort of see

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:45.650
see on the video of it just sort of see
 

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.620
see on the video of it just sort of see
this very thin outline with the share

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:47.630
this very thin outline with the share
 

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:51.040
this very thin outline with the share
icon a little a little arrow in the

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:51.050
icon a little a little arrow in the
 

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.510
icon a little a little arrow in the
bottom right corner and then right next

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:52.520
bottom right corner and then right next
 

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.460
bottom right corner and then right next
to that is sort of your most recently

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:54.470
to that is sort of your most recently
 

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.789
to that is sort of your most recently
used or most frequently you

00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799
used or most frequently you
 

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:59.080
used or most frequently you
application that you've used to share in

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.090
application that you've used to share in
 

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.510
application that you've used to share in
this particular application before so

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520
this particular application before so
 

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.330
this particular application before so
tapping on that share icon actually

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:04.340
tapping on that share icon actually
 

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.010
tapping on that share icon actually
brings down this menu which shows three

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:06.020
brings down this menu which shows three
 

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.919
brings down this menu which shows three
additional share options this is ordered

00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:08.929
additional share options this is ordered
 

00:28:08.929 --> 00:28:11.740
additional share options this is ordered
by frequency of use and then if you tap

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:11.750
by frequency of use and then if you tap
 

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.490
by frequency of use and then if you tap
see all it'll sort of expand out to show

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:15.500
see all it'll sort of expand out to show
 

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.500
see all it'll sort of expand out to show
you the rest the really nice thing about

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:17.510
you the rest the really nice thing about
 

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.760
you the rest the really nice thing about
the show action provider is it's not

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:18.770
the show action provider is it's not
 

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.260
the show action provider is it's not
going to throw up this in a big dialogue

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:20.270
going to throw up this in a big dialogue
 

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.580
going to throw up this in a big dialogue
it sort of feels like you're still

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:21.590
it sort of feels like you're still
 

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.640
it sort of feels like you're still
within your application and it's it also

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:24.650
within your application and it's it also
 

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.159
within your application and it's it also
bubbles up any of the applications that

00:28:27.159 --> 00:28:27.169
bubbles up any of the applications that
 

00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:28.539
bubbles up any of the applications that
were using to share and orders by

00:28:28.539 --> 00:28:28.549
were using to share and orders by
 

00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:30.460
were using to share and orders by
frequency so sort of does all these

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:30.470
frequency so sort of does all these
 

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.590
frequency so sort of does all these
things for you while sort of still

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600
things for you while sort of still
 

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.030
things for you while sort of still
letting you feel like you're inside the

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:34.040
letting you feel like you're inside the
 

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.150
letting you feel like you're inside the
application and then just sort of down

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:40.160
application and then just sort of down
 

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.080
application and then just sort of down
the bottom here you'll see for

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.090
the bottom here you'll see for
 

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.330
the bottom here you'll see for
developers to sort of implement this a

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:43.340
developers to sort of implement this a
 

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.580
developers to sort of implement this a
quick tip is to use share compared to

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:45.590
quick tip is to use share compared to
 

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.070
quick tip is to use share compared to
configure menu item it sort of does

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080
configure menu item it sort of does
 

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.330
configure menu item it sort of does
elyse things for you in a backward

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:49.340
elyse things for you in a backward
 

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:54.700
elyse things for you in a backward
compatible memo so you and then the

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:54.710
compatible memo so you and then the
 

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.840
compatible memo so you and then the
other option is just to have it as a

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:55.850
other option is just to have it as a
 

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.299
other option is just to have it as a
regular share action so rather a action

00:28:58.299 --> 00:28:58.309
regular share action so rather a action
 

00:28:58.309 --> 00:29:01.150
regular share action so rather a action
provider it's just a standard action

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:01.160
provider it's just a standard action
 

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.680
provider it's just a standard action
item that goes in the action bar there

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:02.690
item that goes in the action bar there
 

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.570
item that goes in the action bar there
so here you should just use the standard

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:04.580
so here you should just use the standard
 

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.200
so here you should just use the standard
arm icon like i disgust and then call

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:08.210
arm icon like i disgust and then call
 

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.539
arm icon like i disgust and then call
out to the sub standard system share

00:29:10.539 --> 00:29:10.549
out to the sub standard system share
 

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:12.850
out to the sub standard system share
intent which is action send and that

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:12.860
intent which is action send and that
 

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.680
intent which is action send and that
will fire up this system dialogue which

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:14.690
will fire up this system dialogue which
 

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.840
will fire up this system dialogue which
goes on top of your application here and

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:16.850
goes on top of your application here and
 

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.159
goes on top of your application here and
this is what the sort of more recent

00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:18.169
this is what the sort of more recent
 

00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:19.750
this is what the sort of more recent
version of it looks like on I think

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760
version of it looks like on I think
 

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.510
version of it looks like on I think
jellybean plus the nice thing about this

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:22.520
jellybean plus the nice thing about this
 

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.610
jellybean plus the nice thing about this
is that it's been called by the system

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:24.620
is that it's been called by the system
 

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.289
is that it's been called by the system
so you get this sort of consistent feel

00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:26.299
so you get this sort of consistent feel
 

00:29:26.299 --> 00:29:27.610
so you get this sort of consistent feel
across all applications that are

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:27.620
across all applications that are
 

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.370
across all applications that are
creating this dialog it also is

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:30.380
creating this dialog it also is
 

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.380
creating this dialog it also is
optimized for larger screens so when

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:32.390
optimized for larger screens so when
 

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.990
optimized for larger screens so when
when it shows on a say a 10-inch tablet

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000
when it shows on a say a 10-inch tablet
 

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.760
when it shows on a say a 10-inch tablet
it's going to go into multi well it's

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:36.770
it's going to go into multi well it's
 

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:37.840
it's going to go into multi well it's
already multi-column it's going to go

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:37.850
already multi-column it's going to go
 

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.480
already multi-column it's going to go
into probably three columns yeah and

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:40.490
into probably three columns yeah and
 

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.060
into probably three columns yeah and
also it's also worth noting that you can

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.070
also it's also worth noting that you can
 

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.549
also it's also worth noting that you can
add items to this so you can prepend

00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559
add items to this so you can prepend
 

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:48.700
add items to this so you can prepend
intense to show at the top here so by

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:48.710
intense to show at the top here so by
 

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.470
intense to show at the top here so by
default it will just show whatever can

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480
default it will just show whatever can
 

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.930
default it will just show whatever can
respond to the send intent but you can

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:52.940
respond to the send intent but you can
 

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.490
respond to the send intent but you can
obviously add things at the top so like

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:54.500
obviously add things at the top so like
 

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.590
obviously add things at the top so like
I think I think it was pocket or there's

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600
I think I think it was pocket or there's
 

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.970
I think I think it was pocket or there's
some app out there that actually

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:57.980
some app out there that actually
 

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.760
some app out there that actually
introduced a copy to clipboard we're

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:00.770
introduced a copy to clipboard we're
 

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.049
introduced a copy to clipboard we're
basically you can share the record to

00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:02.059
basically you can share the record to
 

00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:04.330
basically you can share the record to
the clipboard to get that URL and paste

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:04.340
the clipboard to get that URL and paste
 

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.580
the clipboard to get that URL and paste
it wherever else you want yeah and the

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:06.590
it wherever else you want yeah and the
 

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.020
it wherever else you want yeah and the
nice thing about this dialog is that you

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.030
nice thing about this dialog is that you
 

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:08.380
nice thing about this dialog is that you
know

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:08.390
know
 

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.210
know
very with OS version or maybe we'll

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:10.220
very with OS version or maybe we'll
 

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.730
very with OS version or maybe we'll
change it in the future OS version but

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:12.740
change it in the future OS version but
 

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.050
change it in the future OS version but
as long as you call us in 10 you'll get

actually a lot smaller like 40 tips but
 

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.640
actually a lot smaller like 40 tips but
don't rely on these numbers these are

don't rely on these numbers these are
 

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.080
don't rely on these numbers these are
numbers that will probably change in the

they're using the kind of the old the
 

00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:32.820
they're using the kind of the old the

older system UI style so make sure that
 

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.009

you you plan for both because if you're

00:32:35.009 --> 00:32:35.019
you you plan for both because if you're
 

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:37.249
you you plan for both because if you're
supporting for example android 4.0

00:32:37.249 --> 00:32:37.259
supporting for example android 4.0
 

00:32:37.259 --> 00:32:39.149

actually it was four point yeah four

00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159
actually it was four point yeah four
 

00:32:39.159 --> 00:32:40.710
actually it was four point yeah four
point i was using this if you're

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720
point i was using this if you're
 

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.720
point i was using this if you're
supporting android 4.0 and higher just

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:42.730
supporting android 4.0 and higher just
 

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.539
supporting android 4.0 and higher just
be aware that your buttons maybe your

00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:45.549
be aware that your buttons maybe your

be aware that your buttons maybe your
notifications may actually be in the

notifications may actually be in the
 

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.940
notifications may actually be in the
bottom right at some point okay so there

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:50.950
bottom right at some point okay so there
 

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:52.230
bottom right at some point okay so there
are lots of different full screen modes

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240
are lots of different full screen modes
 

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.850
are lots of different full screen modes
and this slide is littered with the

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:53.860
and this slide is littered with the
 

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.430
and this slide is littered with the
stuff but you basically have you know a

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440
stuff but you basically have you know a
 

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.869
stuff but you basically have you know a
couple of modes you have normal mode

00:32:57.869 --> 00:32:57.879
couple of modes you have normal mode
 

00:32:57.879 --> 00:32:59.700
couple of modes you have normal mode
where everything is visible you have low

00:32:59.700 --> 00:32:59.710
where everything is visible you have low
 

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.220
where everything is visible you have low
profile mode where the bars are visible

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:02.230
profile mode where the bars are visible
 

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.070
profile mode where the bars are visible
and actually you can selectively you can

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080
and actually you can selectively you can
 

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.749
and actually you can selectively you can
you can mix and match what happens to

00:33:06.749 --> 00:33:06.759
you can mix and match what happens to
 

00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:09.480
you can mix and match what happens to
the status bar in the navigation bar but

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:09.490
the status bar in the navigation bar but
 

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.310
the status bar in the navigation bar but
the low profile mode still shows the

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320
the low profile mode still shows the
 

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.859
the low profile mode still shows the
bars but it recedes them visually so

00:33:13.859 --> 00:33:13.869
bars but it recedes them visually so
 

00:33:13.869 --> 00:33:15.539
bars but it recedes them visually so
you'll notice that the status bar here

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:15.549
you'll notice that the status bar here
 

00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:18.450
you'll notice that the status bar here
is dimmed you actually don't even see a

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:18.460
is dimmed you actually don't even see a
 

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.710
is dimmed you actually don't even see a
notification I kind you see just a

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:19.720
notification I kind you see just a
 

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.019

little a little dot indicating that
there's something there and then you're

there's something there and then you're
 

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.859
there's something there and then you're

generally when you use this kind of you

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:40.210
generally when you use this kind of you
 

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.519
generally when you use this kind of you
I something that works really well is

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:41.529
I something that works really well is
 

00:33:41.529 --> 00:33:44.100
I something that works really well is
overlaying the action bar so here this

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:44.110
overlaying the action bar so here this
 

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.350
overlaying the action bar so here this
is actually the action bar you with a

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360
is actually the action bar you with a
 

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.549
is actually the action bar you with a
semi transparency applied another

00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559
semi transparency applied another
 

00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:52.590
semi transparency applied another
important point is when you touch on the

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600
important point is when you touch on the
 

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.389
important point is when you touch on the
content you should always toggle right

00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399
content you should always toggle right
 

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.789
content you should always toggle right
so you should never permanently be in

00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799
so you should never permanently be in
 

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:58.499
so you should never permanently be in
low profile mode or the southern mode

00:33:58.499 --> 00:33:58.509
low profile mode or the southern mode
 

00:33:58.509 --> 00:34:00.840
low profile mode or the southern mode
which we'll talk about so touching

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:00.850
which we'll talk about so touching
 

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:02.279
which we'll talk about so touching
should actually be the action that

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:02.289
should actually be the action that
 

00:34:02.289 --> 00:34:06.720
should actually be the action that
toggles things and actually in this low

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:06.730
toggles things and actually in this low
 

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.730
toggles things and actually in this low
profile mode you obviously also want to

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:08.740
profile mode you obviously also want to
 

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.859
profile mode you obviously also want to
hide other UI elements as well as the

00:34:10.859 --> 00:34:10.869
hide other UI elements as well as the
 

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:12.629
hide other UI elements as well as the
action bar that's actually one thing I

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639
action bar that's actually one thing I
 

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.909
action bar that's actually one thing I
should mention right after this so

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919
should mention right after this so
 

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:16.200
should mention right after this so
there's another mode called hide

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:16.210
there's another mode called hide
 

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.139
there's another mode called hide
navigation and hide navigation hides the

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:19.149
navigation and hide navigation hides the
 

00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:21.389
navigation and hide navigation hides the
navigation bar at the bottom and it's

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399
navigation bar at the bottom and it's
 

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:23.970
navigation bar at the bottom and it's
usually tied it usually also hides the

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:23.980
usually tied it usually also hides the
 

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.639
usually tied it usually also hides the
the top bar the status bar so in this

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:26.649
the top bar the status bar so in this
 

00:34:26.649 --> 00:34:29.010
the top bar the status bar so in this
case you have full control over the

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:29.020
case you have full control over the
 

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.780
case you have full control over the
pixels on the screen so basically your

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:30.790
pixels on the screen so basically your
 

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:31.640
pixels on the screen so basically your
app is drawing

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:31.650
app is drawing
 

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:32.780
app is drawing
everything to the screen and this works

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:32.790
everything to the screen and this works
 

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.970
everything to the screen and this works
really well for videos for video content

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980
really well for videos for video content
 

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.480
really well for videos for video content
and one caveat here is that this isn't

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:38.490
and one caveat here is that this isn't
 

00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:40.760
and one caveat here is that this isn't
permanent as soon as the user touches

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:40.770
permanent as soon as the user touches
 

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.580
permanent as soon as the user touches
the screen the system will automatically

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:43.590
the screen the system will automatically
 

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.260
the screen the system will automatically
show the navigation again because you

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:45.270
show the navigation again because you
 

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.000
show the navigation again because you
don't want to lock the user into a place

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.010
don't want to lock the user into a place
 

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.010
don't want to lock the user into a place
where they have no access to back home

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020
where they have no access to back home
 

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.250
where they have no access to back home
in recent that's just really really bad

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:51.260
in recent that's just really really bad
 

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.840
in recent that's just really really bad
so there's one thing I wanted to mention

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:53.850
so there's one thing I wanted to mention
 

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.640
so there's one thing I wanted to mention
and oh right the one the last thing I

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:55.650
and oh right the one the last thing I
 

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.050
and oh right the one the last thing I
wanted to mention about these different

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060
wanted to mention about these different
 

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.560
wanted to mention about these different
modes is you generally want to only

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:00.570
modes is you generally want to only
 

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.900
modes is you generally want to only
switch between two normal and low

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:02.910
switch between two normal and low
 

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.610
switch between two normal and low
profile or normal and hide navigation

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:04.620
profile or normal and hide navigation
 

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.670
profile or normal and hide navigation
and you don't want to have different UI

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680
and you don't want to have different UI
 

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.440
and you don't want to have different UI
elements on the screen going on and off

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:09.450
elements on the screen going on and off
 

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.450
elements on the screen going on and off
at different times you actually want to

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.460
at different times you actually want to
 

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.580
at different times you actually want to
make sure that you either have the

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:13.590
make sure that you either have the
 

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.920
make sure that you either have the
status bar the navigation bar the action

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:15.930
status bar the navigation bar the action
 

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.900
status bar the navigation bar the action
bar and other UI controls all visible

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:17.910
bar and other UI controls all visible
 

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.930
bar and other UI controls all visible
like here or none of them visible so

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:20.940
like here or none of them visible so
 

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.250
like here or none of them visible so
basically this boils down to make sure

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260
basically this boils down to make sure
 

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.710
basically this boils down to make sure
that the action bar visibility is tied

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720
that the action bar visibility is tied
 

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.260
that the action bar visibility is tied
to the visibility of the other elements

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:27.270
to the visibility of the other elements
 

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.760
to the visibility of the other elements
on the screen the way I like to think

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:28.770
on the screen the way I like to think
 

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.470
on the screen the way I like to think
about these two is that load profile is

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480
about these two is that load profile is
 

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.090
about these two is that load profile is
sort of for an immersive activity where

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:32.100
sort of for an immersive activity where
 

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.920
sort of for an immersive activity where
there may still be some user interaction

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:33.930
there may still be some user interaction
 

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.450
there may still be some user interaction
like maybe you're swiping through photos

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460
like maybe you're swiping through photos
 

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.310
like maybe you're swiping through photos
maybe you're reading a book or something

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320
maybe you're reading a book or something
 

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.980
maybe you're reading a book or something
like that whereas the hide navigation is

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:39.990
like that whereas the hide navigation is
 

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.970
like that whereas the hide navigation is
more useful for something where you're

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980
more useful for something where you're
 

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.230
more useful for something where you're
not sort of interacting with it like

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240
not sort of interacting with it like
 

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.460
not sort of interacting with it like
watching video you're just sitting back

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:43.470
watching video you're just sitting back
 

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.200
watching video you're just sitting back
and looking at the screen exactly

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:45.210
and looking at the screen exactly
 

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.290
and looking at the screen exactly
exactly okay so those are the different

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300
exactly okay so those are the different
 

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.510
exactly okay so those are the different
modes just a quick a couple of examples

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520
modes just a quick a couple of examples
 

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.580
modes just a quick a couple of examples
on apps that do this in our opinion

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:52.590
on apps that do this in our opinion
 

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.260
on apps that do this in our opinion
really well first is google play books

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.270
really well first is google play books
 

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.800
really well first is google play books
so you know by default you see this you

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:57.810
so you know by default you see this you
 

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.220
so you know by default you see this you
know your actual book is itself as well

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:01.230
know your actual book is itself as well
 

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.050
know your actual book is itself as well
as some controls at the bottom and the

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060
as some controls at the bottom and the
 

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.600
as some controls at the bottom and the
action bar at the top but as soon as you

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:05.610
action bar at the top but as soon as you
 

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.150
action bar at the top but as soon as you
touch where she's not here as soon as

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160
touch where she's not here as soon as
 

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.180
touch where she's not here as soon as
you touch the screen the action bar the

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:11.190
you touch the screen the action bar the
 

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.980
you touch the screen the action bar the
status bar

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:12.990
status bar
 

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.740
status bar
and the UI control at the bottom the the

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:15.750
and the UI control at the bottom the the
 

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.200
and the UI control at the bottom the the
scrubber they all fade out and then the

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:18.210
scrubber they all fade out and then the
 

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.000
scrubber they all fade out and then the
navigation bar goes into low profile

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.010
navigation bar goes into low profile
 

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.010
navigation bar goes into low profile
mode so what you end up seeing is just

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020
mode so what you end up seeing is just
 

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.950
mode so what you end up seeing is just
nothing but but content nothing but the

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960
nothing but but content nothing but the
 

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.560
nothing but but content nothing but the
body of the book itself and then there

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:27.570
body of the book itself and then there
 

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.570
body of the book itself and then there
are some actions here for back home and

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:29.580
are some actions here for back home and
 

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.210
are some actions here for back home and
recent obviously there should be visible

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:31.220
recent obviously there should be visible
 

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.590
recent obviously there should be visible
another nice thing that this does is

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:33.600
another nice thing that this does is
 

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.290
another nice thing that this does is
that the content doesn't jump so if I

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300
that the content doesn't jump so if I
 

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.020
that the content doesn't jump so if I
touch to toggle the content doesn't kind

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.030
touch to toggle the content doesn't kind
 

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.180
touch to toggle the content doesn't kind
of realign you know software relay

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:41.190
of realign you know software relay
 

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.460
of realign you know software relay
itself out and this is possible on

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:43.470
itself out and this is possible on
 

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.609
itself out and this is possible on
jellybean so in jellybean we introduce

00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619
jellybean so in jellybean we introduce
 

00:36:46.619 --> 00:36:48.380
jellybean so in jellybean we introduce
some new API is to make sure that this

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:48.390
some new API is to make sure that this
 

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.150
some new API is to make sure that this
is possible on earlier versions it's

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160
is possible on earlier versions it's
 

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.280
is possible on earlier versions it's
much harder to do that if you're showing

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:52.290
much harder to do that if you're showing
 

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:53.930
much harder to do that if you're showing
and hiding certain things like the

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940
and hiding certain things like the
 

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.570
and hiding certain things like the
navigation bar especially another app

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:56.580
navigation bar especially another app
 

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.460
navigation bar especially another app
that does this really well as pocket so

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:58.470
that does this really well as pocket so
 

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.990
that does this really well as pocket so
what they're also kind of a good reading

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000
what they're also kind of a good reading
 

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.630
what they're also kind of a good reading
app but one thing that they do slightly

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640
app but one thing that they do slightly
 

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.840
app but one thing that they do slightly
differently is they actually toggle they

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:05.850
differently is they actually toggle they
 

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.570
differently is they actually toggle they
also toggle on touch but they also hide

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:08.580
also toggle on touch but they also hide
 

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.980
also toggle on touch but they also hide
the system UI as you start scrolling so

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:12.990
the system UI as you start scrolling so
 

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.810
the system UI as you start scrolling so
as you start scrolling down it goes into

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820
as you start scrolling down it goes into
 

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.790
as you start scrolling down it goes into
low profile mode it still shows the

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800
low profile mode it still shows the
 

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.230
low profile mode it still shows the
status bar which is good because you

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240
status bar which is good because you
 

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.550
status bar which is good because you
know if you have an email come in you

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560
know if you have an email come in you
 

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.380
know if you have an email come in you
you want to be aware that something is

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:21.390
you want to be aware that something is
 

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:25.310
you want to be aware that something is
happening and also you know it shows low

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320
happening and also you know it shows low
 

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.380
happening and also you know it shows low
profile mode from the navigation bar so

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:27.390
profile mode from the navigation bar so
 

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.840
profile mode from the navigation bar so
it's it's really really subtle but it's

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:29.850
it's it's really really subtle but it's
 

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.090
it's it's really really subtle but it's
very nice kind of focus so the thing is

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:32.100
very nice kind of focus so the thing is
 

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.320
very nice kind of focus so the thing is
you're really focused on the content

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:33.330
you're really focused on the content
 

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:37.910
you're really focused on the content
itself and lastly we have YouTube so

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920
itself and lastly we have YouTube so
 

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.140
itself and lastly we have YouTube so
YouTube is kind of the canonical example

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:39.150
YouTube is kind of the canonical example
 

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:43.310
YouTube is kind of the canonical example
of a great video playing application and

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320
of a great video playing application and
 

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.349
of a great video playing application and
obviously what YouTube does is they hide

00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359
obviously what YouTube does is they hide
 

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:48.200
obviously what YouTube does is they hide
everything possible when when you go

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:48.210
everything possible when when you go
 

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.870
everything possible when when you go
into this full screen mode so this is

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880
into this full screen mode so this is
 

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.310
into this full screen mode so this is
again possible with the new jelly bean

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320
again possible with the new jelly bean
 

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.030
again possible with the new jelly bean
api's yeah and oh one thing to note is

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040
api's yeah and oh one thing to note is
 

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.000
api's yeah and oh one thing to note is
that in the new jelly bean api is one of

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.010
that in the new jelly bean api is one of
 

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.150
that in the new jelly bean api is one of
the caveats or Consequences is that the

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160
the caveats or Consequences is that the
 

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.010
the caveats or Consequences is that the
navigation bar can actually overlay your

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:04.020
navigation bar can actually overlay your
 

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.080
navigation bar can actually overlay your
content so you notice here that the the

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:06.090
content so you notice here that the the
 

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.640
content so you notice here that the the
navigation bar is actually cutting off

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:07.650
navigation bar is actually cutting off
 

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.109
navigation bar is actually cutting off
the content so if you have something

00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119
the content so if you have something
 

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:11.359
the content so if you have something
really important at the bottom or I

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:11.369
really important at the bottom or I
 

00:38:11.369 --> 00:38:12.590
really important at the bottom or I
guess in this case at the right of your

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:12.600
guess in this case at the right of your
 

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.090
guess in this case at the right of your
screen you have to make sure that you're

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:14.100
screen you have to make sure that you're
 

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.980
screen you have to make sure that you're
not necessarily using that flag you

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:15.990
not necessarily using that flag you
 

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.810
not necessarily using that flag you
probably just want to use a low profile

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820
probably just want to use a low profile
 

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.580
probably just want to use a low profile
yeah the i/o app uses the YouTube player

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:20.590
yeah the i/o app uses the YouTube player
 

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.260
yeah the i/o app uses the YouTube player
API so it gets a lot of these things to

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:22.270
API so it gets a lot of these things to
 

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.210
API so it gets a lot of these things to
free it handles all the the full screen

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:24.220
free it handles all the the full screen
 

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.550
free it handles all the the full screen
modes for you and then one quick

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560
modes for you and then one quick
 

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.960
modes for you and then one quick
developer tip I don't have a we're

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:27.970
developer tip I don't have a we're
 

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.800
developer tip I don't have a we're
really far over yeah is a is a if you go

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:31.810
really far over yeah is a is a if you go
 

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.080
really far over yeah is a is a if you go
to eclipse and I think IntelliJ or

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:34.090
to eclipse and I think IntelliJ or
 

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.450
to eclipse and I think IntelliJ or
Android shortly you can create a full

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:36.460
Android shortly you can create a full
 

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.150
Android shortly you can create a full
screen activity yeah which kind of

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160
screen activity yeah which kind of
 

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.760
screen activity yeah which kind of
implements a pretty large chunk of this

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:41.770
implements a pretty large chunk of this
 

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.230
implements a pretty large chunk of this
behavior for you at least for photo

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240

can you deviate from them in which cases

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640
can you deviate from them in which cases
 

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.180
can you deviate from them in which cases

in one of their apps timer they

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:55.990
in one of their apps timer they
 

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.080
in one of their apps timer they
introduced a dark theme that used an

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.090
introduced a dark theme that used an
 

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:00.420
introduced a dark theme that used an
orange accent color and a bunch of users

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:00.430
orange accent color and a bunch of users
 

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:01.770
orange accent color and a bunch of users
were like oh this isn't hollow this

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:01.780
were like oh this isn't hollow this

were like oh this isn't hollow this
isn't Hollow because it wasn't it was

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:04.030
