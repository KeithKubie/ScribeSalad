ALAN SEALES: In "Cheech
is Not My Real Name,"

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.960
Cheech Marin writes
candidly about growing up

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.510
as a wise-cracking kid
in South Central LA,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.760
resisting the draft, and his
chance meeting with Tommy

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.520
Chong, and how they formed one
of the most successful comedy

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.870
acts of all time.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.760
Breaking up,
reuniting, and still

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.560
performing together to this day.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.489
Please welcome to the
stage, Cheech Marin.

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.303
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.645
How you doing?

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:33.262
CHEECH MARIN: Very good.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:33.635
Thank you.

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:34.370
ALAN SEALES: Have a seat.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.760
CHEECH MARIN: No, no.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.259
Please.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:37.850
Please, sit.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.060
How's everybody today?

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.310
ALAN SEALES: So let's start
with some easy stuff here.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.235
I actually like the
book cover itself.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.900
It kind of symbolizes a
little something to me,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.810
but I want to get your take
on what it actually means.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.344
CHEECH MARIN: I was trying to
support the pinata industry.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.260
ALAN SEALES: That was
what I was going to say.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.940
CHEECH MARIN: It was good.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.080
No, it was kind of
breaking up the old image

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.170
and seeing what's inside.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.540
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.482
So your real name
actually is not Cheech.

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:04.190
CHEECH MARIN: No.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.730
ALAN SEALES: Which is?

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.110
CHEECH MARIN: It's Richard.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.830
Dick for short.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.038
Although, not really.

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:11.130
But that's what they called me--

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.630
Cheech.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.890
ALAN SEALES: Why did
you want to write

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.790
this book in the first place?

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.650
I mean, you're well-known
over many years

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.510
for many different
things, but why venture

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.810
into the author territory?

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.370
CHEECH MARIN: Money.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.030
They offered me a lot
of money to do it.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.470
OK.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.500
That's the truth.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.830
I was doing an art
talk in San Diego,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.224
and there was a literary
agent in the audience.

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:34.640
She says, these
stories are great.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.224
You've got to make
a book out of them.

00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:37.639
So I said, can you
give me a deal?

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:38.300
Yeah, OK.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.270
She did.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.061
And so here we are.

00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:43.310
ALAN SEALES: It was that easy?

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.019
Anyone can write a book?

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:46.185
CHEECH MARIN: Anybody, yeah.

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:48.320
As a matter of fact,
anybody can write a book.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.800
Whether it's good
or not, who knows?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.495
No.

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:54.120
And then it took a little while
to put all the stories together

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.690
and get a rhythm.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.450
But I've been a writer
since I was little.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.070
I've always wrote--
written-- wrotten.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.880
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.690
So you've wrotten.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.815
CHEECH MARIN: I've wrotten.

00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:06.172
ALAN SEALES: You
wrote a lot of stuff.

00:02:06.172 --> 00:02:07.380
Is it writing if it's improv?

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.369
I guess it's recording.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.410
CHEECH MARIN: Well, yeah.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.870
I mean, if you do it
again, it's writing--

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.884
the same thing.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:16.050
ALAN SEALES: How many times
did you write this book?

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.670
CHEECH MARIN: Oh, this book?

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.940
Not that many times.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.080
Unlike some authors, I think
a lot before I put it down.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.390
And so I was pretty satisfied.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.090
And I had a
collaborator who would--

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.010
like a trainer, John Hassan.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.860
He was, OK, we need
to go over this again.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.850
But it was good.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.297
ALAN SEALES: How long
did it take then?

00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:38.880
CHEECH MARIN: The
actual writing part?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.104
Maybe about six months.

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:42.270
ALAN SEALES: That's not bad.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.811
CHEECH MARIN: No,
it was pretty good.

00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:44.450
I write fast.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.033
I'm on demand.

00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:49.170
ALAN SEALES: But putting
the stories together,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.170
did you have an outline?

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.687
Or how did you piece it
together in your muse there?

00:02:53.687 --> 00:02:55.770
CHEECH MARIN: I knew that
I wanted to kind of tell

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.900
the whole life story, but I
didn't want to start it-- then

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.300
on this day I was born.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.250
So I started it in medias
res, where I was in Canada.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.780
And how did I get here?

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.630
How does a South Central LA-born
kid get to Calgary, Alberta

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.090
without corrosion?

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.070
And so I started there.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.110
It was kind of this
existential quandrum

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.110
I was in because it was in
the middle of the Vietnam War.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.909
And I was going to Canada
ostensibly to be a potter.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:29.700
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.145
Yeah.

00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:30.930
CHEECH MARIN: A potter.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.429
And I did.

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.980
I made pottery professionally
for a couple of years.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.730
ALAN SEALES: Well, you actually
start in the book before that.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.530
You go into a little bit of
the South Central history.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.429
But when you were
a kid in 1952, you

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.970
said you were on a radio show
called "The House Party" hosted

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.890
by Art Linkletter, right?

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.510
So what happened on that?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.390
CHEECH MARIN: Well, it
was a radio program first.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.450
And very shortly
thereafter, he put it on TV

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.410
called "Kids Say the
Darndest Things."

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.090
And he would try to get kids to
spill the beans on the family,

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.780
like my mother is pregnant.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.400
My daddy doesn't know.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.100
And so I was chosen.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.594
I was in first grade, I believe.

00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:11.760
I was chosen along with a
couple of other classmates

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.510
to get in a limo with every
candy and soda and cookie

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.209
available on Earth
and eat them all

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.860
before we got to the studio.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.450
And then we put on the show.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.354
ALAN SEALES: And you just
show up all hopped up?

00:04:24.354 --> 00:04:25.770
CHEECH MARIN: They
opened the door

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.200
and like four sugar-laden
buzzing bees jumped out.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.950
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.491
I brought that up
because in the book

00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:33.810
you mentioned that that's
where you got the acting bug.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.807
CHEECH MARIN: Oh, yeah.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.140
It was like the first time I
had ever been on something.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.110
No, actually, I was in a
school play, a Christmas play.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.920
And I played the kettle drum.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.270
And we did "up on the
rooftops boom, boom, boom."

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.520
That was the kettle drum part.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.660
And I was a little
kid, I mean, little.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.900
I was always the littlest
guy in the class.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.870
And for some reason
they assigned

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.370
me to do the kettle drum.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.020
And you couldn't see me.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.690
Every kid in this
little rendition

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.370
had a paper band with a
gold star on it like that.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.680
And that's all you could see
of me is this little gold star.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.296
And the hand would come out.

00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:17.520
Boom, boom, boom.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.600
And everybody thought
that was hilarious.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.610
Hey, they're laughing.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.835
I'm in show business.

00:05:21.835 --> 00:05:22.520
All right.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.870
It's a highlight for me.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.860
ALAN SEALES: So your family
was in South Central LA.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.600
How did your parents
end up there, like,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.607
before you were born?

00:05:31.607 --> 00:05:33.440
CHEECH MARIN: Oh, that's
where they grew up.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.080
ALAN SEALES: Oh, really?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.200
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.283
That's where they grew up.

00:05:35.283 --> 00:05:36.360
They were born in LA.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.080
My grandparents were all
from Mexico, but my parents,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.411
myself, all my children, all my
grandchildren, were born in LA.

00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:45.660
ALAN SEALES: I want to read
a quote here from the book

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.370
because you're talking about
moving to Granada Hills.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.130
"Our neighborhood
was all tract houses

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.540
and bordered by orange groves.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.540
At night, the aroma of orange
blossoms was intoxicating.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.970
The first night in the house,
I was awakened by a noise.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.839
I was afraid.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.880
It sounded like the house
was being electrocuted.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.100
I went over to the window,
the sound grew louder.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.230
I opened the window and
it still got louder.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.462
Then I realized what it was.

00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:07.920
The sound of a million crickets
had replaced the screaming,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.420
sirens, and gunshots.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.040
I'll make that
trade every time."

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.790
CHEECH MARIN: Boy.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.160
Really, it was--

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.472
I was a kid in South Central.

00:06:14.472 --> 00:06:15.930
It was a very
violent neighborhood.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.420
And there was a lot of
shootings, a lot of killings.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.090
I saw two homicides
right in front of my eyes

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.674
before I was seven years old.

00:06:24.674 --> 00:06:26.340
Kids that grow up in
that neighborhood--

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.350
it was predominantly black,
about 90%, some Mexicans,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.669
a couple of Asians, and one
lost white guy wandering--

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:36.960
ALAN SEALES: With a big camera.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.980
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.460
And it was a tough neighborhood.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.130
So there was always
that tension.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.350
So people in those
neighborhoods always

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:52.050
grew up with early onset heart
attacks, stroke, hypertension.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.140
It's tense in those
neighborhoods.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.250
So still to this day, the
sound of sirens freak me out.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.980
I look for someplace
to hide because--

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.370
ALAN SEALES: Is that why
we had to drag you out

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.850
of the green room here?

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.507
CHEECH MARIN:
That's actually why.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:05.840
ALAN SEALES: It's New York, man.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.340
Sirens.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.290
CHEECH MARIN: So we
moved from there,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.380
from South Central to
Granada Hills, which

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.437
was a suburb of the San Fernando
Valley, which was primarily

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:19.020
orange groves.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.930
It was an agricultural
neighborhood

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.890
that they were converting
to housing tracts.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.770
And so one day
everybody was black,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.000
and then the next day
everybody was white.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.480
And it was like,
how does this work?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.810
Where is the black people?

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.810
There's no black people.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.410
How come there's no
black people here?

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.070
So it was interesting
to make that change.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.749
ALAN SEALES: So in
the book, though, you

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:44.290
talk about-- you
make little comments

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.289
like what you just said.

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:49.070
There's a lot of
mentions about race.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.100
How did that affect, I
guess, who you are now

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.590
and what you brought
into your acts

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.920
later on, like the racial--

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.620
or lack of racial
diversity, I guess?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.700
CHEECH MARIN: The black
culture and neighborhoods

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.950
and aesthetic informed a
great part of what we did,

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.400
Tommy Chong and I. Because he
came from a black background,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.450
too, because he was born
in Calgary, Alberta.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.950
And he found the one black
neighborhood in Calgary.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.810
It was called Amber Valley.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.850
And his wife came from there.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.639
But he was a musician playing
R&amp;B from a very early age.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.180
ALAN SEALES: He
wrote for Diana Ross.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.940
CHEECH MARIN: He wrote for
Diana Ross and The Supremes.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:38.830
And so his musical education
was primarily R&amp;B and jazz.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.770
And my musical
education was primarily

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.610
from South Central, R&amp;B--
same thing-- then jazz.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.650
So we understood each other
really well in those terms,

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.600
in musical terms.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.680
We always viewed Cheech &amp;
Chong in terms of music.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.700
Comedy in terms of music because
it was a rhythmic thing for us.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.290
And it had a rhythm
and it had a beat.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.370
And we knew when to come
in and when to stay out.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:08.030
And so when we first came to
LA from Canada, all we played

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.750
was black clubs in LA.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.814
There was a big
network of black clubs,

00:09:13.814 --> 00:09:14.980
and they had the old format.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.130
They had a professional
emcee, who introduced

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.840
a professional comedian.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.810
And then the comedians would
introduce the floor show.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.370
And we played in
all the clubs in LA.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.830
And finally, we
made it to the top,

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.840
playing this club called
PJ's in Hollywood.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.560
It was the uptown black
club in Hollywood.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.110
And we opened for everybody.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.310
We were the house comedians.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.870
We opened for everybody--

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:44.130
Ray Charles, Carmen
McRae, The Isley Brothers,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.570
The Impressions.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.460
And one night, even
Marvin Gaye got up

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.100
and sang "What's Going On"
right when it was first out.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.690
So we were right in
the heart of that.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.300
And that always informed--
and it spilled over

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.020
into our comedy.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.630
We had a black rhythm
and a big black audience

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.227
that maintains itself to
this day in our following.

00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:02.060
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.960
We have a lot to talk
about with Cheech &amp; Chong,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.710
but I want to go back real
quick to when you were younger.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.680
That you actually were in
Catholic school in high school,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.180
right?

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:15.490
CHEECH MARIN: Yes.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.110
ALAN SEALES: And you
were an altar boy?

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.860
CHEECH MARIN: Yes.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.234
ALAN SEALES: So obviously,
the weed smoking, and the pot,

00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:22.494
and the Catholic
stuff go hand in hand.

00:10:22.494 --> 00:10:23.410
CHEECH MARIN: Exactly.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.760
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.260
CHEECH MARIN: Well,
funny thing is it did.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.770
That's the first time
I really understood

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.480
what the mass was about.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.910
I went to Easter Sunday--

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.890
I'm not kidding.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.580
I went to Easter Sunday,
high mass, candles, incense,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.520
blah blah, blah.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.400
And I smoked a little
weed before I went there.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.320
Oh, I get it.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.860
It's a multimedia experience.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.010
There was this ceremony, a
ritualistic ceremony going on,

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.000
transubstantiation,
and the priests.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.270
And everybody was dressed
in their garments.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.540
And oh, I get it.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.410
You're supposed to be
assaulted in order to create

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.250
this religious experience.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.130
ALAN SEALES: So--

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.443
Let's let that sit for a second.

00:11:09.443 --> 00:11:11.957
CHEECH MARIN: Why do
you think they have it?

00:11:11.957 --> 00:11:13.900
ALAN SEALES: In high
school, too, you

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.230
said that you were every
teacher's worst nightmare,

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.340
because you got straight A's
but were the class clown.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.600
CHEECH MARIN: I was
a pain in the ass.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.399
I was a wise-ass
that never shut up.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.690
And that was always my trouble.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.023
I was always getting in trouble.

00:11:27.023 --> 00:11:29.810
I wasn't a malicious
kid or got in trouble,

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.001
but I couldn't shut up.

00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:33.375
So I thought,
well, maybe there's

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:36.600
show business in my future.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.080
So I was always in trouble,
but I was a straight-A student.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.960
And I would fuck with them
as much as I possibly could.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.874
ALAN SEALES: What would you do?

00:11:45.874 --> 00:11:47.290
CHEECH MARIN: The
thing they don't

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.862
want you to do in Catholic
school is answer them back.

00:11:50.862 --> 00:11:53.710
That's the thing they don't
want because they teach you--

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.500
and this is the
philosophy they--

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.230
Catholic education
teaches you how to think.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.160
Just don't think that.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.540
It's like, wait a minute.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.960
How do you figure out if God
can do this, then what do you--

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.850
and they didn't
like that at all.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.010
You were supposed
to fall in line.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.350
But it was a good
liberal arts education,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.797
which I highly value.

00:12:15.797 --> 00:12:17.380
ALAN SEALES: And
most of your family--

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.554
or some of your family
went into the priesthood

00:12:19.554 --> 00:12:20.470
or went into religion?

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.261
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:25.120
I have two cousins that became
priests and another cousin that

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.650
became a nun.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.950
And I was scheduled
to go to the seminary.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.890
And I discovered girls and
went, let me get this straight--

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.590
no girls in the priesthood?

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.940
I don't think so.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.690
ALAN SEALES: And then
you went to college?

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.523
CHEECH MARIN: I did.

00:12:39.523 --> 00:12:40.840
ALAN SEALES: Went to college.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.440
And we're talking about pot.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.080
You know, a quote from the
book, "what else have they

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.920
been lying about?"

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.030
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.249
That was my first reaction
when I smoked my first joint.

00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:49.790
I don't know.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.850
I was a straight kid.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.280
And I was at a party and
somebody handed me a joint.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.670
I'm in college and took
a hit and I got high.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.730
And I looked around, wow.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.650
What else have they
been lying about?

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.860
Because this is not at all what
they've been warning me about.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.525
ALAN SEALES: And then this
was also the hippie revolution

00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:11.650
happening at the same time.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.483
You also got into
transcendental meditation?

00:13:13.483 --> 00:13:14.930
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:15.640
Very early.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.680
I was pre-Beatles.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:24.430
And that was the demarcation
there, pre-Beatles,

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.320
post-Beatles.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.630
And once again, a
girl led me into that.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.400
My girlfriend, I'm
going to go meditate.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.580
Want to come?

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.880
Sure.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.950
And I learned how to
meditate transcendentally.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.105
And I still do that to this day.

00:13:41.105 --> 00:13:42.730
ALAN SEALES: Did you
realize in college

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.275
that you were actually--

00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:45.790
that you already were a hippie?

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.930
Or did college-- you looked
around and you're like,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.450
oh, I want to be
like those guys?

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.910
CHEECH MARIN: You know, it
was a gradual transformation

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.390
because it was happening to
all of us at the same time.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.880
And I was the oldest
of the baby boomers.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.670
The baby boomers started
the year that I was born.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.661
And we started changing
because we started--

00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:05.410
it was the worst thing
that they could do,

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.640
educate all these guys.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.900
And they asked questions.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.580
And they didn't
like the answers.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.860
And so, wait a minute.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.850
What about this-- why Vietnam?

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:13.600
Where is Vietnam?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.560
What does it represent?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.520
They didn't attack us.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.320
They didn't topple
the Twin Towers.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.300
They didn't bomb
our Pearl Harbor.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.314
They didn't invade us.

00:14:21.314 --> 00:14:22.730
And I don't even
know where it is.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.500
Or why are we there?

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:29.260
And they expected everybody
to fall in lockstep conformity

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:29.760
to that.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.440
And there was a college
educated generation

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.040
with a lot of people
backing them up

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.980
that started questioning and
they didn't like the answers.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.910
ALAN SEALES: And you
were part of a movement

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.200
to actually resist the draft?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.830
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.038
It was actually called the
Draft Resistance Movement.

00:14:44.038 --> 00:14:47.710
It was headed by David
Harris, who promulgated this,

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.830
and he was married to Joan
Baez during the course of this.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.410
So they became this famous,
hippie, anti-war couple.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.010
And they traveled to campuses.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.540
And that's where I
heard David Harris speak

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.400
for the first time.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.000
And they just made
the most sense.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.570
The philosophy behind the
Draft Resistance Movement

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.070
was to not cooperate.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.900
It was if you're 18, don't
register for the draft.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.880
If you've registered
for the draft,

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.140
don't go to the physical.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.180
If you get drafted,
don't show up for--

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.200
don't be drafted.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.670
And it goes on--

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.620
to clog the bureaucracy.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.300
And that's what it did.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.370
Because traditionally
in history,

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.490
if you look back at--
especially here in New York,

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.320
any time they
institute a draft, it's

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.620
a real division among society.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.380
Because sometimes you can
pay to get out of the draft.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.960
Sometimes you can do crazy
things to get out of the draft.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.380
But it's like-- because they
can arbitrarily grab you,

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.540
put you in the army,
and you can get killed.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.840
And it tends to change people's
thinking at that point.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.780
It's not some vague
philosophical concept.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.980
You know, they can grab
you, send you thousands

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.310
of miles away into the jungle.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.950
Why am I here?

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.620
Boink.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.300
And it made everybody think.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.050
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.720
And what did you do to
your draft card, though?

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.930
CHEECH MARIN: Well, first, I
got it signed by Muhammad Ali.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.895
We went to this big
anti-war demonstration

00:16:09.895 --> 00:16:12.000
in Century City in Los Angeles.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.750
It was the big one.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.855
President Johnson
was the guy and he

00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:17.740
was speaking in Century City.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.970
And there was this big anti-war
draft rally in Rancho Park

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:22.990
right next to it.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.080
And so Muhammad Ali shows up.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.470
And he had just won the world
heavyweight championship

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.820
beating Sonny Liston,
the unbeatable.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.950
And he was this young guy.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.020
And at the same time, he
came out as a black Muslim.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.180
He was already, but
he hadn't announced it

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.990
until he won the championship.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.950
And he shows up.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.940
And he was the most physically
impressive human being

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.950
I've ever seen.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.620
And he's big.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.990
He's like 6' 4",
somewhere around there.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.704
And he was young.

00:16:52.704 --> 00:16:53.745
And he was like chiseled.

00:16:53.745 --> 00:16:55.460
He was really good looking.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.450
Even in a black suit with a
bow tie, this guy was a star.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.700
You could tell.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.900
He was extremely charismatic,
extremely accessible.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.960
And he started
giving his speech.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.540
And then after,
everybody crowded around

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.859
and he was signing autographs.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.170
So I handed him my draft card.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:13.980
"M. Ali."

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.900
Real legible, too.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.140
And so then I took that draft
card and I turned it in.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.800
And it went on a
collage that accompanied

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.900
David Harris and Joan
Baez on a speaking

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.040
tour around the country.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.289
And you could actually see it.

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:29.220
It was on the cover of
"Newsweek" magazine.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.330
And if you looked
at the collage,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.496
then right in the corner
you could see my draft card

00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:34.500
with M. Ali on it.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.170
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.900
You ripped up your
draft card, though.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.570
CHEECH MARIN: Well, that--

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.660
ALAN SEALES: Because
that prompted the escape?

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.670
CHEECH MARIN: No.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.550
I ripped up my registration
card not my actual draft card.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.550
Because there was an
actual turn-in day

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.850
you turned in your draft card.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:58.110
And the director of the draft
at that time, General Hershey,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.040
issued this directive that
anybody who protested,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.260
caused commotion at
the draft center,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.060
burned their draft card--

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.650
I did all those things--

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.940
and they would immediately
be reclassified from their 2S

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.940
student deferment to 1A,
would be drafted and sent

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.202
to the front lines in Vietnam.

00:18:16.202 --> 00:18:16.910
That was his fix.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.200
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.520
CHEECH MARIN: Everybody
thought it was bullshit

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.740
and it would be overturned.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.630
It was basic First Amendment.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.970
And it was eventually
overturned.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.000
It went to the Court of Appeals.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.600
But you're going to spend three
years, maybe four in the can.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.520
They were sentencing
the draft resisters

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.470
to eight years in
Leavenworth at that time.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.150
Coincidentally, in my
last semester in school,

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.280
I discovered pottery.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.387
I took a pottery class.

00:18:46.387 --> 00:18:48.095
The last semester in
school, you always--

00:18:48.095 --> 00:18:49.690
ALAN SEALES: Which
is also for a girl?

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:49.960
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.918
It was also for a girl.

00:18:50.918 --> 00:18:53.727
It's always for a girl.

00:18:53.727 --> 00:18:55.810
I took all the classes
that I had been putting off

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:56.490
for four years.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.850
You know, Econ
101, and all that.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.872
I only had one spot left over.

00:19:01.872 --> 00:19:03.330
And there was this
really cute girl

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.267
that I had a class
with previously.

00:19:05.267 --> 00:19:06.850
And I says, well,
what are you taking?

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.058
She says, I'm taking pottery.

00:19:08.058 --> 00:19:09.300
You should take it with me.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.460
I should take it with you.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.240
And so I started making pottery.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.520
And as soon as my hands
touched that clay,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.555
and I centered my
first wad of clay--

00:19:19.555 --> 00:19:21.050
[HUMS]

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.260
It was like a tuning
fork went off,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:28.850
and my Mexican genes
came busting out.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:29.975
Hey, homes, where you been?

00:19:29.975 --> 00:19:31.100
We've been waiting for you.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.615
Come on.

00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:32.490
Let's make some pots.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.410
And it changed my life.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.430
Really, it changed my life.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.420
I quit my job.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.120
I quit my classes.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.710
I got a $900 NEDA loan, and
I made pottery from sunup

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.550
to sundown.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.580
So at the same time, the draft
was kind of hovering over me.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.150
And my pottery teacher, who
kind of knew of my predicament,

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.750
he said, I have
this ex-student that

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.550
has a pottery up in Canada.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.920
And he's very famous, and
he just won the Bicentennial

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.820
Exhibition Award.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.782
He's a big deal.

00:20:06.782 --> 00:20:09.240
I'm going to write him and see
if you can be his assistant.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.614
I didn't even wait
for an answer.

00:20:10.614 --> 00:20:12.600
I got on the
Greyhound-- and boom.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.470
Next thing, I was in Calgary
and working for this man named

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.559
Ed Drahanchuk.

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:19.100
It was great.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.890
ALAN SEALES: And you were
out in the middle of nowhere?

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:21.806
CHEECH MARIN: Nowhere.

00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:22.637
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:20:22.637 --> 00:20:24.720
I forget what you said in
the book, the statistic.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.178
It was the first
winter they've had

00:20:26.178 --> 00:20:29.510
in like 80 years where a whole
week was below 60 degrees--

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.410
negative 60 degrees.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.451
CHEECH MARIN: Just about.

00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:34.750
It was the coldest winter
in 80 years in Calgary.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:39.290
And the high in
January was 20 below.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.120
It was always 40 below.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.080
They got into 50.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.594
And then one night, 75 below.

00:20:43.594 --> 00:20:46.010
ALAN SEALES: And there was no
running water in your cabin?

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.900
CHEECH MARIN: Nothing.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.020
You had to go to
the river every day

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:56.140
with my little wagon
with my 20-gallon jug.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.430
Go to the river and get water
and then chop wood every day.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.290
And I was from South Central.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.540
I had never seen
snow in my life,

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.300
much less go to the river
for my water and chop wood.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.790
And there was a lot
of wildlife around.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.469
There was a lot of bears around.

00:21:14.469 --> 00:21:16.010
And I lived in this
little log cabin.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.110
It had electricity,
but that's it--

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.660
and a potbelly stove
and an outhouse.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.950
And so I'd always try
to take a crap at work.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.342
They had a flush toilet.

00:21:26.342 --> 00:21:27.800
Because in the
middle of the night,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.260
you got to go out to this
outhouse at 40 below,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.860
sit on a wooden toilet
seat with bears around.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.020
And I had a shotgun.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.200
I had a shotgun I would
take with me every time.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.730
It's a little hard to relax--

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:41.150
ALAN SEALES: You left
that bit out of the book.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.730
CHEECH MARIN: --in
that situation.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.400
I just want to dump
and get out of there.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.764
Welcome to the wilderness.

00:21:49.764 --> 00:21:51.680
ALAN SEALES: I know I
keep talking about this.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.630
I'll move on, but I find
it just fascinating.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:57.160
You've told a story, too,
about shooting-- what was it--

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.030
a moose in the middle
of that lake, and then

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.650
having to chop it up with--

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.637
or chop it up with a chainsaw
to take it out of the lake.

00:22:03.637 --> 00:22:05.720
CHEECH MARIN: The guy I
worked for, Ed Drahanchuk,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.970
he was of Ukrainian descent.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.630
He was a hunter, avid hunter,
went hunting all the time.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.766
And he was this great potter.

00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:15.140
I'd never fired
a gun in my life,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.660
even though my father was a
policeman for 30 years, LAPD.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.960
And so he said, come on.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.600
We're going to go hunting.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.280
I'm going to show
you how to hunt.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.420
OK, great.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.267
And we'd go hunting.

00:22:25.267 --> 00:22:26.850
He says, there's a
moose in this area.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:27.890
I know there is.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.130
I heard that there was.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.620
So we went hunting this moose.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.770
And we worked all day
trying to find him.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.720
Almost to dark and
we find this moose.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.469
It was standing in the
middle of a muskeg.

00:22:37.469 --> 00:22:40.370
A muskeg is like a little,
shallow, frozen lake

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.500
with a big crust of ice on it.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.320
And so he says, all right.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.450
You go to the other
end of the lake

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.550
and try to scare him towards me.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.680
When he comes out,
I'll shoot him.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.090
OK.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.110
What do you want me
to do, make faces?

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.390
And so I went out.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.520
And I tried to hey,
come on, moose.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.906
Because I didn't want
him to charge me.

00:23:02.906 --> 00:23:04.280
And so after a
while, he wasn't--

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.660
[CHOMPING]

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.466
And he stood there in
the middle of this lake.

00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:10.969
It's not working.

00:23:10.969 --> 00:23:12.260
So Ed signaled me to come back.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:12.960
And I came back.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.520
And then it's starting to get
dark and there's bears out.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.756
I get a little nervous.

00:23:17.756 --> 00:23:19.880
And so he says, well, I'm
going to have to drop him

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.960
right here, which he did.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.390
He shot this-- moose
goes [CRASHING SOUND].

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.030
OK, let's go get him.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.470
And the moose
weighs 1,500 pounds,

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.237
so we both grabbed a leg.

00:23:34.237 --> 00:23:35.570
We have to go back to the truck.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.520
Yeah, let's get out of here
because this ain't working.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.020
No, no.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.320
We got to go get the saw.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.340
And he goes back.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.650
He has a little chainsaw.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:47.150
We had to go back and cut
this moose into four quarters.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.670
And then pick it up, hook
it up to like a plow.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.900
What do they call those?

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.610
We were in yoke, you know?

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.370
And we hooked it up and
dragged these quarters out.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.630
They were frozen.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.120
And you're going through this
like crunch, crunch, crunch,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:02.840
crunch.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.790
And now it's dark.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:10.074
But we got him out, and so had
moose meat for a long time.

00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:11.990
ALAN SEALES: So then
fast forward a little bit

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.787
to getting to Vancouver and
you get to meet Tommy Chong.

00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:15.620
What happened there?

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.340
How did you meet him?

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.400
And what was that like?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.310
CHEECH MARIN: Well, eventually,
I made it to Vancouver.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:25.970
And I was delivering carpets and
writing for this rock and roll

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.030
magazine called "Pop," and
it was a music scene magazine

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.690
in Vancouver.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.830
And the editor said, you
know, I got this guy I know.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.040
You should meet him.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.040
He's running this real weird
kind of thing in Chinatown.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.240
What kind of thing?

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.150
Is it an opium den with girls?

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:44.960
No.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.550
He says, he's running an
improvisational theater company

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.300
in a topless bar
in like the worst

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.800
part of town-- in junkie,
wino-ville, Skid Row downtown

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.520
Vancouver.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.230
I says, well, some of
it sounds intriguing.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:09.240
And so he had me meet Tommy
out in this farmhouse.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.464
And Tommy Chong at that
time had really long hair

00:25:12.464 --> 00:25:13.880
for the day-- it
was really long--

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:20.120
and a scraggly beard and leather
pants and a jailhouse tattoo.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.860
And he's half-Chinese
and half-English Irish.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.410
And he looked at me
and I looked at him.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:29.030
We both had the same thought,
what in the hell are you?

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.660
Are you Mongolian?

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.680
Biker?

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.480
Because he had never
seen a Mexican before.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.850
And he's thinking the same.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.800
Are you Filipino?

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.090
And so we got together.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.390
And he was running this--

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.950
he was with Motown
with Bobby Taylor

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.620
and The Vancouvers, his group
that he wrote the hit song for.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.820
And during that period
of traveling around,

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.450
he had seen
improvisational theater.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.870
He'd seen Second City
and The Committee.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.400
And he got intrigued.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.920
And even though he never
said a word on stage,

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.154
he just played
guitar, he decided

00:26:03.154 --> 00:26:04.820
after he split with
the band that that's

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.720
what he wanted to do.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.650
ALAN SEALES: Was improv?

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:07.525
CHEECH MARIN: Improv.

00:26:07.525 --> 00:26:11.180
And he had a venue when
he got back to Vancouver.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.920
His parents had
turned his last club

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.570
into Vancouver's
first topless club.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:18.782
And so he had this idea.

00:26:18.782 --> 00:26:20.990
And he was working the lights
when he first got back,

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.680
just to have something to do.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.760
And he kept seeing these girls
come in that were the dancers.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.260
And they were so sexy in their
bell-bottom, low-cut jeans

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.519
and their crop tops.

00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:34.310
But once they got into
their stripper gear,

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.720
they weren't so sexy.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.409
And the guys wouldn't
even look at them.

00:26:37.409 --> 00:26:38.450
They were there to drink.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.511
And it was like a tough crowd--
loggers, bikers, prostitutes,

00:26:42.511 --> 00:26:43.010
pimps.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.340
Because it was hooker central,
and they ran their office out

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.279
of the club--

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:51.320
ALAN SEALES: Like you do.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.820
CHEECH MARIN: Johns and liquor.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.530
It worked really well.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.700
And so he had this
bright idea that he

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.230
would have the girls
start off fully clothed

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.810
and be involved in some
kind of little skit.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.410
You know, like jokes
out of "Playboy."

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.410
Guy walks in.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.320
And he found that
during the course

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.160
of the skit, that the
girls would start to strip,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.950
the audience was intrigued.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.450
Because before when
the girls would

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.590
stand dancing
naked on the stage,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.090
the guys wouldn't
even look at them.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.580
They were like, [GRUMBLING].

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.020
And once the voyeuristic
element of it--

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.430
like the girls [MUMBLING].

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.070
You could hear a pin
drop in the place.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.600
And so he says,
I'm onto something.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.420
So he started writing
these little skits.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.160
And he had a couple-- there
was four topless dancers,

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.350
a mime artist--

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.770
I swear to God--

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.686
full white face.

00:27:53.686 --> 00:27:55.170
ALAN SEALES: Did the mime strip?

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.260
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.350
At the strip bar.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.000
No, he didn't.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.180
But--

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:58.850
ALAN SEALES: Oh, OK.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.308
CHEECH MARIN: --we'd
like to do it.

00:28:00.308 --> 00:28:02.980
A mime artist, a
classical guitarist,

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.726
and four topless
girls, and then me

00:28:04.726 --> 00:28:07.690
and Tommy and a couple other
guys for this audience that

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.410
didn't want to see us.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.060
They didn't want to see
long-haired guys talking

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.560
to them.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.090
They wanted to see naked girls.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.960
It was fabulous.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.921
ALAN SEALES: You said you ended
up inventing hippie burlesque?

00:28:21.921 --> 00:28:23.420
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah,
that's basically

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:28.970
what it was, because it was
strippers with comedians.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.860
And that's classic burlesque.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.320
That's where all the
old-style comedians--

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.870
Phil Silvers and
all those guys--

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:36.730
came out of.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.220
And so we started doing it
but for the hippie generation.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.595
And we started
taking things that

00:28:40.595 --> 00:28:42.260
were happening on the street.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.500
I got hired as a
writer, primarily.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.670
And so I go, I can
write for this stuff.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.130
I know what I'm
talking about here.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:54.350
And so I started writing skits
for them and then filling

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.690
in whenever anybody didn't--

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:57.920
and so we kept this.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.950
And it was great.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:59.950
I mean, it was fabulous.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.390
We did four hours of
improv six nights a week.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.310
So when we came
out of there, man.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.520
We had chops a go-go.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.790
We had a lot of stage experience
with a very hostile audience.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.030
They tried to beat
us up all the time.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.510
The guys would get drunk.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.740
What the hell is this?

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.600
And they'd climb on
stage and try to kill us.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.050
Luckily, Tommy had
his brother, Stan,

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.170
who was actually a
killer, and his buddies.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.130
And they stood at
the end of the stage.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:36.560
And Stan was such a thug.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.500
I'll give you a story.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.630
He kept complaining
his knuckle hurt.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.010
My knuckle hurts.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.070
[MUMBLING] And he kept
bitching and bitching.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.920
Tommy says, why don't
you go to the doctor?

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.711
Get it checked out.

00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:48.810
I'll pay for it.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.000
And so OK.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.182
He goes to the doctor.

00:29:51.182 --> 00:29:52.640
The doctor examines
and says, well,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.430
you have a tooth in
your knuckle here.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.850
He had smacked some guy
and the tooth was still

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.170
in his knuckle a week later.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.300
So that was kind of the milieu.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.545
If a strip club can have
a milieu, that was it.

00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:09.920
ALAN SEALES: And
so at this time,

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.490
you were still
Richard and Tommy.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.030
When did Cheech &amp; Chong develop?

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.960
When did that happen?

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.400
CHEECH MARIN: After
our very first gig.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.370
Because we were both
musicians all our life

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.010
and singers and guitar players.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.860
And after the troop broke up--
because the rest of the troop

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.270
wanted to go to the hills
to get their heads together.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.686
That's what you
did in those days.

00:30:28.686 --> 00:30:31.240
And we had been to the hills
and our head was together.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.290
Our pocketbook wasn't together.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.790
And so we wanted
to form this group.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.540
I said, look, we'll form a
band, and we'll do music,

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.824
and we'll do skits.

00:30:39.824 --> 00:30:40.490
You're a singer.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:41.330
I'm a guitar player.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:45.260
We'll do skits that we've
been developing and music.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.792
And maybe we can
play Vegas one day.

00:30:47.792 --> 00:30:48.450
Wow.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.690
That's great.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.580
And so we started.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.610
Our first gig was a battle
of the bands at The Gardens

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.040
Auditorium in Vancouver.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.570
And we got up and the band
was on there ready to play.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.860
And we came out and
started doing skits.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.100
And it was really
amazing because this

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:12.660
was a young hippie audience,
or hippie-esque audience.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.450
And they had never
seen us before.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.727
They weren't going to
come down to that club.

00:31:16.727 --> 00:31:18.560
There was no way they
were getting anybody--

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.000
and that audience was going
to come down to that club

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.960
and see us.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.970
So we were really new to them.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:24.950
And they were intrigued.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.520
We were speaking to them, only
they had never heard us before.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.970
We were them.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.430
And so they were intrigued.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.830
And they jammed to
the front of the stage

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.240
and they gathered around.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.600
They went nuts.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.101
And we won the battle of the
bands without playing a note.

00:31:40.101 --> 00:31:42.350
ALAN SEALES: And the rest
of the bands just sat there.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.350
CHEECH MARIN: OK.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.150
Now?

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.460
OK.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.440
And so we won.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.320
And so the guitar
player asked us,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.630
so when's our next gig, boss?

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.090
I don't know if there's
going to be a next gig.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.020
And so we realized
that we were a duo.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.690
We could make it as a duo.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.220
So on the way home
that night we were

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.120
in Papa Chong's
car, Tommy's Dad,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.790
and it rains in
Vancouver all the time.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.000
His car didn't have
windshield wipers that worked.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.350
It had windshield wipers.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.230
They didn't work.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.510
He had a wire coat
hanger straightened out

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.720
and it went out of the car
and attached to the wiper.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:28.660
And you-- manually by hand.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.910
And we're trying
to think of a name.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.620
And we're going over
the Georgia Viaduct

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.060
Bridge, which was condemned.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.046
There's a big sign,
proceed at your own risk.

00:32:37.046 --> 00:32:37.670
It's condemned.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:41.190
We're going to get it,
but we don't know when.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.690
OK.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.665
So like, hey.

00:32:42.665 --> 00:32:43.790
We're going to be big, man.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:44.620
You hear that reaction?

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.828
Yeah, we're going to be good.

00:32:45.828 --> 00:32:47.030
We need a new name.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.110
Because it was billed as Tommy
Chong and the Shanghai Junk,

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:55.160
because he had always been in
groups where his name was--

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.530
he was Little Daddy
and The Bachelors.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.405
He was the bachelor.

00:32:58.405 --> 00:33:00.030
He was Bobby Taylor
and The Vancouvers.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.220
He was a Vancouver.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.710
And he said, the
next thing I'm in I'm

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:08.100
going to have my name in it
so they can't replace me.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:08.907
Smart.

00:33:08.907 --> 00:33:10.240
ALAN SEALES: That's a good plan.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:10.760
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.968
And so I said, yeah, me, too.

00:33:11.968 --> 00:33:13.910
I don't want to get replaced.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.840
Richard and Tommy?

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.740
Nah.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.640
Marin and Chong.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.620
Chong and Marin.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.120
No.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.170
And so he says, do
you have a nickname?

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.010
I says, well, Cheech
is my nickname.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.440
It's short for chicharron.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:30.260
And he said-- all
the Mexicans laugh.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.055
And he says, Cheech?

00:33:32.055 --> 00:33:32.640
Cheech.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.024
Cheech and Chong.

00:33:34.024 --> 00:33:35.780
Cheech and Chong.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.670
And that was it.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:39.140
Because we were
musicians, we recognized

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.330
that that name scanned.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.720
There was a beat to it.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.842
If you said Chong
and Cheech, it--

00:33:44.842 --> 00:33:46.550
ALAN SEALES: It doesn't
roll out as well.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:49.070
CHEECH MARIN: It's
4 or 4 and 1/2 time,

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.470
and you just want it to be 4, 4.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.899
It was always Cheech and Chong.

00:33:52.899 --> 00:33:53.690
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:57.500
So how much of your act--

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.210
I guess how much of
your material, which

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.460
has to do a lot with the
pot-smoking characters

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.840
and whatnot, how much of that
is actually the two of you

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.111
normally versus your
own personal advocacy?

00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:11.360
CHEECH MARIN: Well, Tommy
used to say that that was us

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.950
when our wives weren't around.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:17.449
And pretty much, it was true.

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:20.170
We were reflecting what we
saw on the streets and all

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.639
the characters we
were running into.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.520
We didn't smoke a
whole lot of dope,

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.199
as much as anybody in that era.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:34.580
But we were hard working trying
to get this act together.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.900
And that's all we
worked on all the time.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.570
And so it was like--

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:42.139
but we came up with
these personas.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.050
And not even the
Cheech character

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.800
was fully formed in
Vancouver because they

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.440
didn't have a lot of
low-riders in Vancouver.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.620
So it wasn't until we
got back to the States.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.889
And so we decided, well, if
we're going to make it big,

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:59.340
we've got to go to
either New York or LA.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.450
And I says, I heard
it snows in New York,

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.920
so I'm not going there
because I've had enough snow.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.790
I was from LA,
and I knew people.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.410
The fly in the ointment was
that I was wanted by the FBI.

00:35:13.172 --> 00:35:14.630
ALAN SEALES: For
the draft dodging?

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.470
CHEECH MARIN: For
the draft dodging.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.024
It was draft resistance.

00:35:19.024 --> 00:35:19.940
They knew I was there.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.210
I wasn't dodging anybody.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.160
And it's funny.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.830
Because it was in the
days before computers,

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.910
so their information system's
flow, whatever that's called,

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.320
was non-existent.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.670
And so I got in.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:39.440
I was wanted, but I got in using
a phony ID of my friend Bill

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.380
Knorr with his picture on it.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.060
I presented it to the guard.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.080
Hey, that's me.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:45.900
It looks brown.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.400
Brown.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.360
OK, go ahead.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.540
And I came back to the US.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.262
Although, I was wanted for
a long time when I was back.

00:35:54.262 --> 00:35:54.970
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:56.386
CHEECH MARIN: And
Tommy thought it

00:35:56.386 --> 00:35:59.425
was really funny if he mentioned
that all the time on stage.

00:35:59.425 --> 00:36:00.800
ALAN SEALES: He
kept pointing out

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.755
that you were here illegally?

00:36:01.755 --> 00:36:01.971
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:36:01.971 --> 00:36:03.240
Hey, he's wanted by the FBI.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.260
I said, will you shut
the fuck up, man?

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.740
That shit ain't funny.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.110
ALAN SEALES: So you
came back to LA.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.410
You guys were not
really a comedy act,

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:14.120
not really a musical
act, but then you

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.759
got signed to a record label.

00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:16.550
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.630
ALAN SEALES: And were the first
comedians on FM radio, yeah?

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.890
CHEECH MARIN: Pretty much.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:24.290
I mean, it was like
everything was in flux.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:28.250
There was huge changes
going on in the country,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.730
and things that
were nontraditional

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.931
could find root and grow.

00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:35.930
And we were one of them.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.790
And we'd go around and we'd
hunt for gigs all the time.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.500
And we only had one
goal every day--

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.430
was to somehow get
our hands on $1.50.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.910
And for $1.50, we could
make some Chinese meal--

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.940
rice and beef and
greens or something.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.720
And we could eat and not starve.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.330
Always walking around, we'd
walk around neighborhoods

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.630
and look for clubs or anything.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.280
Anything.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.360
They have a school here.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.940
We can perform in the
quadrangle just to be on stage--

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.840
and mostly black clubs.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.030
And it was really, really great.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:18.590
We had a giant audience
in the black neighborhood.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.880
But on the off-hours, we'd
play these white clubs

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.970
that didn't pay money.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.260
But it was exposure.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:29.660
So eventually, we got discovered
at the Troubadour, which is

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.870
the club of note in that day.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.080
That whole singer/songwriter,
Eagles, Linda Ronstadt,

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.720
JD Souther, they were all there,
and they got discovered there.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.980
And so we started playing these
hoot nights on Monday, open mic

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.370
night, basically.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.400
And we started attracting
an audience and a following.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.850
And then one night,
although the thing

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.720
was set up for these producers
at Warner Brothers Records,

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.170
Lou Adler, this famous record
producer, was in the audience.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.740
Coincidentally, Lou Adler
had grown up in East LA,

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.030
and he knew about Chicano
low-rider culture.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:09.090
And he immediately recognized
what we were doing.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:12.480
And he sent word through
this girl that said,

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.090
Lou Adler saw you and he
wants you to give him a call.

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.220
And Tommy had no idea
who Lou Adler was.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.970
I mean, he was the
biggest record producer

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.450
in the world at the time.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:25.510
He had produced Sam Cook,
Johnny Rivers, Spirit,

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:30.580
The Mamas and Papas,
founded Monterey Pop.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:35.690
And he was just about to release
"Tapestry" by Carole King.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.650
He was a big deal.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.350
So we called him up.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.490
We went to his
office the next day.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:43.320
And he looked at us.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.532
He says, well, what
do you want to do?

00:38:45.532 --> 00:38:47.240
And we looked around
his office, and it's

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.410
covered in gold records.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.050
It was gold records everywhere.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.010
And I says, well,
I'll make a record.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.260
We want to make a record.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.810
Well, what kind?

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.310
Gold.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.910
Seems to me that's
what you make,

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.860
so we would like to
make a gold record.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.820
And so he signed us to a deal.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:10.520
Not much money, but enough
to keep us off of starvation.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.130
And so we started working
on how to convert what we

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.850
were doing onstage to record.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:19.220
And we had no idea how
to do that because we

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.330
were a visual act.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.690
And so through a process
that we invented ourselves,

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:30.140
we realized that you had to
make things that sounded funny.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.570
Not that looked funny,
but that sounded funny

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.010
because they had to
translate by ear.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:39.920
And you quickly learned that
some knife sounds funnier

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.750
than others.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:45.270
Because we did all
our own sound effects.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.720
And so we started this
process in the studio.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.760
And unlike our
contemporaries, like

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.700
Richard Pryor, or Lily Tomlin,
or George Carlin, or Steve

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.690
Martin, whose record act
consisted of a live recording

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.060
of their stage act.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.150
It was a soundtrack.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.400
You'd hear everybody laughing.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.580
You knew when to laugh.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:07.190
We started creating these scenes
in the studio with characters

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:09.434
with a lot of sound effects
and a lot of atmosphere

00:40:09.434 --> 00:40:11.350
because we were influenced
by other people who

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.180
came before us--

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.530
notably Ken Nordine,
this guy that

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.220
came out in the early '60s.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:23.380
And we started creating these
things, and they took hold.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.000
And when they got
released, it was

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.150
perfect for the
album-listening generation

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.240
because albums were starting
to be the big thing.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.350
It was the big
explosion of albums.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:34.960
And the kids wanted albums.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.080
And FM radio was the
only place that you

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.900
could go to hear albums.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:44.000
It wasn't Top 40-- yummy, yummy,
yummy, I got love in my tummy.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.900
You know, it was like
[MIMICS WHOOSHING SOUND].

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.842
These weird sounds.

00:40:49.842 --> 00:40:51.550
You could get away
with it because people

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:55.720
listened with headphones, and
so we catered to that audience.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.940
There's a lot of
panning of jet planes

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.100
through the middle of your
head and out the thing.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.080
And guns-- whatever it was.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.380
But we played to that.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.444
And it exploded on FM radio.

00:41:07.444 --> 00:41:08.860
ALAN SEALES: Wow
So we're actually

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.985
a little bit short on time.

00:41:09.985 --> 00:41:13.030
If anybody has questions,
step up to the mics here.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.900
But you basically said that
you went from pretty much being

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.450
dirt broke to having
over $1 million

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:23.410
in checks sitting on your
counter without a bank account

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.720
to put them in, by the
way, within 6 months.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.674
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:41:27.674 --> 00:41:29.590
ALAN SEALES: You were
on tour that whole time?

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.131
CHEECH MARIN: We
were always on tour.

00:41:31.131 --> 00:41:34.900
We used to do over 300 nights
a year for eight years,

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.610
like always on the road.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:39.460
And the only way we got off
the road is if one of us

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.824
needed an operation
for something.

00:41:42.824 --> 00:41:43.990
We used to call it dry dock.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:45.323
We're going to go into dry dock.

00:41:45.323 --> 00:41:46.390
Tommy needs some teeth.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.842
I need a knee.

00:41:48.842 --> 00:41:50.050
Really, that's what happened.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.610
So we'd go to dry dock.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:53.837
And then-- [HEAVY BREATHING].

00:41:53.837 --> 00:41:54.670
I remember it like--

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.586
the first time we ever
went on a big tour, one

00:41:56.586 --> 00:41:58.900
of the first records, we
went on for three months

00:41:58.900 --> 00:41:59.780
and never came back.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.785
It was just two guys.

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:04.850
We went all the way across the
country, landed in Montreal,

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.630
went to England,
did some time there.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.380
Landed back in the
East and worked our way

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.560
all the way back.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.590
And I got home and all I wanted
to do is sit in my living room

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.421
and make it stop.

00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:17.920
Stop.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.540
This world is going too fast.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.120
It was like I just want to
stay and look out the window.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.700
And my girlfriend at the time
could not-- because I was home.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.120
Let's go out.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.800
Let's go to dinner.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.508
Let's go to this.

00:42:26.508 --> 00:42:29.450
Shut up.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.690
And then finally, it did.

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:33.490
And then we would start it--

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:37.390
in a week, we would start
again on a three-month tour.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:41.650
But the point you brought up
is we would get these checks.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:42.850
Our album was selling.

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:43.810
It was a big deal.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:48.910
It started selling, and we would
get a check for like $800,000.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:49.671
And the next day--

00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:51.670
ALAN SEALES: This is the
'70s, so that was still

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:52.150
a lot of money.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.900
I mean, it's a lot
of money anyways.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.483
CHEECH MARIN: That
was the early '70s,

00:42:54.483 --> 00:42:57.190
and it was a whole lot of money.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:01.100
And then the next day we'd get
another check for $700,000.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.001
And we kept getting--

00:43:02.001 --> 00:43:02.500
wow.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.730
We didn't know
what to do with it.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.080
Neither one of us had a car.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.420
Really, had no car
or a house because we

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.450
didn't need a car on the road.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.920
So finally, we got
time enough to rent

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.250
a better apartment or house.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.990
And I kept going on
like that for years.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.310
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.044
So the movies started to happen.

00:43:26.044 --> 00:43:28.210
Because you went from radio
to movies, which I think

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.610
is probably when
I would describe

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:33.309
a more realistic
conflict started coming

00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:34.350
in between you and Tommy.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:35.600
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.260
Movies is an
interesting phenomenon--

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:43.990
and the people that work in it--
because it's a dream factory,

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:45.130
and it's myth-making.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.860
And the people that
make the movies

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.430
get involved in this
myth of the movies

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:53.500
and their larger-than-life
characters,

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.040
and it inflates the
worst parts of you.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.540
And you can be a megalomaniac
or a humble saint

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:05.440
within two seconds of each
other, and it kept fluxing.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.750
And so there was
always a conversation,

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.850
a contentious conversation,
between Tommy and I

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.460
because we were very strong
personalities-- and two

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.080
of them.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.000
But it was the irritant
that produced the pearl.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.190
And we always worked it out.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.410
But as the movies went on, there
was a real division of chores

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.910
there.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.118
There's going to be one
person that was the director,

00:44:27.118 --> 00:44:30.910
one person is going to be the
writer, one person did that.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.990
As we went along and
got more success,

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.560
Tommy wanted to be everything.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.530
He wanted to be the
director or the sole writer.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:40.030
I said, I just come in?

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:41.710
I say your lines?

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.870
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.000
And so that tension kept
building and building

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.472
until we-- he didn't
want me to write anymore.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:55.990
So we had worked our
way over to we were

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:59.659
living in Paris at the time.

00:44:59.659 --> 00:45:00.700
I lived there for a year.

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.590
He lived there for three years.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:06.232
And the last movie came out,
"The Corsican Brothers."

00:45:06.232 --> 00:45:07.690
And he stayed in
Paris and I came--

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.210
my marriage was falling apart.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.774
And I just didn't want to
do what we were doing .

00:45:12.774 --> 00:45:14.440
I didn't want to argue
with him anymore.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.106
I didn't want to fight
with him anymore.

00:45:16.106 --> 00:45:18.130
And I come back to LA.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:23.650
And I sat there and smoked dope
and played guitar for as long

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.832
as I could.

00:45:24.832 --> 00:45:26.290
And then I was
watching TV one day,

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.390
and then this
phenomenon happened.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.120
It was MTV.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.950
And it took over music.

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:36.230
And everybody watched
MTV 24 hours a day.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.870
And it was videos.

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:41.800
And I realized that
this is perfect for us.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.940
We were filmmakers.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.990
We were musicians.

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:45.170
We were comedians.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.115
And we could make
these funny videos.

00:45:47.115 --> 00:45:49.240
We could put them all
together, have a video album.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.000
It would be great.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.208
We could take over the world.

00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:56.530
And I called Tommy in Paris
and I said, I got this deal.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.310
We can do this.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.630
And he wasn't interested.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.049
He said, well-- I told him.

00:46:02.049 --> 00:46:02.590
I said, yeah.

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.710
We Have MTV over here in France.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:06.580
You're into video.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.200
I'm into film.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.150
Kiss my ass, mother fucker.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.080
What the fuck, man?

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.920
Look, I got this deal.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.754
And let's come over.

00:46:16.754 --> 00:46:17.336
You come over.

00:46:17.336 --> 00:46:19.620
He says, well, I'll come
over and do a couple of them.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.800
So one of the
ones-- so I'm trying

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.380
to write these other
songs and videos.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.150
And I needed one more.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.790
And I was at my kitchen
table in the morning,

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.400
and I was having a cup of
coffee, reading the paper,

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.680
and the music was playing.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.120
And I was reading this
article about this young kid,

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.850
Chicano kid in LA who was
like 12, 13-- around there.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:42.950
And he was mentally
retarded and he

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.410
couldn't communicate
to the-- he got

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:46.940
caught in an immigration raid.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.950
And he couldn't
communicate to the officers

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:53.660
that he was an American
citizen, and they deported him

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:54.680
to Mexico.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.050
And his parents
didn't know where

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.970
he was for almost two months.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.220
And they just dumped him
on the streets of Tijuana

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.460
and that was it.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.590
And I started-- and Bruce
Springsteen's song comes on,

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.550
that song, "Born in the USA."

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.070
I kept saying born in East LA.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:14.300
And that was it.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.290
That was the last song.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:21.177
So I wrote the song, and
we're going to record it.

00:47:21.177 --> 00:47:22.010
We're in the studio.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:25.310
And I almost had finished it,
but the middle section, which

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:28.127
was for two guys
improving back and forth--

00:47:28.127 --> 00:47:28.960
which was our forte.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.300
That's how we always
did everything--

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.870
was for Tommy and I. And
he wasn't in the studio.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:36.920
And I waited and wait.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.070
It was almost 9 o'clock.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.780
I go, what's wrong with him?

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.010
So I picked up the phone,
called him, and he was home.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.350
Tommy, did you forget we had
this radio recording date?

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:47.120
He says, no.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.650
You do it, man.

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:49.150
What?

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.730
No, no, man.

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:51.188
We've got to do
the middle section.

00:47:51.188 --> 00:47:51.700
He says, no.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.325
It's your song.

00:47:52.325 --> 00:47:53.260
You do it.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.780
I said, come on, man.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.910
The thing's for us.

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:56.670
And he says, no.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:57.385
You do it.

00:47:57.385 --> 00:47:58.700
It's your thing.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.930
So you're not coming in?

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:04.070
No, you do it.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.490
And I was really sad.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:09.040
I was really sad, because I
had always been there for him.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.840
And the first time I asked him
to be there for me, and he--

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.260
because it was a tug.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.499
It was a battle.

00:48:16.499 --> 00:48:18.290
ALAN SEALES: So was
that the definitive end

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.570
of Cheech &amp; Chong right
there, I would say?

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.040
CHEECH MARIN: Pretty much.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.630
What happened-- and you got
to be careful what you do--

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.810
is I went and I
recorded the song.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:29.390
I played both parts.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.330
The song came out, and
the video came out.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:35.200
And he wasn't in the song,
so he wasn't in the video.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.920
And both became really big hits.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.120
They were a number 1 song
and a number 1 video.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.600
And the head of the studio
in Columbia, Frank Price,

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.300
got turned onto the
video by Irving Azoff,

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.740
who was a record producer.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.240
And he called me,
and we had already

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.239
made two movies for him.

00:48:51.239 --> 00:48:54.860
And he called me and he said,
I think there's a movie here,

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.720
but it's for you.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.410
It's not a team movie, because
there's no drugs involved.

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:01.660
And it's for your persona.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.860
If you want to,
there's a movie here.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.012
And I want you to star
in it and write it.

00:49:11.012 --> 00:49:12.507
OK.

00:49:12.507 --> 00:49:13.590
Tommy and I had a meeting.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:19.632
He came over ostensibly to pitch
me a story for a TV series.

00:49:19.632 --> 00:49:21.340
Before he got started,
I said, look, man.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:21.980
This is what happened.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.646
I got offered this
movie by Frank Price,

00:49:23.646 --> 00:49:25.200
and I'm going to do it.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.740
And it was like, there it was.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.050
And he just got
mad and got shook

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:34.686
and turned around and walked
to his car and that was it.

00:49:34.686 --> 00:49:36.819
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:49:36.819 --> 00:49:38.360
So we've only got
a few minutes left.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.839
I've only got through like
half of my notes right here.

00:49:40.839 --> 00:49:42.630
CHEECH MARIN: You simply
must buy the book.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.580
It's called "Cheech
is Not My Real Name."

00:49:47.472 --> 00:49:49.680
ALAN SEALES: You were friends
with John Lasseter, who

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.513
made you the voice of
many of his characters

00:49:51.513 --> 00:49:54.130
in Disney and Pixar,
including Tito, the Chihuahua

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:55.130
from "Oliver &amp; Company."

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.250
It's one of my favorites.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:57.926
Can you give us a check it out?

00:49:57.926 --> 00:49:59.050
CHEECH MARIN: Check it out.

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:03.990
There was one bit of direction.

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:10.140
George Schrader-- and
he was Panamanian.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.600
This guy, George Schrader,
anyway, spoke perfect Spanish.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.510
And I went into like--

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:18.160
I was looking for
a gig to do after.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.350
And I got this call to come in
and audition for this thing.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:24.840
And I went in there, and
I didn't know how to--

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.620
I had never had an audition
for anything, ever.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.320
I did the text that they have.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.900
And everybody goes,
oh, that's very nice.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.200
And I got in the parking lot.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.020
I said, that sucked.

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.280
So I went back in.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.874
I said, what I did, it sucked.

00:50:40.874 --> 00:50:41.790
I want to do it again.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:42.449
They go, OK.

00:50:42.449 --> 00:50:44.240
And so George gave me
one bit of direction.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.850
He says, play this character,
Tito, which was a chihuahua,

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:51.060
like you have one finger
in a light socket.

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.160
That's all I needed--

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.890
at the top of my voice.

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:59.070
And it was a breakout character.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:00.570
And the movie became a big hit.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:03.520
And then I started on this
road of animated movies.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.860
And it was what I was
born to do or was trained

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.530
to do more than anything,
because animation was Cheech

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.312
&amp; Chong without the animation.

00:51:13.312 --> 00:51:15.270
It was voice acting, and
I knew how to do that.

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:17.720
So a string of movies--

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.150
"The Lion King," "Cars."

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.200
And we're still doing
"Cars" right now.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.654
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, right.

00:51:24.654 --> 00:51:26.070
I mean, there's
so much about you.

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:27.300
CHEECH MARIN: These
guys got nothing to do.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.841
They can go in the
little cubbyholes,

00:51:28.841 --> 00:51:34.719
and order free food, and
lay back, and watch TV.

00:51:34.719 --> 00:51:36.260
This is much more
informative, right?

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:40.800
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.540
There's so much I want to cover
and we don't have time for.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.650
So you've been a cub scout,
Boy Scout, altar boy,

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:49.510
guitar player, potter--

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:50.010
everything.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:51.600
You've danced with
Kate Middleton.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.150
And now, you're the owner--

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:58.464
CHEECH MARIN: She asked me.

00:51:58.464 --> 00:51:59.880
ALAN SEALES: You
are the largest--

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.190
you're the owner of the
largest Chicano art collection.

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.610
CHEECH MARIN: Yeah.

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:03.401
ALAN SEALES: Right?

00:52:03.401 --> 00:52:05.490
CHEECH MARIN: In the
known hemisphere.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:07.448
ALAN SEALES: Are there
any unknown hemispheres?

00:52:07.448 --> 00:52:08.592
CHEECH MARIN: Well, sure.

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:10.800
ALAN SEALES: And now, I want
to give you a quick plug

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.780
before we wrap up here.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.890
So what is this?

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.980
CHEECH MARIN: This is a bottle.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.770
It's a concept in
Western civilization.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:25.110
This is my new line of mezcal
called Tres Papalote, which

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.700
means Three Kites.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.320
So you can get higher than
three kites on this thing.

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.970
And as I said, a company
came to me and says,

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:36.280
we'd like you to be involved
in the beverage industry.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.960
And how about some wine?

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.990
I said, well, I'll drink it, but
I don't know anything about it.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.630
And they say, well,
you're Mexican.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:45.562
How about some tequila?

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:46.490
So I said--

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.280
ALAN SEALES: Thanks, asshole.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.695
CHEECH MARIN: OK.

00:52:49.695 --> 00:52:51.240
There's a zillion
tequilas out there.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.740
And so I said, well,
you know what's

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.440
an undiscovered
category is mezcal.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.020
And so why don't we do a mezcal.

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.520
What's that?

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.560
That's the one with the
worm in it, isn't it?

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.060
No, no.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:04.770
It's mezcal, and it's a very
distinct, artisanal beverage.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:06.180
And so we started investigating.

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.670
And we thought, hey,
this is a coming thing,

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:09.580
and it's really good.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:13.330
It's something new to drink that
has a distinctive smoky taste.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:14.940
And it's like tequila.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.875
I call it tequila with tattoos.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.980
And now it's catching on.

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.580
There's mezcal bars everywhere,
and it's the hipster thing

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:24.590
to do.

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:27.990
And millennials love
it, and I love it.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:29.366
And it's a great
drink to drink--

00:53:29.366 --> 00:53:30.406
ALAN SEALES: Millennials.

00:53:30.406 --> 00:53:31.770
CHEECH MARIN: Millennials, yeah.

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.604
That's the new term.

00:53:32.604 --> 00:53:34.353
ALAN SEALES: Which is
now like the largest

00:53:34.353 --> 00:53:35.716
consumer of boxed wine as well.

00:53:35.716 --> 00:53:36.840
CHEECH MARIN: Yes, exactly.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.850
Here's a little fact--

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:44.760
84% of all wine is drunk 48
hours after its purchase.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.242
All wine.

00:53:46.242 --> 00:53:47.950
That's why they don't
have corks anymore.

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:48.316
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:53:48.316 --> 00:53:49.180
Don't need them.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:52.120
CHEECH MARIN: Don't need them.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.270
These 50-year-old
Cabernets, that's

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:57.640
like that much of the market.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.792
48 hours, 84% of all wine.

00:54:00.792 --> 00:54:01.750
So anyways, we started.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:02.416
We put this out.

00:54:02.416 --> 00:54:04.137
It has been highly successful.

00:54:04.137 --> 00:54:06.720
And this is one of the figures
from my Chicano art collection.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:10.799
It's a glass statue by
the De La Torre Brothers.

00:54:10.799 --> 00:54:12.340
And I'm trying to
get them jobs, too,

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:16.141
because Mexicans
help each other.

00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:17.140
And they're all related.

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:23.811
And I think-- do we
have some for them?

00:54:23.811 --> 00:54:24.310
No.

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:25.393
No, you get to look at it.

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.180
And it's a great, great
drink, Tres Papalote.

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:33.387
I wish we had some art books.

00:54:33.387 --> 00:54:34.970
We didn't bring any
art books with us.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:35.170
ALAN SEALES: No.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:35.260
Not this time.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.384
CHEECH MARIN: We're trying
to get rid of them, too.

00:54:37.384 --> 00:54:38.120
ALAN SEALES: Oh.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:38.770
Ship them over.

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:39.940
We'll give them out.

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.010
CHEECH MARIN: I
just might do that.

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:41.390
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:42.490
CHEECH MARIN: All right.

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:42.970
ALAN SEALES: Sorry, go ahead.

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:43.660
CHEECH MARIN: Go ahead.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.210
No.

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:45.710
ALAN SEALES: I was
going to wrap up.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:47.999
I want you to continue
your story, though.

00:54:47.999 --> 00:54:49.915
CHEECH MARIN: As things
come into your screen,

00:54:49.915 --> 00:54:52.600
you go, oh, I could be involved.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.340
You guys are going to be
the first to know about it.

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.270
I'm coming out with
my own weed line

00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:59.995
called Cheech's Private Stash.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:10.730
It'll be available wherever fine
weed is sold, mostly online.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:17.127
No, but-- I mean,
millennials like it.

00:55:17.127 --> 00:55:19.210
ALAN SEALES: Did you know
that most weed is smoked

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:21.928
24 hours after purchasing?

00:55:21.928 --> 00:55:24.700
CHEECH MARIN: That is true.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.340
It's an interesting
thing because we're

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.440
waiting to see where
the government was going

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.820
to come down with Trump and--

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.550
Mr. Peanut.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.020
And are they going
to go buy these--

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.510
but even Sessions
is not dumb enough

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:46.060
to go up against 33 states.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.060
And he's a states'
rights advocate.

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.550
I mean, like you can't have
states' rights for some things

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:53.720
and not states' rights
for other things.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.580
And so now what they
indicate is we're just

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.870
going to leave the marijuana
thing, because there is going

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:02.860
to be a lot of pushback from the
other side who are well-funded

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:07.330
and the states who get
$200 to $300 million

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:11.290
in taxes for their
beleaguered states every year.

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:19.060
And I think it's the intoxicant
of choice of now generations

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.980
rather than--

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:25.280
and it has medicinal
qualities for sure.

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:30.340
And I haven't heard any
argument from medical beer yet.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:34.910
ALAN SEALES: Your
liver is too good.

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:36.059
Have this beer.

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.600
CHEECH MARIN: Pickle
it a little bit.

00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.464
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:56:38.464 --> 00:56:40.630
CHEECH MARIN: And so it was
all these things coming,

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.760
and they go with
lifestyle because we're

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.850
increasingly involved
in lifestyle, obviously.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:52.120
And we're figuring out
how the market works.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:57.490
Because you can only grow
and sell weed in the state

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.380
that you're in.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.890
You can't transport
it across state lines

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:04.180
to sell California
weed in Colorado.

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:07.030
And for every state
that has legalized--

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:09.570
some form of legalized weed--

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.200
there is an equal
and opposite group

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.540
on the other side that wants
to undo all those laws.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:17.020
And they throw logs in
your path all the time.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.700
But the stain keeps--

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.729
it's like a lava flow.

00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:22.270
I mean, you can
stand in front of it,

00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:25.180
but I wouldn't recommend it.

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.670
Because it's going to be--

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:29.590
and it's going to go
across the nation.

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:31.410
The thing that they're
going to find out

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:34.660
is there is people
that smoke marijuana

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.650
in every single
stratum of society--

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:42.900
financial, religious, ethnic.

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.960
And good luck fighting it.

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.540
And I think they kind of
looked over the abyss.

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.460
No, I don't think
we're going in there.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.040
So that's happening.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.967
Cheech's Private Stash.

00:57:54.967 --> 00:57:56.800
ALAN SEALES: Is there
a website to get more?

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.880
CHEECH MARIN: Not yet
but there will be.

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.010
ALAN SEALES: We'll add it
to the YouTube description

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:01.301
for this video once you get it.

00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:02.500
CHEECH MARIN: Yes, please.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.270
And it's great.

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:07.060
I mean, it has really
medicinal properties.

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.346
ALAN SEALES: I think
it's really good.

00:58:09.346 --> 00:58:10.720
That's what I'm
taking from this.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.719
CHEECH MARIN: That's it.

00:58:11.719 --> 00:58:17.060
I just had a nausea caused
by some stomach problems.

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.300
And I was taking all the
prescribed medications,

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.490
and it was only weed
that stopped this nausea.

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:22.990
And nausea-- I don't
know if anybody

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:26.200
has had a bout of nausea
here that's ongoing.

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.970
It's debilitating.

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:29.080
It really is debilitating.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.385
Because like, you're
just like, oh, man.

00:58:31.385 --> 00:58:32.600
I feel like shit.

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.590
And weed knocked
it out right away.

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:38.180
And I didn't want to admit
it, because I, you know,

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:40.750
I want to be [MUMBLES].

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.610
But you know, it's nice.

00:58:45.997 --> 00:58:47.580
ALAN SEALES: What's
next then for you?

00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:50.560
You've got something-- your
name on everything under the sun

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.060
here.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:51.610
CHEECH MARIN: Well,
I'm a Chicano.

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:53.720
I have to have three
jobs at all times.

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:57.780
I was raised that way.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.120
My dad always had three jobs.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.320
You got to have three jobs.

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.100
OK.

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:06.367
And so I'm going to continue
writing, which I really enjoy.

00:59:06.367 --> 00:59:07.950
It Because I was a
writer all my life.

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:09.670
I was an English
major in college.

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:10.720
And I wrote all the time.

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.190
So there's a couple of things
that I really want to write.

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:18.150
I'm halfway through a book
of essays about the Latino

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.610
experience in the United States.

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:25.190
It's called "We Come in Peace
and We Have You Surrounded."

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:28.770
It's sort of a cautionary tale.

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:33.450
And then I'm reading this
novella called "Hector."

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:34.830
And it's about
this young Chicano

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:38.010
kid who belongs to the
world's smallest minority.

00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:39.800
He's a Mexican vegetarian.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:45.270
Because there aren't
a lot of those.

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:47.710
And the travails
he's going-- there's

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.960
sort of magical
realism aspects of it,

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.730
because I'm a big Gabriel
Garcia Marquez fan.

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:57.450
If you read this book,
"Cheech is Not My Real Name,"

00:59:57.450 --> 01:00:01.830
I meet Gabriel Garcia
Marquez in Havana.

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:04.340
And it was like meeting
Shakespeare for me.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:07.829
I was like, that's Gabo,
and he's standing there,

01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:08.870
and I'm being introduced.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:10.800
And now he's going
to shake my hand.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.520
Wow.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.130
And he says, hello, really
deeply and then splits.

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:15.701
That's it.

01:00:15.701 --> 01:00:16.200
Hello.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.780
[MUMBLES] OK, cool.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.970
But that's the thing
about a celebrity--

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:25.650
you get to meet all the
people that you adore.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:26.882
And he was one of them.

01:00:26.882 --> 01:00:27.590
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.006
Well, I appreciate it so much.

01:00:29.006 --> 01:00:29.880
Thank you for coming.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.540
CHEECH MARIN: Thank
you very much.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.140
ALAN SEALES: This
has been wonderful.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:31.380
CHEECH MARIN: Thanks
for having me.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.046
I appreciate it.

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:33.182
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:33.182 --> 01:00:34.140
ALAN SEALES: Thank you.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.556
CHEECH MARIN: Thank
you very much.

01:00:35.556 --> 01:00:36.290
My pleasure.
