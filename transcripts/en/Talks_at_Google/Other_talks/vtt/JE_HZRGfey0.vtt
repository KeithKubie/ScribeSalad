00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.460
LOGAN URY: Hi, my
name is Logan Ury.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.350
And I'm on the Irrational Lab
team, a behavioral economics

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.650
research team led by Dan Ariely.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.020
I'm very excited
to welcome my dear

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.050
friend Joey the Cat to Google.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.020
A former teen prodigy
in the Chuck E. Cheese

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.290
skeeball circuit, Joey the Cat
turned pro in the fall of 2009

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.930
and quickly made
a name for himself

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.770
in the Brewskee-Ball
nationwide tour.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.270
At 24 he continued to push
the statistical limits

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.890
and was the first SF roller to
capture a triple Crown, which

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.760
is the BROTY, the Brewskee
Mug and Hundo Challenge.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.460
The records kept coming and Joey
the Cat could not be stopped.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.720
In 2001, in a field of the
world's 64 best rollers,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.370
Joey the Cat dominated
the competition

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.460
and was crowned the number
one skeeball player.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.590
He won again in 2012
and 2014 and is now

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.420
the most acclaimed competitive
skeeball player on the planet.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.080
In 2013 he quit
his cushy tech job

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240
to focus full-time on his
skeeball rental business.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.599
He's here to talk to
you about how you too

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.890
can turn your passion
into a career.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.224
Joey, thanks for being with us.

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:09.890
JOEY MUCHA: Logan,
thanks for having me.

00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:12.740
LOGAN URY: So I thought
it'd be fun to start off

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.580
with a little audience
participation.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.540
And maybe somebody
can challenge Joey

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.970
to a little skeeball match.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.410
DAVID: Oh my god.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.910
All right.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.365
It's been a long time.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.524
So ball nine?

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:24.690
JOEY MUCHA: Ball nine, yeah.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.179
DAVID: Holy crap.

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.679
All right.

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.113
We're on a time limit.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.620
I don't have a strategy.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.536
LOGAN URY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.448
JOEY MUCHA: The first three
balls were a little wide.

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:36.915
Still trying to find the center.

00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:37.404
Oh there we go.

00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:38.195
DAVID: There we go.

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:39.849
JOEY MUCHA: [INAUDIBLE] 50.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.316
Two 50s.

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:43.761
Almost had it dialed
in for a second there

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:46.206
but strayed left and right.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:48.348
Nine balls through, 220.

00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:48.973
LOGAN URY: Woo.

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:49.959
JOEY MUCHA: 220.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:50.945
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:52.424
DAVID: Thank you.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:55.875
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:58.833
JOEY MUCHA: What
we call finding 40.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:00.390
We go right down
the middle and try

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.464
to roll [INAUDIBLE]
[? best ?] seven as possible.

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:07.910
[INAUDIBLE] So that you
can get your average high

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.392
over 10 games.

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:11.368
We would play 10 games in a row.

00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:17.790
[INAUDIBLE] centered out the 40.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.766
Sometimes you have
trouble with 50.

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.730
But in this case nice and
smooth right down the middle.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.718
LOGAN URY: Woo.

00:02:23.718 --> 00:02:24.212
JOEY MUCHA: Thank you.

00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:25.170
LOGAN URY: Nicely done.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.962
David, thanks for participating.

00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:28.857
DAVID: No problem.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:29.690
LOGAN URY: OK, Joey.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.856
So I'm going to ask you
questions for a little while

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:34.290
and then at the end we'll
open it up to the audience.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.730
So let's start by talking
about your love of skeeball.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.610
Then we'll talk about
the skeeball business.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.172
And we'll wrap it
up with your advice

00:02:40.172 --> 00:02:41.255
for budding entrepreneurs.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.180
So first of all,
who are you and who

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.500
is your alter-
"skeego," Joey the Cat?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.100
JOEY MUCHA: My name is Joey
Mucha and born and raised

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.760
in Portland, Oregon.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.800
Moved to San Francisco
six years ago.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.410
And when I moved
to San Francisco

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.120
I joined a competitive
skeeball league.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.636
And everyone has
an alter "skeego"

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:01.260
when they join the
league, because it's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.420
sort of escapism and
something fun to do.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.340
And so the alter "skeego"
that I employed in the league

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.840
was Joey the Cat, which
was given to me in college.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.440
And it's sort of a metaphor
for always being on the prowl,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.350
keeping your claws sharp-- both
in personal and professional

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.144
endeavors.

00:03:17.144 --> 00:03:18.060
LOGAN URY: Fresh suit.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.799
I like it.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:19.590
JOEY MUCHA: Thanks.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.030
LOGAN URY: And I guess my
second question is why skeeball.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.400
JOEY MUCHA: Skeeball
came to me--

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.150
as you mentioned--
from Chuck E. Cheese.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.780
I was in the arcade for my
11th birthday with my family

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.650
and friends.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.830
And I was wandering
around the arcade.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.495
And my dad was hovering
around the skeeball machines.

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:38.370
And he said, Joey, you
should play this game.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.116
It's really interactive.

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:41.740
And you're not just
staring at a screen

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.450
pushing buttons and
shooting fake things.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.210
You're rolling something
tangible up the ramp.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.420
And there's instant
gratification.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.580
And that planted the seed
for my skeeball love.

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:56.170
LOGAN URY: And can you tell us
a little bit about your journey

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.378
to the national championship?

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.670
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah when I joined
the competitive skeeball league

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.780
when I moved here I fell
in love with the game

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.280
and playing with friends.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.160
And I excelled pretty well but
not the best in San Francisco.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.860
I was a top seed
from San Francisco--

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.000
and invite the top 64 rollers
to come out and compete.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.890
And so I go to the national
championship in New York City.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.790
So I'm flying across the country
to play competitive skeeball.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.410
And I go out there and
I was a "hundo roller."

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.080
I was rolling for the
100-point pockets.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.370
And I was quickly
met with adversity.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.749
And I ended up losing
in the third round

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.290
to the eventual
champion, Skee-Diddy.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.810
LOGAN URY: He'll always get you.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.768
JOEY MUCHA: Skee-Diddy.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.280
And so when I come
back to San Francisco

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.310
after the national
championships I really

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.610
went back to the drawing board.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.160
I had to reevaluate my game.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.550
And so what I did
right after that

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.610
was I said, all
right, the only way

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.234
to get better at this
game-- I'm living

00:04:59.234 --> 00:05:02.240
in Bernal Heights, a
one-bedroom apartment--

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.980
and I went onto eBay
and I said, maybe

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.580
I got to buy my own
skeeball machine.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.490
And I end up shipping
out a skeeball machine

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.050
into my apartment.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.890
And so that was losing
the national championship

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.670
and then figuring
out how to get better

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.452
and owning your own
skeeball machine.

00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:19.285
LOGAN URY: So how often
were you practicing?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.680
JOEY MUCHA: I was practicing
three, four times a week,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.610
and really becoming a student
of the game and the sport.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.120
LOGAN URY: And the
next year did you

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.394
go back and claim
that championship?

00:05:33.394 --> 00:05:35.810
JOEY MUCHA: So yeah there's a
couple of videos on YouTube,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.470
some Rocky-inspired training
videos of me practicing,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.730
and reminiscing on the
prior year's failure,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.790
and then climbing up to
the top of Bernal Heights

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.810
with skeeballs in
my hand and posting

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.274
that to YouTube to send
a message that I've

00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:51.190
been practicing a lot.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.869
And I went back and my
mom-- her birthday falls

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:59.410
around Memorial Day, when the
skeeball national championships

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.785
are every year-- and she said,
all I want for my birthday

00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:04.950
is a skeeball national
championship for my son.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.960
So really set the pressure high.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.280
But I clawed my way through
the field and pulled it out.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.180
And in the very last match--
you roll 10 games in a row,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.950
alternating with your
opponent, one on one.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.490
And so as I was mentioning,
in the little exhibition

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.340
round we had here, you need
to keep your average high.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.670
So if you miss the 100s, or
you're going really ambitious

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.887
and you miss, it's going to
create a pretty volatile score.

00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:38.220
And then if someone who's
steady, right down the middle,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.970
is going to keep their average
higher and service to the top.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.640
And so I won it.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.780
And there's a speech
online, and also on YouTube,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.290
where I dedicate it to my mom,
winning my first ever national

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.570
skeeball championship.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.654
LOGAN URY: And what did
it feel like to win?

00:06:55.654 --> 00:06:56.820
JOEY MUCHA: It was electric.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.635
It was so gratifying to
practice really, really hard

00:07:02.635 --> 00:07:07.380
and commit myself to
this game and focus--

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.730
I was so focused and
dialed in that it

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.390
was special on so many levels.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.290
Not only being around
all my friends,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.400
but the energy in the
room, the community

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.150
that is a part of the
skeeball league is electric.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.470
And it was just so much fun.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.970
And then shaking up
that champagne bottle,

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.620
spraying it around the bar where
the tournament was being held,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.464
and then dedicating
it to my mom.

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:32.630
LOGAN URY: That's beautiful.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.920
Felt

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.270
JOEY MUCHA: Amazing.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.102
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:07:34.102 --> 00:07:35.810
Do you have any favorite
skeeball stories

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.101
that you want to share with us?

00:07:39.452 --> 00:07:40.160
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.560
So a couple of
skeeball stories I've

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.930
got-- not related to
the business, I guess--

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.260
is going back to the second
national championships.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.610
And my parents actually flew
out from Portland, Oregon

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.160
to New York City
to watch me play.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.910
So not only did my
mom ask me, can you

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.080
dedicate the championship
to my birthday,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.260
she says, can we come
out and watch you.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.740
It was one of two
rollers that also

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.120
had their parents in attendance.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.530
They probably didn't travel
as far across the country.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.070
But having my parents out
there to enlighten them

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.420
to this experience was really
special because not only

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.800
did my dad get me
into the game he's

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.770
so supportive of me playing.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:32.039
And my mom was so excited to
see all of these victories

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.870
and then come out
and watch it live.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.969
And she was so nervous.

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:38.260
She said, I don't know how
you stay calm under pressure

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.200
up there, because there
were multiple times

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.520
during the third
national championship

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.620
that I competed in where
she had to turn away.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.720
And there was so much pressure.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.830
And there were three
times that I almost lost.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.920
So you have to go from
64 rollers down to two

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.314
and then play for the title
and basically win out.

00:08:58.314 --> 00:08:59.730
And there were two
matches where I

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.250
was down by a handful of
points in frame seven, eight

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.320
against "Brewbacca,"
"Snakes on a Lane,"

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.230
and then ultimately
"Chips Ahoy" was

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.720
the guy I played in the finals.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.620
And my parents were right there.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.510
And I handily won that
second national championship

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.360
in the final round.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.360
LOGAN URY: This sounds like
a movie waiting to happen.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.300
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah there's a
documentary in the works.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.680
There's a fair amount of
interesting storylines,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.950
and interesting
characters, and then

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.559
some drama on the competitive
side and the business side.

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:39.100
LOGAN URY: Yeah so that's a good
transition into the business

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.780
side.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.279
Can you tell us a little bit
about what you're doing before?

00:09:43.046 --> 00:09:44.670
JOEY MUCHA: So I
moved to San Francisco

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.820
to work for an internet
technology company.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.800
And I jumped in as an
online marketing manager

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.879
having never been to
the Bay Area other

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:53.920
than to look for housing.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.386
And it was fantastic.

00:09:58.386 --> 00:10:00.260
I worked for this company
for a couple years.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.760
And then they ended
up getting acquired

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.100
by a larger mobile
advertising network.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.701
And all along the way I was
running the skeeball biz

00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:11.200
on the side.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.158
And then I went and worked
for another company.

00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:16.190
And then they got acquired
by a publicly-traded company.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.630
And so I was achieving a
certain amount of success--

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.590
I mean nothing astronomical.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.440
I was a early employee but
not a significant shareholder.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.900
But learning a ton, both
about business, and strategy,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.350
and navigating the
professional landscape,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.280
but also building my
marketing and sales chops.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.850
LOGAN URY: So how did skeeball
transform from a hobby

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.641
to a business for you?

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.140
JOEY MUCHA: When I bought that
first skeeball machine that's

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.790
when people started
calling me crazy.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.280
They said, why do you have
your own skeeball machine.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.080
What are you doing?

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.690
You're not an arcade operator.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.222
You don't run the league.

00:10:53.222 --> 00:10:54.430
Why do you have this machine?

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.150
And so I said, it's to practice
and because I love the game.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.960
And then it wasn't until I
had my very first client that

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.390
wanted to rent this machine from
me for a company anniversary

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:12.430
that I figured there is a
business behind this game.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.380
It's niche enough and
in enough demand--

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.490
and I can create enough demand--
that people would potentially

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.330
want to have these at events
and have me host tournaments.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.430
And so it was that
point when I realized

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.180
it could become a side
business, when I said,

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.090
there is a small
market for this.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.990
And so I pursued that.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.950
And I reinvested all the
money I got from the rentals

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.184
back into the side business.

00:11:36.184 --> 00:11:38.600
LOGAN URY: Was there a pivotal
moment or a pivotal company

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.090
where you said, this is a
real thing that I can do.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.410
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah when I rented
my first machine to Airbnb

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.040
for their second
anniversary party.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.710
Airbnb is a home-sharing
rentals marketplace.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.810
And I became a host on Airbnb.

00:11:53.852 --> 00:11:56.910
And the hook to my
space-- why someone

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.420
would want to rent
my space, other

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.346
than the
terribly-uncomfortable couch

00:12:00.346 --> 00:12:01.720
that they were
staying on-- was I

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.810
had a skeeball machine
inside my apartment.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.590
So I said, rent a
couch or skeeball

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.860
machine in Bernal Heights.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.250
And at the time
Airbnb was growing

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.730
very rapidly but still small.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.320
And the CEO was
living on Airbnb.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.060
And so he stayed
at my apartment.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.500
And when he saw the
skeeball machine in there

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.370
he was just enamored
with my story

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.295
and with the novelty of this
large-- it was a 13-footer.

00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:30.920
This is a 10-footer
you see right here.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.630
So it's even three feet
longer on the lane which

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.740
makes it even more of a
overwhelming furniture

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.490
piece in your small
one-bedroom apartment.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.710
Because I had to step over
it to get into my kitchen.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.880
I had to walk around it
to get into my bedroom.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.660
It was blocking one of my doors.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.450
And so he said, we need this at
our second anniversary party.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.660
And so we made it happen.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.290
We put it inside the
original Airbnb office,

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.070
which was also their apartment.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.290
And so it had this very
homey-- like from one

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.330
small business
budding entrepreneur

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.830
to a growing small business
inside their apartment.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.594
And then people just had
so much joy playing it.

00:13:11.594 --> 00:13:14.135
LOGAN URY: So you talked about
your companies being acquired.

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:16.940
The question of my mind
is, do you actually

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.690
make a living from
your skeeball business.

00:13:19.204 --> 00:13:20.370
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah absolutely.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.400
Right now it's my
primary source of income.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.164
Sometimes I'll rent
my place out on Airbnb

00:13:26.164 --> 00:13:27.830
for a little bit of
supplemental income.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.480
But the majority of my income
comes from this business--

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.970
renting, leasing, and
hosting skeeball tournaments.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.490
LOGAN URY: So walk us through
a typical work day for you.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.800
JOEY MUCHA: A typical work
day for me is waking up,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.870
answering emails,-- either
inbound leads coming in from

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:52.360
the website or outbound sales
efforts that I'm working

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.410
on-- a couple hours of email,
and then I'm either delivering

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.980
skeeball machines to events,
or servicing skeeball machines,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.841
or going around to skeeball
machines and collecting

00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:06.340
the passive income that's coming
in to the machines that are

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.160
in bars and venues.

00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:10.610
LOGAN URY: And did you
always see yourself

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.401
as an entrepreneur?

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.320
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah
my personal DNA was

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.330
wired to always be hands-on,
whether that was starting

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.750
companies or building things.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.664
And when I was in college
I never skateboarded before

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:26.580
and I wanted to skateboard
for the first time.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.390
So instead of just
buying a skateboard

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.019
I started researching on the
web how to make skateboards.

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:33.560
And then I figured out how to
take the thin laminates of wood

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.404
and put them together
into these molds,

00:14:35.404 --> 00:14:36.820
and then cut them
out, and install

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.850
the graphics and the hardware.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.300
And the next thing
you know I was

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.930
building 5, 10
skateboards a month

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.930
and just selling them to friends
and having fun with that.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.600
And then-- a lot of people
do this but-- silkscreening

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.450
t-shirts and just
creating your own wares

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.290
that you want to interact with.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.020
And then skeeball came around.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.390
And it was a no-brainer for me
that it could be a business.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.449
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:02.740
What has surprised you most
about working for yourself?

00:15:04.769 --> 00:15:06.310
JOEY MUCHA: The most
surprising thing

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.657
for me is that when you run
your own company full-time

00:15:10.657 --> 00:15:12.740
you think you're going to
have all this free time.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.073
And you think you're going
to have way more flexibility.

00:15:15.073 --> 00:15:16.840
And it's absolutely
the opposite.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.990
Because you end up having
to work even harder and even

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:26.910
longer hours to really make
your venture pay dividends.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.240
You could just make ends meet,
and put in the minimum amount,

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.400
if your business is
already generating revenue.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.600
But to make it really
grow and thrive you

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.180
have to start finding
efficiencies, and hiring

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.300
people, and positioning
your assets so they

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.940
can work for you as
best as possible.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.370
But that takes a
lot of hard work

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.220
with sales, and marketing,
and partnerships.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.000
And so when I quit
my job I said,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.610
all right, I'm going to have
all this time to travel and take

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.850
on other projects.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.130
But it was quite the opposite.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.120
I was working even
harder and not

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.620
doing some of my other pastimes
to get the business to where

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.786
I wanted it, because I was
very ambitious with where

00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:04.550
I wanted it.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.508
LOGAN URY: Is there one
aspect of your business

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.022
that you're
particularly proud of?

00:16:08.022 --> 00:16:08.730
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.920
So the passive side of
the business, where I just

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.680
put games into venues, bars,
art galleries, food truck

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.550
parks, and they work for me.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:27.080
It was how Warren Buffett sort
of initiated his base capital

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.190
to grow his empire, was
through passive income

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.060
streams-- gumball machines
and vending machines.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.880
And so putting them into bars
has an incredibly long sales

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.340
cycle because you need to
become friends with the owners

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.200
and convince them that
the space in their bars

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.180
is something that you can
take up to not only provide

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.000
an amenity to the patron but
make money off of that space.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.370
And so one story that
I'm really proud of

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.800
is building a skeeball trailer.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.990
So I took two skeeball
machines, cut the legs off,

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.530
and put them on
a utility trailer

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.030
that you'd pull
around lawnmowers

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.041
with-- like a
landscaping trailer.

00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:11.040
And I just cut the legs
off the skeeball machine

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.890
and plopped them right
onto the trailer.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.720
And it required not
only hands-on skills

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.141
with building things but
also business development.

00:17:20.141 --> 00:17:22.390
I had to figure out where
is this thing going to live.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.670
I don't have a garage.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.319
I don't have storage for it.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.910
And how's it going
to make money?

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.160
And so very early on I
partnered with a food truck park

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.780
that is basically pioneering, in
San Francisco, the mobile food

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.260
truck ecosystem.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.110
And they housed my
skeeball trailer

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.464
once I completed it so it could
stay there semi-permanently.

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:47.297
And I could take it out
and drive it around.

00:17:47.849 --> 00:17:49.390
LOGAN URY: So you
talked a little bit

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.340
about how it was surprising
that you actually

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.052
have less time
rather than more time

00:17:53.052 --> 00:17:54.510
now that you run
your own business.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.950
What are some other
surprises and challenges

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.990
of working for yourself?

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.500
JOEY MUCHA: So when
you work for yourself

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.770
you basically have
to do everything,

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:12.780
from operations, to sales, to
HR, to taking out the trash.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.260
And you can't be ashamed
of taking on those tasks.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.960
And if you're literally
working for yourself--

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.720
and you're the only employee--
you have to do everything.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.370
And so hiring an
accountant was something

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.469
I didn't think I
would have to do.

00:18:27.469 --> 00:18:29.260
I could just learn some
accounting software

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.050
and figure it out.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:35.540
But if you're not good at that
you need to bring on some help.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.590
And so figuring out
what tools I needed

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.500
to use to make
myself most efficient

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.710
was something that surprised me
and I had to explore and learn.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.020
And so I'm using
an array of tools

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.990
that make my job
more efficient, which

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.530
is like an accounting online
accounting software called

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:03.610
Xero, a credit card acceptor
called Stripe, and Google Apps

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:07.920
to manage all of my sales
reps' email accounts

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.860
and calendaring so I have
my scheduling all in place.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.640
And sort of a variety
of web-based tools.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.610
And then having a website.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:21.060
I was incredibly surprised
how much inbound sales leads

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.760
I was getting just by being
really highly-indexed.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.650
LOGAN URY: How do
people find you?

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.170
JOEY MUCHA: The
two primary sources

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:31.640
are my website, via
Google Search, and Yelp.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.760
Yelp has been an incredible
inbound lead source.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.260
LOGAN URY: So I'd
like to transition

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.657
into giving advice to people.

00:19:38.657 --> 00:19:41.240
I think there's a lot of people
at Google who enjoy their jobs

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.592
but also have a big passion.

00:19:42.592 --> 00:19:44.550
And I think they have
some questions around how

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.670
do you turn your
passion into a career.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.550
So to start off,
what's the best career

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.720
advice you've ever been given.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.360
JOEY MUCHA: I mean it's
cheesy but doing something

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.150
that you love is so critical.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.749
Because if it doesn't keep you
up at night-- if you're not

00:20:00.749 --> 00:20:02.290
passionate about
it, you're not going

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.040
to pour your heart
into it, and you're not

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.740
going to take all
of your free time

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.350
and really spend that
time doing this thing.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.870
And you may not
fall in love with it

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.400
until you know that
it can be successful

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.910
or that it has
potential to grow.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.320
And until you really
give it a chance--

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.430
and if it doesn't
keep you up at night,

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.840
and you're not proud to
go up to someone and say,

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.930
this is what I'm doing or this
is what I want to be doing.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.050
And even walking up to
a stranger and saying,

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:37.280
I'm the best seamstress
who makes leather pants.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.590
Like whatever it is, like
something obscure or something

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.340
mundane but you
apply a twist to,

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.950
then you're going to have
a hard time selling it.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.350
You're going have a hard
time telling someone that,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.900
oh I quit my XYZ
to do this thing,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.836
unless you are really,
really excited about it.

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:56.210
LOGAN URY: So most
people are not

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.780
national champions of anything.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.440
Do you think you really have
to be the best in your fields

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.290
in order to go and
pursue that career?

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.570
JOEY MUCHA: In my
case, I excelled

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.180
from a performance perspective.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.070
But I did other things that
made me more memorable.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.710
If I wasn't a national champion,
but I'm wearing a cat suit

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.920
and have this great brand,
and people remember you

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:25.090
as the x for y-- I'm the
skeeball guy for rentals--

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:30.240
and that is more critical
than being some novel

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.050
performance in culture.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.690
You need to be the subject
matter expert, basically.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.080
You need to be someone that,
when you leave that room,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.920
they're going to
say, I know to go

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.560
to that person for this
thing, whatever it is.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.420
If it's iPhone apps,
if it's fixing cars,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.030
if it's building motorcycles,
if it's your cobbler

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.240
and you're like the shoe
expert-- born-again shoe

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.739
expert.

00:21:57.739 --> 00:22:03.040
Whatever it is, you need to
be that person for that trade,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.480
but not be afraid
that you're not

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.621
going to be that the next day.

00:22:06.621 --> 00:22:07.620
It's going to take time.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:12.010
It took me three years to say,
I'm going to quit my day job,

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:16.170
my cushy six-figure salary,
to do this thing that's

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.080
going to make me
not very much money

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.310
but I'm going to have
100% ownership in it.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.870
And you have to put in the time.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.390
And so it takes time to grow.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.770
This is a ball of clay
that you need to mold.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.250
And it's going to
change direction.

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:33.350
I thought I wanted to
start skeeball leagues

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.230
and copy what they were doing.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.260
But no.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.130
I've created three other
businesses, the rentals.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.740
And so you need to be creative
with the way your business

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.640
or your idea adapts
to the marketplace.

00:22:44.332 --> 00:22:46.040
LOGAN URY: Can you
talk a little bit more

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.720
about personal branding
and who Joey the Cat is?

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.670
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah so Joey
the Cat was just a nickname.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.500
And that's really
all it was when

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.050
I gave it to this skeeball
league operator and said,

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.240
I'm Joey the Cat.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.700
And then I got
better at skeeball

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.950
and it just sort of suck.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.930
And I said, well
people are calling

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.680
me Joey the Cat in the
context of skeeball.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.165
So I'm just going to call it
Joey the Cat Skeeball Rentals.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.810
And then I started to employ
some of my creative marketing

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.690
tactics against that.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.854
I built a small brand.

00:23:18.854 --> 00:23:20.020
I partnered with a designer.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.430
I paid him next to
nothing to build a logo.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.210
And then he designed
t-shirts for me

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.920
that had a really
fun, playful nature.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.260
I went into all these
creative exercises

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.020
that made the
brand come to life.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.470
And so one of the t-shirts--
I always wore a fanny pack.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.420
And anybody can
wear a fanny pack.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.010
But if you own it, and the
fanny pack is your thing,

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.270
and you've got all
your trinkets in there,

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.440
and you wear it when you're
in competition or doing

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:46.940
your craft.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.994
I started to make
that part of my brand.

00:23:50.994 --> 00:23:53.160
So I have this t-shirt that
has a silkscreened fanny

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.660
pack on it.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.119
And people really wanted that
t-shirt because they're like,

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.576
oh is that a
functional fanny pack.

00:23:57.576 --> 00:23:59.210
No, its just a goofy fanny pack.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.160
But it has your logo on it.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:07.957
And my business cards was a
great creative exploration.

00:24:07.957 --> 00:24:09.040
I think I have some on me.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.350
It's a coaster.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.270
My clientele were bars.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.280
And so I could take
these to a bar.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.620
And it's a letterpress coaster,
which is kind of a lost trade.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.020
And it basically is something
I could leave at a bar

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.260
and not feel inappropriate
to give that to a bar owner.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.690
And so I started to remove
friction with my brand

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.360
to get to the people
I wanted to talk to.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.280
And then the third thing is I'm
wearing a cat suit right now.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.480
I'm owning this brand.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.570
The first Joey the
Cat attire that I had

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.180
was a African women's
jumpsuit onesie

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.640
that I got on Haight Street
at a second-hand store.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.470
But it was the most iconic
skeeball performance attire

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.620
that anyone was wearing.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.828
And so it was very memorable.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.350
And then I retired that to
the skeeball memorabilia

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.010
hall of fame and then upgraded
to this thing, a three piece

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:08.550
custom tailored Sumatra
tiger cat suit, which

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:13.020
has just not only been an
interesting piece of clothing

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.210
to wear but has become my brand.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.083
You will never forget this suit.

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.282
It's going to be etched
into your eyes forever.

00:25:20.282 --> 00:25:21.240
LOGAN URY: I apologize.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.340
JOEY MUCHA: And yes
apologies all around.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:28.229
But if you want to
remember who that was,

00:25:28.229 --> 00:25:29.770
it was either the
guy in the cat suit

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.075
or the guy with the skeeball
machine, or in this case

00:25:32.075 --> 00:25:34.450
the guy in the cat suit who
brought the skeeball machine.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.550
And that piece of
information that

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:42.350
stays with you will create what
marketers call brand recall.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:47.830
And it separates
you from the crop

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.790
of people that are trying to
do whatever is-- in this case,

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.320
arcade games are a commodity.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.510
It's a commoditized
product that I've

00:25:55.510 --> 00:26:00.940
differentiated through
branding and creating demand

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.899
within the marketplace.

00:26:01.899 --> 00:26:03.315
LOGAN URY: It's
really interesting

00:26:03.315 --> 00:26:05.680
to hear you talk about what
a role personal branding has

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.309
played.

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:08.350
Are there any people you
look up to who you think

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.660
are really excelling at this?

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:18.620
JOEY MUCHA: There's a band that
I follow called Con Bro Chill.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.345
And they have a type of
music called party rock.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.870
And even if you
don't love the music,

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:31.670
if you see them live-- they
even make this metaphor

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.600
towards burning their
image into your eyes.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.350
They have so much creativity
with the way they perform

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:44.250
and the way their stage presence
is transacted to the audience

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.200
that it's infectious.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.264
And it has this viral nature.

00:26:50.264 --> 00:26:51.180
And then they live it.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.400
They live it on Twitter.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.460
They live it in their
videos that they create.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.760
And it just permeates
the entire experience.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.420
And the songs get you going.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.840
But if you're not into
that type of music

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.590
it can still get
you on a variety

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.330
of other emotional chords.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:12.080
And so Con Bro Chill, a small
up-and-coming party rock band

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.460
is someone that I
draw inspiration,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.455
given the sort of counterculture
nature my business.

00:27:17.455 --> 00:27:18.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:19.107 --> 00:27:20.065
JOEY MUCHA: Definitely.

00:27:20.065 --> 00:27:20.330
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.940
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah, it's fun.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.310
LOGAN URY: So I'm sure a
lot of people come up to

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.760
and say, oh, you know I want
to do the same thing as you.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.200
I want to be an entrepreneur.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.705
What are some of the mistakes
that you see people making?

00:27:30.009 --> 00:27:32.300
JOEY MUCHA: I kind of hinted
on it a little bit earlier

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:38.940
but it's either thinking you
can't succeed because you don't

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.530
have something right
away, and then not

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:46.830
pouring your heart and soul and
being prepared for opportunity.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.350
I think success is your
intersection of preparedness

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.680
and opportunity.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.570
And it's sort of
a two-way street.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.110
The opportunity arises
when you're prepared.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.170
And you're prepared, and
the opportunity arises,

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.350
you will achieve success.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.950
And so I saw this
catapulting itself

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:10.470
in my mind and my business
when I put myself in position

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:15.400
by being, if you google skeeball
rentals in San Francisco,

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.280
number one result.

00:28:18.206 --> 00:28:20.080
And across the country
I'm on the first page.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.710
But some producer googled
that unique term in New York

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.260
and found me and
then wanted to put me

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.090
on a TV show on
the Travel Channel.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.260
I was prepared for
the opportunity.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.440
And then when the
opportunity presented itself

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.321
I was able to execute on it.

00:28:39.321 --> 00:28:41.570
LOGAN URY: What happened
with the Travel Channel show?

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.500
JOEY MUCHA: So they were doing
a new series called "Game On,

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.380
America" where they
bring in a host that

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:54.447
is a Casino counterfeit spotter.

00:28:54.447 --> 00:28:56.280
He can figure out who's
cheating in casinos.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.927
And he would go around and teach
people how to excel in games.

00:28:58.927 --> 00:29:01.010
And they said, we would
like you to teach the host

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.810
how to play skeeball and how
to hustle someone in skeeball.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.710
And then they came to San
Francisco and filmed for a day.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.200
And I was on the pilot--
or the very first episode

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.740
of the show-- for about six
minutes teaching the host how

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.520
to play skeeball and hustle
a group of bystanders.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.520
LOGAN URY: Did it lead
to a lot of new business?

00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:22.160
JOEY MUCHA: I don't
think it directly

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.680
correlated with new business.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:31.870
But it definitely-- it
legitimized my status

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.070
as someone just beyond
a skeeball league.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.390
It's like OK, this person is
a teacher as well as a player.

00:29:38.992 --> 00:29:40.700
LOGAN URY: So you've
already accomplished

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.210
so much as Joey the Cat.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.845
What's next?

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.460
JOEY MUCHA: So the business,
as I mentioned, is a commodity.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.690
You can go out and buy an arcade
game today and put it in a bar.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.120
You can buy an arcade game today
and put it up on Craigslist

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.950
to have people come rent
it, whatever you want to do.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.989
But I see the business growing,
both from its nostalgic nature

00:30:01.989 --> 00:30:04.280
but also I want to introduce
a little bit of innovation

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:04.988
into the company.

00:30:04.988 --> 00:30:08.510
And so I'm working on
some cashless payment

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.541
systems for the games.

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:11.040
I think there's a
lot of opportunity

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.460
there, credit
cards specifically.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.840
And working with
an engineer on that

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.680
is taking up a lot of my time.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.360
And so I actually want to
hire someone and train someone

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.526
to take on some of
the day-to-day stuff

00:30:27.526 --> 00:30:28.150
that I'm doing.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.180
And that's a big step.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.059
I have some
commission-only salespeople

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:34.100
under the team right now.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:38.020
But to hire a full-time
employee to do what I'm doing

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.724
is definitely a near-term
next step for the business.

00:30:41.724 --> 00:30:43.140
LOGAN URY: That's
really exciting.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.830
Well that's it for my questions.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.780
Is there anyone in the
audience who has a question?

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.210
How many machines
do you own, Joey?

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.015
JOEY MUCHA: So I own
25 skeeball machines--

00:30:53.015 --> 00:30:53.640
LOGAN URY: Wow.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.098
JOEY MUCHA: --just
like the one you

00:30:55.098 --> 00:30:58.650
see here, the classic
10-Footer with mesh nets,

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.590
the 100-point pockets, and
the old-school aesthetic

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.305
that you remember from Chuck
E Cheese and the boardwalk.

00:31:06.344 --> 00:31:08.760
LOGAN URY: Question was
why don't you aim for 100

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.890
and why is that hard.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.480
JOEY MUCHA: So the
100-point pocket

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.380
is the highest point value
pocket on the scoring board.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.400
And it's in the
position in the corners

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.710
where not only is it
farther away from any

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.460
of the other
pockets, it's smaller

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.800
in diameter, which does
a couple of things.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.920
It makes it more
volatile for the ball

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.660
to actually create a
smooth entry point.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.500
And the ball needs to be
moving at a certain inertia

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.580
to go into it smoothly.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.372
And so to be able
to control it, it's

00:31:42.372 --> 00:31:44.830
kind of like hitting for a home
run every time in baseball.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.950
You're going to either miss
the ball completely or make

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.020
marginal contact.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.714
But some of the time you're
going to make it a home run

00:31:53.714 --> 00:31:56.130
and you're going to go straight
into the 100-point pocket.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.227
But no one has perfected
it to go straight

00:31:58.227 --> 00:31:59.310
into the 100-point pocket.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:03.930
And it's purely the geometry
and the physics of this game.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.890
And so the only way that
I've seen a lot of success

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.736
with the 100-point
pocket is off the net

00:32:08.736 --> 00:32:09.860
because it does two things.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.635
It slows the ball down
and it softens the angle.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.750
What they do in the
national championships

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.090
is they actually tighten
the nets to the point

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.590
where it's basically a
hitting a concrete wall

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.560
and you're not going
to get it to go in.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.330
And so it's just such
a volatile pocket

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:29.740
to go for that you're going
to really create a lot of risk

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.595
and a wide delta in
your scoring range.

00:32:32.595 --> 00:32:34.970
LOGAN URY: So we're going to
have a little demonstration.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.040
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah so I mean
every machine is different.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.720
And that's what's the
beauty of this game

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.470
is that they all have
their own character.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.640
But at the national
championships they tighten nets

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.850
and they use brand-new rubber
so the ball comes off really

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:51.350
strong.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.790
But you basically
want to make it go off

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.860
the side net like that.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.180
See how it comes
off the side net?

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.600
And then you slow the ball--
it slows the ball down.

00:32:59.602 --> 00:33:01.060
So you got to find
the right angle.

00:33:01.954 --> 00:33:03.370
And sometimes
people will actually

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:04.918
go off the-- there
we go-- so see

00:33:04.918 --> 00:33:06.459
how it comes off
the net right there.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.250
There, see how it almost
went in right there?

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:11.870
It's tough.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:12.370
It's tough.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.828
That's why I don't
go for hundreds.

00:33:13.828 --> 00:33:15.200
Of course, the last one goes in.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.450
But yeah, it slows the ball down
to the point where it basically

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.560
makes it easier for it to enter.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.310
And so whenever I go to
an arcade or boardwalk

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.370
I'll definitely try to
find the machine that

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.257
has the easiest
nets to go after.

00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:30.840
LOGAN URY: So the
question is how much

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.630
is your success in business tied
to your success as a player.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.990
JOEY MUCHA: So the success
as a player, in my mind,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.790
is a novelty and nice to have.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.360
But what it did do
is it definitely

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.555
kept my morale high
as the entrepreneur.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.636
Winning was definitely
gratification.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.150
When you put so much
time and energy--

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.640
I've calculated I've probably
played 5,000 or 6,000

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.590
hours of skeeball,
not only being

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.850
a student of the game but
dissecting the machines,

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.390
breaking them.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:02.380
A big piece of advice I
have for entrepreneurs

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.515
is to break it to
see how it works.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:11.750
Whether that's a car, a bicycle,
whatever you're working with,

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.370
learn how they actually work.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.179
Because then if you're not
an expert playing the game

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:22.644
you can be an expert as a
mover and creator of the game.

00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:24.310
LOGAN URY: I think
that's a great point.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.870
Because it's a little
intimidating to

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.036
think about becoming national
champion of something.

00:34:28.036 --> 00:34:31.160
But you can be the
best at deconstructing

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.785
a skeeball machine
even if you're not--

00:34:32.785 --> 00:34:33.040
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.000
LOGAN URY: --the best player.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.874
JOEY MUCHA: If I would
have spent all my time

00:34:35.874 --> 00:34:39.440
I did practicing to
play the game learning

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.739
how to create my own
skeeball machine I'd probably

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:48.020
have a really killer skeeball
machine or something that

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.810
is even more interesting
than this game.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.780
And you need to be prepared
to go down that path,

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.710
that you don't necessarily
know the outcome.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:00.260
You can't train to be a
skeeball national champion

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.400
and assume you're
going to win it.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.510
There's a lot of risk
and luck involved there.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.287
So what I did was I worked
really hard selling.

00:35:08.287 --> 00:35:10.870
I worked really hard selling and
I worked really hard building

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.670
relationships, throwing parties,
and creating my own demand.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:20.070
And so if you ask people
they will give you an answer.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.990
And you've got to
be ready for no.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.420
And you've got ready
for adversity in sales.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.870
But a lot of people
will say yes.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.620
And a lot of people
will want to help you.

00:35:30.187 --> 00:35:31.770
LOGAN URY: The
question is do you ever

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.560
wish that skeeball
machines were more portable

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.470
and were surprised
that there isn't

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.510
a more portable
version at this point.

00:35:40.136 --> 00:35:42.010
JOEY MUCHA: Yeah so the
skeeball machines are

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:47.380
at this perfect intersection
of overwhelming size yet

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.240
marginally portable.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.070
I put this in the back of my
pickup truck and drove it down.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:55.680
And with some help from Logan
here we brought it upstairs.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.749
And it didn't take that long
and it wasn't that hard.

00:35:58.749 --> 00:36:00.540
But to be able to take
on the risk and say,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.581
I'm going to figure out
how to move these things.

00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:05.660
I was using Zipcar rented
trucks I never even

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:10.090
owned a truck for the first
90% percent of my business.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:13.560
I kept my overhead
really low, to rent

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.960
one truck to move a machine
or a van to move two.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.310
And they do break
into two parts.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.280
There's the long lane.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.810
And then it divides
where the scoring pockets

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.800
begin into two parts.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.122
And it's getting creative
with the way you stack them,

00:36:29.122 --> 00:36:30.580
the way you move
them, how you have

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.370
a helper position the machines.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.730
And I do wish they were smaller.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.064
But I think them being
smaller would take away

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:40.730
from the impact.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.300
There are really cheap
$300 skeeball machines

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.930
that you'd have for maybe
a kid's backyard party

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.430
but they don't have
the same effect.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.870
And so bringing this particular
arcade game out into the wild

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.470
is what gives it its novelty.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.880
AUDIENCE: What would
this cost? $5,000?

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.740
JOEY MUCHA: New they're
$5,000 or $6,000.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.300
They don't make
this model anymore.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:09.750
So I find them online from
anywhere between $500 to $2,500

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:10.760
a machine.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.440
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.940
JOEY MUCHA: And
then one rental goes

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.810
for $600 for the
machine for a day.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.910
So the payback period is
pretty aggressive, yeah.

00:37:20.134 --> 00:37:21.550
LOGAN URY: One
question I have is,

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.890
do you still find playing
skeeball fun even though it's

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:24.473
your business.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.760
JOEY MUCHA: That's
a great question.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.900
I do still find it fun
because at the end of the day

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.970
it's a game.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:38.506
And the fun that I find
out of it is just enjoying.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.010
The whole reason I'm here is
because I'm playing this game.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.360
And the friends around you.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.760
If I was in a vacuum,
just playing by myself

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.890
as a robot just rolled
for high scores,

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.640
or trying to get that
perfect game-- 900--

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.014
I wouldn't be
having as much fun.

00:37:54.014 --> 00:37:55.890
But I'm with my friends.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.690
And every event that I go
to is a new opportunity

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.640
to meet somebody, to
show them my passion,

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.707
and to experience something new.

00:38:06.707 --> 00:38:08.790
LOGAN URY: I think that's
a great place to end it.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.110
Joey, thank you so much
for coming to Google today.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.485
JOEY MUCHA: Thanks
for having me.

00:38:12.485 --> 00:38:13.560
[APPLAUSE]
