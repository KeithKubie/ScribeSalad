00:00:01.773 --> 00:00:03.273
- Yellow cow meat.

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:05.642
- Yellow cow meat?

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:06.475
- Yeah.

00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:08.801
- And then of course the hot
pot just keeps simmering away

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:11.654
and as it keeps simmering
more and more flavors build up

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:15.737
and you can see that kind
of layer of fat on top.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:21.317
(upbeat music)

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.854
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:25.903
Its Mark Wiens.

00:00:25.903 --> 00:00:28.578
I am in Dali, Yunnan, China.

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:31.438
As you can see it is a very, very cold

00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:33.208
and very, very rainy day today.

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:35.090
But we're in ancient town.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.698
And right now we're
gonna go for breakfast,

00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:39.610
and then after that we'll
be going to the market.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.911
And then after that
we'll be learning to cook

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.316
at Lu-Shi's cooking school.

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:47.474
And then finally for dinner
we'll be having an amazing

00:00:47.474 --> 00:00:49.141
beef copper hot pot.

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:54.821
Its very, very quiet.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.197
Probably because its quite early

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:58.538
and also because its so rainy outside.

00:00:58.538 --> 00:00:59.694
Its about eight a.m.

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:01.102
This is the restaurant here.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:03.743
Its warm and cozy in here.

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:05.994
And let me just, I'm ecstatic right now.

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:09.552
Because let me show you
what this place serves,

00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:11.185
mutton vermicelli.

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:14.536
I don't think I can think
of anything better to eat

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:18.119
on a rainy, cold morning,
than mutton soup.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.125
(speaking Chinese)

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:33.335
I desperately want to just
douse this entire bowl

00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:36.023
in the chili oil, but before
I do that I got to taste

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:37.940
the broth as is, first.

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:41.360
(slurping)

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.193
Oh, mmmm.

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:49.821
Oh that is, you can definitely
taste the mutton in there

00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:52.488
and then you can taste the mint.

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:55.875
Mmm, the mint comes in there so nicely.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.708
Oh, that's a clean, muttony broth.

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:00.942
But it would be even better

00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:04.234
with the addition of that chili oil.

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:06.234
(music)

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:14.015
Oh yes and also, I forgot to mention

00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:17.505
that it is quite loaded
with Sichuan pepper as well.

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:21.472
Just on that first scoop
of soup I could feel that

00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:23.632
and it is beautiful.

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:25.550
Oh, okay I'll start with
that amount of chili oil

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.633
and may need to add more.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.969
(slurping)

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:34.276
Oh its so good, it just falls apart

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:37.013
and the noodles are really, really soft.

00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:38.761
You can really taste
that mint, you can taste

00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.116
the Sichuan pepper, you can
feel that Sichuan pepper.

00:02:41.116 --> 00:02:45.283
With that chili oil you've got
that smoky, dry chili flavor.

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.442
Garlicky.

00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.264
That will just warm you to your core.

00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:01.334
Oh that broth, its like
a subtle mutton flavor

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.278
and then with that dry chili.

00:03:05.278 --> 00:03:07.146
And I love that zing
from the Sichuan pepper

00:03:07.146 --> 00:03:08.897
and that chili oil.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.694
Oh and that mint.

00:03:10.694 --> 00:03:13.777
Oh what a beautiful, beautiful broth.

00:03:15.391 --> 00:03:17.599
Think I would go in for a
little more chili oil though.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.599
(music)

00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:26.983
Okay, nothing makes me more
happy than another scoop

00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:28.066
of chili oil.

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:34.488
In addition to the noodles,
we also got a mutton salad.

00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:37.114
The same slices of
mutton and he mixed it up

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:42.097
with all the herbs, the mint
in there, the spring onions.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:45.948
And then he made a dressing
that includes chili oil,

00:03:45.948 --> 00:03:49.115
Sichuan pepper, vinegar and soy sauce.

00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:56.799
Oh, that salad is insane too.

00:03:57.906 --> 00:03:59.834
That mutton is so tender.

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:02.165
It tastes like its been maybe salt cured

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:05.754
so the flavor literally
goes all the way through

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:07.393
each piece of meat.

00:04:07.393 --> 00:04:10.741
And then its like complimented
so well by that mint.

00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:12.741
(music)

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:25.895
Let me tell you a 100%
successful way to warm you up

00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:27.918
when its cold outside.

00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:30.370
Have a bowl of mutton noodles.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.106
We're walking through old town Dali

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:35.923
and we're on our way to a tea shop.

00:04:35.923 --> 00:04:38.406
Tea in Yunnan is famous
worldwide actually.

00:04:38.406 --> 00:04:40.635
They produce some of the finest tea

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:43.157
and so we're gonna go drink some tea now.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:46.804
And again what a perfect, rainy, cold day.

00:04:46.804 --> 00:04:49.323
If its gonna be rainy and cold outside

00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:52.740
drinking tea is not a bad activity to do.

00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:59.055
Alright that was a bit of a
wet walk but we have arrived.

00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:01.529
They specialize in Yunnanese black tea

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:02.884
as well as pu-er tea.

00:05:02.884 --> 00:05:04.813
Which I think we're just gonna sit here

00:05:04.813 --> 00:05:06.879
and start drinking some tea.

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.739
(speaking Chinese)

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:12.417
Have many different black
teas as well as pu-er teas

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.838
which are only from Yunnan.

00:05:14.838 --> 00:05:18.171
Pu-er teas, there can be a raw pu-er tea

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:22.976
as well as a manually
fermented, aged pu-er tea.

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:26.666
So right now we're starting
with a type of pu-er tea

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:27.749
which is raw.

00:05:28.723 --> 00:05:33.095
And its from a tree that
is over 400 years old.

00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:34.524
And so he's doing the whole process.

00:05:34.524 --> 00:05:37.381
He's first awakening the leaves

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:38.639
and then just washing the cups.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.056
The first one, the raw pu-er.

00:05:45.238 --> 00:05:46.613
Oh that's good.

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:49.271
Fresh tasting, slightly earthy.

00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:52.354
Really smooth, really, really smooth.

00:06:13.536 --> 00:06:17.490
- [Woman] Taste like
honey, taste like flower,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.443
taste like sweet potato.

00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:20.670
This one is orange.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.659
- The next tea that he's
making is a fermented pu-er tea

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.694
and you can immediately see
how its a much darker color.

00:06:26.694 --> 00:06:30.194
We had a smell of it and it smells earthy.

00:06:34.733 --> 00:06:37.084
Mmmm, oh that one's amazing.

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:41.167
Oh, yeah, its almost like
a bacony, smoky flavor.

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:47.659
It has this huge depth of flavor.

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.212
He was mentioning that it almost
has an orange flavor to it,

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:53.907
which it does, it does.

00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:57.954
And they say that these pu-er
teas, they age with time,

00:06:57.954 --> 00:06:59.716
its like a fine wine.

00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:03.883
And it really is, there's
such a complexity of flavors.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.877
(speaking Chinese)

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:15.006
There's so much to learn about tea.

00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:19.614
Something that's fascinating
to me is that every,

00:07:19.614 --> 00:07:23.614
every tea tree is accounted
for and known about.

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:29.406
So certain teas can come from
one certain, specific tree

00:07:32.378 --> 00:07:36.355
that they know about and that's the tea.

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:38.402
And it will have a different
flavor from a different tree.

00:07:38.402 --> 00:07:40.804
And so every tree is accounted for.

00:07:40.804 --> 00:07:43.014
There's so many different tastes.

00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:45.431
This one is the black oolong.

00:07:48.788 --> 00:07:50.723
Mmm, very light.

00:07:50.723 --> 00:07:52.615
It does have a fruity taste to it

00:07:52.615 --> 00:07:55.948
and a little bit of a natural sweetness.

00:07:57.573 --> 00:07:59.308
This one is from the very top buds.

00:07:59.308 --> 00:08:01.891
The very young buds of the tea.

00:08:05.437 --> 00:08:09.604
Oh, just a drastically different
taste from the other one.

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:13.029
Its floral, its a little bit...

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:18.389
A little bit smokey, but very, very light.

00:08:20.404 --> 00:08:24.571
The next tea is from a 600
year old specific tree.

00:08:25.632 --> 00:08:28.549
And this one is a very gourmet tea.

00:08:34.468 --> 00:08:36.019
That's great!

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:38.269
It is, wait one more taste.

00:08:41.712 --> 00:08:44.795
It has that dryness, like a dry wine.

00:08:46.016 --> 00:08:47.450
There's so much to learn about tea.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.802
You could spend your
lifetime pursuing tea.

00:08:49.802 --> 00:08:52.234
But I had to buy one of those
blocks of the fermented.

00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:53.724
This is the same one that we sampled,

00:08:53.724 --> 00:08:57.474
but fermented, black
tea, aged to perfection.

00:08:58.312 --> 00:09:02.162
And this one cost me 300 yuan
so I'm gonna bring this home.

00:09:02.162 --> 00:09:04.123
And I'm gonna be drinking
this as I'm sitting

00:09:04.123 --> 00:09:05.796
at the computer for sure.

00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:08.271
We're now gonna go catch
a taxi to a market.

00:09:08.271 --> 00:09:09.539
And then after that we're gonna go over

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:11.707
to Lu-Shi's cooking school

00:09:11.707 --> 00:09:14.905
to do a bit of cooking and eating.

00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:16.905
(music)

00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:23.293
- So this is all different types of tofu.

00:09:26.757 --> 00:09:31.149
Then you get the bell pepper,
together with this Sichuan

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:33.526
and mix together with the tofu.

00:09:33.526 --> 00:09:35.448
- A huge, sprawling market.

00:09:35.448 --> 00:09:39.553
Just all the ingredients
you need for Yunnanese food.

00:09:39.553 --> 00:09:40.693
For Sichuan food.

00:09:40.693 --> 00:09:43.516
There are so many vegetables,
there are chilies,

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.433
there are things steaming.

00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:48.085
Its cold and wet this morning.

00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:50.717
This is a great market.

00:09:50.717 --> 00:09:51.806
- [Woman] And this pickled chili,

00:09:51.806 --> 00:09:54.152
before he was pickled he was hard.

00:09:54.152 --> 00:09:55.738
- I always love walking around markets.

00:09:55.738 --> 00:09:58.256
We're off now to Lu-Shi's cooking school.

00:09:58.256 --> 00:10:01.065
And we have arrived to
Lu-Shi's cooking school,

00:10:01.065 --> 00:10:03.287
its called Rice and Friends.

00:10:03.287 --> 00:10:04.286
This is the little courtyard

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:06.485
and we're going upstairs to start cooking.

00:10:06.485 --> 00:10:08.318
Oh, its so cold today.

00:10:09.815 --> 00:10:12.205
Lu-Shi just explained to
us all about the different

00:10:12.205 --> 00:10:15.453
seasonings that go into Chinese cooking.

00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:17.937
Now its time to start cooking.

00:10:17.937 --> 00:10:20.931
We are gonna make our own chili oil.

00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:25.908
So, I am very excited to learn
how to make proper chili oil.

00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:28.887
- We have over here,
this is the dried chili

00:10:28.887 --> 00:10:31.613
and roughly grinded the dried chili.

00:10:31.613 --> 00:10:35.780
Over here, what we have is
some toasted sesame seeds.

00:10:38.969 --> 00:10:40.820
So we heat up the canola oil.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.011
- [Mark] Does it have to
be canola oil or can it be?

00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:44.036
- Does not have to be, can be corn oil,

00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:46.809
or bean oil, or sunflower seed.

00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:50.778
Just any oil which can
bear the high temperature.

00:10:50.778 --> 00:10:54.131
The ginger, star anise
and a Sichuan pepper.

00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:58.957
So with the ginger, I just cut
it into big chunks like that.

00:10:58.957 --> 00:11:00.401
This is good.

00:11:00.401 --> 00:11:03.401
So I'm putting all the spice inside.

00:11:07.184 --> 00:11:10.572
We need to give the spice
a little bit of time

00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:13.046
to release the flavor.

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:16.036
- You want to heat that
oil over a medium size heat

00:11:16.036 --> 00:11:18.069
until it is smoking point.

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:21.123
Also monitor those spices cause
you don't want them to burn.

00:11:21.123 --> 00:11:23.401
That smells ridiculously good.

00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:25.318
- So I'm taking it out.

00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:30.035
So I've already turned off the heat.

00:11:30.035 --> 00:11:33.318
And now its a little bit too hot.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:36.977
We need it to be a little bit
burnt but if its too burnt,

00:11:36.977 --> 00:11:39.550
too hot, it will also burn a bit too much.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.883
So now we do the first time.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.547
You see only the top, the
surface, the color changes.

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:58.280
The bottom is just now gets wet.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.689
So I mix it and second time I
will make sure all the chili

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:04.856
is soaking in the hot oil.

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:14.863
Okay, so now this is the
second time, as you can smell.

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:26.284
So that is how we make the chili oil.

00:12:27.118 --> 00:12:28.418
- Its not immediately ready to eat.

00:12:28.418 --> 00:12:31.916
You have to bottle it
and wait at least one day

00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:33.273
before the flavors settle and mingle

00:12:33.273 --> 00:12:35.914
for it to be more fragrant, more aromatic.

00:12:35.914 --> 00:12:38.183
And that chili oil is one

00:12:38.183 --> 00:12:41.100
of the greatest ingredients of all.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.263
We gonna get started
cooking the wok dishes now.

00:12:45.263 --> 00:12:46.786
We're gonna make a fish eggplant,

00:12:46.786 --> 00:12:49.842
that's actually vegetarian,
which is a Sichuan dish.

00:12:49.842 --> 00:12:52.009
And also Kung Pow chicken.

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:01.045
Pickled chilies, garlic.

00:13:04.558 --> 00:13:07.324
And this is pre-cooked eggplant already.

00:13:07.324 --> 00:13:09.574
Make sure you stir that up.

00:13:12.172 --> 00:13:14.755
Pour in the corn starch around.

00:13:19.572 --> 00:13:22.398
Take this over to the clay pot.

00:13:22.398 --> 00:13:24.398
(music)

00:13:27.757 --> 00:13:30.697
Put all of this, oh it
looks like that eggplant

00:13:30.697 --> 00:13:34.067
is just going to be melt-in-your-mouth.

00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:37.567
And then stick the clay pot onto the fire.

00:13:41.317 --> 00:13:42.676
Okay we're getting
started on the next dish

00:13:42.676 --> 00:13:44.221
which is kung pow chicken.

00:13:44.221 --> 00:13:47.054
This is cooking wine, corn starch.

00:13:56.523 --> 00:13:58.263
We're just cooking the
chicken halfway now,

00:13:58.263 --> 00:14:00.924
then its back into the bowl.

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:04.174
The dry chilies and the Sichuan pepper.

00:14:15.505 --> 00:14:16.519
We're sitting down for lunch now.

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.638
Got the kung pow chicken,
got the eggplant.

00:14:18.638 --> 00:14:20.362
Got rice of course.

00:14:20.362 --> 00:14:22.195
Oh, and got chili oil.

00:14:23.215 --> 00:14:24.612
Okay let me begin with
the kung pow chicken

00:14:24.612 --> 00:14:25.795
while its nice and hot.

00:14:25.795 --> 00:14:27.669
Got the peanuts in here, got the chilies.

00:14:27.669 --> 00:14:32.190
Oh, oh I got the Sichuan
pepper in that bite.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.006
Pair that with the rice.

00:14:35.006 --> 00:14:36.796
This would definitely be even more amazing

00:14:36.796 --> 00:14:38.463
with some chili oil.

00:14:44.003 --> 00:14:48.734
Its not spicy, but its so
fragrant and so aromatic.

00:14:48.734 --> 00:14:51.236
Then back to the eggplant.

00:14:51.236 --> 00:14:53.585
I put the eggplant right onto the rice.

00:14:53.585 --> 00:14:55.452
Scoop it out.

00:14:55.452 --> 00:14:57.452
(music)

00:15:04.182 --> 00:15:05.298
Its comfort food.

00:15:05.298 --> 00:15:08.962
Micah's having some kung pow chicken too.

00:15:08.962 --> 00:15:10.962
(music)

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:21.211
That was a lot of fun.

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:23.070
I especially am really
excited that I learned

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.237
how to make Lu-Shi's chili oil recipe.

00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:29.204
I'm gonna be making that for sure.

00:15:29.204 --> 00:15:31.044
So from here, we're gonna
take a little bit of a rest

00:15:31.044 --> 00:15:32.124
this afternoon.

00:15:32.124 --> 00:15:34.954
And then for dinner tonight,
we have another special dinner.

00:15:34.954 --> 00:15:38.486
We're gonna be eating a
beef hotpot Yunnanese style

00:15:38.486 --> 00:15:40.986
that's served in a copper pot.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.409
- Frank told me you love meat.

00:15:47.409 --> 00:15:48.992
- Yes, I love meat.

00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:52.112
What's the name of this restaurant.

00:15:52.112 --> 00:15:54.945
- Okay, so here this restaurant is

00:15:56.385 --> 00:15:58.909
is a restaurant from Bow shan,

00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:01.888
and which like this city
is on the way to Burma,

00:16:01.888 --> 00:16:03.555
so its west to Dali.

00:16:04.424 --> 00:16:05.757
Yellow cow meat.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.063
- Yellow cow meat?

00:16:08.063 --> 00:16:08.896
- Yes.

00:16:25.797 --> 00:16:27.918
- And you've got to go the
front to make your own sauce.

00:16:27.918 --> 00:16:29.885
Which is the dipping sauce,
you can mix and match.

00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:32.645
So I'm gonna go up
front and make my sauce.

00:16:32.645 --> 00:16:33.478
Do you mix everything?

00:16:33.478 --> 00:16:35.592
- [Li-Shu] Everything.

00:16:35.592 --> 00:16:37.239
- A little bit of everything?

00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:39.895
Okay, so this is called, what
is this one called again?

00:16:39.895 --> 00:16:41.356
- [Li-Shu] Fish mint herb.

00:16:41.356 --> 00:16:42.656
- Fish mint herb.

00:16:42.656 --> 00:16:45.626
So it has a fishy taste
even though its an herb.

00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:46.959
Its a vegetable.

00:16:49.219 --> 00:16:51.386
And we've got some garlic.

00:16:53.872 --> 00:16:55.622
Some crushed chilies.

00:16:58.052 --> 00:16:59.881
This one is fermented tofu.

00:16:59.881 --> 00:17:02.294
How much of this should I add?

00:17:02.294 --> 00:17:03.127
A little bit?

00:17:03.127 --> 00:17:05.794
A little bit will go a long way.

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:10.532
Soy sauce.

00:17:13.247 --> 00:17:15.497
(mumbling)

00:17:23.772 --> 00:17:26.262
- I'm going to put the
Shitake mushroom inside

00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:31.001
because this one gives a
lot of flavor for the broth.

00:17:31.001 --> 00:17:33.636
- Its really an incredibly
beautiful hot pot.

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.969
Its beef, its full of beef
slices, its bubbling away.

00:17:36.969 --> 00:17:38.438
There's pumpkin in there.

00:17:38.438 --> 00:17:40.515
And then we just added
in the Shitake mushrooms

00:17:40.515 --> 00:17:41.765
and the radish.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.677
- It also dissolves the tofu.

00:17:48.727 --> 00:17:51.219
- Oh yeah and there's that
hunk of fermented tofu

00:17:51.219 --> 00:17:54.218
which almost looks like a block of cheese.

00:17:54.218 --> 00:17:57.411
And that's also in my sauce mixture here.

00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:58.828
Stir this around.

00:18:03.439 --> 00:18:04.988
Look at that sauce,
that sauce is beautiful.

00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:07.240
This is a sauce I just want to marinate

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.980
in there for a little while.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.147
That is chunky, beautiful.

00:18:13.508 --> 00:18:14.341
Oh, wow!

00:18:17.474 --> 00:18:22.179
Oh that beef is tender and
stringy and so flavorful.

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:24.577
And that sauce is incredible.

00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:26.760
All of those things we mixed together.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.894
That's such a depth of flavor,
so many things going on.

00:18:28.894 --> 00:18:31.253
Its a little spicy.

00:18:31.253 --> 00:18:36.074
You can taste that tofu, it
really does have a salty,

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.324
almost cheesy flavor to it.

00:18:43.024 --> 00:18:44.445
And with that Sichuan, there's
a little bit of Sichuan

00:18:44.445 --> 00:18:47.475
pepper in there too, oh that sauce is,

00:18:47.475 --> 00:18:51.142
its remarkable, its
just loaded with flavor.

00:18:59.677 --> 00:19:01.677
(music)

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:11.380
The mushroom's amazing, it has
a beautiful bounciness to it.

00:19:14.155 --> 00:19:15.238
Just so pure.

00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:23.723
- This is a special type of tofu.

00:19:23.723 --> 00:19:26.723
Only from Yunnan, not anywhere else.

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:31.872
And in Chinese we call it au-jung tofu.

00:19:31.872 --> 00:19:33.247
- We're waiting for that tofu to cook

00:19:33.247 --> 00:19:34.728
but it just needs a few minutes.

00:19:34.728 --> 00:19:37.730
But I just cannot get over the beef

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.431
and the shitake mushrooms,
that combination.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.186
And then of course the hot
pot just keeps simmering away

00:19:44.186 --> 00:19:47.174
and as it keeps simmering,
more and more flavors build up

00:19:47.174 --> 00:19:52.014
and you can see that kind of
layer of beef oil fat on top.

00:19:52.014 --> 00:19:55.264
And oh man, its just a beautiful thing.

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:01.932
(music)

00:20:04.982 --> 00:20:06.607
What's interesting about
this tofu is that the more

00:20:06.607 --> 00:20:08.847
you cook it the more it becomes soft

00:20:08.847 --> 00:20:12.740
and it can actually completely
liquefy if you overcook it.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.736
So right now is the
perfect time to eat it,

00:20:14.736 --> 00:20:18.218
its been simmering for
about four minutes or so.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.443
And you can see these chunks of tofu.

00:20:20.443 --> 00:20:21.846
You dip it into the sauce and the tofu

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.929
just soaks everything up.

00:20:25.089 --> 00:20:26.414
Oh look at that!

00:20:26.414 --> 00:20:28.997
And I'm gonna take some up too.

00:20:32.729 --> 00:20:37.548
It sort of dissolves and
its sort of like melty.

00:20:37.548 --> 00:20:39.631
And these are pea shoots.

00:20:42.172 --> 00:20:46.339
- Usually I put glass noodle
in the end of hot pot.

00:20:48.805 --> 00:20:50.805
(music)

00:20:59.828 --> 00:21:03.578
- Again, everything has
to go into the sauce.

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:08.300
Mmmm.

00:21:10.984 --> 00:21:13.980
You're just looking at some
noodles from the hot pot.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.563
Oh wow, the pea sprouts
are amazing though.

00:21:18.441 --> 00:21:19.283
- [Woman] Its too long.

00:21:19.283 --> 00:21:21.197
- Oh let me help you.

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.864
- [Woman] Thank you.

00:21:27.168 --> 00:21:29.409
- They have a natural sweetness

00:21:29.409 --> 00:21:32.010
as well as a natural nuttiness.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.338
Mmm, really really good.

00:21:34.338 --> 00:21:38.338
And then, since that's
been boiling for so long,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.548
it really has like an oily
beefiness to it now our hot pot.

00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:47.381
That makes everything even better.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.030
Mmm, hmmm, vegetables amazing.

00:22:05.278 --> 00:22:08.447
All I can do right now is
just sit back and relax.

00:22:08.447 --> 00:22:12.030
That was an impressively
delicious hot pot.

00:22:14.871 --> 00:22:16.603
We made it back to the hotel.

00:22:16.603 --> 00:22:18.940
That was just another stunner of a meal.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.342
That hot pot was sensational
and what a way to end

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:25.812
another impressive day
and a sensational day

00:22:25.812 --> 00:22:29.593
of eating in Dali, around Dali and Yunnan.

00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:32.075
I want to say a huge thank
you to Lu-Shi for taking

00:22:32.075 --> 00:22:34.567
us around and also to Zouba Tours.

00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:38.218
Frank from Zouba tours,
he arranged everything.

00:22:38.218 --> 00:22:39.564
