00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to Landmarks in Physics.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm Andy Brown, the instructor for this course,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and here we are, on location in Siracusa, Italy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This course is really designed for anyone.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you have no background in physics but know a little bit of algebra,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you're going to succeed in the course.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In Unit 1, we're going to begin with a question that fascinated the Greeks--how big is our planet?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Today, it's easy to answer that question.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You can go to Google and type "what is the circumference of the earth?"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But 2,000 years ago the Greeks didn't have Google.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Still, a man named Eratosthenes was able to answer this question using nothing more

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
than some basic assumptions about the earth and the sun

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
along with an understanding of geometry, trigonometry and shadows.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In this unit, we'll learn everything we need to answer this question ourselves,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and in doing so, we'll learn some of the important mathematical tools

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that we'll be using throughout the course.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
By the end of this unit, you'll be able to go outside on a sunny day

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and estimate the circumference of the earth yourself.
