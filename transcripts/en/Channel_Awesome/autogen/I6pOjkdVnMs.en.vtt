and then when it gets to this point I'm
 

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.230 align:start position:0%
and then when it gets to this point I'm
like<00:10:39.769><c> you're</c><00:10:39.980><c> right</c><00:10:40.009><c> he's</c><00:10:40.459><c> really</c><00:10:40.699><c> not</c><00:10:40.910><c> a</c><00:10:40.939><c> good</c>

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
dumbing it down a little bit serve
 

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.499 align:start position:0%
dumbing it down a little bit serve
allows<00:10:49.040><c> it</c><00:10:49.339><c> where</c><00:10:49.519><c> then</c><00:10:49.730><c> it</c><00:10:49.850><c> fools</c><00:10:50.089><c> you</c><00:10:50.300><c> and</c>
