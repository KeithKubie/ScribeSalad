<u>don't smell</u>
I'm like,
anything, I don't knoÁand

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:04.404
then every once and a while like
"Carboni!" "Go!"

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:07.875
"Carboni! Pete!" "Please
just go!"

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:17.951
(music)

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:27.961
(music)

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:52.553
Do you guys have that friend
that everybody has and as
soon as they start

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:56.023
dating somebody they just are
not your friend anymore they

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.792
just disappear into the
relationship. So I had this

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.561
friend Pete, ok, Pete Carboni.
he gets like that. When Pete

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:04.898
Carboni has a girlfriend he's
a no-call-returning
motherfucker,

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.867
like you can just call him
twenty times you won't get

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.437
anything back so he was dating
this girl once named Kelly and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.506
we didn't talk for like a year
and at some point you're like

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.676
"Alright, I'll fucking hang
out when you break up, see you

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.446
in eight months." You know, you
just know at some point,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.616
that's their pattern. So Pete
called me one day and he goes

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.252
"Hey Ari, listen I broke up
with Kelly." And i was like,

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:28.255
"Fuck yeah, man.
congratulations." And he goes

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.424
"Listen", he owned up to it
he goes "Lsten, I've been a

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.292
bad friend and I'm sorry. And
I want to make it up to you so I

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:38.365
got some mushrooms so I think we
should do these mushrooms to

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.668
rekindle our friendship. And I
was like "Dude, Pete, you

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.403
don't have to do that man,
I'm just happy to have you

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.173
back in my life. Just to have
you around again is good enough,

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:50.210
but I will be there in four
minutes because let's do these

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:53.714
mushrooms. I had never done
them before, have you guys ever

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:56.183
done them before by round of
applause? (cheers) Ok, cool a

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.752
few of you have. At the time I
had never done them so I was

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.587
worried, we didn't know like
how long it would take to kick

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.123
in, none of this stuff. So we
asked our drug dealer cause

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.359
that's what you're supposed
to do. Always ask your drug

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:07.294
dealer for advice they have a
vested interest in keeping you

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:11.465
safe. They want you to come back
and our drug dealer said it

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.401
would take thirty minutes to
kick in so we were like perfect,

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.903
here's what we're gonna do.
We're going to take these

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.205
mushrooms, we're going to go
to the Third Street Promenade
in

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.874
Santa Monica where there's no
cars and we can walk around and

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:24.611
have a great time. So we took
them, we drove to the Third

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.180
Street Promenade. It's like a
five minute drive from his

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:31.618
house. Anyways, maybe three
minutes on the way, this car
passed us,

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:34.855
just this other car on a two
lane street just passed us and

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:39.927
we laughed so hard at that. We
were just like "dude

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.567
(indistinctÓ and at one point
one of us was like. "wait this

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.107
doesn't seem that funny" and
we're like "yeah it's not

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.210
that funny- ohhh we're on
mushrooms, we're tripping out

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:58.312
right now, they've kicked in.
Way too early. Why did we trust

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.348
our drug dealer?" So we're
like we have to park
immediately.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.451
So we're driving to a free
parking lot but right then we

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.587
passed a five dollar parking lot
and he was like "We should

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.058
pull over here." And I was
like "yes, we should." but
even on

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:16.096
mushrooms my judaism does not
leave me. Free, exactly, is

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:24.171
always less money than some
money. So we thought better be

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.573
safe than sorry, let's go to
this free parking lot. We got

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:33.247
maybe two blocks of the six
blocks we had left and I looked

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.148
over and we were in traffic and
I looked over and saw a tree in

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:36.550
the sidewalk on the other side
of the street and I thought

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:39.987
"man that tree needs some
friends. And if he was born in

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:43.390
the forest he'd have tons of
friends. but he wasn't he was

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:47.494
born in the fucking sidewalk,
and he's got nobody" and I

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:49.329
turned to pete and I'm like
"Hey man you thinking what

00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:53.867
I'm thinking?" and he was
like. "wait, what, no!

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:55.435
There's like a billion
thoughts you could have, I'm

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.338
definitely not thinking what
you're thinking. The odds

00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:02.042
of that are just crazy, it's
mind blowing, for instance,

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:05.045
I'm thinking we should go hug
that tree." "That's

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:09.149
exactly what I was thinking!
that's the exact thing!" But

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:11.118
he's like "ok, but let's
not get out here because if we

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.954
get out in the middle of street
it will be weird that we're

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.057
just abandoning our car in the
middle lane, so i was like

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:19.059
"cool let's go to the free
parking lot" so we went to the

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.595
free parking lot, forgot about
the tree instantly, and as we

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.665
were leaving I took my phone and
was like, "should I have this

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:27.100
with me?" I didn't know what
mushrooms were, I had this

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:30.170
thought that if somebody, like
the wrong person texted me I was

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:32.306
going to freak out. Like if my
mom texted me I'd just be like

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:36.243
"ah, you know!" and fucking
chuck my phone. So I just left

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.845
it in the car. I didn't want
to deal with it, That doesn't

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:39.646
happen, you shouldn't leave
your phone in the car, but

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.915
that's not what happened. So
we got out, went to the Third

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.218
Street Promenade. Now, the Third
Street Promenade, if you

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:47.221
haven't been there, is full of
families. You feel like a real

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:50.991
degenerate. You're like
"I'm on mushrooms, and

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:55.262
that's a four year old." So
we both felt kinda weird and

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.864
were just like "let's get
out of here, let's go see a

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.298
movie." So we sat down, got a
bunch of popcorn, sat down in

00:04:58.332 --> 00:04:59.900
this movie theatre and we were
like "This is going to be

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:04.338
awesome" and then the Bruno
trailer came on and man we

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:06.373
laughed so hard. People are
worried about mushrooms but you

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.242
just laugh, we laughed. We just
laughed for the first half of

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:14.815
that preview. And then Pete
Carboni, he just starts rustling

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:16.650
with his jacket, he has his
jacket on, he just starts

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:19.720
rustling with it like this over
and over again. And I'm over

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:21.188
here looking at him and I'm
like, I don't want to say

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:24.424
anything, but he's been doing
that for a while. And then all

00:05:24.458 --> 00:05:29.830
of a sudden he just stands up
and he just walks out. And I was

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:34.635
like "fuck yeah, Pete's
feeling it." So I enjoyed the

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.538
rest of the preview myself, it
was amazing. Movie started, Pete

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.274
didn't come back, and I was
like "Where the fuck is he, I

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.075
thought he went to the bathroom
or something. I was like, "I

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.578
should go check for him, but I
don't wanna miss this movie,

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.247
it's pretty amazing
already." And, to tell you

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:51.852
what happened to Pete Carboni,
ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Pete

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:56.590
Carboni, everybody let him hear
it.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:06:02.029
So it was about halfway
through the trailer...

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:04.498
[laughter]

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.835
To the movie <i>Bruno</i>

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:11.438
that I started
to feel sadder

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:16.443
than I've ever felt
in my life before.

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.045
I think what was
going through my mind is,

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:19.046
I was laughing
at the trailer.

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:21.114
I found it really funny,
and I was like,

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:23.317
"Yeah, this guy Sacha Baron
Cohen's a really funny dude.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.886
He's doing really well
in his career," you know?

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.956
And then I started to think
of my own career as a comedian,

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:31.558
and I started to get
a little bit sad.

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:33.727
And that thought just
spiraled me

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.630
and propelled me
out of that room.

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:39.066
I had that feeling
that you have,

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:43.070
like, right before you're about
to cry hysterically.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.139
I mean, am I right, fellas?
Yeah?

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:50.577
And I was in a dark place
in my life.

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:53.914
I'd just gotten out of this
on-again, off-again

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:57.551
embattled relationship
with this girl Kelly.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.420
And Kelly would use
the off-again portion

00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:02.222
of our relationship

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:07.160
to have sex
with some of my friends.

00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:10.831
Yes, and this would
often inspire me

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.332
to take her back again,
you know,

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:16.069
to stop that
from happening,

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:19.173
which would make us
more embattled, you know?

00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:20.774
Which would make me
break up with her.

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.743
The whole thing--it's what
an economist might call

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:27.581
a vicious cycle.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.716
So I--like, I got to get
out of here.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.385
I'm just not
in a good place.

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:36.857
So I jump into a cab,
and I say, "551 Sawtelle,"

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.060
and the guy must have
misheard me.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.695
So he turned around,

00:07:41.728 --> 00:07:44.331
and he was like,
"Uh, which hotel?"

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:46.433
And normally,

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:51.138
I think I would be able to
resolve this misunderstanding.

00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:55.075
But in the condition I was in,
all I could think to do was,

00:07:55.108 --> 00:08:00.581
I pointed in the direction
of my apartment,

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:01.849
and I just was like, "Go!

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:04.518
Ari: So I thought I should go
out and see if Pete Carboni is

00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:07.788
in the lobby. And I also had
this other problem where I
became

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:12.526
positive that I had peed my
pants. And it's dark in a movie
theatre

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:16.930
and I couldn't see so I was just
trying to feel for it, just like
this

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.668
in the fucking begining of
public enemies. Looking at other

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:23.637
people just like "no, it's not
what you think, I just"

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:29.576
Like, they'll never understand.
I just pissed myself and I just
wanted to check.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.846
It's not what you think, it's
nothing bad. And I couldn't feel
any liquid and I was like

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.183
alright maybe I didn't pee
myself. And I was like you know
what, here's what I'll do,

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:40.654
I'll go outside, in the lobby in
the light and see if I have a
pee stain, and that's

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.924
how I'll find Carboni if he's
out there.

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:47.528
Pete: Please, just go!"

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.497
And so the guy just starts
driving in that direction,

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:51.832
and I'm like,
"Okay, I'm on my way home,"

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.334
and then we got
to a stop sign.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:55.836
And it's a weird thing.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.070
When you're on mushrooms,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.238
it messes with your sense
of time, you know?

00:08:58.272 --> 00:08:59.873
So it felt like I was at this
stop sign for, like, a year.

00:08:59.907 --> 00:09:02.309
It felt awful.

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:03.644
And so I couldn't help my--
and I just start going,

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.078
"Go!
Please!

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:07.714
Please go!
Just go!"

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:09.316
And then the guy
would drive faster,

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:12.419
and then he'd get
to the next stoplight sooner.

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:16.023
And then I'd yell "go" again.

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:18.025
I mean, this is another
vicious cycle

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.126
I found myself in.

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:22.162
So I got out of the cab.
I told him to stop, got out.

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:24.498
And I gave him 100 bucks.

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:30.070
And then I turned,
and I just started running.

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:34.575
And I was running down
Bundy Avenue,

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:39.046
which if you don't know is
basically a four-lane highway.

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:43.684
And it's probably too big
of a street to be running down,

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:45.352
dressed like this,

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:46.920
as fast as you can

00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:49.256
while you're crying
hysterically,

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:50.791
Ari: So I went outside, I
looked, I didn't see him right
away.

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:53.293
I was like "Oh, let' me check my
pee stain." I looked, I didn't
see a stain

00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:57.130
I was like "Oh, fuck yeah. Maybe
I didn't pee myself at all."

00:09:57.164 --> 00:10:07.174
But then I was like, "wait, what
if I peed, so much, that the
entire thing

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:09.309
is just one big pee stain."

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:11.178
Pete: as I'm running,
I notice ahead of me

00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:14.081
a hole, like,
in a fence.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:17.417
And so my instinct is just to go
through this hole in the fence.

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:20.988
So I just jumped--
I sort of slide through,

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:25.559
and I wind up in,
like, this suburban backyard.

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:28.128
And there's some dude
who's, like,

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:32.933
reading a paper
on his back porch

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.436
as I come in
in my sad state.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.673
And I was like, "I'm just...

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:41.608
I'm gonna try
the honesty approach."

00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:43.610
I walk up to the guy.

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:46.813
I'm like,
"Uh, excuse me, sir?

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:52.119
"I'm very sorry,
but I'm feeling very sick.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:57.224
Do you think that maybe
you could drive me home?"

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.826
And shockingly,
this guy says yes.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.529
Ari: So I'm out in the lobby of
the Loews going like this just

00:11:02.563 --> 00:11:05.766
trying to fucking smell.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.701
Pete: And we got in his car,
and, you know,

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:15.142
he starts driving,
but then he gets to a stop sign.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:16.610
And I'm just out of control.

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:18.812
I'm like,
"Man, just go!

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:20.347
Ari: I'm like "I don't smell
anything. I don't know."

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.350
And then every once and a while
just like "Carboni!"

00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:25.452
Please!
Just go!"

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:26.987
"Carboni! Pete!"

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:29.256
And then I was like "alright I
should go find him. I don't know
where he is.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:30.958
but I should find him. But I was
like wait what if he comes back
here, let's just

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:33.727
make the movies the home base.
So I watched the movie and every
few minutes I was like

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.231
"Where the fuck is Pete".

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:40.868
Until finally I felt so bad.
I'm just like, this degenerate.

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:45.806
Doing mushrooms on a Monday
morning.

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:49.943
And I jump out of his car,
and I throw $200 at him.

00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:52.446
And he--he says to me.

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:54.681
He's like, "Man, I just
drove you, like, five blocks.

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:56.617
It's really"--
And I was like, "Just take it!"

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.353
And then
I just started running.

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:02.823
And I ran
all the way home.

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:08.228
And when I got home, I started
to feel a little bit lonely,

00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:12.833
and I started to rethink things
with Kelly, you know?

00:12:12.866 --> 00:12:14.067
It's like,
you know, yeah,

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.137
she slept with a few
of my friends.

00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:18.572
Okay.

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:20.073
Maybe I can
just take that as,

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:23.877
she finds my friends
really charming and attractive.

00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:26.079
In a way,
that's like a compliment.

00:12:26.113 --> 00:12:27.781
Ari: At the end of the movie
everybody stood up to leave

00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:32.119
and I saw this kid, this 18 year
old kid. He was with his
grandparents and they stood up

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:34.655
and they were discussing the
movie they just saw,

00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:37.090
and it was so beautiful.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.860
So I called her,
and I asked her to come over,

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:41.261
Ari: I was overcome with
emotion.

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:43.564
I was like, this kid is still
spending time with his
grandparents

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:45.499
that's so fucking wonderful.

00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:48.602
And when she got there,
I begged her to take me back,

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:49.870
and she did.

00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:51.438
I was almost like getting choked
up, I was like "my grandparents

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:55.108
are all gone, I'll never get a
chance to see public enemies
with them."

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:59.580
Pete: And then I kissed her, so
passionately.

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:03.317
As so many of my friends had
done before me.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.452
Ari: But anyway, I pick up the
phone and call Pete.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.621
And then my phone rang,

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:10.157
and it was Ari.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:15.963
I was like, "Oh, yeah.
That's right.

00:13:16.063 --> 00:13:19.233
"Like, we were supposed to be
doing mushrooms today

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:21.068
"to rekindle
our friendship

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:24.304
because I've been
such a bad friend."

00:13:24.338 --> 00:13:30.477
"Oh no".

00:13:30.511 --> 00:13:33.213
And, Ari, do you remember
what you said?

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:34.948
(Ari)
Yeah, I was worried about you.

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:37.084
So I was like--I was like,
"Hey, are you okay?"

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:41.488
Yeah, and I thought
he was gonna attack me,

00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:43.724
which would've been
the right thing to do.

00:13:43.757 --> 00:13:46.159
And then I was like,
"You know"--

00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:47.828
I don't know
how to tell him this,

00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:50.230
so I was like, "Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.

00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:53.000
I'm here with Kelly."

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.434
Yeah, I forgot
about that.

00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:55.536
You were like,
"I'm here with Kelly.

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:56.737
We got back together,"
but I was like...

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.105
[sighs]

00:13:58.138 --> 00:14:00.040
"All right, well,
at least you're all right."

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.309
(Pete)
Yeah, he was
a good sport about it.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:05.045
And then you--not only that,
then he says to me.

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:08.482
He's like, "Hey, man,
I just want to let you know

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.717
that I love you."

00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:11.919
(Ari)
I do.

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:13.520
I was really concerned
for you.

00:14:13.554 --> 00:14:16.156
Yeah, and I was, like,
overwhelmed with--

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.791
I was like--
That was so nice of you.

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:19.393
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.161
I wouldn't have been
that way.

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:22.429
Let me ask you
a question.

00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:24.231
(Pete)
What's that?

00:14:24.264 --> 00:14:26.633
Why--why did you have
$300 on you?

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:30.904
[laughter and applause]

00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:32.639
I think I figured that
I was doing something

00:14:32.673 --> 00:14:34.308
sort of adventurous
that, like,

00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:37.311
I should probably bring
emergency funds.

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:38.512
- You know?
- No, it's--

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:39.646
Just to be safe.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.182
You don't need emergency funds
for a mushroom trip.

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:45.419
Oh, yeah,
but didn't I need them?

00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:48.322
[laughter]

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:49.523
Wouldn't you say
that I needed them?

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:50.924
Yeah, you're right.
You're right, you did.

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.926
And I'm glad
you're safe, man.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.394
I'm glad you're safe
as well.

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:56.163
Thanks.
Pete Carboni, everybody.

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:56.263
Pete Carboni.
