You're listening to radio lab from public radio,W , N, Y, s,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.000
e, n, n, p. R.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.193
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.720
<v 1>today's show. You ever heard of this? It's about choice.</v>

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.900
I don't know what to expect. I believe you're about to see a miracle.

6
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.830
And we thought we would start things off in a parking lot in sunny Berkeley,

7
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:32.400
California with a psychologist. I'm Barry Schwartz.

8
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:36.630
I'm a professor of psychology at Swarthmore college where I have been teaching

9
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:40.470
since 1971 the only job I ever applied for.

10
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:45.471
So I think deep down in my past I appreciated the value of simplifying one's

11
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.320
options. Even wrote a book about it called the paradox of choice.

12
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:53.310
And to illustrate that paradox he brought us to, well,

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.150
you'll see it very, will you give us a visual as to what we're doing.

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.170
So we were about to walk into Berkeley's very famous Berkeley Bowl,

15
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.290
<v 0>which is a supermarket,</v>

16
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.140
very unusual when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables. Wow. Has a selection.

17
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.350
I'm like any I've ever seen in my life. Could you describe your first of,

18
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.820
I see just fields of oranges.

19
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.770
So we've got navel orange,

20
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.470
Valencia juice aren't Texas Valencia juice, our organic neighbor,

21
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.630
the old 10 JZ Tangerine have large naval on small phone.

22
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.310
They Redmond at us Moodle suburban and large gala with Washington Pacific road,

23
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:36.170
Hawaiian plant, those delicious

24
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.193
[inaudible].

25
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.580
We have freedom of choice with respect to every yellow line and you see it in

26
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:53.900
every area of life in romantic relationships. Marge of Vaginas.

27
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.250
When I was growing up,

28
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:58.250
the answer to the question should I get married was obvious.

29
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.850
The answer to the question when was which Lez of course, of course.

30
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:04.530
And as soon as possible. Well now there are no different.

31
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.410
Every imaginable lifestyle is available. You can be gay, straight bi, Zack,

32
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.500
look at the seedless grapes, a late, late, more apples.

33
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.620
The sense that there are a million opportunities for you.

34
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.860
You can make your own rules. The shots overwhelming.

35
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.463
Okay?

36
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.980
<v 2>Counseling centers,</v>

37
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:32.580
psych services centers and universities are bursting at the scenes.

38
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.770
Why? These are the most privileged kids ever.

39
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.490
The schools are giving them everything they could possibly want and they are

40
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.330
banging down the doors because they are so screwed up. Why? What's going on?

41
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.950
And the answer is people don't know what to do.

42
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.540
They don't know how to choose.

43
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:55.530
They can't face a world in which everything is available.

44
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.660
And I see this in the college, it's, it's,

45
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.650
it's heartbreaking to see these incredibly talented college seniors who we

46
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.160
haven't given every opportunity to do what ever they want.

47
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.140
Terrified at graduation. They know that this is a stage in life.

48
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.560
We're walking through one door means they gonna hear a lot of other doors slam

49
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.330
shut. It can't bear the thought that they may walk through the wrong door.

50
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.830
It's choice. [inaudible] it is. It's the disease of of modernity.

51
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.550
<v 1>This is right. Well this is, come on,</v>

52
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.580
go ahead and let's do the show. But I say come on in reservation.

53
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.570
What do you wife? Well,

54
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:38.340
because like people from Swarthmore college get to pay like $45,000 a year for

55
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:42.230
the privilege of do they know that's a very, very rare slice of American. Yeah,

56
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.750
fine. You're right. You're right. Thanks. Come on. You have this too. I mean,

57
00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:49.830
how many speeds on your bike do you really need? Well, that's a different thing.

58
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:53.280
I mean, I don't need, I don't need 22 speeds. I happen to make do with five.

59
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.270
There you go. So there are some real questions here and I'm this hour,

60
00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:01.440
we're gonna look at choice, choice and decision making. When do we choose?

61
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:05.190
How do we choose the way? Do we choose the limits of choice, of choice,

62
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.280
of choose limits? What's up Jews on Radiolab? I've Jetta Ivan,

63
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.070
Ryan, Robert Krulwich, Steve at this bitches

64
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.783
<v 3>know</v>

65
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.163
[inaudible]

66
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.180
<v 1>okay to begin. Oh, you ready? Yup. He says, let me just ask the basic question.</v>

67
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:30.720
A basic question, which is, okay, so a lot of choice can be bad,

68
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:34.020
but clearly we need some choice. So what's the right amount? Actually,

69
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:37.490
how much can you really handle? Hmm. I asked that question very short.

70
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.433
<v 2>Well,</v>

71
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.390
there's a classic study in psychology from 50 years ago called the magic number

72
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:43.930
seven

73
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.020
<v 1>the magical number seven plus or minus two that's general there.</v>

74
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:47.920
Author of the book,

75
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:52.030
Proust was a neuroscientist and the new book called how we decide in the 50s he

76
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:55.870
says, I think like 1956 a guy named George Miller wondered about this.

77
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:57.970
How much could a human brain really hold?

78
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:00.490
So he conducted a series of memory tests,

79
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.630
ask people to memorize different sets of numbers, letters, musical notes.

80
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.950
And what Miller found out is that the average human could hold about seven

81
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.040
digits plus or minus two at any given moment in working memory.

82
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.180
When you say working memory,

83
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:17.150
you mean like a like what we can keep in our top of mind memory, right?

84
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.860
Not like memory memory, but the like, like Ram. Exactly. Random digits.

85
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.270
You can hold about seven plus or minus two and with practice people can can,

86
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.210
you know, really bump it up a bit with practice. Robert, with practice,

87
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.200
I'm still struggling with six, six, six, six, six, six, six.

88
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.900
And I think myself, I think I got the first floor.

89
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.280
I mean it's not an accident that that so many of these random digits we have to

90
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.060
memorize from phone numbers to social security numbers are seven plus or minus

91
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:43.894
two. Now,

92
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.900
the interesting thing is what happens to our decision making powers when you try

93
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:52.970
and get more than seven in your head? What you want me to shut the door? Yes.

94
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.110
Well, let me introduce you to someone. I'm a Baba. I'm a professor here at, uh,

95
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.780
the Stanford Graduate School of Business in marketing. A lot of my research,

96
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.160
it has to do with the brain and tricking people. Oh yeah, absolutely.

97
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.110
So Robert, I wanna tell you about one particular experiment that he did.

98
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.140
So the experiment is pretty straightforward. It goes like this.

99
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.630
You got a bunch of subjects together. He said, okay,

100
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:20.570
I'm going to give you all a number, your number and a little card.

101
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.240
You're gonna read the number and I want you to commit that number to memory.

102
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.370
Take as much time as you want to memorize the number.

103
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.060
And then he says you're not going to walk to the next room and recall the

104
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:29.480
number.

105
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.150
And that's what subjects think test subjects think that they're going to be

106
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:32.391
doing.

107
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:35.150
So they know they're going to be in one place getting a number of going to

108
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:37.790
another place with reciting that number. That's right. That's all they know.

109
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.570
That's all they know.

110
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.740
But they don't know is that not everybody is getting the same kind of number.

111
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.220
Some people get a seven digit numbers.

112
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.400
Some people get a two digit number that I can do. By the way,

113
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.680
I think I can do two digits. Yeah, I doubt it.

114
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.750
All the subjects have to do is they've got to memorize a number of walk out of

115
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:56.810
room one down the hall, have room to then recite their number.

116
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.330
Now just imagine you or me person with a two digit number in their head.

117
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.930
It was walking out of room one two is my number.

118
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:04.700
I can definitely remember this down the hall.

119
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.930
The same time someone with seven digits in their head,

120
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.910
two to eight walks down the hall.

121
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.140
Now here's where the trickery comes in as they're walking down the hall mid

122
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.030
memorizing all of a sudden skis me,

123
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.480
they pass silly lady in the hallway and she's holding something.

124
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.090
Sorry to interrupt you, but would you like a snack? Um Oh. Oh sure.

125
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.530
She says here have have a snack. Just as our,

126
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:29.870
as our way of saying thanks for participating in this study.

127
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.400
You can have one of two snacks.

128
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.400
You choose between a big fat slice of chocolate cake or be a nice bowl of fruit

129
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:42.110
salad. Meanwhile, they've both got these numbers still in their head.

130
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.020
Now here's the weird thing. When they finally make their choice,

131
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.680
what would you like? Some yummy cake or some healthy fruits and the people,

132
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.040
this is crazy. The people with two digits in their head. No, I love cake,

133
00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:56.760
but I think I'll take the fruit. Almost always choose the fruit. It's healthy.

134
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.270
Whereas the people with seven digits in their head almost always choose the

135
00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:05.160
cake. You know the cake? I want the cake and we're talking by huge margins here.

136
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.470
It was significant. I mean this was like in some cases,

137
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.160
2025 30 point difference. So, uh,

138
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.890
the meaning if you have seven digits in your head,

139
00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:17.730
you are twice as likely to truce cake than fruit twice.

140
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.600
So let's get on with this so that people with the seven that just get the cake.

141
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.440
I get that part.

142
00:08:22.441 --> 00:08:26.160
I don't know why exactly that doesn't interest you as to why they would choose

143
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.420
y. Okay, good. Now that I've got your interest, I would tell you the theory,

144
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.980
and this is where it gets interesting,

145
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.040
it seems that the brain is anatomically organized into different systems.

146
00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:40.350
Dual systems is what they're called going to Jonah.

147
00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:42.420
You have a rational deliberative system,

148
00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:45.420
which is sort of more to the front of the brain and then deeper in the brand.

149
00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:48.990
You have an emotional unconscious system. According to Jonah,

150
00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:51.540
these two systems are often at war,

151
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.480
and then there's constant competition between the rational brain and the

152
00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:58.890
emotional. Um, they're always competing for attention, um, and, and, and,

153
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:00.660
and to guide and direct your behavior,

154
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.320
especially when you have a tough choice like bother shifts, cake versus fruit.

155
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.040
There the competition is fierce.

156
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.280
Emotional automatic system is pushing them towards the cage.

157
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.480
The emotional brain loves sweet and gooey chocolate cake frosting.

158
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.830
That's really what you want your chocolate. Now, on the other hand,

159
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.730
the deliberative system other hand comes and says, wait a second,

160
00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.480
that you were thoughtful about this choice carefully.

161
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.490
This probably is not good for you because high fat content.

162
00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:35.070
Think about your waistlines. Think about your cholesterol.

163
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.510
Isn't that good for your help.

164
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.620
It is not good for yourself and that access a check.

165
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:45.360
But if you give that rational deliberative system, seven numbers,

166
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.800
just seven to memorize, one to two, eight, nine, three, six one, two,

167
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.350
one, two, two, eight, five, one, one.

168
00:09:55.351 --> 00:10:00.330
So two I should coalesced suddenly for the rational range as in you could do too

169
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:03.980
much to keep track of getting tired. Ooh,

170
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.820
it can't put up as much of a fight. Oh,

171
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.930
she means greater likelihood that the emotions will drive their choices.

172
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.780
The astounding thing here says Joan is not simply that, you know,

173
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:19.130
sometimes emotion wins of a reason. It's how easily it wins.

174
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.530
Seven numbers is all it takes to screw up reason. Just just,

175
00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:26.150
just think about how astonishingly limited that is. Yeah,

176
00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:30.680
I mean compared to a motion team reason is well,

177
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.460
pretty feeble and there's no way around it and we can kind of rage against the

178
00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:38.690
machine. But the brute fact is it's just one microchip and a big computer.

179
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.670
And when we always rely on it,

180
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.470
all the advice and decision making is stop and think. Slow down, take your time.

181
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.900
And yet when you actually look at the brain, um,

182
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.930
that that can lead you to rely on a feeble piece of machinery. All right,

183
00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:54.210
let me just offer it.

184
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.540
Admittedly in consequential case in point there we were at the Berkeley bowl in

185
00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:01.900
the apple ion, there were thousands and thousands of apples to choose from.

186
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.900
Okay. Not Down but a lot and Robert and I get in our heads,

187
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.741
we're going to choose,

188
00:11:05.741 --> 00:11:10.741
let's each choose an apple and Robert Being Robert decides like in six seconds

189
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.930
because it had this really cool name, Washington Pacific road. Zack,

190
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.600
I'm going to get this as me. I deliberate yet

191
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.820
maybe I should do it. Let's go to the organic. We're running out of time.

192
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.900
I lined up about 12 apples, compare them by rice size, color,

193
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.040
anything I can think of and eventually decided on a giant Korean apple pair,

194
00:11:36.041 --> 00:11:39.670
which was the only logical choice because it was bigger than his.

195
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.720
This is a nine pound app check. It is large. It was more expensive too.

196
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.840
89 check. Definitely way more original

197
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.050
check in. I figure as we're checking out game,

198
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.630
I am the winner.

199
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.200
But a couple hours later we get to the airport,

200
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.920
we have some time before our flight. I grab a plastic knife and cut the apples.

201
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.050
Do a taste. Okay. [inaudible] two three.

202
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.560
And guess who's apple is the best. I'm guessing this as apple. Oh,

203
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.370
much better apple. Ah hmm. So good.

204
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.240
Apple wins in every department. Gone. My Apple.

205
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.110
I don't even want to talk about why this doesn't taste like an apple at all.

206
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.770
It has a surprise. Was it a worm? That's a gigantic core.

207
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.710
Is that a core version? An animal living there anyhow,

208
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.560
according to Jonah where I went wrong. Yeah, you've used complete,

209
00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:38.420
you've short circuited your prefrontal cortex there.

210
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.080
The prefrontal Cortex is the right here in your forehead and that's where the

211
00:12:42.081 --> 00:12:43.100
irrational brain lives.

212
00:12:43.101 --> 00:12:46.400
And I just had given it to many things to keep track of all these apples.

213
00:12:46.401 --> 00:12:50.750
You can only hold so much data at one month, you know, any given moment. Um, so,

214
00:12:50.751 --> 00:12:52.340
so you can fix it on seven apples,

215
00:12:52.341 --> 00:12:55.820
but only one piece of information for each apple. How red they are or are shiny.

216
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.130
They are.

217
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.110
So you can't do seven apples with seven variables because then you've got 4,909

218
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:05.000
that's a weight. Exactly. But there is a bigger problem than brain fatigue.

219
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.320
If you asked Barry Schwartz,

220
00:13:06.321 --> 00:13:10.430
and it happens after you choose your plague with the possibility that you didn't

221
00:13:10.431 --> 00:13:15.260
do as well as you, you could don't regret. I'm lamenting what could have been,

222
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:16.271
hey rich,

223
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:19.960
I definitely felt at the airport and chances are you didn't do as well as you

224
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.250
could. Well does it? Therein lies the Rub. And if of a place like Berkeley Bowl,

225
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:29.490
you get seduced by an 11 pound apple that turns out to be a fake watermelon with

226
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:34.470
an anus. All right, so,

227
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.820
<v 4>oh, we now understand the problem that Barry proposes.</v>

228
00:13:37.821 --> 00:13:42.821
He says that if you have to make a choice to often the choice is the wrong one

229
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.560
cause your brain is too full of fat and hurts your head, your head,

230
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.830
or because if you make the choice, you then think, Ah Damn,

231
00:13:48.831 --> 00:13:51.860
I should've chosen otherwise. The regret problem, right?

232
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.940
There are ways to handle this. Our friend Oliver sacks,

233
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.790
Dr. Oliver Sacks and euro scientists at irregular on this program.

234
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.860
We were talking and I told him about this issue and he said,

235
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.340
I don't have the problem. What do you mean you don't have the problem as well?

236
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.601
I make,

237
00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:10.601
he says a willful choice that certain things I care about a lot and I worry over

238
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.500
it. And then others, all whole swath of my life that I just don't choose.

239
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.940
Yes. My housekeeper actually comes tomorrow and uh,

240
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.640
she will get half a gallon of soy milk,

241
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.740
half a gallon of prune juice and she will make a gallon or so of all ins.

242
00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:30.860
Jello is, she will make a large bowl of Tabouli.

243
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:36.080
She will get six or seven tins of sardines because I eat sardines with two every

244
00:14:36.081 --> 00:14:40.360
evening she would get seven apples in seven oranges, seven apple.

245
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.520
Why seven apples and seven. Okay.

246
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:47.650
Well because I'm also very greedy and impulsive and therefore I have to have a

247
00:14:48.171 --> 00:14:51.980
rule that I am permitted to eat an a day and a

248
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.020
<v 5>pair a day. Um, if I had 70 apples, I wa I, I would,</v>

249
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:57.860
I would eat them all.

250
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.170
So you have worked it out so that you are regulating yourself and somehow your

251
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.530
appetite has become unregulated in the meantime? Yes.

252
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:10.250
I never get bored with my food. Why not? That seems so boring.

253
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.010
Well, it, it, um, I don't find it boring. I am,

254
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.820
I enjoy it equally with equal Vallish every time.

255
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.950
If I were to sit down with you and describe to you a new candy, I don't know,

256
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.150
almond m and m's and I were to do it with all the talents that I could possibly

257
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:32.930
bring to description. So you would see the Nice Outer Candy Shell.

258
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.850
It would glisten, it would be sugary,

259
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.890
it would have this most delicious nut inside.

260
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.890
Would you not feel at all tempted to break the habit of years,

261
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:44.330
whatever your sweet is and just venture over to almond m and. M?

262
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.910
I would certainly try the almond m and. M,

263
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:51.170
but since you mentioned it with chocolate, there is a shop close to me,

264
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:54.500
which has broken 72% chocolate.

265
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.360
I go there each day. Um, indeed, I have a,

266
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.170
you with me, a single dollar in my pocket,

267
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.230
put that down and I say a dollars worth of 72 every day. Every day.

268
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.760
Neither more nor less.

269
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.530
Can you recall the moment when you somehow leaped from whatever your predecessor

270
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:20.531
chocolate routine was to these 72% a cocoa content?

271
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:26.090
Something wonderful must've happened on that day where you got yanked from the

272
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:29.800
deep Rut that you are in into the next deep rut. But I'm just curious what,

273
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.280
what happened on the day of change? I don't, I don't clearly recollect,

274
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:37.130
but I can tell you a day of negative change.

275
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.890
This again goes back to my carnivorous days when I got a thing about kidneys.

276
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.640
For some reason, you mean the Oregon or the p? No,

277
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.160
no. The, the organ hung on, you know, on you.

278
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.460
It was when I was at wisdom to at UCLA and I am as I now have sardines every

279
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:00.890
time for dinner. At that time, living in Topanga Canyon,

280
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.150
I would have kidneys and I would go to the farmer's market and I would buy my

281
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:10.100
weekly kidneys. But on one occasion, a strange mistake happened,

282
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.330
whether I made the mistake or whether I was misheard, I all,

283
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.920
instead of my usual two pounds of kidneys, I was given 22 pounds of killers.

284
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.720
And if a mistake has made, I'm too shy to say anything.

285
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.700
And I do embarrass to be such a Wimp, both of routine and of shyness. I mean,

286
00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:31.370
I think it's a double, it's a double duty there. Yes. Wow. Well, what the hell?

287
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.800
Anyhow, with these, I should of course a thrown away, uh,

288
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.760
this monstrous palpitating bag of kidneys.

289
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.800
Um,

290
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.700
but in the event I took it back to my little house in Topanga and then followed

291
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:55.650
an increasingly nightmarish period, um, in which I had kidneys for breakfast,

292
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.280
for lunch, kidneys stewed cares, sweet kidneys.

293
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.750
And finally, after about 10 days, by which time I'd eaten about 50 pounds.

294
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.880
I, I,

295
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.800
I'm an uncontrollable nausea and vomiting took a hold of me.

296
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.150
I literally are just the mind. Um, I think it was literally as well,

297
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:17.350
because I remember seeing bits of kidney and the format,

298
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.690
and I then threw out the west of the kidneys. And I've never had a kidney since

<v 5>Oliver sacks off author. Okay.</v>

301
00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.540
<v 6>Most recently the book Musicophilia</v>

302

<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

303
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.830
<v 1>What did he call those kidneys? Just bring younger. What is that?</v>

304
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.680
That's French for kidney. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Really? No kidding.

305
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.080
What's French for? Let's go to break. Oh five wow. Wow. No, but that's,

306
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.150
that's good bye for good meeting. We'll be right back. Okay. Coming up,

307
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:04.800
we have a story you will not believe about what happens behind the scenes at a

308
00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:08.670
casino when you are trying not to lose, but nonetheless we're getting gouged.

309
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.610
That's coming up behind radio lab. I'm Jad Abumrad.

310
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.140
I remembered Krulwich stay with us.

311

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.950
and this message.

316
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.700
<v 9>Hi, I'm Abby Jacobson</v>

317
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.220
<v 10>and you may know me from my fifth TV show, broad city,</v>

318
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.420
but before that I went to art school. And why am I telling you that? Well,

319
00:19:43.421 --> 00:19:47.200
it's because I have a podcast baby about art.

320
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.420
It's called a piece of work. It's a collab between me, w NYC studios and Moma.

321
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.230
I'll talk art with some of my friends like Questlove, Tavi, Gevinson,

322
00:19:56.231 --> 00:20:00.130
and RuPaul, and we'll consult some experts and learn some incredible things.

323
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.020
Listen

324
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.410
<v 9>to a piece of work with Abby Jacobson, wherever you get your podcasts.</v>

325
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.390
<v 1>Hello, I'm Chad up. I'm Ron and I remember crawling. This is radio lab.</v>

326
00:20:12.391 --> 00:20:14.520
Today's program is about choice. Yep.

327
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.880
How we choose why and wants his choice.

328
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.770
<v 4>Shoes. I'm actually, I'm going to dream of a,</v>

329
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.860
of the possibility one day of walking into a store and instead of being obsessed

330
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:32.411
and turned on by the beauty of an object or by the promise of an object or price

331
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.740
price of an Android,

332
00:20:33.741 --> 00:20:37.490
the status that would be conferred upon me if I chose or not conferred upon me,

333
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.380
all those messy emotions. What would happen if I could be like, oh,

334
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.310
<v 6>spot. I am half ball cannon ball canyons. Do not. I speak</v>

335
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.300
<v 1>from pure logic.</v>

336
00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:51.850
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

337
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.670
<v 11>hello. Hi. Hi. Hi, Jared and Robert.</v>

338
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.390
<v 1>We actually put the spot question to a neurologist,</v>

339
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.170
Dr Antwan Beshara who works at the University of Southern California.

340
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.510
If I could say Abracadabra and go all logic,

341
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.270
would I be a happy

342
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.100
<v 11>the chooser? Uh,</v>

343
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.110
I would say no based on, uh,

344
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.210
our work with neurological patients in,

345
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.620
he told us about a patient he was had he's changed the name of the patient he

346
00:21:22.621 --> 00:21:25.590
was, he would call them Elliott [inaudible]. Can you, can you describe him?

347
00:21:25.591 --> 00:21:30.140
What was he like? Yeah. Wow. He's about five feet, uh, 10, you know,

348
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.460
170 pounds I would say. And what did that kind of decree? It looks very normal,

349
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.890
like a normal

350
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:42.200
<v 1>Bursa. He was an accountant. That's [inaudible] again for a large corporation,</v>

351
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.190
successful accountant, upper management and active in his local church.

352
00:21:46.191 --> 00:21:47.024
And he was married?

353
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.760
<v 11>Yes, a very conservative family. Very religious house in the suburbs,</v>

354
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:54.970
good money savings, smart, successful man.

355
00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.240
<v 1>Kind of the American dream.</v>

356
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.030
<v 11>And then, you know, the tumor happened.</v>

357
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:10.260
<v 1>This is in 1982 doctors discovered a small knot in the front of Elliot's head</v>

358
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.790
and a part of the brain called the org glow frontal cortex.

359
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.780
And where's that dance? Just behind the eyes to doctors removed the tumor.

360
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.850
<v 11>Yeah, he had the surgery, the tumor was removed</v>

361
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.890
<v 1>and then the doctors send them home. Well, at first glance,</v>

362
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:26.190
it seems like a tremendous success. No language impairment,

363
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.990
no movement disorders.

364
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.850
He still score 97th percentile on the intelligence test. Um, he's, he,

365
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.420
he seems fine. Like good old Elliot does good old Elliott.

366
00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:39.810
Go back to the good old jobs. He starts going back to the good old job,

367
00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:44.620
the good old family. And that's when things got really weird that,

368
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.120
that at first it's just subtle things. These very minor decisions did.

369
00:22:48.121 --> 00:22:50.670
He suddenly couldn't make, like he'd be at the office,

370
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.540
he'd want to sign a contract and he'd have in front of him a blue pen and a

371
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:58.680
black pen and he would think, well, type on this contract is black,

372
00:22:58.681 --> 00:23:01.590
so maybe I should use a blue pen. Maybe a blue pen sticks out more.

373
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.370
On the other hand, maybe 600 too much and will become too distracting.

374
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.670
Then again, black pen is lower on ink, so you want to save that for later.

375
00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:11.850
I just would go on an on set Jonah or half an hour

376
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.460
if it takes him a half an hour to decide which pin to choose.

377
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.240
Imagine Elliot in the cereal aisle in the grocery store.

378
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.540
I mean this year last particularly tough because there, yeah,

379
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.580
there must be 200 varieties of cereal. This is a sugary cereal.

380
00:23:26.581 --> 00:23:29.190
This is a not sugary. Susannah. I think about it, you know,

381
00:23:29.191 --> 00:23:32.730
what would I prefer tomorrow when with extra proof I've got these other cereals

382
00:23:32.731 --> 00:23:33.181
at home.

383
00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:36.630
Are they also hunting up the [inaudible] to break up the honey nut monotony?

384
00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.900
Is there one cereal on sale? That's a better deal with Elliot.

385
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.860
It'll take forever to decide. According to Dr Bashar,

386
00:23:42.861 --> 00:23:46.180
he would just keep on analyzing, analyzing this one's 14 hours

387
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.630
<v 4>analyzing 15 ounces,</v>

388
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:52.631
but for the standard prices they also analyzing on analyzing is is the one

389
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:54.440
certainly analyzing

390
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.610
<v 1>all day long.</v>

391
00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:00.650
The question was what exactly had happened to Elliot to make him that way?

392
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.360
What exactly did that tumor do?

393
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.900
And the breakthrough came when Elliot went to see a neurologist named Antonio

394
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.250
Demasio into Mazda. Immediately noticed something,

395
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.190
even though Elliott was perfectly thoughtful, perfectly articulate,

396
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:18.140
always controlled, always relaxed. When he spoke, he seemed kind of numb.

397
00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:22.070
No sign of anger or rage or self-pity, no feeling at all.

398
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.190
So demasio had an idea. He put Elliot in a chair,

399
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.450
hooked him up to all these measuring devices and then showed Elliot a series of

400
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.460
really charged pictures,

401
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.940
severed foot and naked woman house on fire pictures.

402
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.840
At a normal people trigger an automatic emotional response. You can't help it,

403
00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:41.150
but your blood pressure increases. Your pulse increases,

404
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.400
your hands start to sweat. But with Elliot,

405
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.030
these pictures triggered nothing and that's when it became clear what had

406
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:48.550
happened to Elliott would,

407
00:24:48.551 --> 00:24:53.090
his tumor had really done with cut him off from his emotional mind.

408
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:56.030
He'd become ineffective. I'm kind of like Spock leg Vulcan

409
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:01.920
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

410
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.040
<v 4>The conventional theory would be that a person without emotions would be</v>

411
00:25:05.041 --> 00:25:05.970
perfectly rational.

412
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.600
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

413
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.720
<v 4>that emotion somehow interfered with rationality that they got in the way.</v>

414
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.040
Here's this guy who couldn't experience emotions and he would pathologically

415
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:19.580
indecisive. So then the answer to my question, my first question,

416
00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:23.980
wouldn't we all be better off if we could be completely rational? You know,

417
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.310
have the answer. It's no.

418
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.600
When you got all these options to consider and they're more or less the same,

419
00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:34.601
the only way to wheedle your way to a choice is to stop thinking and go with,

420
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.950
go with a feeling. Right? And so the, the, the logic of yes,

421
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:44.600
no, yes, no, yes. No leads you nowhere but the feelings of yes.

422
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:49.310
No, yes, no, that does lead you somewhere. That's right. Feeling.

423
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.850
So zantoine Beshara that's the key. Without feeling

424
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:59.470
you're stuck. So what ended up happening to Elliot? You ended up in a divorce,

425
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.660
uh, and ended up losing his job, losing all his savings.

426
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.970
He got involved with the con artist. Um,

427
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.330
you have to move back in with his parents. Elliott was stuck. His, his,

428
00:26:10.331 --> 00:26:11.350
his life fell apart,

429
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.700
which makes you kind of reevaluate the doctors' spark advantage.

430
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:20.310
So called because if we really were keeping company with a,

431
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.800
a flock of Spock's and we brought them to the grocery store there,

432
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:29.250
they'd be 55 sparks staring at the Cheerios, the Cheerios,

433
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.520
not to mention that they're divorced and broke.

434
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.640
So I mean obviously we have some advantage over these welcomes cause we have

435
00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:38.250
these feelings that can push us to the solution. Yeah. But what I,

436
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.260
what I still don't get as,

437
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.680
is it just the roar of feeling that does it or is there something about having a

438
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:44.514
feeling

439
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.510
<v 1>that's more subtle than that? That is, is there some, is there some,</v>

440
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.170
what is the power of the feeling? That's an interesting question. Let me,

441
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:56.760
let me get, let me walk this story in from a writer, Stephen Johnson.

442
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.580
So he's written a whole bunch of books, emergence, mind wide open, cool.

443
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.270
And he tells this story that can we press record really gets at what you're

444
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:06.780
asking.

445
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.140
My wife and I had moved into this new wonderful apartment that overlooked the

446
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:14.850
Hudson, a river on the west side of Manhattan. It had this vast window.

447
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.830
It was one kind of window in this room, but it was huge.

448
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.980
And we would sit there and stare out at the river all times a day.

449
00:27:19.981 --> 00:27:21.750
And at one point, the first time where we were there,

450
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:24.600
the storm started to come in and they were to kind of build up over Jersey and

451
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:26.070
come rolling in. And we thought, oh, this is great.

452
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:29.430
We can look at the white caps on it and see the lightning over in Jersey City

453
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:33.570
and all this stuff. And one late June day,

454
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.060
we're sitting out there in our apartment,

455
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:40.500
we can see the guy's getting darker and darker and we immediately say to each

456
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:41.810
other how this is going to be a great yeah

457
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.650
<v 13>show. So we have to over to the window and we, uh, we're standing at the window.</v>

458
00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:51.120
My wife literally with her hands pressed against the glass and I'm standing

459
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.000
right next to it, just to the side of it, kind of looking out.

460
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:56.030
And a storm starts really kicking up.

461
00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.240
There's a lot of lightning and you can see the window actually kind of flex just

462
00:28:00.241 --> 00:28:03.420
a tiny little bit, which is, so you noticed this when? Yeah, we noticed that,

463
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.520
that there was a little bit of give in and we know that size,

464
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:06.650
it has to have a little bit of Gif,

465
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.870
otherwise it's not stable so we can tell it was really,

466
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.480
it was really windy and um,

467
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.410
and there are a couple of pretty powerful gusts and then all of a sudden there's

468
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:19.500
this very strange sharp kind of click sound.

469
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.950
My wife instantly jumps back from the window, jumps back, you know,

470
00:28:24.951 --> 00:28:27.410
kind of four or five feet and says, what was that?

471
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.930
I say being the incredibly perceptive person that I am. I say,

472
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:38.110
I'm pretty sure it was the study door slamming with the wind around the corner

473
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.860
in the, in the other part of the apartment.

474
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.300
So she goes back around the corner to check on whether it was in fact the study

475
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.110
door slamming.

476
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:49.970
And at that moment as I'm standing two inches from the frame and the window,

477
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.823
the entire thing. Yeah.

478
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.973
<v 6>Hello.</v>

479
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:59.280
<v 13>It makes insane noise. It shatters glass. Wow.</v>

480
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.410
And all of a sudden there's a, you know,

481
00:29:01.411 --> 00:29:03.940
60 mile an hour storm like blowing through our hearts

482
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:07.913
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

483
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:13.630
<v 13>so we both run into the bathroom and close the door and all of a sudden,</v>

484
00:29:14.631 --> 00:29:16.250
you know, I suddenly think like, oh my God,

485
00:29:16.251 --> 00:29:19.670
you were standing in front of that window three seconds before. If,

486
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.310
if I hadn't stupidly told you that I thought that clicking sound was the door

487
00:29:23.311 --> 00:29:24.940
slamming, nothing would've landed on you.

488
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.850
<v 1>I think it's entirely possible that it would've killed her. Okay.</v>

489
00:29:30.851 --> 00:29:34.390
So that that happened. His wife by the way was fine. Good.

490
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.670
They installed a new window. They cleaned up the apartment.

491
00:29:36.671 --> 00:29:39.610
They did because I am covered with imaginary glass.

492
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:43.780
I mean I sad to fix it so unbelievably Rio,

493
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.340
thank you very much.

494
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.560
But what's illuminating and what gets at the question you asked yes.

495
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.320
Is actually what happened next.

496
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:52.660
It's the postscript to that event for literally years.

497
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.460
Every time I heard the sound of wind blowing through a window in that apartment

498
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:02.461
and really pretty much anywhere else I had an involuntary fear reflects the

499
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:07.130
sound of any wind or is it a specific kind of wind sound? Uh,

500
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.920
it was a sound of wind associated with a window. So you know, it's the,

501
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.973
<v 14>okay,</v>

502
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:15.660
<v 13>you know,</v>

503
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.780
I would go to my parents' house who live on the ground floor of the house in

504
00:30:18.781 --> 00:30:19.860
suburban Washington,

505
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.830
but I would just hear when kind of going through the window there and I would

506
00:30:22.831 --> 00:30:25.770
think something's not right and this was not a rational feeling.

507
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.180
It was certainly not a rational thought.

508
00:30:27.181 --> 00:30:30.960
I could look empirically and say it's 30 miles an hour. This wind,

509
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.460
the window is clearly not going to blow in.

510
00:30:32.461 --> 00:30:34.680
It's not that big a window and I'm standing nowhere near it.

511
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.020
But you still somehow couldn't shake the dread.

512
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.930
I couldn't get rid of that feeling.

513
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:44.790
<v 1>And it's one of those moments where you really, you really ask yourself,</v>

514
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:49.710
I think you know who's in charge, you know who's driving the ship, you know,

515
00:30:49.711 --> 00:30:52.650
because some part of me is looking at this situation in PuroClean Zang,

516
00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.860
rationally this window is no threat to me, right? It's not going to blow in.

517
00:30:55.890 --> 00:31:00.390
And yet some other part of me is unable to shake this emotional state of,

518
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.120
of dread and fear and alertness and threat. All right.

519
00:31:03.121 --> 00:31:07.530
Now to get back to your question Robert, where do feelings come from? Yeah,

520
00:31:07.531 --> 00:31:11.730
why do I say yes to weak checks with, with uh, with power, right?

521
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.510
We'll consider the,

522
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.890
the story we just heard from the perspective of a Steven Johnson's brain. Okay.

523
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:21.210
So what a brain wants to do most of all is keep the organisms safe, right?

524
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.780
And it does that by looking for patterns. Like here's an explosion.

525
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:26.723
Life almost died.

526
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.010
Like it's entirely possible that it would have killed her in that moment.

527
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.970
Brain soaks it all in. Takes kind of a snapshot. Like what do we got here?

528
00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.020
Window,

529
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:39.020
glass shock till the later wind blows brain thinks need a second window class.

530
00:31:42.131 --> 00:31:46.660
We've seen this before. Warn the organism. Be Afraid, be afraid, be afraid.

531
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.110
My point is that feeling of dread and fear and alertness and threat,

532
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.280
that's just an alarm signal.

533
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.830
The brain is just trying to help Steve make the right decision. Great.

534
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.990
Okay. Now under the cereal out there you are. You're looking at all the boxes,

535
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.730
captain crime, and as your eyes fall on the right's crispy box, right?

536
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.930
Rice krispies race me just like Steve Johnson with the wind somewhere way deep

537
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:11.321
down,

538
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:15.270
your brain is calling up all the experiences you've ever had with Rice krispies,

539
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.050
the good rice crispy experiences, the bad ones.

540
00:32:17.051 --> 00:32:20.680
Maybe in college you got dumped by that girl who likes Rice Krispie treats.

541
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:23.950
I don't know. I remember her thousands of little memory fragments down there.

542
00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:26.560
Royal about a lot of information, I think too much.

543
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.310
So what ends up happening is that it all gets summed somehow in your

544
00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:34.900
subconscious and then it bubbles up as a feeling crispies.

545
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.533
All right.

546
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:42.330
So one way to look at a gut feeling is that it's a kind of shorthand average of

547
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:45.440
all of this past wisdom.

548
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:00.130
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

549
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:05.130
<v 1>So you have this tremendous Sturman drawn the feelings in the Centerman.</v>

550
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.400
Whoa, that's a German, I could do it a little jerky now,

551
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.810
but there is a scientist,

552
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.730
one feeling that humans have that seems to Trump all the others and that is the

553
00:33:15.731 --> 00:33:19.720
feeling of loss. People heat to lose. You can actually put a number on it,

554
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.120
how much they hate to lose versus winning.

555
00:33:22.121 --> 00:33:25.030
And it's a really cool experiment that was done, but then I'd be everywhere.

556
00:33:25.031 --> 00:33:29.160
But our experiment will be done by national public radio's wonderful reporter

557
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:30.783
Mike Peskov.

558
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.230
Are you a bit of a gambler or would you rather just keep your money and not risk

559
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.410
it? Um, I mean, I, I wouldn't mind risking a few dollars,

560
00:33:37.411 --> 00:33:39.400
but I just don't want to go overboard. You know what you say? You're,

561
00:33:39.401 --> 00:33:44.190
you're a gambling woman. You like gambling. No, I don't. I don't really gamble.

562
00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.250
I, I'm very cautious and Finicky,

563
00:33:47.251 --> 00:33:50.100
whether it's eating or taking chances. Yeah.

564
00:33:50.101 --> 00:33:54.030
The risk of losing something isn't worth the gambling. I mean,

565
00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:56.130
I guess I wouldn't take over and go, I played that way.

566
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.960
We were to play heads or towels. Would you want to do it if you won,

567
00:34:03.961 --> 00:34:07.050
you want a dollar. But if I want, I wanted dollars. Probably not. No, no,

568
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.740
no thanks.

569
00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.220
If you knew the game was on the up and up and I were to flip a coin and I said,

570
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.920
Oh look, I'll pay you, you know, a dollar 25 if you win,

571
00:34:13.921 --> 00:34:17.130
you only have to pay me a dollar. I ain't doing it with, you know, I don't know.

572
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.630
That just doesn't seem worth it. I said, look,

573
00:34:18.631 --> 00:34:21.270
I'll give you a dollar 50 and you only have to put up a dollar.

574
00:34:21.271 --> 00:34:23.190
Would you do it then? No, not really.

575
00:34:23.191 --> 00:34:27.900
50 cents is not worth if I offered you a dollar 75 if you want the possibility,

576
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:31.860
maybe like at that point you maybe start thinking, fine, I'll give you $2.

577
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.830
You only have to put up a dollar. Would you be interested? Sure. Yeah.

578
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.550
I would do that. I would do that. Yes, sure. Wow.

579
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.970
So everyone seems to converge around two bucks. Two to one. Yes.

580
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.630
So that means that like losses twice is painful. Yeah.

581
00:34:45.631 --> 00:34:49.830
You could say loss hurts twice as much as gain. Feels good.

582
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:52.800
Why do you think that is? It must have something to do with, you know,

583
00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:55.470
when we were all running away from lions on the Savannah. Yeah.

584
00:34:55.471 --> 00:34:57.210
It always seems to come back to that, doesn't it? Oh,

585
00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.930
I guess a Willdabeast in the brush is worth a lion on the heels or something.

586
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.213
No. Know what that means.

587
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.670
But were there any people that you talked to who went way past two to one? Sure.

588
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.200
Okay. A hundred to one. No. Come on. You're crazy. A hundred at two.

589
00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:12.300
One on a coin. [inaudible] nope. Nope. I'm just not a gambler.

590
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.390
Is this a religious thing? No, I'm just not a gambler.

591
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.280
So here's the question to get us to the next thing. Wow.

592
00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.860
Given that human beings hate to lose,

593
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:24.360
what do you do if your entire business is getting people to lose money?

594
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.840
You're talking about. He knows that you're not, dude,

595
00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:30.290
I am here going to Las Vegas highway, Lennox City, lantack city.

596
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:34.040
Then I normally would have seen it will do,

597
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.290
and they will try to distract you with, you know,

598
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.600
fountains of Jellybeans and Regan statues that move.

599
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:42.610
But there's one casino in particular called Harris.

600
00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.060
It's a chain that doesn't do any of that. Yeah,

601
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:48.750
they offer slots and they offer a blackjack, but there's no exploding volcano.

602
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.670
There's no Picasso on the wall yet, according to Mike Harris jumps out at you.

603
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.080
They are the success story in the casino base.

604
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.760
Gary Loveman has a lot to do with that. Yeah. Any minute.

605
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:01.920
You're not drunk or depressed, I'd like you in the casino.

606
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.840
He's the CEO of Harris Casinos casino business,

607
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:09.420
and he's developed a really brilliant technique for slaying the beast.

608
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:12.330
That is loss aversion. That's one way to put it. What's his technique?

609
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.220
Loyalty cards. What's a loyalty card? What does that mean? Well, basically,

610
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:20.220
I mean, you know how back in the day, if you wanted to play the slots,

611
00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:22.890
you just stuck a quarter in [inaudible] can't do that anymore. Right.

612
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:26.250
You're like, I'd like to, I'd like to throw a quarter in the one armed bandit.

613
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.780
Turns out there are no quarters. Okay,

614
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.060
I'll slide a dollar bill and it turns out before you have to do it,

615
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:32.550
you have to sign up for a card. Well, why would I want to sign up for a card?

616
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:34.890
Well, hey, you have to, but B, the first time you play,

617
00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:38.190
we'll give you a couple extra dollars. Everyone wants to sign up for that card.

618
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.410
It's free money. Now, just to be clear at Harris,

619
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:43.250
it's actually not obligatory to sign up for this card,

620
00:36:43.251 --> 00:36:46.290
but most people do to get the rewards. And so there you are.

621
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:50.400
You've got this little loyalty thing and you're sticking it in every slot or

622
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:54.900
machine that you play. Mat offers them certain, uh,

623
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.630
well they've got this new pilot program where they basically watch every move

624
00:36:58.631 --> 00:37:00.370
you make. Hm. Check it out. Okay.

625
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:02.900
<v 0>Let's say you're playing the slots. Okay?</v>

626
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.460
You stick your card in the slot machine. All right, Mike,

627
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.090
Tireless in at that very moment,

628
00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:13.010
the information is transmitted downstairs. In the case of this casino,

629
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.490
we were out. It goes downstairs in the bowels of the casino.

630
00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.760
I need to take a four to Julia.

631
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.200
There was a dispatcher sitting there in front of a monitor.

632
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.800
<v 1>This computer sees that you've put your card into slot machine number 42 four</v>

633
00:37:24.801 --> 00:37:27.580
seven 53 computer begins taking notes.

634
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.840
Every game that you play, they're logging on,

635
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.610
adding at a dividing line graph and graphics, whatever, whatever.

636
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.230
It's able to crunch those numbers and over many visits, the casino

637
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.490
<v 0>begins to know you.</v>

638
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.970
They know your game is slots and I know you'd like to play for an average of six

639
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:45.804
hours

640
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.980
and they know that generally you have a limit,

641
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.140
say $89 wow. They can know that I usually leave after losing 89 bucks

642
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.780
and you know on this particular visit you're not doing so well, right?

643
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:05.130
When you've lost more than you're winning. In fact, you've lost 72 box,

644
00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:08.370
which is really close to your personal limit and this is the crucial moment

645
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.730
<v 1>you're starting to get that sinking feeling. You might just pack it in.</v>

646
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.590
I walk out of the Casino. Casino doesn't want you to do that.

647
00:38:14.591 --> 00:38:15.510
They want to keep you there.

648
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.020
So as your loss increasing from 72 to 77 to 85 and you're getting closer and

649
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:23.210
closer to them in a back room,

650
00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.780
there's a computer going off at dispatchers seeing it.

651
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.320
Juliet 37 Oh three the dispatcher knows to call the slot attendant up on the

652
00:38:30.321 --> 00:38:31.940
floor. Go for Willie.

653
00:38:31.941 --> 00:38:36.941
I have a DCL one at Gulf 14 oh for Karen Method

654
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.920
<v 0>Willie Lisa, one for Kevin Massey cop and the slot attendant walks out.</v>

655
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:45.820
Tap you on the shoulder. Hello. How you doing ma'am? Ms Kevin Massa. Yeah,

656
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.450
everything going okay for you today I'm losing.

657
00:38:49.451 --> 00:38:52.720
Of course we know that's the case because our systems allows us to monitor that

658
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.190
and so the attendant offers you something you might like to visit to the steak

659
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.110
house and visit to our coffee shop. They could offer you tickets to a show,

660
00:38:59.111 --> 00:39:02.830
Celine Dion's playing the big room. Woo. Or they could just offer cold,

661
00:39:02.831 --> 00:39:06.040
hard cash once a money today just by playing with your car. You're lucky.

662
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.490
We're walking on. Really, I've, I got $15 DCL one point yet. We got seven

663
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.850
and all of a sudden you're happy that you won 15 bucks.

664
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:21.270
You're not fixated on the fact that you've lost 72 so you come back to again and

665
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:25.000
again and again. I think it's great if something to do,

666
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.940
I've always had was $300 off the day with the nerve.

667
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.370
Boys don't know how much.

668
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.140
<v 1>Now here is the amazing part for all the different thousands of people who come</v>

669
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:36.940
through the doors of Harris Casinos.

670
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.120
They could figure out their own individual pain points.

671
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.310
So you're telling me that if you walk into a casino,

672
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.000
I walk in right after you Robert Krulwich right after us. Yeah.

673
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.380
And we do that enough times.

674
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:52.300
After a while they can know that you like to gamble until you're about $700

675
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:55.750
down. Me, I usually get around 11 bucks and moneybags crow, which over there,

676
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.140
money back scroll, which usually holds out until he's for granted in the hall.

677
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.720
Right. And they can know that about each of us. Yeah, they can.

678
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:05.860
What do you think about this strikes you as a good business proposition or does

679
00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:08.860
it strike you as a creepy example of big brother ism?

680
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.730
Obviously this works out well for Harris. So does it work out well for me?

681
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:15.490
You and Robert Krulwich? I think it does. What do you mean? Well,

682
00:40:15.491 --> 00:40:20.050
they can ever change the odds. So when we go into a casino by state law,

683
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.360
they'll never be able to change the odds of the game.

684
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:26.110
All that Harris can do is kind of manage the feeling that we get.

685
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:26.860
<v 15>Hmm.</v>

686
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.790
They leave a lot happier than if they had simply had a bad gaming experience,

687
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.220
put their wallet back in their pocket and go on home on happy

688
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.910
<v 1>and everything about going to the, to a casino is a poor decision,</v>

689
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.230
an irrational decision.

690
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.640
And if there was a way they can make me walking out of there feeling like 1

691
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.100
million bucks when I spent 2 million, well then I say more power to them.

692
00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.200
<v 15>And I would add of course that almost any business could try something similar</v>

693
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.220
as assuming they had appealing sorts of things to do for customers that had bad

694
00:40:52.221 --> 00:40:52.940
experiences.

695
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.490
<v 1>What's your pain point, by the way? Uh, you know what it is.</v>

696
00:40:55.491 --> 00:40:59.240
If I'm down 300 bucks, I'm really pissed off. I'm not going to get there. Yeah.

697
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.000
There's only one thing that would keep me at the table. That's it.

698
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:06.230
Celine Dion not, not tickets for a concert. If she was actually in the game.

699
00:41:06.231 --> 00:41:08.960
She's a terrible poker player. What we call dead money.

700
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.193
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

701
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.653
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

702
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.060
<v 0>thanks Mike. Yeah, we'll be back.</v>

703
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.600
<v 1>Hey, by the way, Mike works at NPR news.</v>

<v 4>hello, this is radio lab. I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

711
00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.190
I am Robert Krulwich and today we are talking about decision making,

712
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.630
how we make decisions like Oh I want to just to stop you in that Pronoun you

713
00:42:04.631 --> 00:42:07.690
just happened to you. You would say we make decisions now.

714
00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:12.340
So when you get a boomer, when you decide to choose a pen black over blue,

715
00:42:12.341 --> 00:42:15.850
if you decide to choose a cereal cheerio's over special k. Sure, yes,

716
00:42:15.851 --> 00:42:16.684
definitely. Uh,

717
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.310
I'm assuming that you feel very much in charge of that choice. You know,

718
00:42:21.311 --> 00:42:25.740
if someone said, hey, who chose, you'd say, this feels like a trick question.

719
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.090
It's going to be a trick question. You chose to cheerios.

720
00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.690
Well you think you chose,

721
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.300
would you please welcome the Studley Malcolm Gladwell?

722
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.250
<v 18>I'm talking with Malcolm Gladwell,</v>

723
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:40.490
the writer of the tipping point and he at the time he'd just written to the book

724
00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.220
blink. We were at the 92nd street Y in New York.

725
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.340
<v 4>He raised an interesting question. Yes.</v>

726
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:50.220
We began the discussion by talking about a dangerous element in decision making,

727
00:42:50.221 --> 00:42:52.260
which he calls call this the perils,

728
00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:56.370
that introspection and you tell the story of a poster contest.

729
00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.480
It involves hanging cats versus,

730
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.860
<v 19>do you recall this? Yes. Yeah. Yes. Gosh, I have no memory.</v>

731
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.780
Um, the um, yeah, this is a famous study by, um, Tim Wilson,

732
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:13.590
who's one of my favorite psychologist at UVA and a guy named John Schooler who's

733
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.020
absolutely brilliant. They, uh,

734
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.860
they have a whole bunch of posters and they bring students in and they say,

735
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.740
take anyone you want, it's yours.

736
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.590
And then they bring in another group and they say, take any one you want,

737
00:43:25.591 --> 00:43:29.730
but by the way, before you go home with it, um, just explain,

738
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.010
write out a paragraph about why you're taking it home, why you like it.

739
00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:34.350
And then they call up the student six months later and they say,

740
00:43:34.351 --> 00:43:37.170
that poster you got for free six months ago, do you like it?

741
00:43:37.171 --> 00:43:38.010
Are you still happy with it?

742
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:41.700
And the ones who didn't have to explain themselves still love their poster and

743
00:43:41.701 --> 00:43:44.580
the ones who did hate their poster. And furthermore,

744
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.200
the ones who had to explain themselves,

745
00:43:46.201 --> 00:43:50.640
it turns out only took the posters of the hanging cats of the little kittens,

746
00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:54.600
you know, hanging, they go hanging of cats. It doesn't mean like, but if, no,

747
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:55.890
no, no, no. You know those posters,

748
00:43:55.891 --> 00:43:59.190
you surely you saw them or maybe you have lived in the upper kind of

749
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.180
intellectual precincts for so long that you lost contact with the rest of us.

750
00:44:03.181 --> 00:44:06.390
But, um, you know, dove, you never seen them.

751
00:44:06.391 --> 00:44:09.840
The little kitten hanging on a bar and it says, hang in there baby, you know?

752
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.840
Oh yeah. All right. I don't think of it as hanging. I forget.

753
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.290
It's sort of you're fake. You're just saying. Yeah, no we're not. Yeah,

754
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:18.900
you're right. You're right. I am taking it off. My, actually,

755
00:44:18.901 --> 00:44:19.621
when I first saw that,

756
00:44:19.621 --> 00:44:23.340
I thought that kitten was having to do a chin up and so it didn't have the

757
00:44:23.341 --> 00:44:26.220
desired effect. I thought, why are they torturing this kid? Right.

758
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.440
Why do kittens have to work? Is it, you know,

759
00:44:28.441 --> 00:44:30.750
is it not enough that human beings have to go to the gym anyway?

760
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.990
But you had those,

761
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:36.660
then you had impression as posters and the kids who had to explain their

762
00:44:36.661 --> 00:44:40.770
preferences overwhelmingly chose the kittens and those who didn't have to

763
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:43.110
explain themselves chose the impressionist posters.

764
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:47.850
So what that says is the act of making you explain your preferences not only

765
00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:50.640
biased you in favor of something, but you didn't actually want,

766
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.760
it also made you change your preference away from something that was

767
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:56.780
sophisticated and in favor of something that was unsuccessful.

768
00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.013
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

769
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:01.243
<v 19>hmm</v>

770
00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:05.620
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

771
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.570
<v 19>if you think about the whole universe of focus group testing and something that</v>

772
00:45:09.571 --> 00:45:12.210
determines all of the cultural products that get into our society,

773
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:17.610
that makes you really stop and worry, right?

774
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.420
We're putting people through a process that alienates them from their true needs

775
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.570
and that biases them in favor of the unsophisticated

776
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:30.160
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

777
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:30.370
<v 19>Well,</v>

778
00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:35.370
an overwhelming majority of the greatest and most successful movies or sitcoms

779
00:45:36.611 --> 00:45:40.540
or television shows of all time tested badly, almost by definition.

780
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.540
They're really breakthrough shows will test badly in focus groups.

781
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:47.140
I actually saw the focus group results for Mary Tyler Moore show,

782
00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:51.640
which were devastating. Hayden. Mary was abrasive.

783
00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.760
Roto was, you know, noxious, you know the,

784
00:45:54.761 --> 00:45:56.680
in the focus group testing of all in the family,

785
00:45:56.681 --> 00:46:00.460
which got one of the lowest scores of any sick pilot, a tested CBS.

786
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:04.180
The overwhelming majority of people who watched the show said that the only way

787
00:46:04.181 --> 00:46:07.120
to fix it was to turn Archie into a kind of cuddly, sensitive,

788
00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.630
you know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

789
00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.330
The only reason these shows ever make on the areas that somebody at some point

790
00:46:13.331 --> 00:46:16.090
just says, you know what? Ignore that stuff. I like it.

791
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.253
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

792
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:28.370
<v 4>so the, the suggestion here is that because these snap judgments are,</v>

793
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.530
are eight mysterious over explained,

794
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.610
therefore corrected in the wrong direction. Frankly, capitalists,

795
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.120
capitalism should have no cutting edge excitement except that there are these

796
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:43.950
occasional people's take the risk at the system. So that's one, one consequence.

797
00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:47.340
The other though is very, very much interesting to me. Um,

798
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:53.510
if you can't know why you have a feeling in your gut and you can't explain why

799
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:54.870
you have a feeling in your gut,

800
00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:59.550
and to some extent you can't control what's the feeling in your gut. You,

801
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.750
you wonder who's in charge of the choices that you make.

802
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.840
And there's a whole section of this book, which is maybe the scariest,

803
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:11.730
which is about something called priming, where external clues things that you,

804
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.890
um, see trigger biases inside you. So let me run you through some of those. Uh,

805
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.790
there's a game you ask your readers to play. We have play.

806
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.970
They are words in the game. And the, in one of the Games you played,

807
00:47:22.971 --> 00:47:27.300
the words wrinkle, Bingo and Florida appear matter of factly.

808
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.280
What happens to people who see

809
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.400
<v 1>while doing something else, wrinkle Bingo and Florida,</v>

810
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:38.410
they walk out of the room after the test is over more slowly than they walked

811
00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:39.244
into the,

812
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.580
you ask people to play a game of trivial pursuit. Some of them you say, first,

813
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:46.480
before we play this game,

814
00:47:46.481 --> 00:47:50.830
let's think about professors for a moment and now we'll play trivial pursuit.

815
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.320
In other group you say, let's play trivial pursuit,

816
00:47:53.321 --> 00:47:58.180
but now let's think about soccer hooligans and then we'll play trivial pursuit.

817
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:01.420
What's the difference if I make you think about professors first,

818
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.410
your scores are substantially superior. You win. Basically.

819
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.240
If I make you think about hooligans, you lose just thinking about them. Yes.

820
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:13.303
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

821
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:16.840
<v 1>can we step away from the 92nd street y for just a moment here. Um,</v>

822
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.980
cause this priming thing that you and Malcolm are discussing gets Kinda Uri when

823
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:25.810
you go actually beyond words like here. Um, once you have a sip of this coffee,

824
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.740
this coffee here. Yeah, right now. Yeah. Let's go ahead and have a sit.

825
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.620
Why he looking at me like that? Because I've just primed you. What do you mean?

826
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.270
Cause I have just primed you. You were just, what crime do you think you mean?

827
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:44.020
I to explain it. We talked to a psychologist.

828
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:48.280
My name is John Barge and I'm a professor at Yale University in Psychology

829
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.100
Department and John did an interesting experiment. Okay. Check one,

830
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:54.160
two in a Grad student by the name of Lawrence Williams. Here's what they did.

831
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.980
Lawrence went out into the world and get a bunch of stuff with them and

832
00:48:56.981 --> 00:48:59.260
briefcase some coffees and papers,

833
00:48:59.261 --> 00:49:02.020
so much stuff that he could barely carry it all. And he went out,

834
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.600
went out into the in front of the library or in town,

835
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:08.560
and he would approach somebody and he'd say, excuse me, sir, ma'am,

836
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:11.260
would you mind taking this survey? It's just a minute of your time,

837
00:49:11.261 --> 00:49:15.250
but give their agreement to be in the study grades. Pretty simple survey.

838
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:16.550
What kind of survey? Well,

839
00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:21.040
it had a picture of a guy on it and a description of the guy who's got the guy's

840
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:25.090
name was Joe. So here's Joe. Joe. Joe Is these six traits.

841
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.000
There's a little description of Joe right there on the paper. Okay.

842
00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:31.140
I want you to do, he would say, all I want you to do for this surveys.

843
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:35.680
Just tell me gut feeling. What do you think a Joe, do you like him?

844
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:39.700
That's it. That's it. Do I like how much do you like Joe? That's,

845
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.840
that's the whole question. Yeah,

846
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:45.010
you mean like rate it one to ten one to 10 and everyone saw the same person.

847
00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:46.990
Describe the same way. Everyone sees the same description,

848
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.090
but there's one thing I haven't told you yet.

849
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:55.660
Somewhere in this process toward the beginning you would ever so casually ask

850
00:49:55.661 --> 00:49:57.880
them, can you just do me a favor? My hands are full.

851
00:49:57.881 --> 00:50:00.910
Can you hold this Cup of coffee? Your hold this just for a second. Thanks.

852
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.550
And they just take it for a second. It's all very natural.

853
00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:07.090
So it's not even seen as part of the experiment because it was just a second.

854
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.890
Well, I should say it. Yeah. Everybody got the same cup of coffee. In fact,

855
00:50:11.891 --> 00:50:15.820
he would hand half the people a cup of hot coffee and you would hand the other

856
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:20.470
half a cup of iced coffee like I gave you. And it was always really fast.

857
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.280
They only hold the cup for maybe a second at most, but that second,

858
00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:29.110
whether it was hot or cold, seems to have made a, because the hot coffee people,

859
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.910
<v 20>both people who saw, who had touched the or held the hot coffee</v>

860
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:36.660
<v 1>when they were asked, do you like Joe? The majority said, yeah, exactly.</v>

861
00:50:36.661 --> 00:50:40.440
They liked Joe. Where's the cold coffee people? By and large,

862
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:45.540
they didn't like him. Oh cool. Is that right?

863
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:49.650
I just bank very, very bad kid. You know, they've repeated this study many,

864
00:50:49.651 --> 00:50:51.270
many times. Always the same result.

865
00:50:51.271 --> 00:50:56.271
People who hold the hot coffee are more pro Joe than the people who hold the ice

866
00:50:56.311 --> 00:51:00.290
coffee. In other words, something happens in that second when they hold the cup,

867
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:05.291
some sort of mistranslation in their brain where warm cup becomes warm.

868
00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:06.840
Joe Real warm.

869
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:11.340
This physical sensation gets confused with the metaphor.

870
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.040
<v 20>People are all the same temperature, usually 98.6 degrees.</v>

871
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:16.110
We're not different in warmth and cold physically,

872
00:51:16.111 --> 00:51:18.600
but we talk about people that way. It's very important to us.

873
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.180
You hear somebody who's warm, you immediately like them.

874
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:23.940
You hear a person's cold, you know you don't want to be their friend.

875
00:51:23.941 --> 00:51:25.050
You don't want to hire them. Warmth.

876
00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:28.380
And Colton is psychologically is all about trust.

877
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.160
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

878
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.960
<v 20>it's all about are you a friend or a foe?</v>

879
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.860
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

880
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:37.950
<v 1>lovely. So why wouldn't it? Why would, if that, but if that's true,</v>

881
00:51:37.951 --> 00:51:40.980
why is it true? Like why, why the confusion? Yeah.

882
00:51:40.981 --> 00:51:44.340
Why does it boil down to something as dumb as that? Well,

883
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.430
John Barge and his team have actually been, uh, asking that question,

884
00:51:47.431 --> 00:51:50.520
doing some neuroscience to see if maybe the inside the brain they can see

885
00:51:50.521 --> 00:51:51.650
something that would explain it. Yeah.

886
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:56.500
<v 20>And it seems that the, the area of the brain that records temperature a bit,</v>

887
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.990
it's responsive to actual physical temperature is also the same area of the

888
00:51:59.991 --> 00:52:03.370
brain that is, uh, the location of where, uh,

889
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:07.880
I'll trust the same little part of the brain is got both of those things going

890
00:52:07.881 --> 00:52:08.130
on

891
00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:10.140
<v 1>and he thinks that there is a good reason for that.</v>

892
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.220
Temperature and trust are in fact link,

893
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:16.890
particularly when you're a little baby.

894
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.000
<v 20>Since our first learning about the world is,</v>

895
00:52:22.001 --> 00:52:24.920
is usually in terms of what we can see and what we can touch.

896
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.230
We don't have much memory and we can't think very well.

897
00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:29.690
So it's all about our immediate experience.

898
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:35.000
While a huge important area of experience for a little baby is to,

899
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.760
is to keep close to the caretaker and to stay warm.

900
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:44.511
I mean this,

901
00:52:44.511 --> 00:52:48.260
this is something that's so critical when they're so tiny and helpless that they

902
00:52:48.261 --> 00:52:52.430
don't maintain closeness. If they don't maintain warmth, they don't survive.

903
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:58.010
So, uh, I guess the, the,

904
00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:00.220
the point is if you're hiring somebody and it,

905
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:03.490
and you really want to hire the right person, don't have any coffee around,

906
00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:08.350
but the first step is to accept the possibility. And very few people believe me,

907
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:11.050
I tried to explain to my family and my friends what I do.

908
00:53:11.051 --> 00:53:14.920
And they never believe any of these things are really true of them because we

909
00:53:14.921 --> 00:53:16.390
don't have any awareness of them.

910
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:20.140
I can't remember one time that ever happened to me. Well, yeah,

911
00:53:20.141 --> 00:53:23.290
you won't remember one time because it's never going to be in your memory.

912
00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.980
It's never going to be in your awareness. Yeah. I, it's time. I don't, why

913
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.260
<v 19>is it so hard for us to, to, um,</v>

914
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.600
to concede that a huge part of our own motivations

915
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:37.440
<v 4>are mysterious. We're back now at the 92nd street y again with Malcolm Gladwell.</v>

916
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:40.830
I have to say there was a part of our conversation where this whole thing got a

917
00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:41.910
little scary to me.

918
00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:47.130
You have to do in part with race because instead of using hot and cold as the

919
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:51.330
metaphor, suppose you use black or white. Right. And he said very flatly.

920
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:56.840
There are stereotypes that we have that seem to be beyond our ability to

921
00:53:56.881 --> 00:53:58.140
control. In fact,

922
00:53:58.141 --> 00:54:02.430
he took a test to measure the unconscious feelings that he had in him about

923
00:54:02.431 --> 00:54:03.130
black and white

924
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:04.760
<v 19>people. I score on an unconscious,</v>

925
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:09.490
turns out I have a moderate preference for whites on an unconscious level and he

926
00:54:09.491 --> 00:54:11.710
is by the way half black. Um, yeah.

927
00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:16.450
Which is not unusual for black people by the way. Um, nor is it unusual for,

928
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:17.343
you know,

929
00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:22.350
Jews to have a moderate unconscious preference for gentiles over Jews or for any

930
00:54:22.601 --> 00:54:26.380
kind of, um, with blacks? It's most striking. Uh,

931
00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.770
my unconscious attitudes towards blacks are a function of the society in which I

932
00:54:29.771 --> 00:54:34.300
live. My unconscious is basically x is just basically collecting impressions and

933
00:54:34.301 --> 00:54:37.090
thoughts and biases and stuff from the world.

934
00:54:37.091 --> 00:54:39.700
I live in amassing this massive database.

935
00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.760
And if in an a very kind of unfiltered way, right. Well my data,

936
00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.980
my unconscious database about race has more negative things about blacks in it

937
00:54:47.981 --> 00:54:52.240
than positive things. Right. I live in, you know, the United States,

938
00:54:52.241 --> 00:54:56.170
of course it does. And so the, of course it's not going to not affect me,

939
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:57.460
you know? Well

940
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:03.020
<v 4>yeah, it's just, it's horrible. Or maybe just put it this way,</v>

941
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.090
that, that, uh,

942
00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:10.400
that you can't really purge yourself of things that would bother you if you

943
00:55:10.401 --> 00:55:15.401
could spy on them and that you are in some sense a prisoner of your culture in a

944
00:55:15.741 --> 00:55:18.350
way that makes you in some way.

945
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:21.620
Ungovernable you can't quite get on top of yourself.

946
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.070
<v 19>No. The more you push, I mean,</v>

947
00:55:24.071 --> 00:55:28.240
I don't push this issue that far in the book cause it gets really troubling

948
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.810
really quickly. Yeah, it does. The more you push it to you, right.

949
00:55:31.811 --> 00:55:35.740
It's deeply disturbing. And there's a book written by, um, uh,

950
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.720
a guy named Daniel Wagner at Harvard called the illusion of conscious will,

951
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:44.020
um, which, and it's a very difficult book. Um,

952
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:48.400
but if he pushes this as far as you go, and you know, at the end,

953
00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.880
if you go through all of this research, it's pinned down recently in psychology,

954
00:55:51.881 --> 00:55:55.510
you do end up with the position that the notion of conscious will is an

955
00:55:55.511 --> 00:55:56.344
illusion.

956
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.340
It's just we make up stories that make it make us feel good about the decisions

957
00:56:02.341 --> 00:56:03.061
we make, but in fact,

958
00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:05.690
we're not really as nearly as in charge as we think we are.

959
00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:08.683
<v 3>A</v>

[inaudible].

961
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:19.250
<v 1>That was Malcolm Gladwell talking with me at the 92nd street y.</v>

962
00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:22.940
His new book is called outliers. Anything you heard this hour,
