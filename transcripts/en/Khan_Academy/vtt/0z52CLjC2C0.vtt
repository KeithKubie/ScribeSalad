00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.670
So let's see if we can take the
derivative of this expression

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.790
right over here, if we can
find capital F prime of x.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.630
And once again,
it looks like you

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.670
might be able to use
the fundamental theorem

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.250
of calculus.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.810
A big giveaway is
that you're taking

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.710
the derivative of a
definite integral that

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.980
gives you a function of x.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.144
But here I have x on both the
upper and the lower boundary,

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:22.810
and the fundamental
theorem of calculus,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.530
is at least from
what we've seen,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.616
is when we have x's only
on the upper boundary.

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.240
And then, of course,
it's an x squared,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.970
but we've seen examples
of that already

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.770
when we used the
chain rule to do it.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.320
But how can we break
this up and put

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.700
this in a form that's a little
bit closer to what we're

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.370
familiar with when we apply
the fundamental theorem

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.450
of calculus?

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.920
And to realize
that, we really just

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.350
have to attempt to graph
what this is representing.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.380
So let's say that
this is our lowercase

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.040
f of x, or I should say f of t.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.980
So let's call this
lowercase f of t.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.700
And let's graph it
over the interval

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.070
between x and x squared.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.490
So let's say this is my y-axis.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.360
This is my t-axis.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.340
And let's say that
this right over here

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.600
is y is equal to f of t.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.880
I'm drawing it generally.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.671
I don't know what this
exactly looks like.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.420
And we're going to
talk about the interval

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.530
between x and x squared.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.870
So if we're going to talk about
the interval between x, which

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.970
is right over here,
it's the lower bound,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.224
so x and x squared.

00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:25.640
It's the lower bound, at least
for this definite integral.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.370
We don't know for sure.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.703
It depends on what x you
choose on which one is actually

00:01:28.703 --> 00:01:29.470
smaller.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.670
But let's just say that for
the sake of visualizing,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.040
we'll draw x right
over here, and we

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.600
will draw x squared
right over here.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.730
So this whole expression,
this entire definite integral,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.490
is essentially asking for,
is essentially representing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.820
this entire area, the
entire area under the curve.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.520
But what we could do
is introduce a constant

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.610
that's someplace in
between x and x squared.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.230
Let's say that constant
is c, and break this area

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.210
into two different areas
with c as the divider.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.150
So that same exact
whole area we can now

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.940
write it as two
separate integrals.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.360
So one integral that
represents this area right over

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.562
here, and then another integral
that represents this area

00:02:14.562 --> 00:02:16.020
right over there,
and where we just

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.520
say c is some constant
between x and x squared.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.269
Well, how can we denote
this area in purple?

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.310
Well, that's going to be--
So this thing is going

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.250
to be equal to the sum
of these two areas.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.500
The purple area we can show
is the definite integral

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:39.240
from x to c of our function
of t, cosine t over t dt.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.100
And then to that we're
going to add the green area.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100
And then we'll get
the original area.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.020
So for the green area, our
lower bound of integration

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.590
is now our constant c, and
our upper bound of integration

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:00.630
is x squared, and it's going
to be of cosine t over t dt.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.280
And this is a form where, if
we know how to apply the chain

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.660
rule, we can apply the
fundamental theorem

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.690
of calculus.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.260
And this is almost in a form.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.552
We're used to seeing it where
the x is the upper bound.

00:03:10.552 --> 00:03:12.218
And, well, we already
know what happens.

00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:14.210
We can swap these two
bounds, but it'll just

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.760
be the negative
of that integral.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.850
So this is going to be equal
to-- let me rewrite it--

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.360
the negative of the
definite integral from c

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.170
to x of cosine t over t dt.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.330
And then we have plus
the definite integral

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:41.497
that goes from c to x squared
of cosine t over t dt.

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:43.830
So all we've done is we've
rewritten this thing in a way

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.930
that we're used to applying
the fundamental theorem

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.090
of calculus.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.579
So if we want to find
F prime of x, well,

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.370
applying the derivative
operator over here,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.078
we're going to have
a negative out front.

00:03:56.078 --> 00:04:00.530
It's going to be equal to
negative cosine x over x.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.360
Once again, just the
fundamental theorem of calculus.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.830
And then plus--
we're first going

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.000
to take the derivative of
this thing with respect

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.790
to x squared, and
that's going to give you

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.480
cosine of x squared
over x squared.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.057
Wherever you saw t, you
replace it with an x squared.

00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:22.890
And then you're going
to multiply that times

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.530
the derivative of x
squared with respect to x.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.420
So that's just going
to be-- derivative

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.075
of x squared with
respect to x is just 2x.

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:31.700
And we're done.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.350
We just need to
simplify this thing.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.400
So all of this is going to
be equal to negative cosine

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.750
x over x plus-- well, this
is going to cancel out

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.650
with just one of those-- plus
2 cosine x squared over x.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.540
And I guess we could simplify
it even more as being equal to--

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.590
and we can swap these--
everything over x 2 cosine

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.730
of x squared minus cosine of x.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.790
And we are done.
