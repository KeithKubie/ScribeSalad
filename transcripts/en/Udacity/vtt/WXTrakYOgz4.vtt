00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.770
To solidify our understanding of
this inverse Fast Fourier Transform,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.410
let's do an exercise.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.120
Suppose that A is at most a cubic, and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.600
the values at the fourth roots
of unity are as shown here.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.580
And I want you to find
the coefficients of A.
