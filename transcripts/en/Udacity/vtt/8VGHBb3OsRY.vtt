00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.230
At the end of the previous video, we ended up the following iteration.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.770
We proposed reduced feature set that uses only

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.920
the most influential features on interselection time of Starburst.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.830
We then evaluated how well that new updated model worked out.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.060
We were able to refine our model to address the overfitting issue.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.990
However the linear regression model we chose clearly was not

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.800
capturing the spikiness of the behavior that we observed.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.450
We can use the diagram depiction of the history of our analysis to

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.210
more rigorously identify options forward.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.259
We might continue using linear regression.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.440
And return to the feature selection stage.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.755
We initially chose the complete set of interselection times.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:39.680
Then used the reduced set.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.460
We can revisit this phase by including terms of higher order thus making it

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.230
a polynomial regression.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.720
Alternatively we could attempt to represent the regression estimator with

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.080
a different model altogether.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.290
Specifically we might try neural networks or kernel density estimation.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.820
We might find that producing a point estimator is too high a level of

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.120
precision altogether to be supported by the data we have, and

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.319
instead try to recast as a different statistical inference problem.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.940
For example, we can conduct a hypothesis test for

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.790
interselection times between Starbursts and Airheads.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.580
To provide a degree of confidence that they are not of the same popularity.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.490
The thing to notice is, because we've kept track of the decisions we've made

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.540
along the way, we're able to easily identify new possible paths.
