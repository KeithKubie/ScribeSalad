00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.450
Now that you filled in the section
headings of your master

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.430
resume spreadsheet, begin to fill out
the content within each section area.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.590
Within each section,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.630
you showcase your experience
with bullet pointed statements.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.030
So, what does a good bullet
point statement look like?

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.730
A strong bullet statement
starts with an action verb.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.220
Use a variety throughout your resume.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
A strong bullet point statement avoids
using pronouns and small words.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.440
For example, instead of, I built the
toaster, use the phrase, built toaster.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.420
This keeps your statement concise,
consistent, and direct.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.020
Strong bullet point
statements are concise.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.190
These should be a maximum of one and
a half lines each.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.920
They also include concrete and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.640
numerical evidence to show
the impact of your work.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.950
Noting achievements and
accomplishments makes a resume shine.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.040
How can you creatively transfer your
experience into concise bullet points?
