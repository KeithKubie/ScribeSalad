00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.130
I'm going to conclude this set of examples with

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.750
a system that you might also know, Bash. And in

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.000
case you don't, Bash is a Unix shell written as

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a free software replacement for the traditional Bourne shell, also

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.690
called sh. So what I'm showing here is the

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.950
descriptive architecture of the command component of Bash. So, is

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.170
the architecture, as implemented, of the command component of Bash.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.390
And the component is the one here sort of highlighted

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.120
in gray. And what you can see here, these names are

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.640
the sub components of the command component. And if we look at

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.000
this architecture, two design problems of the component can kind of jump

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.870
at us. The first one is the lack of cohesion within the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.830
component. So, if you look here, you can see that only

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.820
a few connections exist between the sub-components. And having a low cohesion

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.430
is normally not a good thing for a design. The second thing

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.860
that we can note is the high coupling. The component has tons

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.200
of connections with other components. They're, these edges that are

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.890
leaving the components and going towards other parts of the system.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.190
So basically, this component has low cohesion and high coupling, which

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.730
is exactly the opposite of how a good design should be.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.410
Given the structure, it is clear that anytime you change

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.970
this component you might need to change a bunch of other

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.440
components in the system. And of course, when changing other components

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.910
in the system, you might also need to chance the command

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.060
component as well. And along similar lines, to understand this

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.890
component you probably need to look at many other parts of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.690
the system, which is also less than ideal. And one

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.580
important point here is that with all these examples, I'm not

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.500
really trying to criticize any specific system, what I'm trying

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.380
to show instead, is how complex software architectures can be, and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.040
how much they can degrade over time. And this is true

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.660
for most systems, not just the ones that I showed you.
