[MUSIC]

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.660
There's a great anecdote about
the very first photograph taken

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.480
of Earth from the
vantage point of space.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.910
The idea was that
this photograph

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.340
occasioned a profound shift in
our understanding of ourselves.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.720
You see, for the first
time in human history

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.780
we could look back at our
planet in its entirety

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.830
and see the big picture.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.210
This provided an
ontological awakening.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.800
It changed our
story, our narrative.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.210
It upgraded our self image.
it expanded our consciousness.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.580
New maps for new
realities, as they say.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.030
Astronauts in orbit call this
experience the Overview Effect,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.370
aa a boundary shattering
sense of revelation and global

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.910
interconnectedness.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.560
Where we shake off
our petty differences

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.880
and emerge with a sense
of global responsibility,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.860
global consciousness,
and global citizenship.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.990
Carl Sagan's famous Pale Blue
Dot film echoed the same idea.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.960
From the vantage
point of space there

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.305
are no lines dividing nations,
no geographical subdivisions,

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:13.450
no flags, or racial divides,
or disputed territory.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.770
There is only Earth.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.000
A single celestial
body teeming with life.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.520
The womb in which we dwell.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.260
Yet, the fact is our
historically myopic point

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.080
of view, most certainly
are limited perspective,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.420
has resulted in much animosity.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.430
We have, all too often,
organized ourselves

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580
into competing hostile tribes.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.460
Subjugating each other
for land and resources.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.550
And misrepresenting
the big picture

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.060
into a story of
borders, subdivisions,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.230
and dividing lines.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.810
Too much hostility, not
enough empathy and compassion.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.610
Cultural differences, religion,
tribes, nation, race, these

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.510
are creative expressions
and variations that

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.550
should and could be celebrated.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.830
Instead they become
symbols that are all

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.740
too often used to create
suffocating boundaries.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.930
And they are increasingly
ill conceived

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.669
to address the challenges of a
hyper-connected global world.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.910
As advancements in
technology and information

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.350
enable greater mobility of
ideas, goods, and people,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.730
the role of the physical
border is shifting

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.480
and due for an upgrade.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.920
Conflicts remain,
and too many people

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.420
are restricted access to
the increasingly fluid means

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.000
of migration,
transportation, and movement.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.910
Migration has always
been a defining factor

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.080
of the human experience.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.300
Migration has, and continues to
touch, all nations, cultures,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.180
and regions, all
peoples on the planet.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.400
Migration has been
the seed at the heart

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.300
of thriving societies.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.150
Accelerating the dissemination
of knowledge and ideas.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.610
Restricting migration
is ultimately

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.515
like restricting
the flow of ideas.

00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:59.180
In much the same way that
we don't tolerate censorship

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.360
or book burning,
we might consider

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.040
the ways in which restricting
the free movement of people

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.730
can be equally punishing to
the idea of human flourishing.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.500
The desire to become a
global citizen is human.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.110
We all have it, and we
all share the same goals

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.110
for safety, comfort, and
prosperity for our family.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.780
Some are fortunate enough
to be able to invest

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.170
in a second residence
and citizenship.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.210
While others are forced to
seek asylum for their survival.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.910
Being a global citizen
is also about the strong

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.320
and the wealthy helping
the weak and the poor.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.890
As we saw with the Global
Citizen Tax Initiative.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.560
Boarder disputes, conflict
zones, armed borders, these

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.830
are things that persist
and need to be addressed.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.810
We need a new story, a new
lens with which to address

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.750
these inconsistencies.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.360
We need to scale up,
to unleash a truly

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.170
global citizenry, exchanging
ideas, beliefs, goods,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.210
and services.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.610
It has been said that
empathy rarely extends

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.920
beyond our line of sight.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.000
So, perhaps it is by
extending our gaze,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.910
using marvelous new storytelling
tools like virtual reality,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.710
that we can bridge divisions
and bring worlds together.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.640
Ushering in a form
of radical empathy

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.310
to see the other as ourselves.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.040
Where boundaries are
dissolved and compassionate

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.589
reins supreme.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.329
Massive transformation
of conscious.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.370
A software up-grade for mankind.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.200
Birthing a new kind
of global citizen.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.360
We can do this.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.010
