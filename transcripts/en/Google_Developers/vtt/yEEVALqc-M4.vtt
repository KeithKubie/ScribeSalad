00:00:00.997 --> 00:00:02.330
PETER LEWIS: Beacons aren't new.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.790
We've had them for thousands
and thousands of years

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.160
where, typically at
sea, they've been

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.290
used to mark important
places around the coastlines

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.550
of countries.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.100
The new Open Beacon
format from Google-- it

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.100
performs exactly
the same purpose.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.240
It marks an important
point so that when

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.660
users' devices are
moving through the world,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.440
they can have a much better
idea about the important objects

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.562
and places that are around them.

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.770
ROS VAN DER LANS: For
Amsterdam, the public transport

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.870
is very important.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.619
We have a very
dense infrastructure

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.090
designed for horse and buggy.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.825
In this project, we are
deploying thousands of Beacons

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:41.479
in trams, metros, and buses.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.020
PETER LEWIS: Google's
Beacon platform

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.620
allows deployers of Beacons,
like the City of Amsterdam,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920
to associate information
with their Beacons,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.389
and then make them
available to all developers.

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.180
ROS VAN DER LANS: We
are working on getting

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.189
a data-driven, real-time city.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:57.230
CARMEN RUIZ VICENTE: With
Google Beacon platform,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.810
we wanted to focus
on simplicity,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.810
so that developers
can focus on features.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.930
AXEL ROEST: Art Whisperer
is an application

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.730
that combines public data
about art with Beacons

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.750
to tell you about the
art piece you're looking

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.130
at in a non-intrusive way.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.790
When you walk down
the street, it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.250
will tell you what
you're staring at.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.339
If you walk away, it
will fade out again.

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:21.880
TIM DE KRAKER: So
we actually created

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.040
an app that helps you to
have better experiences when

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.690
you go out.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.695
From all the bars
around, which place

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:30.080
is best for you at that moment?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.110
Let's use the fact that we
know someone is in a bar,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.100
and close the loop between
the online part of his life

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.860
and the offline
part of his life.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.130
And that's where Beacons
have a great opportunity.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.100
KATHERINE PAYNE: Wayfindr
allows developers

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.390
and built environment
owners to understand

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.810
how they can use
Beacon technology

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.500
to allow blind people to
navigate their indoor spaces

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.430
using their smartphones.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.630
We want to be able to make sure
that whether you're getting off

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.650
a plane in Sydney, taking
the Metro in New York,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.070
or landing in Amsterdam, you get
the same consistent, reliable

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.330
instructions through
a smartphone.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.840
PAUL MANWARING:
What's a smart city?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.673
Cities aren't smart.

00:02:06.673 --> 00:02:07.860
People are smart.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.470
People make cities interactive.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.180
It's about creating moments
where those objects can connect

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.450
that person to history,
or culture, or education,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.010
or mobility, or another person.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.640
PETER LEWIS: We're excited to
see Beacon technology being

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.200
rolled out in cities, so that
we can see what innovation

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.180
developers bring to the table.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.230
