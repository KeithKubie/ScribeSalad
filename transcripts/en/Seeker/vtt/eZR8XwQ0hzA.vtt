00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.870
Pregnancy seems like a miracle, but when people
start basing health advice on that sentiment

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.759
that’s how problems start.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.499
Luckily, I've brought this science with me.

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:14.289
Let's look it over, shall we?

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:22.099
I've got a pal who just announced she's preggers,
and being pregnant comes with all sorts of

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.630
strange conversations about health which would
NOT be okay in any other situation.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.110
When you're pregnant, strangers will throw
shade at you for being in a sushi restaurant,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.340
at Starbucks, or on an airplane…

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.210
Everyone's got opinions, but do they have
facts to back it up?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.930
A big myth about pregnancy concerns fish.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.680
Fish is a staple of a healthy diet, and pregnant
women are encouraged to eat fish -- but it

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.480
DOES contain trace amounts of mercury.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.390
But not all fish are equal, so you just need
to eat the right fish.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.179
No yellowtail or bigeye tuna, but salmon is
great!

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:02.630
Check the full lists online When ingested,
methylmercury is absorbed by the central nervous

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.440
system and can impair normal brain development
in children, infants and fetuses.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.490
Other studies have connected methylmercury
consumption during pregnancy to ADHD, especially

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.490
in boys.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.300
Just remember FISH is GREAT for pregnant women
-- it's brain food after all!

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.770
Plus it contains omega-3s and decreases cognitive
decline in older people

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.670
Coffee is another thing pregnant women get
judgement for drinking.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.390
But in general, coffee won't harm a fetus.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.561
Some studies say drinking caffeine can increase
risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or other

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:32.640
weight problems.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.500
This means tea SHOULD be two sides to the
same leaf, but it isn't.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.350
Fortunately for caffeine lovers, research
isn't entirely clear -- even if the media

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.050
hype makes it seem like it is.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.150
Yes, caffeine IS a stimulant, which may cause
problems in large quantities, but drinking

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.330
less than 200 mg per day is fine.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.500
200 mg is like, one 8 to 10 ounce cup of coffee,
depending.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.380
Studies show eating peanuts while pregnant
will decrease the chances of the baby developing

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.090
an allergy to peanuts.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.390
Not to mention, peanuts are a great source
of folic acid and protein!

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.379
Though research is still ongoing, avoiding
them altogether doesn't seem to be necessary.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.230
Sometimes, you get chocolate in my peanut
butter! AND THEN there's some serious opinions

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.330
thrown around.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.640
A study published in Early Human Development
surprisingly found preggo moms who ate chocolate

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.560
also have happy babies.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.359
Their study of 300 Finnish women found those
who'd reported eating a bit of chocolate daily

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.909
had a "positively reactive" baby -- also known
as a baby who smiled and laughed a lot.

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.510
But be cautious, they didn't say it CAUSED
a happy baby, just that they're correlated.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.480
Speaking of chocolate and smiling … pregnancy
and sex has a LOT of myths surrounding it.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.290
You can still have sex when you're pregnant.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.900
The baby is surrounded by the uterus, and
an amniotic sac, the cervix has a mucus plug

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.180
sealing it shut, and the benefits of hormone
release during sex and orgasm are well documented.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.939
The contractions from orgasm are completely
different muscles from those in the uterus

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.140
-- so get jiggy with it!

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.670
That being said, STIs CAN affect the fetus;
so make sure all parties are clean and practice

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.670
safe sex.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.579
Some other myths that have been debunked by
science: go get your hair did.

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.150
There's no evidence hair dye harms the fetus
in the least; alcohol isn't great but if you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.999
slip up you're not going to mess up your kid;
hot dogs, eggs and chickens are all fine,

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.260
just make sure they are well-cooked!

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.499
Something I was surprised by, is heat -- pregnant
moms should try and keep their body temperature

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:42.859
below 102 (40C) -- so no jacuzzis, saunas
or hot yogas.

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.779
Pregnancy can be scary, especially if its
the first time.

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.630
You don't get a do-over, after all, but all
the science says don't cut your diet to only

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.689
the "safest" foods, instead just eat healthily:
lots of fruits and vegetables, some meat and

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.370
fish some dairy and grain.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.780
Keep it colorful!

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.090
We all want to believe that these wives tales
have been passed down and carry water, but

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.659
some of them are just plain made up.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.090
Do you have a science question?

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.340
That's why were here!

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.060
Let us help!
