Question I'd like you to answer for me is,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.390
going to the URL that we were just at,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.110
the New York Times RSS listing. Here's the URL.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.320
We'll also include this in the notes below so you

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.490
can copy and paste it. Use urllib and minidom in Python to download this

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.950
page and tell me how many item elements are in that listing.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.120
Remember the, the function, get elements by tag name will be particularly

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.270
useful to you on a minidom objects. Okay, have at it.
