00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.500
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.243
&gt;&gt; And, I have the honor
today of introducing Mem Fox.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.773
&gt;&gt; Chances are if you have a child,
as I do, you've read a Mem Fox book.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.036
This prolific Australian
writer is the author of more

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.823
than 35 picture books for children,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.203
including some favorites
in my own household.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.353
<i>Ten Little Fingers and Ten
Little Toes</i>, <i>Koala Lu</i>

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.493
and the very effective
<i>Time for Bed</i>.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.310


00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.386
Her first book <i>Possum Magic</i>,
the tale of two possums in search

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.576
of food that will make
the other visible again,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.396
she has said was rejected multiple
times before it became the huge best

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.496
seller internationally that it is.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.603
Her most recent book,
<i>Lets Count Goats</i>,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.856
illustrated by Jan Thomas is
a typical Mem Fix masterpiece.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.270
It is a subtle lesson that's told by
lovable animals in very witty verse.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.676
Mem is a retired teacher and a
fierce literacy advocate who lives

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.043
in Adelaide, Australia and lists
among her likes world peace

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.016
and green paper clips.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.510
[ Laughter ]

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.510
&gt;&gt; And her dislikes, which I'm
thankfully not wearing a brown

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.636
clothing, and untidiness and she
says that she enjoys sleeping

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.300
and I assume she also
enjoys writing,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.130
but I will let her tell you
more about that herself.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.730
[ Applause ]

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.156
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: Hi, or as
I bet you're dieing

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.306
for me to say, "Good day[HC1]".

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
[ Laughter ]

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.173
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: And I used to think that
Australians didn't say good day,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.623
I thought it was just something that
Americans thought Australians said,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.056
but I've been listening and we do.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.276
We do say good day.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.883
Once upon a time a very long
time ago, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.623
boys and girls, a baby was born.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.063
That baby was me.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.540
[ Laughter ]

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.553
&gt;&gt; It's hard to imagine that
I was ever a baby but I was.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.660
When I was six months old
my parents moved to Africa

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.146
and that's where I started school.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.330


00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.583
That's why I don't have
an Australian accent,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.230
I have an English accent instead.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.050
I'm so sorry that I don't
have an Australian accent,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.340
I am ashamed of the fact that I
don't have an Australian accent.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.933
My teacher, when I started school,
was a very frightening teacher.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.930
An African man called
Mr. Lorvu [phonetic].

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.196
I was the only white
child in the school.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.053
All my friends were Africans
and we learned to write sitting

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.753
under a big tree and we wrote
in the earth with our fingers.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.586
That's how I learned to write, by
putting my finger in the earth.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.293
He would do it in the air and
we would do it in the earth

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.573
and he would come around
and look at it

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.770
and if it wasn't good enough
we would sweep that bit aside

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.266
with the side of our hand and
we would do it again and then

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.686
of course we graduated later
to slates, which was fantastic

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.023
because in order to rub things out
on a slate you have to spit on it.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.990
[ Laughter ]

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.290
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: Well that was
how I learned to write.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.890
I made a lot of friends at school
and they were all Africans.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.230
I could have felt very different.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.436
I didn't feel different, I didn't
notice the color of their skin,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.370
I didn't notice the color of my skin

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.513
and I have remembered
that all my life.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.663
Now days as soon as I say to
myself, by looking at somebody,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.803
that person is different
from me I know

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.060


00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.403
that I am making a very big mistake

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.650
because that person is not very
different from me in any way.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.310
We are all like each other,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.643
we are all human beings
and we are all the same.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.096
When I grew up I remembered
my friends in my first class

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.710
and I wrote this book,
<i>Who Ever You Are</i>.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.750
[ Applause ]

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.616
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: My Mother was a
very difficult woman to please.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.810
She was the sort of
woman who thought

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.013
that if I were praised I
would get above myself.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.656
So she praised me very
rarely and especially

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.003
when I became enormously successful

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.746
with my very first book she thought
I was in mortal danger of some kind

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.593
or another, and her praise from
that time became even more sparse.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.253
However with this book
she finished it and said,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.330
without realizing what
she was doing,

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.023
this is my twenty second
book ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.556
twenty-two books I had to wait,
she said, "Oh, I love that book".

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960
[ Applause ]

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.063
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: So this book is rather
special to me for many reasons.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.043
Whoever you are, children, are
there any children in the audience?

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.550
Can I see them?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.950
I can see one or two.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.416
You know this book is funny.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.016
At the front they say
whoever you are,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.343
inside they say whoever you
are, as if we could not remember

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.756
from one page turn to the next.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.746
And amazingly, for the third time,
as if we were complete idiots,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.080
they tell us, for the third time,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.086
that this book is called
<i>Whoever You Are</i>.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.553
Can you tell me what this
book is called people?

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.420
[ Laughter ]

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.353
&gt;&gt; Audience: Whoever you are.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.886
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: Thank you.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.153
Oh, I just have to tell you
that I have a little grandson

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.620
who was born prematurely,
very, very prematurely.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.903
It will be our only grandson, he's
now, his corrected age six months,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.136
he was born on January the 4th.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.983
And I have read him -- I read
him this book every single day

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.816
in the hospital.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.083
I opened the door of the
humid crib, humidity crib,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.456
and I read him this book.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.456
So it is a very, very
special book to me.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.063
I bet you're just wishing I would
get on and read it, you know.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.650
[ Laughter ]

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.450
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: Little one, whoever
you are, wherever you are,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.800
there are little ones just
like you all over the world.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.066
Their skin may be different
from yours

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.256
and their homes may be
different from yours.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.146
Their schools may be
different from yours

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.356
and their lands may be
different from yours.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.533
Their lives may be
different from yours

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.983
and their words may be
very different from yours

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.736
but inside their hearts are just
like yours, whoever they are,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.896
wherever they are,
all over the world.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.490


00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.803
Their smiles are like yours
and they laugh just like you.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.266
Their hurts are like yours and they
cry like you too, whoever they are,

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.236
wherever they are,
all over the world.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.743
Little one when you are older

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.210
and when you are grown
you may be different

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.706
and they may be different
whoever you are, whoever they are

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.713
in this big wide world, but
remember this, joys are the same

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.750
and love is the same, pain is
the same and blood is the same,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.090
hearts are the same and smiles are
just the same wherever they are,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.546
wherever you are, wherever
we are all over the world.

[ Applause ]

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.610
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: <i>Whoever You
Are</i> makes writing look easy.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.153
It looks so easy and people read
a book like that and they say,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.853
"You know I think I'll
write a picture book one day

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.683
when I have the time", as if
time were the only requirement.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.480
As if talent had nothing
to do with it what so ever.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.016
Now you look at that book and
you think, oh what's that,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.223
she must of knocked
it up in an afternoon.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.156
But of course I didn't, because
how many of you noticed that each

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.383
of the similar items in the book
has only one syllable, one syllable.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.126
Their lives may be different,
their words may be different,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.566
their schools may be different,
joys are the same, love is the same,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.626
pain is the same, smiles
are the same.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.426
They're all one syllable words.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.900
And it drives you crazy, that
kind of detail drives you crazy

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:35.276
and I am one of the writers, the
few writers at this festival,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.850
who writes as rarely as possible.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.210
I think it adds up to about five
minutes a year because it is

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.050
so difficult to find
one syllable words.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.696
Like a good man, they're
hard to find.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.730

&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: Fortunately
I found the good man

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.793
and the syllables, so
I'm doing just fine.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.393
I'm just doing fine.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.520
My Mother was a very
wild Australian woman.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.646
When we were in Africa she
could kill a snake with one blow

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.520
from a crow bar, which
she kept at the back door.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.730
She brought me up to love Australia,
even though we didn't live there.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.643
She sang me Australian songs.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.776
She made me Australian cookies.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.643
She told me about the
beaches and the people.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.276
She read me stories about
Koalas and Kangaroos.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.476
I was the most Australian
child ever in the world,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.896
even though my home was in Africa.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.476
When I was already grown up and
married, I came back to Australia

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:38.526
and pretty soon after
that we had our own child

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.683
and we called her Chloe and she
began to grow and to love books

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:48.730
and I was so shocked to find that
there were no Australian books

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.770
for my little Australian
kid to read.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.793
I was outraged, people.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.460
I was outraged.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.460
I was outraged.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.660
Oh, yes she liked Beatrix Potter.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.260
Oh yes she loved Dr. Seuss.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.593
Oh, yes, they were all
fine, they were all fine,

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.260
but where was the Australian
book for my Australian child?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.110
Surely, I said to myself, there must
be something for an Australian child

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.316
to read that wasn't
written in England

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.116
or America, but there wasn't much.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.553
There wasn't enough.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.686
I had to do it myself.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.093
So I wrote a book, which
is now 27 years old,

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.346
it's called <i>Possum Magic</i> and
it is the best selling kid's book

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.163
in the world in Australia.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.373
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: Those of you who know
anything about books and writing

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.186
and publishing will know that
for a book to be in hard back

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.293
for 27 years is something
unbelievable,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.226
and <i>Possum Magic</i> is still

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.493
in hard back 27 years
after it was published.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.230
So I'm pleased about it.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.563
Not pleased enough to read it
to you, though, because I need

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.496
to hurry along with my talk.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.183
I assure that you will have
some questions for me at the end

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.970
of this session, but
let me guess what some

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.036
of those questions might be.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.090
One thing people always ask is,
how many books have you written?

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.070
So I will answer that
question by saying immediately

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.233
that I've written 36
books for children

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.693
and five books for grown-ups.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.126
Now the last time I spoke to
anybody, about a month ago,

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.970
I had only written 35 books
and I've now written 36.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.106
So, in the last month, in my
house, has come the new copies

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.570
of my latest book, which
are very, very exciting.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.920
Particularly, as a first time
Grandmother, I have finally,

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.020
after 39 years of waiting,
been able to put <i>For Theo</i>

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.700
at the beginning of a book.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.400
[ Applause ]

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.693
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: Oh, its so exciting
people, it's so exciting.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.653
You understand that, you know, for
me as a premature baby Grandmother

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.103
to have a six month old child
turning the pages every single time,

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.843
at six months is astonishing.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.786
I mean I did not think
that kids could do that.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.213
Flick, flick, flick.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
It's sensational and he seemed

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.920
to like this the other
day when I read to him.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.046
It came on the day that I left.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.313
It came into my house on the day
that I left, which was Wednesday.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.316
And it goes like this.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.536
Now this may not go so
well, it may not go so well

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.030
because I've never read it
before, okay, except to him,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.773
and that was just one to one.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.330
This is my first big audience, and
you know you get to know your books

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.006
after awhile and you so them
really well and you know

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:50.560
when to turn the pages and so on.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.360
[ Laughter ]

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.493
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: I'm going to
tell you the background

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.456
in how this story came to
be after I have read it.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.960
This book is called <i>Lets Count
Goats</i>, <i>Lets Count Goats</i>.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440
Are we ready?

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:09.860
I suspect inside they say
lets count goats again.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.220

idiots, we can't remember

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:20.286
from one page turn to the next.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.220
Here we go.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.886
I'm so sorry for the
people at the sides,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.486
I will promise, I love you dearly.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.763
I love you a lot.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.700
Okay, I adore you but I'm going to
have difficulty because I've got

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.160
to read the book, probably
like this.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.560
[ Laughter ]

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.186
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: And of course, you
know, you need to see the pictures

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.763
and you're so far away that it's
kind of pointless you being here.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.303
Why don't you all go home?

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:54.470
[ Laughter ]

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.670

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.470
Oh Lord okay.

mountain goat frisking in the sun

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.516
and here we see a city
goat going for a run.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.900
But can you count the seaside goats?

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.536
I think there's only one.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:14.840
So you now have to imagine
what you're seeing on each page

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.166
because you can't see the
illustrations after this okay.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.793
Here we see a drinking goat
and here a goat is eating,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.533
but can you count the little
goats lost and loudly bleeding?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.146
Here we see an airport
goat looking for her cases,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.956
but can you count the pilot goats
with goggles on their faces?

of goat playing on the vase,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.670
but can we count the rowdy
goats careering around in cars?

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.010


00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.690
Here we -- oops -- what?

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580
Oh, yes.

goat and this one's going under,

but we can we count the crossing
goats terrified of thunder?

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.220
Is that five?

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.590
Five, we are at five.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.273
Here we see the Sanford
goat playing with his toys,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.786
but we can we count the trumpet
goats making all the noise?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.700
You're counting aren't you?

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.643
Here we see a summer goat
with nothing left to mow and

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.123
but can we count the winter
goats huddled in the snow?

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.063
Seven? Here we see a fireman
goat climbing through the smoke

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.740

goats trying not to choke?

oh my God, what are we up to?

Are we sure were up to nine?

Were you counting?

Hang on, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.713
oh my goodness, thank God, I
thought there was a mistake.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.820

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:55.620
because we should be
on ten, should we not?

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.060
I mean that's how counting goats go.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.580
They go from one to ten.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.313
We are gong from nine to
five, but there's a reason

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.633
for it, okay, don't panic.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.160
Here we see the story goats
and all their shining eyes,

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.256
but can you count their pricked up
ears one, two, three, four, five,

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.793
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.200
You can? I'm not surprised.

[ Applause ]

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.040
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: At the moment
my most popular book

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.690
in Australia is a book called
<i>Where is the Green Sheep</i>.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.036
It is so popular that so many three
year olds get three copies of it

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.250
for their third birthday and they
already have a copy of their own,

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.770
so it doesn't go down well.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.970
[ Laughter ]

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.113
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: It is so popular that
the illustrator and I decided

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.396
that we would like to do a companion
book for <i>Where is the Green Sheep</i>,

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.590
and I thought a counting
book would be a great idea.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.883
However, my illustrator did
not like the text that I did,

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.006
so it could not be a companion
book because if it was going

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:20.726
to be a companion book
she had to like the text

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.713
and she didn't like the text.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.730
And she was pretty
scarey about the text

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.000
and she said well you can write your
own book but I'm not illustrating

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.993
that one and she said
you can't use sheep,

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.180
I had called the book
counting sheep.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.123
She said you can't use sheep
because that's a companion book

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.056
to green sheep and
you can't use color

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:48.993
because we've already got
<i>Coloring Green Sheep</i> .

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.606
And I wondered how many
words I could actually use

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.136
by the time I finished
this conversation.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.800
Anyway, I rewrote the book,
called it <i>Counting Goats</i>

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.280
and that's how the
book came into being.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.343
It came into being because of that.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.276
But I do want to tell you
something about my grandchild.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.323
I'm very pleased that I have
written <i>Counting Goats</i>

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.120
and that it's dedicated to him
because he will be able to count.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.200
I was with my daughter a couple of
weeks ago, and she was holding him,

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.780
and she told me something
that had happened in 1998.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.586
She said this happened in 1998.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.933
And I said, "Oh that's
only eight years ago."

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.463
And she looked at me and said, "No.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.366
No. It's 12 years ago.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.496
2010 minus 1998 is
12, its 12 years ago."

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.533
And I said, "Well, you
know, I'm a writer.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.076
I was never meant to do math,
it's not one of the things

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.423
that I have ever, ever
had the talent for.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.076
I just can't do it, I've
never been able to do it.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.330
I cannot subtract, I can't
add, I can't do anything.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.843
I can't even work out a
percentage, really, on a calculator.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.780
I mean it is appalling,
my math is appalling."

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:16.743
And she looked at this tiny child
in her arms and she said, "Oh Theo,

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.283
oh Theo what a genetic swamp
you have been born into."

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.290
[ Laughter ]

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.290
&gt;&gt; Mem Fox: So I'm very, very,

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.356
pleased that that book
has been written for him

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.783
so at least he will be able
to count even though I can't.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.863
I'm going to finish by reading a
very rowdy book so that we finish

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.666
on a loud and happy note.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.410
I was going to tell you a sad
story and then I thought no,

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:52.670
no we'll finish on a very happy note
because I want everybody to join in.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320


00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.963
This book is called
<i>Hattie and the Fox</i>.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.446
It's an old classic of mine.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.036
Are there children in the
audience that I can see?

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.570
There are children, children,
children watch my finger children.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.030
Hattie and the fox,
fox, or as you say fox.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.030

<i>Hattie and the Fox</i> by Mem Fox.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.783
How cool it that, fox twice
on the cover and probably,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.666
knowing what we've seen before,
probably inside the book as well.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:35.640
Indeed we have it,
<i>Hattie and the Fox</i>

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.333
by Mem Fox and this is how it goes.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.630
Hattie was a big black hen.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.810
One morning she looked up and said
goodness gracious me I can see a

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.016
nose in the bushes.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.743
Good grief said the goose.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.676
Well, well, said the pig.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.676
Who cares said the sheep.

But the cow said "moo" so loudly
that the fox was frightened

all so surprised that none

called <i>Guess What</i> I was asked

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.326
about the illustrator and me,
which is typically of all my books,

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:07.363
I have nothing to do
with the illustrator.

I often don't meet the illustrator.

I don't know Jan Thomas
who did goats.

the work, but I don't meet them.

told what I write.

As a writer, and because I have
know visual ability at all,

I never say to an illustrator
this is what I want,

pedestrian, it's so low level,

are absolutely astonishing.
