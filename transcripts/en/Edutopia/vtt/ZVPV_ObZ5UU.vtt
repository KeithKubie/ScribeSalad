00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:11.776
&gt;&gt;When I came here, the school was
-- had a very discouraged faculty.

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:14.676
There was a lot of
student-to-student violence.

00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:18.966
It was highly tracked, we
had seven different tracks,

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:23.836
so that's seven different segregated
groups that moved throughout the day.

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:29.306
So that caused a lot of the
animosity between student groups,

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:32.246
because some groups were
frankly treated a lot better

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:32.956
than other groups.

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:39.096
And the groups were right
along socioeconomic lines,

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:40.966
and racial lines.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:46.906
So when I first took over here, I
knew that something had to change.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:53.576
&gt;&gt;The work with the staff begin
with an investigation of the idea

00:00:53.576 --> 00:01:00.046
of Outward Bound, and could you
upset the ruts of, you know,

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:03.536
traditional thinking by getting
people out of the building

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.726
and on an Outward Bound course,

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:10.486
and so that's where I
started, and I got...

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:14.826
The first time we had just five
people, and myself, six of us,

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.956
went on an outward bound
course, and we began realizing

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:22.196
that somehow we had to
bring this back to school,

00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:25.506
somehow the teamwork really
worked in the wilderness,

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:26.876
could it work in the school?

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:30.066
We really learned well
when we were up there.

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.136
Could you take that learning and
bring it inside the school building?

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:37.166
The idea of Outward Bound is
not to get yourself to the top

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.036
of the mountain, but to get
everyone to the top of the mountain,

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:45.696
and that really has been the
philosophy of this school.

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:47.826
We have a lot of needy kids.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.256
How do you -- how do you
create school experiences

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:52.636
that work for all kids?

00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:56.896
How do you create a culture of
school, where every kid matters,

00:01:57.356 --> 00:02:02.416
and those are the values that we,
sort of, planned the school on.

00:02:02.716 --> 00:02:07.546
So if you have those values,
how do you operationalize them,

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:12.026
and if you stack -- so we started
looking at, who is learning here,

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:16.026
and we found that we were running
two schools, one for the haves,

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:17.436
and one for the have nots.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:23.476
So the change we made there
is, we eliminated tracking.

00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:27.086
And when you eliminate tracking
and, you know, people --

00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:29.526
teachers are used to
teaching a certain way,

00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:33.926
you also had to change the
way learning was delivered.

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:40.756
So all of the research we found
was that kids working in teams,

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:45.366
kids working on project based
learning, really worked.

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:51.336
&gt;&gt;I decided to create a leadership
team, which was representative

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:53.536
of teachers from all over the school.

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:58.636
Some who were in agreement with
what we were doing, and some not.

00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:04.166
And I presented these ideas
about changing the schedule

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:09.046
and eliminating tracking, and
could we be about a school that...

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:09.496
Could we be...

00:03:09.936 --> 00:03:16.286
Run a school that valued all kids,
and try to create some teacher time

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:19.956
to work together, so more
of a collaborative culture.

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:25.336
And the leadership team, we sort
of worked together, and we --

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:27.836
and we came to agreement
on that vision.

00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:31.946
And then we brought it
to the rest of the staff,

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:35.666
and we've moved on from there.

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:41.656
We created teams of teachers to work
on, what does a schedule looks like,

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:45.376
where teachers own time, and
that was one of the first steps.

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:51.556
And how do you teach to a variance
in classrooms, and that became

00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:55.136
when we -- that's how we
investigated expeditionary learning.

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:58.856
&gt;&gt;The staff has a lot
of autonomy here.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:03.876
They have control of time,
they make their own schedules,

00:04:04.436 --> 00:04:08.776
they make their own decisions about
what expeditions they're going to do.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:14.156
We -- my job is to support them in
any way they can, and to protect them

00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:16.706
and to make sure that
they have the resources.

00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:22.526
The protection part is, you know,
sometimes we're out on a limb,

00:04:23.606 --> 00:04:29.656
and we're doing some things that are
maybe riskier than normal school,

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:35.866
and we all know that the only way you
learn is through taking some risks.

00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:39.206
&gt;&gt;The major part of our assessment
here is the quality of student work.

00:04:40.056 --> 00:04:43.716
Every -- every expedition
kid produces several items,

00:04:43.746 --> 00:04:49.266
but there's usually a final product
that I would match that quality

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:53.196
of work up with any
school in the country.

00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:54.766
So you have that.

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:58.136
The students also maintain
a portfolio of their work,

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:01.636
which they present to their
parents two times a year,

00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:07.746
and so that they know that their
work has to be of high quality,

00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:08.886
because they're presenting it.

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:12.516
It's not about the parent coming in
asking the teacher how they're doing,

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:15.566
the student has to
present their work.

00:05:16.156 --> 00:05:19.946
So that's, I think, the
most important thing,

00:05:20.136 --> 00:05:25.896
but we also have state
standardized tests at King,

00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:28.586
just like everybody else
does in the country.

00:05:29.126 --> 00:05:38.686
And the -- and for our kids at King,
even though 56 percent of them are

00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:42.856
on free lunch, and 33 percent of
them are second language learners,

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:47.456
and we speak 31 different languages,
we score above the state average

00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:50.546
in every curriculum area,
at every grade level.

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:56.296
&gt;&gt;We have people who have come from,
I think there's 16 foreign countries

00:05:56.296 --> 00:06:00.796
to come and see how we use laptops,
and then, when they come here,

00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:03.026
they see the laptops, they say,

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.526
"Well you also have this thing
called expeditionary learning,

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:08.676
and project based learning.

00:06:09.146 --> 00:06:13.766
If we just had that, and
laptops, we could do this,

00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:16.976
but we don't have expeditionary
learning, we're just going

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:19.576
to buy laptops," and
then we have people

00:06:19.576 --> 00:06:24.956
from expeditionary learning come, who
are investigating whether they want

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:26.876
to do it, and they look
at expeditionary learning,

00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:28.706
and they said, "Well we
can't possibly do that,

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.286
because we don't have the laptops."

00:06:30.846 --> 00:06:34.416
&gt;&gt;But what we say, it's all
about engagement of kids,

00:06:34.416 --> 00:06:37.446
whether you have the laptops,
or whether you have...

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:44.446
The design of the school is, we
get kids excited about learning,

00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:50.526
and we let them go, and they
-- and the, you know, the --

00:06:50.886 --> 00:06:54.656
really the genius of this
school is not in a program,

00:06:54.656 --> 00:06:57.336
it's not in the laptops,
it's in the learning,

00:06:57.706 --> 00:07:02.196
it's in teachers designing learning
that they know will work for kids.

00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:09.346
And it's not a program, it's not
a laptop, it's the whole thing,

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:14.586
it's about, they value kids,
they know how to engage them,

00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:20.246
and they have the space and the
time and the autonomy to do it.

00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:23.076
