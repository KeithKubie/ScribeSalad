00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.120
The graphs of f of x, g of x,
and h of x are shown below.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.880
Select and drag cards to
create a compound inequality

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.920
that orders the
values of f of x,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.860
g of x, and h of x for x-values
near 2 but not at 2 itself.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.780
So for any of the x-values that
are depicted right over here,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.810
say, x is equal to 3, we see
that h of 3 is the largest,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.870
f of 3 is the smallest,
and g of 3 is in between.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.660
And that's true for
any of the x-values

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.785
that they've depicted here.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:35.860
If we look at when x is equal
to 1, h of 1 is the largest,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.710
f of 1 is the smallest,
g of 1 is in between.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.200
So for all of the x-values
that they're depicting,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.580
f of x is less than or equal
to g of x, which is less than

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.210
or equal to h of x.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.850
And the only place where they
equal based on this graph

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.290
comes into play, it looks like
as we approach x equals 2,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.530
it looks like all the
functions are approaching 1.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.590
So that's where the equal
might come into play.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.400
But let's keep seeing what
they want us to do after that.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.790
So then it says it follows that.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.262
And instead of writing f
of x, g of x, and h of x,

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:19.220
they've written the actual
definitions of them.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.330
So let's just remind
ourselves f of x is 2x times

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.060
the square root of
x minus 1 minus 1.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.410
That's this blue
one right over here.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.570
So instead writing
f of x, we can

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.400
write 2 times the square
root of x minus 1.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.435
Minus 1 is less than
or equal to g of x.

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:42.080
G of x was this rational
expression right over here.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.210
So let's go back down here.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.995
We get this rational expression.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:48.120
And then that's going to
be less than or equal to h

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.270
of x, which was, I believe,
e to the x minus 2.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.920
Is that right?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.050
Yep, e to the x minus 2.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.530
So all we've really
done is replaced

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.930
f, g, and h with
their definitions.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.300
And then this means that
the limit-- so they're

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.990
looking at the limit
as x approaches

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.450
2 of these different
expressions.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.290
So the limit as x approaches
2 of this expression

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.810
is going to be less than
or equal to the limit

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.070
as x approaches 2 of
this expression, which

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.960
is this right over here,
which is going to be less than

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.070
or equal to the
limit as x approaches

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.880
2 of this expression, which
is that right over there.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.750
And then they say
finally the value

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.060
of the limit as x approaches 2
of this thing right over here

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.280
is-- well, this is where
the squeeze theorem

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.494
comes into play.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.160
We just have to remind
ourselves-- well,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.450
let's just think about it.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.430
Can we figure out the
limit as x approaches

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.280
2 of this right over here?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.940
Well, the limit as x approaches
2-- let's see, 2 minus 1.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.940
So we're taking the
principal root of 2 minus 1,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.315
which is the
principal root of 1.

00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:56.000
So you have 2 times 1 minus 1.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.950
So this is 1.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.940
This right over here
is e to the 2 minus 2.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.430
That's either the 0,
or that's 1 as well.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.760
So the limit of all
of this is going

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.155
to be greater than
or equal to 1,

00:03:07.155 --> 00:03:09.030
and it's going to be
less than or equal to 1.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.450
Or it's right in
between 1 and 1.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.700
And the only way that it's
going to be between 1 and 1

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.050
is if it is equal to 1.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.890
This is the squeeze theorem
at play right over here.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.030
g of x, over the domain
that we've been looking at,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.800
or over the x-values
that we care about-- g

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.950
of x was less than or equal
to h of x, which was--

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.890
or f of x was less than or equal
to g of x, which was less than

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.420
or equal to h of x.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.800
And then we took the limit for
all of them as x approached 2.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.029
For the lower function, for
f of x, it approached 1.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.820
And we see it in the
graph right over here.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.610
In the lower function,
f of x approaches

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.160
1, h of x approaches 1,
and therefore, g of x

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.540
must also approach 1.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.530
And we actually see that in
this graph right over here.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.020
But anyway, we could
check our answer just

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.410
to feel good about ourselves.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.330
We got it right.
