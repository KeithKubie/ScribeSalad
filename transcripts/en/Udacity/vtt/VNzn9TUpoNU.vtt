00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.250
The sending rate of the sender is approximately 800 kbps. With

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.960
a window size of ten packets and a round trip time of 100

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.030
milliseconds the sender can send 100 packets per second. With

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.050
each packet being one kilobyte Or 8000 bits, that gives us 800,000 bits per

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.890
second or about 800 kilobits per second.
