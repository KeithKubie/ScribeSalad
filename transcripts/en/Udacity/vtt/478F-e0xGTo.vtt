00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.410
So now before we carry on, let's spend
a little bit of time comparing Epsilon

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.490
photography and Coded photography.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.240
The aim so far, I've set for the concept
of Coded Photography is to encode into

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.090
a single image, information about
the environment, the photographic

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.240
signal from the environment, and then
we can add a post capture, after we've

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.290
captured the image decoded you actually
got more information about the scene.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.338
We saw this example a little bit when
we did Light Field Cameras, right?

00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:32.670
It captured the stack of pictures
into one image representation, and

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.100
then we were able to do thinks
like do things like paralens and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.140
also change focal lens.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.070
So Coded Photography basically is,
in that, that kind of a process

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.220
where we basically, encode into the
image itself additional information that

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.970
would allow us to extract more kinds
of images out of it at a later point.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.590
Something that could actually capture
depth, parallax even focal planes, and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.660
perhaps, additional information.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.410
Epsilon Photography basically says,
rather than capture one image with all

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.450
of that information, let's capture a
series of images, a sequence of images,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.540
a sequential set of images that may
have those different variations.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.150
Take a picture, change the focal length,
take another picture.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910
That basically means, for example,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.500
if there was a fast moving object
we would actually have trouble,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.790
because we would really like
to have a much faster camera.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.460
In the case of Coded Photography, since
it's doing all of that, and if it's fast

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.040
enough in computing all of this, it can
actually capture the image in one gulp.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.550
So that's, basically one of
the big differences here.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.690
Now of course, the space that
goes from Coded Photography and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.390
Epsilon Photography couldn't be merged,
because we can actual combine them to be

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.800
able to generate null forms of images,
too.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.010
So, one thing to note
about coded photography is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.260
that each image that we may capture in a
Coded Photography signal would basically

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.150
mean that the neighborhood pixels
may have different radiations.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.950
One pixel would have focal lens at
something, the other one may actually

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.940
have it at different one, and knowing
the code that relates both of them, and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.730
knowing one pixel at the left or right
was captured, we can actually decode it,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.550
and generate something new and
interesting.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.295
Again, an example that comes to mind
is something I mentioned before,

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:10.169
bare patterns but knowing the pattern
that this one is r, this one is g, and

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.420
this one is b in a square pattern,
allowed us to decode the image.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.330
In Epsilon Photography of course,
that variation is in time.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.640
Now, all of this allows
us to now of course,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.540
create the images that can
control light over time or space.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.720
Because now we can capture a series of
images of one image that actually has

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.780
those radiations either in space or
in time, and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.870
we can preserve details about
the recorded environment.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.220
So, in essence, what I'm trying to get
to is there is this big space that we

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.310
could actually have between Coded
Photography and Epsilon Photography.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.300
Both of them are useful,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.590
and they may even overlap a little
bit in terms of what they can do.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.490
These are just labels that we're
coming up to help us kind of define

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.380
the space of different
types of photography's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.570
concepts that are related to
Computational Photography.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.920
And of course, have both overlap
between both of them, and again,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.020
at the end of the day, we're trying
to figure out how to capture the best

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.700
possible way of capturing an image that
we can actually render differently?
