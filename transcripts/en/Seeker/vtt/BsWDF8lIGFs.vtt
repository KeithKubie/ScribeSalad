00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.190
You know stock music always makes me feel
so productive.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.559
Hi there harmonically inclined homies, Trace
here for DNews.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.200
We all know music has the power to alter behaviours,
like when Queen Bey makes you dance or Adele

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.220
helps you work through a difficult breakup.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.880
But music also helps us get through more mundane
times, like the workday.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.320
When I’m writing, I like to put on my headphones
and pump up the jams… like Girl Talk or

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.710
the National Treasure soundtrack.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.710
No judgement.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.500
And that may not be such a bad thing.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.370
A recent study in the Journal of Organizational
Behavior took a close look at how music affects

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.960
cooperation.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.620
Researchers put 78 college students into two
groups: one exposed to happy music, and the

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.570
other exposed to unhappy music.4

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.329
Now, before we go any further, we know “happy”
is a pretty broad term, but according to these

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.870
researchers they decided to add “Yellow
Submarine” by the Beatles; “Walking on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.890
Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves; and
-- of course -- the theme song from “Happy

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.329
Days” to this happy music playlist.4 And
for unhappy music, they played songs from

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.969
less familiar heavy metal bands.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:09.990
Tunes like “Smokahontas” by Attack Attack!
and “You Ain't No Family” by Iwrestledabearonce.4

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630
Cool band name, by the way.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.909
Alright, back to the study.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.150
Individuals had to decide how much money they
wanted to put into a group pool and how much

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.790
they wanted to keep for themselves.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.640
To incentivize cooperation, money put into
the pool would be multiplied one and a half

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.870
times before being split evenly.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.850
The results showed that contributions into
the pool were about one-third higher than

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.950
with happy music than with unhappy.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.700
And listening to music you like is not just
good for group work.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.840
A music therapy expert at the University of
Miami conducted a study with 56 computer developers

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.520
who were asked to keep a detailed music log.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.450
In the log, participants recorded how they
felt before and after listening to music,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.560
how long they listened, and their music selections.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.740
The log was then compared to their overall
quality of work.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.970
The results showed that developers came up
with better ideas plus worked better and faster

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.420
with music on.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
Without music, they had poorer work quality
overall.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.740
So music may make you more cooperative and
increase your productivity, but there is also

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.420
evidence that it can sometimes have a negative
effect, depending on the task at hand.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.510
One study at Florida Atlantic University observed
45 students to see how fast they wrote essays

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.090
with or without music.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.400
The results showed that those who listened
to music while writing wrote slower by an

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.099
average of 60 words per hour, concluding that
music may actually be distracting when doing

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.900
something as cognitive as essay writing.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.980
So when it comes to music in the workplace,
remember that there are as many variables

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.510
as there are different musical genres.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.150
Not only should you consider happy versus
unhappy music -- whatever that may be for

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.340
you -- but also consider what it is you actually
do at work.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.780
If you’re going through a vacation's worth
of junk email, go ahead and turn on those

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.780
beats!

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.982
But if you’re trying to meet a tight deadline
on a quarterly report, silence just may be

00:02:51.982 --> 00:02:53.050
your best bet.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.540
Understanding how music can affect you is
not just good for getting work done, it's

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.599
a profitable area of study.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.569
Casinos also use music and different musical
cues to keep you gambling and happy.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.019
I learned that in Casino Secrets on DiscoveryGO.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.170
DiscoveryGo lets you watch your favorite Discovery
shows on your phone or tablet.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.530
Download it for free at your app store!

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.170
So just because “Yellow Submarine” was
classified as “happy” music by some researchers

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.849
doesn’t necessary mean it’s good music...or
does it?

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.810
- Is There A Formula Behind Good Music?

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:33.099
Host Jules talks more about it in this video.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:42.459
What do you listen to when you want to get
ish done?

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.200
Seriously, I am standing by this National
Treasure Soundtrack.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.269
It's amazing for my brain…

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:53.269
I can't do a Nick Cage impression, but if
i could I would.
