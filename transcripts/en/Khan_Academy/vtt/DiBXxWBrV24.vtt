00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.240
Welcome back.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.200
When I left off, I was hurrying
a little bit.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.510
But we'd hopefully come to the
conclusion that if I have a

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.780
simple lever, like I have here,
and I know the distances

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.280
from where I'm applying
the force, to the

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.360
fulcrum, to the pivot.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.379
And I know the distance from the
pivot to where the machine

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.745
is essentially applying the
force, the machine being the

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:21.710
lever in this situation, I know
the relationship between

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.380
the two forces I'm applying.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.005
The input force-- so actually I
shouldn't call this a force

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.010
too, I should call this an
input force-- anyway, the

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.010
input force times the distance
from the input force to the

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.980
fulcrum is equal to the output
force times the distance from

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.010
the output force
to the fulcrum.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.860
And that all fell out of what
we did in the last video.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.280
The conservation of energy and
that the work in has to equal

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.850
the work out.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.590
And all work is, is a transfer
of energy, so the transfer of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.980
energy in has to be the transfer
of energy out,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.050
assuming we have no friction
and none of the energy is

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.690
lost.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.520
And how is this useful?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.050
Well we could do a bunch
of problems with this.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.930
Let's say that I have
a 100 newton object

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.820
right here, 100 newtons.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.810
And let's say that I know, no
matter what I do, my maximum

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.060
strength that I could push--
well let me draw this a little

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.740
different-- let's say it's like
this, cause of my goal is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.870
to lift the 100 newton object.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.050
So the 100 newton object
is right here.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.150
That's a 100 newtons.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.180
And let's say I know that the
maximum downward force that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.530
I'm capable of applying is
only 10 newtons, right?

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.940
So I want my force to
be multiplied by 10

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.380
to lift this force.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.510
So let's figure out
what would happen.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.830
My input force is 10.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.530
And I want to figure
out the distance.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.530
So let's say my input
force is 10.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.220
And let's call this the
input distance.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.920
And I want the output force
to be 100, right?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.290
And let's call this the
output distance.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.540
So if I have a fulcrum here,
this is the input distance and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.770
this is the output distance.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.340
Let me switch colors.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.530
This is getting monotonous.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.670
This is the output distance,
from here to here.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.680
And let's figure out what the
ratio has to be, for the ratio

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.970
of the input distance to
the output distance.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.400
Well, if we just divide both
sides by 10, we get the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.910
distance input.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.610
It has to be 10 times the
distance output, right?

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.680
100 divided by 10.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.030
So if the distance from the
fulcrum to the weight is, I

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.980
don't know, 5 meters, then the
distance from where I'm

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.920
applying the force to
the fulcrum has

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.750
to be 10 times that.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.060
It has to be 50 meters.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.390
So no matter what, the ratio of
this length to this length

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.350
has to be 10.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.090
And now what would happen?

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.210
If I design this machine this
way, I will be able to apply

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.790
10 newtons here, which is my
maximum strength, 10 newtons

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.570
downwards, and I will lift
a 100 newton object.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.960
And now what's the
trade off though?

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.560
Nothing just pops
out of thin air.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.245
The trade off is, is that I am
going to have to push down for

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:59.300
a much longer distance, for
actually 10 times the distance

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.360
as this object is going
to move up.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.210
And once again I know that
because the work in has to

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.000
equal the work out.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.200
I can't through some magical
machine-- and if you were able

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.330
to invent one, you shouldn't
watch this video and you

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.840
should go build it and become a
trillionaire-- but a machine

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.020
can never generate work
out of thin air.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.660
Or it can never generate
energy out of thin air.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.600
That energy has to come
from some place.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.970
Most machines actually you lose
energy to friction or

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.660
whatever else.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.080
But in this situation, if I'm
putting in 10 newtons of force

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.660
times some distance, whatever
that quantity is of work, the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.900
work cannot change.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.490
The total work.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.910
It can go down if there is some
friction in the system.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.470
So let's do another problem.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.480
And really they're all kind
of the same formula.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.670
And then I'll move into a few
other types of simple systems.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.130
I should use the line tool.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.060
We'll make this up on the fly.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.180
And you could always create
problems where you can

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.800
compound it further and et
cetera, et cetera, using some

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.870
of the other concepts
we've learned.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.600
But I won't worry about
that right now.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.630
So let's say that I'm going
to push up here.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.830
Well no let me see what
I want to do.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:35.380
I want to push down here with
a force of-- let's say that

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:44.000
this distance right here is 35
meters, this distance is 5

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.550
meters-- and let's say I'm going
to push down with the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.730
force of 7 newtons, and what
I want to figure out is how

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.190
heavy of an object
can I lift here.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.840
How heavy of an object.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.560
Well, all we have to do is
use the same formula.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.240
But the moments-- and I know I
used that word once before, so

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.670
you might not know what it is--
but the moments on both

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.980
sides of the fulcrum have
to be the same.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.460
Or the input moment has to
be the output moment.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.730
So what's the moment again?

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.560
Well, the moment is just the
force times the distance from

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.680
the force to the fulcrum.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.360
So the input moment is 7 newtons
times 35 meters.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.915
And realize that that does not
work, because the distance

00:05:21.915 --> 00:05:24.740
this force is traveling
is not 35 meters.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.240
The distance this force
is traveling is

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.470
something like, here.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.320
But this 35 meters is going
to be proportional to the

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.490
distance that this is traveling
when you compare it

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.910
to this other side.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.950
So this quantity, 7
newtons times 35

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.390
meters, is the moment.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.990
And that is going to be equal
to the moment on this side,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.500
the output moment.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.780
So that is equal to 5 meters
times the force that I'm

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.405
lifting, or the lifting force
of the machine, times let's

00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:53.380
say the force out.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.230
So we can figure out the force
out by just dividing both

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.280
sides by 5.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.310
So let's see, 35 divided by 5
is 7, so you get 7 times 7

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.720
equals the force out,
or 49 newtons.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.280
And you can see that, because
you can see that the length of

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.320
this side of the lever is 7
times the length of this side

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.710
of the lever.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.830
So when you input a force of
7, you output a force of 7

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.650
times that.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.820
And of course, in order to move
the block 1 meter up in

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.760
this direction, you're
going to have to

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.210
push down for 7 meters.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.450
And that's where we know that
the input work is equal to the

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.580
output work.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.920
Well anyway hopefully I didn't
confuse you and you have a

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.470
reasonable sense of
how levers work.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.050
In the next couple of videos,
I'll introduce you to other

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.680
machines, simple machines like
a wedge-- I've always had

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.140
trouble calling a wedge
a machine, but it

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.040
is one-- and pulleys.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.290
I'll see you in the next video.
