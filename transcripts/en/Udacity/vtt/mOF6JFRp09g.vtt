00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.490
That sort of ends what I'm going to
tell you about the brain and

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.570
visual function right now.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.040
It is a huge area of research,
as you can imagine.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.770
It's, it's, it's really
fundamental to the human system.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.309
As I said, somewhere around 30%
of our cortex is devoted to this.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.250
We get insights from computation in
understanding what the brain does.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.150
And sometimes we get
insights from brain and

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.870
neurophysiology to thinking
about the computation.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.580
And it's one of the areas in which we
get some direct connection between what

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.159
you might think of as artificial
intelligence and natural intelligence.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.320
It's one of the areas that
we've pushed furthest on that.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.140
There's also work going on, for example,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.060
in computational modeling of,
aud of hearing, audition right?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.750
So to understand what goes on in the
human system versus artificial system.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.860
And in the other senses things
are just getting started.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.730
So haptics, how do you go from touch?

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600
I can touch an object and
I can tell you about it's shape.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.260
How do I do that?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.972
How can I tell that a texture, oh
that's probably the skin of an orange?

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.250
All right,
its a computational problem, and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.790
we'd like to get insight back and forth.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.130
So, sensation in general and
on robotics side, motor control,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.640
is trying to get a computational
model of what goes on in the brain.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.408
All right, so that's really all I'm
going to tell you about the brain.

00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:14.269
It is fascinating stuff and
even in the popular literature,

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:16.714
there's a lot of information
getting out there that I,

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:19.640
that I would deeply encourage
you to go take a look.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.150
And I think you'll enjoy it.
