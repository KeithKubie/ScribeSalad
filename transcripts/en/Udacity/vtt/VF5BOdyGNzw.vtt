00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.810
I left one thing out when I said that the .prototype objects that come for

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.700
free on functions were just as uninteresting as any other new object that we

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.520
could use for storing methods.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.490
In fact, these prototype objects come with one

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.328
extra convenience property that almost no other object has.

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:22.400
Every .prototype object has a .constructor property which points back to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.760
the function it came attached to.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.520
Thus, there is a mutual linking between any new function and

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.380
it's companion .prototype object, because car links to .prototype object,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.030
and prototype links back to the car object.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.390
Car.prototype.constructor is car itself.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.830
The main use for this feature is so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.130
that you can figure out which constructor function built a certain object.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.640
All instances of a class delegate their field lookups to their prototype,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.550
and so they should all report as having the same constructor function.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.340
What do you think would be logged as Amy's constructor property?
