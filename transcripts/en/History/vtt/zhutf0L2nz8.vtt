00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.830
Bladesmiths, this
is the strength test.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.170
To test the strength and
durability of your blades,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.880
I'm going to be taking
each of your knives

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.170
and chopping into these
butt stocks 10 times.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.710
Tony, you are up first.
You ready?

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.540
Get her done.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.040
If there is going to be
a failure on my blade,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.500
it's going to go
at the chop test.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.750
Well, Tony, first
thing, there's

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.250
a little bit of deflection
of the edge right here.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.880
But the rest of the blade
held up pretty well.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.380
Well done.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.380
Corey, you're up.
You ready?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.000
- Absolutely.
- All right.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.580
I really don't know
anything about a gun stock.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.750
It's probably not some
kind of like soft pine.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.420
That's probably not going
to be easy on the blade.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.620
Well, Corey, I'm not supposed
to work on your knives.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.920
But I think I put another
thumb groove on this side.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.080
It's rolled completely around.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
There's no denying that's
a pretty significant role.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.120
Frank, you're up.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.710
Are you ready.
- Let's do it.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.460
I know I heat treated
that edge correctly.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.040
And the blade is strong.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.710
I'm just hoping that warp,
nothing will happen there.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.170
So Frank, you can see,
it took a little bend.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.790
But the good news is that
your edge held up really well.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.920
Your handle was
very comfortable.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.750
The shape of it was
easy to control.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.670
I could index very easily.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.830
But there's no denying, it
took a pretty significant bend.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.750
I see that bend in my
blade, and it got me nervous,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.920
you know.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.830
All of our blades
suffered damage.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.500
So it's up in the air now.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.250
Anything could happen.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.500
All right, gentlemen,
this is the sharpness test.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
I'll be slicing
through these apples.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500
What I'm looking for is a really
clean cut where we're splitting

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.830
apples as opposed to
breaking them or just

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.540
pushing them out of the way.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.380
And unlike the strength test,
this test is all about what

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.040
your knives do to the apples.
Tony, you're up.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.380
You ready?
- Yes, I am.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.670
All right, so your
edge is very sharp.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.210
Even on the damage here
where it deflected,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.880
I mean you can see the apples,
it went right through them.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.380
And even with that
notch, cut beautifully.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.500
Well done.
- Thank you.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.880
- Really well done.
- Thank you.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.670
All right, Corey, you're up.
Are you ready?

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.750
We'll see what it can do.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.080
All right.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.040
With all my catastrophic
edge deflection,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.710
there is just no chance it's
going to be able to perform.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.500
All right, so the apple kind
of tells the tale right there.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.670
You can see that dip in
the apple, what happened

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.710
is it just skated the blade
up and out of the way.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.880
With so much edge damage,
it's just not a cutter.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.000
Frank, you're up.
Are you ready?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.170
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.250
So, Frank, your blade is plenty
sharp and actually cuts fine.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.750
The problem is that warp.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.290
With the warp in that
blade as it moves across,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.620
it just starts pulling up.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.420
And once it starts
changing direction,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.790
it just flies up
out of those apples.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.790
I mean you can actually see
this big curve up in the cuts.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.960
But it's sharp.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.710
It's still a cutter.
Nicely done.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.420
Thank you.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.790
Bladesmiths.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.120
The judges have made
their final decision.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.960
The Bladesmith leaving
the forge is Corey.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.000
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.670
Well, Corey, although
Frank's blade did take a bend,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.080
yours took unfortunately
a catastrophic

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.330
and irreparable edge failure.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
And it's for that reason
we have to let you go.
