[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.360
RENEE MCGREGOR: Thank you very
much for coming this afternoon,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.870
and thanks to Louise
and Google Food Talks

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.610
for inviting me to speak.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.060
So I'm going to talk to you a
little bit about orthorexia.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.070
Any of you have any
idea what orthorexia is?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.570
Some of you are nodding.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.120
Some are saying,
no, not so sure.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.450
What would you say
orthorexia was?

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.270
What was your idea,
what's your definition?

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.230
AUDIENCE: It's an unhealthy
obsession with healthy eating.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.640
RENEE MCGREGOR: Yes.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.090
Pretty much.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.390
You've pretty much hit the
nail on the head, there.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.980
That's exactly what it is.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440
So yeah.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.020
I think it's a really
interesting topic.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.020
It's a fairly new term.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.890
It was only brought to
our attention in 1996,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.820
when Steve Bratman, who's
a physician in the states,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.550
identified it as an issue
with a lot of his clients

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.570
who were trying to be
healthy, but it had almost

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.361
gotten to the point
where it was obsessive.

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:58.340
So when you break
down orthorexia,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.660
it is basically the obsession
with being pure, of eating

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.910
correctly, is the exact term.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.950
And I think it's come
about because there are so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.310
many ideas around
what healthy is.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.520
So one of my questions to
you is what does it actually

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.030
mean to be healthy in 2017?

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.010
What are your thoughts?

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.830
I ask this whenever
I do workshops.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.200
And I do workshops with schools,
with athletes, with coaches,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.760
with school nurses
a lot as well,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.010
because they do a lot of
work around disordered eating

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.574
and poor relationships
with food.

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:32.240
It's really interesting
what comes back.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.670
So I'd love to know what
you think healthy eating is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.132
or what it means to
be healthy in 2017.

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:41.048
AUDIENCE: Well, I think
it's just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:51.920
RENEE MCGREGOR: Yeah.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.870
I love the fact that you've
picked up on the term balance.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.130
We'll go back to
that at some point.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.754
Anybody else want to
add anything else?

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.638
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:04.360
RENEE MCGREGOR: Yeah.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.734
And I think one of the things
I want to make really clear

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:09.093
here is sometimes people get
the wrong idea about what

00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:10.009
I'm trying to promote.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.900
I am a dietitian, so I do
promote a very healthy way

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.670
of eating, which does mean
majority eating lots of fruit,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.400
vegetables, whole grains.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.500
I'm actually in line
with some of the things

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.880
that you do here at Google.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.489
So it is what I promote.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.030
What I want to bring
to the attention

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.590
here is that actually,
sometimes, in some people,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.427
we can get a little bit extreme.

00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:33.010
And when it becomes
extreme, it starts

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.936
to affect your health
and your mental health,

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:37.310
that's when it
becomes a problem.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.143
And that's what I'm
seeing more and more of,

00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:41.510
and so that's what I
want to talk about today.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.870
So one of the challenges
I have as a practitioner

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.410
is that there are so
many messages about food.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.230
I'm sure every single day,
you pick up your phone,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.311
you look at magazines, and
there's always something new.

00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:55.810
What should we eat, who should
we follow, what should we do.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.720
And obviously, while I'm
a big fan of social media,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.940
I think it can do lots
of really positive things

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.230
and gets really positive
messages out there,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.930
I'm also slightly nervous of it.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.000
Because I think it creates
influences that don't always

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.130
give us the right messages.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.130
So these are just a few.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.079
I'm sure you know
all of these people.

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.120
And I struggle with this.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.670
Because on that
page, on that slide,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.150
there's not a single person
who is actually qualified

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.310
to give out nutritional advice.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.940
So from my point of view,
when you are putting stuff out

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.370
on Instagram, or
you're doing blogs,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.950
or you're writing articles,
you're writing books,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.550
even, actually you're
getting some misinformation.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.740
And the problem comes not
to the majority of us.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.920
The majority of us can read
something and go, yeah,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.420
I'll take a bit of that, but
I'm going to forget about that.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.380
That's OK.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.720
The problem comes when
you or somebody that maybe

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.390
is a little bit
susceptible to developing

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.970
a poor relationship with food.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.860
And again, we'll go through
what that would look like.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.515
So I guess some of
the big trends that

00:03:56.515 --> 00:04:00.340
have come out over the
last few years, eat clean.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.720
I think we all hear about that.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.160
It's always hashtag #eatclean.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.850
That's the big thing.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.500
It's almost like
a badge of honor.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.610
I mean, the number of
athletes and clients

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.440
that have come to see
me, and they're like,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.282
I always eat clean.

00:04:12.282 --> 00:04:13.990
And they're really
excited about the fact

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.656
that they're actually
saying that to me.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:16.839
And I'm like, OK.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.790
And they're then really
a bit like, well, you

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.665
don't seem impressed.

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:21.709
And I'm like, well,
what does that mean?

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.800
What does eat clean
actually mean?

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.010
Because from my point of view,
if I don't follow your rules,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.530
then somehow it makes me
feel like I'm eating dirty,

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.910
which I know I don't.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.650
So for me, labeling
and terms and hashtags,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.420
while they're
brilliant and useful,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.310
these things can
be really quite--

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.760
they can be quite detrimental
to a lot of people.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.880
So eating clean, green
juices, superfoods, these

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.630
are all things we hear
about all the time.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.697
And I am not for
one second saying

00:04:49.697 --> 00:04:51.280
that you shouldn't
have a green juice,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.460
and you shouldn't eat foods
that seem to be super,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.951
although I don't ever believe
in a particular one food being

00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:58.450
super.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.370
It's more about your
collection of foods

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.250
that then gives you a balanced
diet and all the nutrients

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.910
you need.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.490
In the same way, I don't
demonize any foods.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.630
Because I don't believe one
food group alone or one food

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.350
is what is going to cause
you negative health problems.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.260
So some of the common
misconceptions.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.530
Sugar.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.260
Let's talk about sugar.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.420
What do we know about sugar?

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.810
What do we hear about sugar?

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.590
Anyone want to tell
me what they-- are

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.075
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:34.560
Like, when we hear
sugar, and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:49.885 --> 00:05:50.760
RENEE MCGREGOR: Yeah.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.350
Really, really,
really good answer.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.001
And the thing is for me is
that I think it's just been--

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:57.750
it's been blown out
of proportion as well.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.540
Because again, we have
bloggers and influencers who

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.480
talk about refined sugar
free and sugar free cakes,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.220
but then you look
at the recipes,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.400
and they're full of maple
syrup and coconut sugar,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.310
and that somehow is
deemed healthier.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.460
But actually, at the end
of the day, sugar is sugar.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.790
Whether it is molasses, honey,
white sugar, maple syrup.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.960
And one of my biggest challenges
to some of the bloggers--

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.670
and I have been on stage with
one, but I won't go there.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.240
Is that actually, at
the end of the day,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.030
you say that white
sugar is processed.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.650
Well, it's no different to
removing the sap from coconut

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.610
to make coconut sugar.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.800
It's exactly the same process.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.280
There is no difference.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.620
So you cannot say that white
table sugar is processed

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.007
and coconut sugar isn't,
because they're the same thing.

00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:50.590
Biggest thing about
all of it, though,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.715
is that they all give you
the same amount of energy

00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:56.760
per 100 grams, and they all
are used in the body in exactly

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.750
the same way.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.299
The body cannot go, oh,
this is coconut sugar,

00:07:02.299 --> 00:07:04.590
it's better for me, so I'm
going to use it in this way.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.280
It doesn't.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.130
It just literally breaks it
down, uses it in the same way.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.650
If you eat any
product to excess,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.990
any product to excess
of what your body needs,

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.660
it will get stored as excess.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.900
The only thing I
would say potentially,

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.450
in defense of some of
these other sugars,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.840
is that things like maple
syrup, honey, they are sweeter.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.330
So potentially,
you could use less.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.380
Potentially.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.390
But that's probably the
only thing I would say.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.870
So otherwise, for
me, whether you're

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.170
using white table
sugar in your cake,

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.570
or whether you're using
honey, it makes no difference.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.070
It's still a cake.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.270
Enjoy it.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.050
Embrace it.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.340
Because actually,
there's nothing wrong

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.140
with having cake or dessert
every now and again.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.014
And that's kind of what
I want to get across.

00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:53.880
I don't-- I get really cross
when I see people having

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.047
a brownie, and they'll
be, it's brilliant.

00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:58.380
It's really healthy for me,
because not only is it sugar

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.120
free, it's also gluten free.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.830
And it's like, it's
still a brownie.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.797
It still gives you the
same amount of energy.

00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:05.880
It's still going to be
used in the body in exactly

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.062
the same way.

00:08:07.062 --> 00:08:09.270
Actually, from my point of
view, if I want a brownie,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.010
I'm just going to eat a brownie.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.500
Simple as that.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.540
Similarly plant-based milks.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.420
Now, I get a lot of grief
about plant-based milks,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.840
because people seem
to think that I'm

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.660
a real Nazi against them.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.540
The only reason I struggle
with plant-based milks

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.260
is because they are
promoted in the wrong way.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.370
There's nothing wrong with using
almond milk or oat milk or hemp

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.070
milk, or whatever you want to
use, if you prefer the taste.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.539
But don't kid
yourself that you're

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.150
going to get the same nutrients
as you would from cow's milk.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.720
That's the only
thing I would say.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.070
So I'm not anti any of them.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.040
I would probably say that
actually, for some people,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.250
the taste of almond milk
is better than cow's milk.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.130
They prefer it.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:54.630
Great.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.920
But don't kid yourself
that you're going

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.003
to get the same nutrients.

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:59.250
This is particularly,
I find, with athletes.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.430
Because obviously, when
it comes to working in--

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.230
the performance
athletes I work with,

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.840
milk is such an
important recovery drink,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.370
because it's the
right composition

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.930
of carbs and protein.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.050
So if they then think they can
recover in the same way with

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.610
almond milk, they don't.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.070
And you can see from
the table that if you

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.790
look at 200 mils of almond milk
versus 200 mils of skim milk,

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.530
almond looks just pretty
much expensive water.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.020
So what I say to
people is by all means,

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.200
use it, but don't kid
yourself in thinking

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.910
it's got the same nutrients.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.340
A lot of the milks--

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.190
I say milks.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.481
I have to do this, because
it's not really milk, is it?

00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:36.570
But a lot of the
plant-based milks

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.610
are fortified with calcium
now, which is a benefit.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.400
I did a talk two
days ago in Belfast,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.620
and there was a professor who
is very big on her bone health

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.410
research.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.560
And one of the things
that she came--

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.393
what she was talking
about is that actually,

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:57.330
the intake of calcium is so
important for our bone health.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.400
And it doesn't matter
how you get it,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.630
but it's really important.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.710
If you are below par,
especially when you're

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.230
in your late teens,
early 20s, it

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.770
can have a real negative impact
on your health in your 60s

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.370
and 70s.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.050
So it's a really important area.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.920
Gluten.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.280
I've already mentioned gluten.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.500
Again, I don't have an issue.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.780
If people want to
be gluten free,

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.237
that's entirely up to them.

00:10:26.237 --> 00:10:28.070
What I find interesting
is that when I first

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.950
qualified as a dietitian
many, many years ago,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.900
nobody wanted to be gluten free.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.190
Celiacs hated being gluten
free, because actually, there

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.930
wasn't an awful lot
of choice out there.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.970
And the foods out there
that were provided

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.870
were really high in fat, really
unpalatable, and really high

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.560
in salt, and nobody
wanted to do it.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.060
And now it just
amazes me that we've

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.660
got so many different
options that people

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.740
want to be gluten free
because they totally

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.150
believe it's healthier.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.170
There is no evidence in
any article you will read--

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.450
a proper, credible
scientific article that is--

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.000
that being gluten
free will benefit you

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.890
if you don't need to be.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.107
Obviously, if you have a
medical reason, then of course

00:11:07.107 --> 00:11:08.690
you have to follow
a gluten-free diet.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.150
And again, what I find
really interesting is

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.540
that the athletes and the
clients I work with who do

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.640
have to be gluten
free, they really moan.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.570
They don't like it.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.490
They still don't
think it's fair.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.280
But at the end of
the day, I think

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.800
it's just been
highlighted as a kind

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:31.340
of a "cure" for immune problems
and digestive problems.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.840
Often the reason why somebody
who goes gluten free feels

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.340
better is because
actually, when you

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.590
change any aspect of your
diet, when you decide

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.570
you're going to
follow a new thing,

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.000
you become more mindful
of what you eat.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.700
If you become more
mindful of what you eat,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.870
you get a balanced diet.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.944
And actually, that's
what makes you better.

00:11:49.944 --> 00:11:51.360
That's what makes
you feel better.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.820
It's not necessary that you've
gone gluten free or sugar free

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.260
or dairy free, it's
actually that you've just

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.310
become more mindful.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.410
And that's something
that I hope--

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.880
is a message I really
want to get out there.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.040
So what is the impact of this
kind of hashtag #eatingclean

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.700
or where does it come into--
how does it become orthorexia?

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.090
So orthorexia, as we
said, is the obsession

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.330
with eating correctly.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.970
It's with eating pure.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.444
And the problem is what might
start off as a really innocent,

00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:24.610
I'm just going to try make
myself feel a bit better.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.780
I'm just going to eat--

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.970
just try and cut out--

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.670
maybe cut out the takeaways, or
cut out the biscuits and cakes

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.230
every day, or whatever it is.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.010
That's fine.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.910
We all do that.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.562
I have weeks where
I go, my goodness,

00:12:38.562 --> 00:12:39.770
I've eaten so much chocolate.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.400
I really need to have two weeks
where I don't eat very much.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.190
That's normal.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.160
That's not me being obsessive.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.380
When it becomes obsessive
is actually when you cannot

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.400
deviate.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.341
So when you start restricting,
and you basically cannot

00:12:52.341 --> 00:12:52.840
deviate.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.548
And it starts to have
an impact on things

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:57.190
like your social life.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:02.050
So sadly, I see lots of
people that come into clinic,

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.780
and they think they're
fit and healthy.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.240
They think that they're
doing everything right.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.000
But they can't join
in with their friends.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.430
And I personally find
that really, really sad.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.800
Because for me, food
is more than just fuel.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.020
Food is about relationships.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.360
It's about networking.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.040
It's about bringing
people together.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.550
And it's so important.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.270
It's kind of-- when
I sit at a table,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.330
I can often spot someone
who's got food anxiety

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.041
because they're not joining in.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:32.290
They're so fixated on whether
they can eat this or not

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.340
eat it, they miss out on
that real connectivity

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.100
time with the people
you want to be with.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.770
I know when I'm--

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.030
my job takes me all
over the country

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.200
and to different
countries as well.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.580
And I really miss out on
that time with my friends.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.400
So the first thing
I do when I get back

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.520
into the UK or back home
is organize a meal out

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.480
with some friends.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.800
I don't care what we're eating.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.000
I'm just there
because I actually

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.230
want to spend some
time with my friends,

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.580
but it's just nice to do
it over food and wine.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.370
So for me, that's a
really important thing.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.400
So the problem we
have is once you've

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.951
got somebody that's following
these very strict food rules,

00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:10.450
they follow it
because it makes them

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.180
feel very safe and controlled.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.652
It gives them something
to fixate on and focus on.

00:14:16.652 --> 00:14:18.985
But it can also then start
to create things like vitamin

00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:20.200
and mineral deficiencies.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.920
So if you go dairy free, and
you don't replace it correctly,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.660
you will end up with maybe
a deficiency in calcium

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.520
and also, potentially,
phosphorus.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.360
These are really important
for bone and teeth and also

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.720
muscle contraction.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.430
So that can be a problem.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.660
You might-- if you
decide to go gluten free,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.930
you actually might find you
don't eat as much whole grain.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.160
Actually, whole grains are
really important for the

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.580
got biome, and we all
are hearing loads more

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.590
about how important
the gut biome is

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.390
and how that can help
your mental health,

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.640
and how that can also help
your digestive system.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.010
But again, people don't
realize that these things

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.450
are really important.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.480
So from my point of
view what people set out

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.970
to think they're
going to be healthier

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.970
actually makes them
more unhealthy,

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.720
and this is what orthorexia is.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.190
And the problem is they
can't step away from it.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.130
They find it too difficult.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.560
So I guess the question is why.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.220
Why do some people--

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.240
if we're in a room
here full of people,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.090
not everybody in this room is
ever going to have any issues.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.920
Often people, like we
said earlier, well,

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.270
why don't you read
all these new things?

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.380
You think, oh, I'll
take a bit of that,

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.430
but I'm not bothered about that.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.388
Like, if somebody said
to me that you can never

00:15:32.388 --> 00:15:34.300
eat chocolate again,
I'd be completely

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.210
and utterly kind of distraught.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.430
But that's just me.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:43.150
So why do some people look
for food as the answer?

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:48.064
Well, it's really about
your personality type.

00:15:48.064 --> 00:15:49.730
And again, I'm not
saying that everybody

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.940
that has got this
personality type

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.180
is going to develop
an eating disorder.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.388
Because in fact, when I was
writing the presentation,

00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:57.390
I was thinking,
that's actually me.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.440
And I certainly
thought, I need to be

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.950
really careful about that.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:01.450
But yeah.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:05.350
We know from studies
that generally speaking,

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.030
it tends to affect people
who are high achievers.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.760
They're very determined.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.580
They're very self-critical.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.660
They do have an
obsessive streak in them.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.320
That's kind of the
biggest element of it.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.790
And they're very sensitive.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.180
So what happens
is that they have

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:28.810
that kind of perfect framework
for where things can go wrong.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.410
And like I said,
not everybody will.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.540
And I think it's
really important

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.530
that I highlight that.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.180
You could have all those--

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.590
like I said, you could have
all those personality traits

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.210
and actually be completely fine.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.130
A lot of it is to do
about your experience.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.700
So as we go through
life, we all experience

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.480
different situations,
different circumstances,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.740
and we interpret
that in our own way.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.470
It's our perceptions.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.930
And it's those
perceptions that can then

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.351
start to create this
very negative mindset,

00:16:55.351 --> 00:16:57.100
and that's where you
then find that people

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.770
are looking for
something to help

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.420
them make them feel better.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.990
And it's much easier
to look at food,

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.119
training, some other element.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.500
It's much easier
to focus on that

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.000
and go, well, if I
control that, I'm

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.380
going to feel so much better.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.119
When actually, what
they don't appreciate

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.329
is that a lot of the issues
are going on inside them.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.440
Because they are high
achievers, because they

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.369
are people that always
want to do the best,

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.440
they never know
when that's enough.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.750
They never know when
they've hit that ceiling.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.560
And actually, they're very,
very bad at accepting failure.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.860
And this is why I see
this a lot in athletes,

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.160
because they are that very
driven personality type.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.740
They hate failing, obviously.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.140
Because to be an Olympic
or Paralympic athlete,

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.584
you have to--

00:17:43.584 --> 00:17:45.250
you don't need-- you
don't want to fail.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.560
But actually, the way I
interpret it with my athletes

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.190
is do you know what?

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.320
It doesn't matter.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.834
You learn from every experience.

00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:53.500
So if you didn't do
that well this time,

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.577
let's come, and
let's reflect on it

00:17:55.577 --> 00:17:57.910
and work out what went wrong,
and then we try and fix it

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:58.930
for next time.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.490
And these are the
things I'd love

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.260
to be seeing in schools more.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.830
Because this sort of mindset
will develop in a school.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.640
When you think about
teenage boys, teenage girls,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.640
and the bullying and the
chastising and stuff that

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.610
can happen, this is when
these things can be set up.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.370
So while that might not be the
time you develop your problem,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.900
if you are somebody
that struggles

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.860
with your sense of self and
your sense of self confidence,

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.330
a lot of these things will
be happening a lot younger.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.880
And it's only when you
get to a certain point,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.830
there'll be one particular
thing that will trigger it.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.760
But actually, the process
is started very early on.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.670
And that's why it's such a
difficult condition as well

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.550
to help, because sometimes
the feelings and the emotions

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.340
are so deeply ingrained,
it's really hard

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.780
to step away from it.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:49.060
And it's much easier to focus on
trying to eat clean and be pure

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.556
than actually deal with that
real negative kind of emotion

00:18:52.556 --> 00:18:53.680
that's going on inside you.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.520
Because that makes you
feel uncomfortable.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.502
So I've already
said orthorexia is

00:19:00.502 --> 00:19:01.710
an obsession with being pure.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.630
And Steve Bratman was the
MD That identified it.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.520
So what I wanted
to do was give you

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.700
a little bit of an
idea of what goes

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.680
on in the mind, how it works.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.690
Because none of
this is intentional.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.910
That's the other thing,
is that nobody goes out

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.440
to develop an eating disorder.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.680
Because it's really a
very miserable place.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.790
But a lot of it is
about just not feeling

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.340
that you're doing enough.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.865
You're like, I don't feel
like I'm performing my best.

00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:32.990
Well, we could probably
all say that at some point.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.943
Or we could probably all think
we could have done better.

00:19:35.943 --> 00:19:37.484
But it's when you
start acting on it.

00:19:37.484 --> 00:19:39.859
It's when you think, I need
to do something to change it.

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:41.620
Everybody else around
me is so great.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.150
And it's when you do
that constant comparison.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.310
And I always say to,
again, people I work with,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.100
especially the younger teenagers
that I tend to work with,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.510
there's a lot of comparisons.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.480
And that's another where
social media can really

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.620
come into play is the well,
they're prettier than me.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.960
They're more
successful than I am.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.540
It looks like
they've got it all.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.040
I'll tell you a funny story in
a minute, because actually, I

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.600
went through something like
that, very similar, yesterday.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.225
But I'll tell you
about it in a minute.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:11.850
But it was-- but the problem is,
you can never compare yourself

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.020
to anybody else, because
we are all unique.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.920
We are all individuals.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.030
And there is nobody else.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.440
There's nobody else
like me out there.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.670
Well, I don't think there is.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.690
But there's nobody else like me.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.840
There's nobody else like
yourselves out there.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.890
So comparing yourself
to somebody else

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.010
is just a futile way of
making yourself feel worse.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.090
You can only actually
compare yourself to yourself.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.450
So whenever I start to doubt
things, which is quite often,

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.110
I will think, well,
compared to a week ago,

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.520
I've now achieved this.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.330
Compared to a month
ago, I'm on par.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.170
And that's a much more
acceptable and more

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.810
self-compassionate way, I
guess, of looking at it.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.290
So the problem is though, when
you don't feel good enough,

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.280
you're searching for something
to make yourself feel better.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.720
And often, it-- in orthorexia,
it's very much about, well,

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.250
if I eat better,
I'll feel better.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.650
We've all heard it, haven't we?

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.750
And we see all the books.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.680
Eat this and you'll
glow, or do this,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.590
and you'll have loads of energy.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.280
We all see it.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.630
And of course, we buy into that.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.480
Because we're looking
for an answer.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.820
The thing is, the
answer is within us.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.090
Because until you
accept yourself and be

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.307
comfortable with who you
are, it's really difficult

00:21:23.307 --> 00:21:24.390
to move forward from this.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.460
And this is why if you do notice
these traits or these symptoms

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.700
or these emotions in people
you care about or even

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.330
in yourselves, please try
and get some help early on.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.467
Because actually, the longer
you stay in this cycle,

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.300
the more entrenched
these food rules become,

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.924
and the more impact
they start to have,

00:21:43.924 --> 00:21:45.979
and the harder it gets
to step out of it.

00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:46.770
The harder it gets.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.750
Because the anxiety
of stepping out of

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.740
it is just too
difficult to bear.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.160
So the way I tend to describe
it is that you're almost

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.920
sitting on a box of emotions.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.902
It's like you're
sitting on it so

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:03.360
that you don't let any of those
negative emotions come out.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.735
You don't want to
deal with them.

00:22:04.735 --> 00:22:06.960
It's like, absolutely.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.750
When you go through
recovery, you

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.610
do have to jump off
that box, and you

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.470
have to let the
emotions out, which

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.140
does mean you tend to start
to feel very uncomfortable.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.560
Now, I suffer with
anxiety massively.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.320
The anxiety I felt as I
came off the tube and walked

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.950
to the Google offices,
I cannot tell you.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.540
I do really struggle
with anxiety,

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.980
but I've learned to manage it.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.460
Because I know
that it will pass.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.020
Because it does pass.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.730
But it's really hard
if you're somebody

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.910
who never allows yourself
to feel it because you're

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.782
constantly worried about what--

00:22:40.782 --> 00:22:41.740
it's going to be awful.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.989
It's going to be catastrophic.

00:22:42.989 --> 00:22:44.850
Because that's what
the anxious mind does.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.730
It catastrophizes everything.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.980
And so you don't
want to do that.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.650
But actually, the only
way to move forward

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.160
is to be comfortable
with the uncomfortable.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.670
Similarly, when you
challenge negative behavior

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.510
with behavior, that's
when you change.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.190
But it's all very--
it is difficult.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.630
It's a long, long process.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:15.910
So obviously, when it
comes to orthorexia,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.770
when I'm working with
people, is trying

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.970
to help people understand that
healthy eating is not just

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.350
about what you put
into your body.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.310
It's not just about what's
on your plate at one time.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.520
It's actually about
the collection,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.080
probably over two
to three weeks.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.390
So you have a few bad
days, it's all right.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.640
It's not the end of the world.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.810
It doesn't mean you've failed.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.309
It doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

00:23:39.309 --> 00:23:41.650
It's just it's a bit busy.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.330
It's Christmas,
or it's birthdays,

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.830
or actually, you've
gone on holiday.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.640
That's OK.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.380
It's fine to relax.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.050
Because the norm is
that you normally

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.810
probably eat really well most
of the other times, and then it

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.220
all balances out.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.790
So I try and actually
really educate

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.712
a healthy attitude to eating.

00:23:59.712 --> 00:24:01.420
Rather than healthy
eating, it's actually

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.340
a healthy attitude to eating.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.410
And I just think,
again, when we're

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:10.300
teaching in schools and even
in universities, where this

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.570
is a really big problem, that's
what we should be teaching

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.560
and educating people.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.130
It's not always about
the wheel, and this

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:19.240
is what healthy eating is.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.620
It's actually
about the attitude,

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.550
because that's what is going
to help people move forward.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:30.670
So my final slide really
is the biggest thing

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.020
is trying to be comfortable
with who you are.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.410
And it really is
about self-acceptance.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.620
And for some people,
that takes time,

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.270
and it actually
takes a lot of input.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.400
So the majority of
the people I work

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.280
with, I work alongside a
psychologist or a counselor,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.250
because the two things
need to go hand in hand.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.360
Some people can
do it themselves.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.090
Some people can make it--

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.050
can turn it around.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.810
But the majority, I'd say,
probably 90% of the cases

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:00.490
I work with, it definitely
needs both nutritional

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:01.870
and a psychological element.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:07.170
And sometimes more
psychological than nutritional.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.682
Any questions?

00:25:09.682 --> 00:25:10.890
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.561
That was really interesting.

00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:14.060
I'm going to kick
off, if that's OK.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:14.893
RENEE MCGREGOR: Mhm.

00:25:14.893 --> 00:25:15.510
Of course.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:19.170
SPEAKER: So you touched earlier
about the younger generation.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.420
Now, as adults, I
feel that we can

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.091
make a bit of a better
informed choice and research

00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:25.090
in the media and things.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:31.890
But with children secondary
school age, for example,

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.110
how do you think the best
way is to talk to them

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.390
about their diet
and to make sure

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.270
that they can make
those educated choices,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.199
and they're not being
influenced by the media.

00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:42.240
RENEE MCGREGOR: I think
one of the biggest things

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.030
is teaching them through food.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.090
So one of the problems
we have is that when

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.310
you look at secondary
school menus and things,

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.660
and they're not very good.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.140
Or they're not foods that
they're familiar with,

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.950
and that can be a real problem.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:02.550
Because I've done workshops
with young athletes,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.680
and we've done
practical workshops

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.260
where I've brought things
like mackerel and avocado

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:07.849
and things.

00:26:07.849 --> 00:26:10.390
And some of them are like, well,
I've never seen that before.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.220
Well, what is it?

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.080
Like literally had no idea.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.640
And you make them
into things that

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.172
are palatable and easy to use.

00:26:17.172 --> 00:26:18.630
So I would never
get somebody who's

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.130
never had mackerel
to eat mackerel,

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.570
because I think that's
just quite harsh.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.290
But what we did was
we blended it up,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.140
and we made into
a mackerel pate.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.380
And interestingly, of all the
children that had never had it,

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.880
probably only two were like,
no, I definitely don't like it.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.380
But the rest of them
were really like, ooh.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.755
And they went
home, and they were

00:26:35.755 --> 00:26:37.050
like, I want have this again.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.650
So I think food needs to be
quite a big part of education

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:41.220
in schools.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.089
Because I think
there's a lot of--

00:26:44.089 --> 00:26:46.380
sometimes it's like something
that you just have to do.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.671
You just have to give the kids.

00:26:47.671 --> 00:26:50.580
But actually, if we feed our
kids properly in schools,

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.080
they'll also concentrate better.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.430
We'll get better productivity.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.510
Because again, we know that
if they don't eat at lunchtime

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.350
because they don't
like what they see,

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.460
then they'll either
eat loads of sugar,

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.940
which is going to make
them peak and trough,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.900
or they'll just skip it.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.300
And the problem then is
these are the things that

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.250
then start to create this
kind of negative relationship

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:11.790
with food.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.880
Because if you do have
somebody who's very vulnerable,

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.340
and they start skipping
lunch if they don't like it,

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.050
that becomes a behavior.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.060
And that becomes an
acceptable behavior to them.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.120
The problem you then
have is that can then

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.900
go into the other
aspects of their life.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.869
And before you know it,
you do have somebody

00:27:28.869 --> 00:27:30.160
doesn't really know about food.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.520
So I think education's
really important.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.040
But not just what you
teach in the classroom,

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.460
actually getting in
there and getting

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.830
the kids to work with
food, taste food,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.390
try different things.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.700
But equally, I think,
as I said, there

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:50.040
needs to be a lot more on
your sense of self, especially

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:50.860
as a teenager.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.077
I mean, it's probably
one of the worst times

00:27:53.077 --> 00:27:54.660
ever when you're a
teenager, isn't it?

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.850
Because everything is changing.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.170
You don't feel great.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.610
You don't look great.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.340
And we all know that
you will get through it,

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.520
and you do eventually look fine.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.060
But at that point, it's
really, really hard.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.810
And you're so self-critical.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.580
And that's something I would
love to do more of in schools

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.312
is really look at how we promote
a positive sense of self.

00:28:18.312 --> 00:28:20.520
Because I don't feel there's
enough of that going on,

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.033
if I'm honest.

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:22.532
SPEAKER: OK.

00:28:22.532 --> 00:28:23.440
Thank you.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.350
Any other questions?

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.080
AUDIENCE: What is your
opinion on every diet that

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.620
is based on calories?

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.160
Meaning, I've been there.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.030
Like a year ago, I
spent three months

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.180
on having a certain amount of
calories I could eat every day.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.700
I was weighing everything
that I was cooking,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.930
and I could only cook.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.880
I could not go out.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.540
I could not--

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.910
It was like, feedback and
taking a step back on it.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.960
It sounds awful.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.530
But I've been there.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.010
And I'm wondering, what
is, as a dietitian,

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.490
your perspective on this?

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.640
There's so many ways
this can go wrong.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.390
RENEE MCGREGOR: Yeah.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:01.430
So I actually very rarely
talk about calories

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:02.840
when I work with my clients.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.330
Because you're right.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:05.480
It becomes obsessive.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.424
Again, if you're working with
somebody who is obsessive,

00:29:08.424 --> 00:29:10.340
as soon as you give them
a number or something

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.340
to fixate on, it's what happens.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:18.470
And at the end of the day,
the body is really quite--

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.570
it's quite an amazing--

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.320
it's very good at regulating.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.790
If you let it, it will
work for you really well.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.310
And that's another big
message I would say to people

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.290
is that if you just
listen to your body,

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.860
it actually does tell you what
you need when you need it.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.860
It's just that we've lost
the art of doing that,

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.170
because there's so
much information.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.440
For example, the sugar stuff.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.640
Everybody's trying not to
eat sugar because we've

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.510
heard how bad it is for us.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.050
But actually, there are times
when the body and the brain

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.060
can only work on sugar.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.280
And so if you deprive
yourself, if you

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.040
start to restrict yourself,
the body will work against you.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.880
So what I often find is when
people severely restrict

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.970
their calorie intake, less
than what they need-- now,

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.727
everybody in this room will have
a very different requirement.

00:30:04.727 --> 00:30:06.185
But when they
restrict the calories

00:30:06.185 --> 00:30:09.050
to less than what they need,
the problem we then have

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:12.530
is that when food
becomes available,

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.537
the body will try
and eat to excess.

00:30:14.537 --> 00:30:16.370
Because it will say,
well, hang on a minute.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.370
I don't know when you're
going to feed me again,

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.710
so I'm going to take on
as many calories as I can.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.930
That then sets up this really
negative cycle of oh my god,

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.210
I've just eaten so much.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:27.380
I'm going to restrict again.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.060
And actually, what you need
to do in these situations

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.700
is regulate your eating.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.150
So I tend to educate people
on getting the correct balance

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:38.610
of carbohydrates, proteins,
whole grains, fruits,

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.110
vegetables at meal
times and snacks.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.450
I'm not anti-snacks.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.710
I always have to eat every three
hours, otherwise I fall apart.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.950
So I'm not anti any
of those things.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.230
But it's right for
you as an individual.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.550
Because if you are somebody
that say, does exercise an hour

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.050
a day, your
requirements are going

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.390
to be much higher than
somebody that just sits

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.860
at their desk all day long.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:05.390
And I think this is where
we do get some problems.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.400
Because as dietitians,
we talk very

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.770
much about moderation and
balance, and of course,

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.790
that's really boring.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:11.910
It's not sexy.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:12.950
It's not exciting.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:14.600
It's just a dull word.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.650
And it is.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.542
But balance is about
what's right for you.

00:31:20.542 --> 00:31:22.250
Now, I have to be
careful, because I then

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.630
get people saying,
yes, but I don't

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.430
need to eat sugar then
ever, because that's

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.526
what balance is for me.

00:31:26.526 --> 00:31:27.650
But that's not what I mean.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.660
Balance is-- when I
say that, it's actually

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.220
about giving your
body what it needs,

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.510
but also allowing yourself
to have the things you want.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.280
Because when you suddenly
go, I do want that,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.440
but I can't have it, you set up
a whole new mindset going on,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.360
almost like a deprivation cycle.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.160
So it can go one
or the other way.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.290
You can either-- you end
up-- people who would just

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.540
want that food, and that's
all they could think about,

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.360
and they're going to
just eat loads of it.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:01.010
Or the opposite side to that
is where it causes anxiety.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.320
So I think in your
case, from what I hear,

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.210
is that it became quite an--

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.310
and if you stepped
even one calorie

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:12.290
over what you were meant to
have, it became a problem.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.980
It caused you
anxiety, shall we say.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.230
Not made a problem.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:19.010
Now, this is why, also,
I don't like trackers.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.404
I don't like the
online food trackers.

00:32:21.404 --> 00:32:22.820
Because one, it's
really difficult

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.670
to get the right thing of what
you're eating and make it work.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:31.610
The other thing is how does
that tracker know that actually,

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.640
today, it might
be that depending

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.400
on what's going on for you
hormonally, depending on what's

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.390
going on for you mentally, that
day, you do need a bit more.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.220
The tracker can't tell you
that, but your body can.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.850
So when I re-educate
people, it really

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.690
is about helping them
to see that eating

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.420
should be fun and enjoyable.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.370
And actually, the
balance is very

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.650
much-- my principle is
very much 80% the time,

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.110
I try and eat as well as I can.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.780
Which does mean that if I then
want to have a glass of wine

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.780
or a pudding or a
chocolate, then I can, and I

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.610
don't worry about it at all.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.016
And that I would
use for anybody,

00:33:09.016 --> 00:33:10.640
whether they're doing
loads of exercise

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.598
or whether they're not.

00:33:11.598 --> 00:33:15.089
Because you can-- it's
proportional to what you do.

00:33:15.089 --> 00:33:16.380
Does that answer your question?

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.316
AUDIENCE: It does.

00:33:22.127 --> 00:33:23.710
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about what

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:24.899
you talked about earlier.

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:26.440
You made a reference
to sugar and how

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.064
your body doesn't
actually know if it's

00:33:28.064 --> 00:33:29.910
coconut sugar, white sugar.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.630
But is there something
in the science--

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.286
and I'm asking you
as a nutritionist--

00:33:33.286 --> 00:33:34.660
is there something
in the science

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.451
of how your body actually
metabolizes that?

00:33:36.451 --> 00:33:38.530
Because you do see that
some sugars are processed

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:42.190
by your body differently, such
as raising your glycemic index,

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:43.582
for example.

00:33:43.582 --> 00:33:44.790
Could you speak more to that?

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:45.790
RENEE MCGREGOR: So yeah.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.010
I mean, obviously, some do
have a slightly different

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:48.910
glycemic index.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.130
But if you look
at all the sugars

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:55.210
that we've been exposed to,
the difference is minute.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.120
Because at the end of the day,
they are all simple sugars.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.740
So they all affect your
blood sugars in the same way.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.250
So yes.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.650
Things like honey,
for example, might

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.760
have a slightly less glycemic
load than table sugar,

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.730
but we're not talking enough to
make the difference that we're

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.400
being told.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.460
I think that's the thing that is
really important to understand

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.199
is that the messages we're
getting about being sugar free

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.880
and only eating
honey and only eating

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.179
maple syrup et
cetera, et cetera,

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.790
they're not significant
enough for it to be

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.020
that-- to make that change.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.350
AUDIENCE: I have one
more question, sorry.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.320
Going back into your 80/20
rule that you just spoke about,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.810
is there danger in people
creating morality around food

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.860
then, being like, oh,
this is part of that 20.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.242
Or oh, this is part of that 80.

00:34:45.242 --> 00:34:47.219
I can eat freely for it.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.650
Do you see that that could also
be an obsession or something,

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.283
like a trigger in itself?

00:34:52.283 --> 00:34:54.199
RENEE MCGREGOR: That's
a really good question.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:57.640
I've never seen that, because I
don't ever really spell it out.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.590
It's kind of how I tend--

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.110
I don't sit there
going, oh well, I've

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.100
eaten really well for
80% of the day today,

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.766
so now I can have my
piece of chocolate.

00:35:05.766 --> 00:35:06.850
I don't do it like that.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.050
I kind of look at it overall.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:13.120
So I tend to sort of know that
actually, I do that naturally.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.570
I don't have to think about it.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.410
It's just what I do.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.580
And so when I work with
people, I very rarely

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.160
use percentages or
numbers, because I

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.974
know that then that
becomes obsessive,

00:35:22.974 --> 00:35:24.640
and we're trying to
move away from that.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.880
It really is about--

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.006
it's actually more about
that attitude to food

00:35:29.006 --> 00:35:31.505
that I try and really work on,
that kind of behavior change.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.046
Mhm.

00:35:35.046 --> 00:35:37.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:40.190
I think just take to go back to
your question about calories,

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.430
what I find really interesting
about calorie restriction is

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.440
that my flatmate does it, and--

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.630
I know, it's a whole thing.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:52.007
But she will have her certain
amount of calories for the day,

00:35:52.007 --> 00:35:54.227
but she'll eat
whatever she wants

00:35:54.227 --> 00:35:55.310
to make up those calories.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.310
So I might eat way, way,
way more calories than she--

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:59.190
not way, way more.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:03.915
But more calories, but it'll
be through lean protein

00:36:03.915 --> 00:36:06.290
and whole grains or whatever,
whereas somebody else might

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.530
need way less calories,
but it could all be crisps.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.500
So I what I find
really interesting

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.286
is the idea that when
you restrict yourself,

00:36:14.286 --> 00:36:16.160
we talk a lot about the
stuff that you're not

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:16.910
getting the nutrients.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:17.701
You're not getting.

00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:20.540
But does it also
work the other way,

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.640
that you might be getting
too much of something?

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.069
Like people who aren't eating
any sugar, dairy, or grain.

00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:27.860
They're obviously not
getting those things,

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.630
but are they getting too
much protein and too much

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.820
other nutrients because
they're trying to make up

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.725
for what they're not eating?

00:36:36.725 --> 00:36:37.850
Too much of the good stuff.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:38.725
Is that possible too?

00:36:38.725 --> 00:36:40.099
RENEE MCGREGOR:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:40.099 --> 00:36:42.050
I think the whole
thing about balance

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:45.980
is that if you increase your
intake of any other food group,

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.727
you displace something else.

00:36:47.727 --> 00:36:49.310
So one of the things
I really struggle

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:50.768
with when I'm
working with athletes

00:36:50.768 --> 00:36:52.850
is because they're
trying to be healthy,

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:54.950
and they're eating
loads of vegetables,

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.750
they don't get
enough carbohydrate.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.030
They don't get enough
energy in to be

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.370
able to perform because
they're trying to be good.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.350
And so that's what I mean.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.517
It's trying to get that balance
for everybody as an individual.

00:37:07.517 --> 00:37:08.600
So yes you're quite right.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.780
Because the thing is,
again, everybody's body

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.884
will always be trying
to reach energy balance.

00:37:14.884 --> 00:37:17.300
So no matter where you're at,
whether you're at the weight

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.470
you want to be, or
whether you're not

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.120
the weight you want
to be, your body

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.910
will always be working
towards getting energy balance

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:25.250
to basically maintain
where you are at.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.550
So that's why often,
when you do decide

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.890
to go to a very
restrictive diet,

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.530
you can probably do it for two
or three days, unless you're

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.864
very extreme and obsessive,
and then you suddenly go,

00:37:35.864 --> 00:37:38.280
yeah, I can't do this anymore,
because I'm just exhausted,

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.640
and I'm hungry, and I'm
going to eat that burger

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.690
or whatever it is.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.580
And you almost go to
the opposite extreme.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.920
Because the body's always
working against that.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.840
It's trying to keep you alive.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.540
Remember that.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.660
That's what the body's
innate thing is,

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.140
it's trying to keep you alive.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.590
So when people do
restrict calories,

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.060
it will slow down
other processes.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.890
So the thing I see a lot
is it's those silent things

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.180
you don't see.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.810
So for example, when somebody
is on a very restrictive diet,

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.310
and they restrict
their calories,

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.800
the body slows down
the digestive system.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:15.320
So that can have a real
impact on how your body works

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.060
in that respect.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.330
In females, it will
reduce estrogen.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.972
So menstruation will stop,
because the body's going,

00:38:22.972 --> 00:38:23.930
well, hang on a minute.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:28.382
I can't-- there's no way I can
fall pregnant and reproduce

00:38:28.382 --> 00:38:30.590
now, because there's not
enough energy in the system.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.390
So it doesn't necessarily
affect your weight,

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.590
and that's what's
really interesting.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.715
It's because the body will
actually slow everything

00:38:35.715 --> 00:38:37.830
else down to keep you alive.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.800
So it will-- you'll find
you can't concentrate.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.730
You get cold.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.990
You can't really think straight.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.400
It's all those different things.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.760
You can't sleep.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.400
That's a big one.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.650
And that's something that
people don't always realize.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.660
That actually, when you
restrict your intake,

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.810
the body's doing everything
it can to work against it.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:00.080
So quickly, one thing to
pick up on though that's

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.870
really interesting
is that you're right.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:08.240
Some people don't change in
weight, and they stay the same,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.430
and they might not
eat the best way.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.230
They might literally
make up their calories

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:16.360
through McDonald's
burgers or whatever.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.410
Their choice.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.160
But that's not good
either, and that's not

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.870
what I'm promoting either.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.450
It really is about if
you eat the right things,

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.150
if you base your meals
around whole grains

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.120
and complex carbs and lean
proteins, you will feel full.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.000
You will feel better.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.540
But that also
means there is then

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.474
room for those little
indulgences if you want them.

00:39:35.474 --> 00:39:37.640
I think that's the message
I'm trying to get across.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.850
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:44.850
Earlier, you were talking
about alternative milks.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.820
What about something
like goat's milk?

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.120
Is that as good as
cow's milk, or is that--

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:50.995
RENEE MCGREGOR: Yeah.

00:39:50.995 --> 00:39:53.360
I mean, goat's milk is
fairly similar in composition

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.150
to cow's milk.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:58.180
So if I'm honest, when I work
with somebody that really,

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.350
realistically, can't
have milk, just

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:02.810
has a lactose intolerance,
or a dairy intolerance,

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.960
or dairy allergy, then you
have to find them something,

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.922
because you need to
get the calcium in.

00:40:07.922 --> 00:40:09.380
Some people, goat's
milk will work.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.990
It comes down to the protein
or the sugar in the milk,

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.850
depending on what
the problem is.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.460
So for some people,
goat's milk is fine.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.919
Sheep's milk is good.

00:40:17.919 --> 00:40:19.460
For other people,
even those, there's

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.560
so much crossover
with the proteins,

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.340
that if it's that particular
protein that they can't digest,

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.080
then you have to find
another alternative.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.740
So in some cases, it's soy.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.800
But we also know there's 40%--

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.460
for people with severe
dairy allergies,

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.220
there's 40% crossover.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.954
So a lot of people that can't
have dairy can't have soy.

00:40:40.954 --> 00:40:42.620
And that's where it
becomes problematic,

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.990
because then you do end
up looking for something

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.920
like almond or oat.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.790
And like I said, I don't have a
problem with people doing that.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:55.597
But what annoys me is the
marketing that it's on par.

00:40:55.597 --> 00:40:56.930
Because nutritionally, it's not.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.790
So you just have to make sure
that you get your nutrition

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:59.623
from somewhere else.

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:00.572
That's all.

00:41:06.765 --> 00:41:07.306
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:07.306 --> 00:41:10.720
I have a lot of friends who
swear by intermittent fasting,

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.520
just eating two meals a day
and then starving for 15 hours.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.395
And that's something
that I don't believe in,

00:41:15.395 --> 00:41:17.594
and I don't feel
in the right place

00:41:17.594 --> 00:41:19.510
to tell them that they're
starving themselves.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:24.495
But do you have any specific
advice for this area?

00:41:24.495 --> 00:41:28.340
I know a lot of the
ideas you say contradict

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.550
that this is good for you.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.820
So just [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.710
RENEE MCGREGOR: Again,
intermittent fasting

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.126
is one of those ones that's
been really-- it's been around

00:41:35.126 --> 00:41:37.240
for a long time, but it
became its heyday probably

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.950
a couple of years ago, with
the 5,2 and that kind of thing.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:44.350
I'm going to say, I do
use intermittent fasting

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.350
in some athletes,
but not in the 5,2.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.470
Because I don't
believe in two days

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.410
a week where you eat only 500
calories, because your body's

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.210
just not in a
happy place at all.

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.420
But what I do sometimes
do for athletes

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:02.080
where I need to hit a particular
body composition or weight,

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.440
and it is giving them
a rule, unfortunately.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.370
But it helps when you do it for
a very short period of time.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.390
But what we would do is actually
the intermittent fasting, where

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:12.550
they eat for eight hours a day.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.970
So say, between 12:00 and 8:00,
and then they'll have 15--

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:18.730
they'll have the
16 hours of fasted.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.980
Because we know
scientifically that's

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.640
quite a useful way of
helping athletes meet weight.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.162
But with anything I do
like that, it's monitored,

00:42:27.162 --> 00:42:29.620
it's supervised, and it's only
done for a very short period

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.620
of time.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.530
So with your
friends, doing the--

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.780
if they're doing
two meals a day,

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.120
and that's all they're
doing, for a start,

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.130
that's not intermittent
fasting, that's just fasting.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.770
Because intermittent
fasting would mean

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:42.925
they do it intermittently.

00:42:42.925 --> 00:42:44.800
So they'd have some days
where they eat well,

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.990
and other days where they
eat very restrictive.

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.170
I think what's interesting
is that when you look now

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:52.900
at the data that's
coming through,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.380
the people that were very
big advocates of the 5,2

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.760
are struggling to maintain it.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.960
It's not sustainable.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.480
Because you then have
two, maybe three days

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.810
a week where you
can't actually focus.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.200
You can't actually concentrate.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.900
You can't be productive.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.270
Because your body won't
be on 500 calories a day.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.750
So it's hard when
you've got friends,

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:17.161
and you're watching them, and
you want to say something.

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.910
And I think the only
way you can sometimes

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:22.960
do things is give them
some sort of tangible data,

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.140
like did you notice that
you made a mistake there?

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.620
Or did you notice that
you haven't got your--

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:27.590
you're really tired.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.090
Or you're actually
really irritable,

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.950
and it's not much
fun to be around.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.820
I mean, you have to be careful
how you say that, obviously.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.320
But it's that kind of thing.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.220
I mean, there are often
opening conversations I

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.690
have with a lot of my clients.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.510
I don't go straight
in there and go,

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.120
you've got a problem with food.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.540
It's very much about asking
those open questions,

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.920
like what's going on with you?

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.600
Why are you following that?

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.830
Where does that come from?

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:54.190
Because it's really
important to hear why.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.560
Because that's
something that they

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.400
feel very passionate about, and
you don't want to belittle it.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.740
You want to encourage them
to open and talk to you.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:07.210
So as a practitioner,
building trust with my clients

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:09.080
is the first step.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.560
And then after
that, you can start

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.644
to then really tackle some of
the what's going on for you.

00:44:15.644 --> 00:44:17.060
Because you're
probably find that,

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.530
again, there's a reason why
your friends are doing that.

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.750
That they are trying to
maintain a certain weight

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.960
or be a certain way
or look a certain way.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.460
Where does that stem from?

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.152
What's that about?

00:44:29.152 --> 00:44:30.610
That's kind of how
I'd go about it.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:33.472
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:33.472 --> 00:44:35.180
SPEAKER: Any more
questions from anybody?

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.140
No?

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.950
Thank you so much for coming in.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.090
We really appreciate it.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.980
Renee's going to be staying
and signing copies of her book

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.832
as well and also joining
us up in the cafe.

00:44:45.832 --> 00:44:48.290
So if you'd like to purchase
a book, please do let us know,

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.414
and she'll sign it for you.

00:44:49.414 --> 00:44:51.310
Thank you very much for coming.
