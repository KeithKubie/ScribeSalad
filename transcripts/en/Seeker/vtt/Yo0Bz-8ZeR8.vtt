00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.899
There’s no need to panic, but a heads up
-- there might be a big bully on the loose,

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.950
and it’s tormenting our entire solar system.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.950
Hi there!

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.119
Ian here for DNews and I’m here to talk
about a solar mystery that astronomers have

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.509
failed to explain… until NOW.

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.779
For a long time astronomers have known that
our sun is tilted.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.390
It’s not by much, but the tilt is there
-- its spin axis appears to be over 6 degrees

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.390
off-vertical.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.070
So what the heck could have caused THAT?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.419
Well, nobody really knows for sure, hence
the “mystery.”

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.599
But there’s some evidence that it has nothing
to do with the sun at all.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.289
Instead there might be an object out there
roughly ten times the mass of Earth bullying

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.980
our entire solar system.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.129
Back in January, renowned dwarf planet hunters
from Caltech caused a huge stir when they

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.219
announced that they had discovered a group
of small objects in the outer solar system

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.219
acting rather strange.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.430
They all seemed to be traveling in the same
direction.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.190
It’s extremely unlikely they are doing this
by chance.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.840
Instead, it must be a massive planet located
20 times farther away from the sun than Neptune,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.500
gravitationally tugging at them.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.760
Of course.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.160
Astronomers call this massive mystery world
Planet 9.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
And in new research accepted for publication
in the Astrophysical Journal, they’ve made

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.150
a link between the our apparently tilted Sun
and the mystery of Planet 9.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.360
To understand what’s going on, we have to
go back in time to when the solar system was

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.660
just being formed.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.940
There was an infant Sun, and it was surrounded
by a disk of gas and dust called a protoplanetary

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.940
disk.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.440
It was like a vinyl record, pretty much flat,
and inside of it our solar system’s planets

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.440
formed.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.920
They ended up in fairly flat racetrack-like
orbits.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.150
But if one of those planets underwent some
kind of disturbance, like a collision with

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.880
another planet, that planet’s orbit could
have been dramatically tilted away from the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.810
orbital plane that the other planets occupy.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.420
Then, over the course of the evolution of
our solar system, this massive world would

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.970
have added a wobble over billions of years
to the entire system, causing all of the other

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.340
planets’ orbits to tilt as they compensated
for this imbalance.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.930
As Planet 9 is thought to be a pretty big
object, and we already think it can influence

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.020
the orbits of smaller objects in the outer
solar system, this unaccounted-for mystery

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.600
world COULD be causing the wonkiness of the
entire solar system!

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.610
It just so happens that Planet 9’s predicted
orbit is thought to be tilted a whopping 30

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.800
degrees away from the orbital plane which,
according to computer simulations, would exactly

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.860
account for the observed tilt in the rest
of the solar system.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.860
So guess what?

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.909
It’s not that our Sun is tilted, it’s
actually Earth and all the rest of the planets

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.760
that are tilted, making the Sun LOOK like
it’s wonky from our perspective.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.209
So now we have all this indirect evidence
of Planet 9.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.079
Isn’t it about time we zoom in on it and
take a picture already?

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.849
Sadly, according to the researchers, the search
area is so big and Planet 9 is so far away,

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.640
it’s going to take at least 3 years to get
a direct observation of this strange new world.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.780
Want to know more about space exploration?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.700
Our new VR channel, Seeker VR, has a video
about that.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.230
Join Jason Silva as he discusses why humanity
needs to explore space to push our species

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.230
forward.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.980
Just use the YouTube app or your VR device,
put on your headphones and get ready to stargaze!

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.349
Want to know more about Planet 9?

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:56.519
Well guess what, Trace and Amy covered that
right here.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:07.170
Do you think Planet 9 is the last big planet
in the solar system to be discovered or do

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.170
you think there’s more out there?
