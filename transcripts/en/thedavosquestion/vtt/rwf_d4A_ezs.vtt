Ian: Well asking what -- what's the one thing
you can do is a bit of a dumb question, it's

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.820
always a bit like asking do you want a heart
or do you want a lung, the answer is both.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.620
But if I had to focus on one thing, I think
the world community has to concentrate on

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.420
not overreacting to issues.
So for instance, not reacting to the stock

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.320
exchange fall by overprotection.
To recognize what has helped the world community

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.080
and to continue with it, so it continues with
the critical long term issues.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.900
So a real focus on the long term rather than
overreacting to the short term.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.510
And the long term issues remain.
They remain poverty, they remain climate change

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.390
and they remain getting the best out of globalization.
That's what I would say, keep focusing on

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.670
the long term and don't react too much to
the short.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.930
Thank You
