00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my surprising answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It is 68 friends.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Who would have thought?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The way to get there is with 0.8 chance you'll pick a type A who has 80 friends

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and with 0.2 chance you'll pick a type B who has 20 friends.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If you work this out this is 64 + 4, makes 68.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Your friend in expectation wold have 68 friends where you would only have 50 in expectation.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, sorry, I think you are unpopular in expectation.
