00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.760
Make that look smooth and post

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.639
hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop in the past when using our backyard forge

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.139
We've been using these stainless steel tongs to pull things out and they are stainless steel

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.939
Which means that they don't melt in the furnace?

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.279
But they do get red-hot and very soft to the point that trying to pick up the crucible just makes them Bend

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.129
And I'm pretty sure these things were originally designed to be used on

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.689
Salad so you can see we haven't been using these for quite what they were designed for so today

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.610
We're gonna see if we can build ourselves some more industrial tongs that can really take the heat of our Forge

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.559
We've got some mild steel bars that we picked up at Home Depot along with some steel hardware

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.799
And we're gonna try and form two pairs of tongs one pair

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.960
That's designed to reach down inside the top of the forge and lift our crucible out and a second pair

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.180
That's designed to grab our crucible from the side, so we can easily pour it out to be building these tongs

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.359
We'll use a drill a hacksaw. We'll probably end up using the bench vise and a pair of channellocks as well first

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.249
let's just sort of get a measurement idea for how long we want these tongs to be I'm not trying to make tongs that I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.939
Can operate up here just something about that long?

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.180
For the most part these will work, just like a pair of scissors

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.779
We'll have a hinge point in the middle and then somewhere around here

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.869
We'll try and get them to twist 90 degrees so that we have the flat face pointing at the crucible

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.189
We'll then take another piece of steel and bolt that on to the end

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.150
In sort of a claw shape so we can really grab onto the crucible

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.239
We just take some more of the steel bar beyond where my hand is and double that over. That'll give a nice handle

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.420
That's easy to hold on to I will still be using the furnace gloves while I'm using these tongs, so I do want something

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.839
That's easy to operate and doesn't require a ton of manual dexterity because they're pretty thick this is all very much an eye balled

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.659
sort of experiment if you want longer tongs you just use maybe the whole bar if you want shorter tongs then you're gonna burn your

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.659
Hands, but just use less

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.130
You go for right about there

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.550
Let's see how long it takes me to cut through this 1/8 inch thickness

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.279
3/4 inch wide mild steel bar using a standard hacksaw I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.509
Wasn't too bad I actually got through that in like 30 seconds pretty good try the next one

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.080
We've now got the two shorter bars that will be the main body of the first set of tongs and we have the two pieces

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.649
That we cut off of those and we're going to be using these for something as well

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.310
We can cut two shorter pieces out of one side of this bar and those will become the two curved claws that will actually hold

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.150
on to our crucible

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.560
It looks like to get a good curved claw shape we aren't gonna have to cut this whole bar right in half

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.489
That would be a little bit too big, but just something I don't know 5 or 6 inches long should be pretty good

00:02:59.489 --> 00:02:59.790
claw

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.310
I think

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.369
We actually want to make sure that our claws don't wrap all the way around our crucible because then the two halves would just hit

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.360
each other
And they wouldn't actually grab the crucible at all so we want them shorter than that so it just grabs onto the sides again

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.360
I'm just kind of eyeballing it here

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.869
Now let's cut these two pieces off of our short bar

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.590
Got a magnet attached to our bench vise here, and it's really picking up quite a bit of steel filings from this I

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.349
Think we want to put our scissor hinge

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.610
Pretty much in the middle here

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.989
There are advantages to having it higher or lower if it's lower down

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.069
Nearer to the crucible then it's easier to hold pressure on it that lets us lift the crucible up out of the Forge but

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.390
If it's higher up

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.140
then we have more space to fit around a crucible and maybe even a

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.269
Larger crucible than this one, so I think just putting it right in the middle will be a good middle ground

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.589
It should be fairly easy enough to hold pressure to lift our crucible up and out

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.629
But we should also have enough space that we can fit around the mouth of even our taller and bigger crucibles

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.079
The hardware we have is one-quarter inch bolts so I have a 1/4 inch drill bit

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.449
But I don't have a punch to get my hole started

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.939
So I'm gonna be switching out using a smaller drill bit just to put a little bit of a divot into the steel and then

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.940
I'll switch back to my 1/4 inch bit

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
That should work I

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.309
Don't have any sort of special drill bit

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.639
This is a normal drill bit that I'm gonna be using to get through this mild steel

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.519
And if you use it correctly it should work pretty well

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.030
There's a couple of things that you want to remember when you're drilling into metal though

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.130
One is you don't want to use a high speed?

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.960
That will create a lot of friction

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.590
Which will heat up the tip of the drill bit and that can make it get soft?

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.669
If you keep a low speed you should be able to get through the metal no problem

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.250
The other thing to remember is that it's always good to use some kind of oil when you're cutting through metal

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.039
I don't have any machine oil around but I do have this cooking oil, which while not perfect should still do the job

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.979
Doesn't need a lot

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.049
Steel hardware fits beautifully through that little hole with just a tiny tiny effects err space almost none

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.280
But it fits through nice and easily

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.280
Just what we want

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.290
Just got a little bit of a burr on the bottom of our steel

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.409
So let's take some sandpaper and just get rid of that you know

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.080
It's a quick test if we fit our bolts through both of those

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.060
We've got ourselves with a hinges pair of tongs or scissors are really they're neither of those yet

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.790
It's just two pieces of metal on a hinge, but

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.600
making good progress

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.989
let's see if we can't bend the ends of our steel 90 degrees so that the flat portion will be facing the crucible I

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.589
Like that that's pretty good alignment, it looks like right there, so now we need to add

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.830
Little claws on to both ends first of course we need to add a little bit of curves into this parts

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.799
Straight right now, which is not going to be good for grabbing a crucible

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.189
You're just putting it in the vise bending it in one spot

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.320
Gonna have to move on to using tools after this because my hands are not going to be stronger

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.340
I

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.079
Think that will work great now we need to attach one of the curve pieces to each of these

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.400
handles and

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.940
Of course that means more drilling holes

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.189
As a final step before we assemble everything using our hardware

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.700
Let's take our extra bits of Steel and fold those over to create our handles

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.120
Alright, that's looking like it should work. Let's start assembling with hardware

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.550
It's pretty good not too shaky these pieces are going to be assembled largely the same way

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:45.099
But they don't need to have any play to them these aren't supposed to move so we're just going to tighten them down a lot

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.199
It seems to be working

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:58.469
But I think we could make it a little bit easier to use if the claw pieces were a little bit more in line with

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:04.019
The shape of the crucible in this case that actually means bending the bars a little bit more inward

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:06.130
That way they should be

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.289
Lined up with the direction the crucible sits there we go that is

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.229
Perfect look at that. It just goes nicely down

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.979
Our little claws are perpendicular to the walls of the crucible

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.179
Easy to grab these things are working pretty well so far of course

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.940
It's going to be a little bit more of a long-term test than that when we start using them in the furnace

00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:28.690
We'll see if the hardware holds up nicely

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:33.330
Or if the change from getting hot to cooling down over and over ends up weakening them somehow

00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:37.289
It's possible that we'll have to come back later and weld some of these pieces in place

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.919
We have tongs that are really good for picking up our crucible from the top

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.339
But if we want to go and pour it these aren't gonna do too much for us

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.560
so what we need to do now is build a second set of tongs that has these claws facing the other direction so that we

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.560
Can come in at it from the side all

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:58.079
Of our pieces are cut our holes are drilled. Let's just bend some handles into this and then do our final assembly wait

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.680
That's not right

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.680
There we go

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:14.579
Now these ones will attach mostly the same way, but instead of attaching them with the claws perpendicular to the posts

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.680
We're going to go parallel

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:24.509
Let's give that a test so with our sideways Tong we should be able to just come in grab it

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:32.099
Tip you can even hold it upside down and pour out all of the dust that's down in there that works pretty great

00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:44.249
Ha yeah, and now I can be farther away from the metal as it's pouring and

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.329
Our tongs aren't going to get destroyed like our salad tongs kept doing

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:54.059
