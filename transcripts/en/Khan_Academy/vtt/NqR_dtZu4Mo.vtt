00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.930
There are many things that
differentiate human beings

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.990
from other species.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.830
But the one thing that probably
differentiates humans even

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.710
from our closest relatives in
the animal kingdom in a really

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.810
big way is the notion that
humans are collective learners.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.280
And to understand
that, let's think

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.000
about how even our closest
relative in the animal

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.750
kingdom, the chimpanzee,
might communicate.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.390
So you might have
one chimpanzee,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.830
and over the course of
his or her lifetime,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.159
they're able to learn a
bunch of cool experiences.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.444
And they're even able to learn
to use tools, manipulate tools,

00:00:35.444 --> 00:00:37.110
and-- who knows--
maybe even make tools.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.260
Maybe even get a twig some
place and take off the leaves

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.450
and then use that to go get ants
out of a hole or whatever else.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.340
So they're able to learn all
this stuff over a lifetime.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.860
Now unfortunate
for chimpanzees--

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.820
well, what is fortunate
for chimpanzees is they

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.490
do teach some of these
things that they've

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.450
learned to other members
of their group, often

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.560
their offspring.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.670
But what's unfortunate
for chimpanzees is they

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.200
don't have a great way to
communicate with each other.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.269
So for most chimpanzees, the
way that they're able to teach

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.130
is essentially by showing--
not showing and telling, just

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.990
showing.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.600
And so because this is such
a un-precise or not exact

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.750
and such an inefficient
way of communication,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.970
really all of the nuances of
what this chimpanzee might

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.730
be able accumulate over
his or her lifetime

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.010
aren't able to be conveyed
to the next generation

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.130
or to the other
chimpanzees around.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.060
So you have tremendous
energy loss.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.460
And in particular, all
that can be conveyed

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.160
are maybe the to
specific movements

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.480
or what you might be able
to observe in the present.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.710
All of the other things
that maybe the chimpanzee is

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.837
learning about-- the times of
year where this is appropriate,

00:01:47.837 --> 00:01:49.420
and maybe they can
convey some of that

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.630
by showing them at the
right times of year--

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.670
but other nuanced aspects
of it, or particular ways

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.910
to hold something, or twist
something, can only be shown.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.610
It can't be described
in a very precise way.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.690
So you have all of this
loss of experience,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.510
this loss of information.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.190
And then over the course
of these animals' life,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.445
they may be able to learn
the same amount again.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.430
But then when they
need to communicate it,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.440
they have the
exact same problem.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.970
It's hard to
communicate with what

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.410
they have at their disposal,
which is really just showing

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.560
the other chimpanzees
what they've done.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.870
And so once again, you
have a loss of information.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.520
And what you have in this
type of circumstance is,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.360
generation after generation,
even though there is learning

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.680
over the course of an
individual chimpanzee's life,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.580
and even though they can
communicate some of that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.530
to each other, that
form of communication

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.940
loses so much
information and so much

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.330
nuance that you never have
an overall accumulation

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.100
of knowledge and wisdom in
this chimpanzee population.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.240
Now humans, on the
other hand, have

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.390
something called a
symbolic language.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.180
And I'll talk about
this in a second.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.310
But for now, it's safe to say
that human language is far more

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.200
precise and far more
efficient than just being

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.800
able to show someone something.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.330
Imagine if you had to
learn how to do something

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.580
without being able to
communicate verbally,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.245
if you just had to look
at someone else's actions.

00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:21.370
And then you'd have a good
idea of how difficult it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.050
is for chimpanzees
to teach each other.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.560
But in the case of
human beings, we

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.280
have this thing called
symbolic language.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.570
That's a very precise, very
efficient way of communicating.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.390
So from one human
being to another,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.680
you can actually
communicate a good deal.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.480
Maybe not every single nuance
and every single experience,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.560
but a good chunk of it.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.750
So right here, I'm drawing
about that much of it

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.140
to some other human being.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.680
Maybe it is the offspring.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.840
Maybe it is another member
of the tribe or the group

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.110
or whatever it is.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.740
And then this human
being might come up

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.250
with some other innovations.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.590
They're able to build off
of all of this learning

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.850
from that previous generation
or from that other human being

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.650
that's around.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.910
And they're able to come
up with their own nuances

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.180
and their own innovations.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.930
And this one right
over here might come up

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.070
with his or her own the
nuances and innovations.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.240
And because they have a good
communication mechanism,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.990
this one could even communicate
to that one what he's learned

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.730
or what she's learned
and communicate

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.640
a good chunk of that.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.270
Maybe not all of it, but
maybe a reasonable bit.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.690
They can describe exactly
how they do something,

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.030
the times of years,
when it's good to do it,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.530
and when it's not
good to do it, how

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.770
to plan for the future,
what's the history

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.900
of this new learning.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.750
And so what you
have going on here

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.630
is because of this strong
communication mechanism,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:50.620
precise, efficient
communication,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.355
what you have is a human
group, or eventually

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:58.450
a human civilization, is able
to have a collective memory.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.730
In the case of the chimpanzees,
they're every generation.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.220
Every chimpanzee is having
to relearn the things

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.540
that the other chimpanzees
might have already done

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.660
in previous generations.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.920
They're not able to really
move forward or build

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.700
on those in significant ways.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.750
In humans, as information is
learned and experience gained,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.740
a good bit of that is able to
be passed on to other humans.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.630
And so this might be passed on.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.490
So all of this might be passed
on or good chunk of this

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.540
could be passed on to
the next generation.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.706
And I'm not even talking
about written language yet.

00:05:34.706 --> 00:05:38.110
This could still just be oral
communication, which is still

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.870
a very strong, precise,
efficient means

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.860
of communication.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.880
Written communication
takes it to another level.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.100
But then this person
over here, maybe she

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.976
comes up with other innovations.

00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:51.600
And at some point,
you might say, well,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.150
look if everyone keeps
having innovations

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.983
and they keep learning
what everyone learned

00:05:54.983 --> 00:05:56.500
in previous
generations, maybe this

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.080
will tap out the
total amount of memory

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.379
that a human being even has.

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.170
And there's actually
a case that maybe this

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.360
is one of the reasons
why humans even

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.690
have larger memories,
because there

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.148
is all of this
collective knowledge

00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:10.540
to gain from one generation to
another, from one human being

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.134
to another.

00:06:11.134 --> 00:06:12.550
But there are some
limits to this.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.650
And this is the other element
where this collective aspect

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.730
of collective memory
and collective learning

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.650
becomes really powerful.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.690
A human being, because of the
strong communication mechanism,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.580
is not just limited to the
knowledge and the experience

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.820
in their memory.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.610
They are able to tap
into-- So this human

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.270
being right over here does
not have this skill set.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.020
And that skill set
maybe gets passed

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.840
on to another human being.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.000
So let me copy and paste that.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.450
This other human being that's
maybe living at the same time.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.760
And when that becomes
relevant, they

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.010
could actually tap into it.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.210
And maybe they could learn
it from that human being.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.043
Or maybe it's in a
different part of society

00:06:56.043 --> 00:06:58.860
and this human being
can build certain tools

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.610
or build certain things
using this information,

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.435
using that knowledge
right over there.

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:04.810
And then this
human being doesn't

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.630
need to know that information.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.220
They can just leverage the
output of that information

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.290
to then build on top of it.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.880
So what it allows
human beings to do

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.760
is not only convey information,
and build on information,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.300
from generation to
generation, human to human,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.440
it allows all of
the human brains

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.480
collectively at any
given point of time

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.720
to be one collective
memory bank that

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.250
can be used to
develop or innovate

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.300
and for specific
domains and adapt

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.940
to specific parts
of the ecosystem

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.180
or to teach each other.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.000
So all of a sudden,
this is really unique,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.670
as far as we can tell,
in the animal kingdom.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.130
All of a sudden, it's
not all about the brain

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.850
or the memory of one
individual member of a species.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.880
It now becomes about
the brain or the memory

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.460
of the entire civilization
or the entire group

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.450
of the species.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.630
And just an example of
that, as far as I know,

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.000
there's no human being who
knows how to do everything

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.650
that all human beings
know how to do.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.650
I could imagine that
there is a chimpanzee that

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.740
knows how to do everything
that any other chimpanzee knows

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.580
how to do.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.860
There are no humans that can
be a fighter pilot, a doctor,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:17.400
a gymnast, a lawyer, understands
philosophy, and speaks

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.700
20 different languages.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.722
As far as I know, that
human being does not exist.

00:08:21.722 --> 00:08:23.180
And that's OK,
because they can tap

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.270
into the experiences, the
abilities of other human beings

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.740
to build up their civilization.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.630
None of us, as far
as we know, knows

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.460
how to do everything
that we need

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.130
to actually build
our civilization.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.900
But the information is
in our collective memory

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.679
to actually do it.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.380
Now the next thing
you might say is, OK,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.549
I started with this premise
that we have a strong, precise,

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.800
efficient means
of communication,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.030
and that other animals don't.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.860
But don't other animals actually
have some form of language?

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.800
So for example, even monkeys.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.150
Wouldn't they screech
when they are in danger?

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.050
That's a form of communication,
maybe a form of language.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.740
Maybe certain animals--
birds, monkeys-- maybe

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.120
they have a song that they sing
that can convey certain things.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.640
Maybe it's when they
are looking for a mate.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.990
Isn't that a form
of communication?

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.640
And these are.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.710
These are a form
of communication

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.410
and a form of language.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.320
But these don't
really come in play

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.940
in terms of the
teaching/learning.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.589
You don't see one chimpanzee
making screeching sounds

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:25.380
or learning sounds.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.930
They might do a little bit, just
to warn, maybe as a warning.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.000
But there's no deep
nuance or deep precision

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.210
that's being able to convey by
these one-off sounds or even

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.670
one-off gestures.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.690
And what's particularly
powerful about human language

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.370
is that it is a
symbolic language.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.550
And when I say it's
a symbolic language,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.500
I'm even saying it
in a broader sense

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.600
that even just written symbols.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.090
I'm talking about even
though the sounds themselves.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.000
So let's go to a time where
we did not even have writings.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.040
And when we talk about
symbolic languages,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.790
let's think about a
non-symbolic language.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.340
So in a non-symbolic language,
you might have some sound.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.600
Let's call it Sound 1.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.870
And it has some meaning.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.490
Let's call it Meaning 1.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.250
So this might be a
certain type of scream.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.940
It means that a
predator is approaching.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.920
Then you might have something
like a Sound 2 or Gesture 2.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.150
And then it has
some other meaning.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.820
It has Meaning 2.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.660
It might be a
certain type of song,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.300
which means that I'm in the mood
to reproduce or whatever else.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.300
You might have Gesture 3
that has some direct meaning.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.380
It might mean that I have found
food or something like that.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.730
So Meaning 3.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.210
What humans have,
they can do this,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.680
where particular sounds
have particular meanings.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.030
So for example, in humans,
you could have Sound 1.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.292
It refers to Meaning 1.

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:50.750
I'll just refer to
it as Meaning 1.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.490
You could have Sound 2
that refers to Meaning 2.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.450
You could have Sound 3
that refers to Meaning 3.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.200
So these are just
direct representations.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.630
But what is really powerful
about symbolic languages,

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.200
is that these oral symbols
can be combined according

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.040
to set rules or grammars to have
an infinite number of meanings.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.450
So this is what really makes
human language transcend

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.160
other languages
and really makes it

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.819
this robust, precise
communication mechanism,

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:20.110
is you could have combinations.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.900
Sound 1, Sound 2,
Sound 3 will now

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.595
have another meaning, Meaning 4.

00:11:24.595 --> 00:11:26.220
Then you could maybe
have a combination

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.980
we have Sound 3, Sound 1, and
Sound 2 might have Meaning 5.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.780
And if you have tens
of thousands of sounds,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.332
and really our oral words
are those sounds in a given

00:11:37.332 --> 00:11:38.790
language, then all
of a sudden, you

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.540
can have infinite
meanings by putting them

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.030
in different combinations.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.946
And if you think this
is a little bit abstract

00:11:43.946 --> 00:11:45.460
imagine that Sound
1 is the sound

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.825
of me saying the word "dog."

00:11:46.825 --> 00:11:48.450
And I'm not even
going to write it down

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.033
because I want to
imagine a world even

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:51.450
before written communication.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.250
So Sound 1 is the sound "dog."

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.020
Sound 2 is a sound, "eats."

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.330
And Sound 3 is the sound "man."

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.320
So literally, Sound 1,
if you heard, "dog,"

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.070
you'd think, OK, I'd
visualize a dog of some type.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.710
And even there, you'd have
some visualization of a dog.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.140
And we all have one maybe.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.270
Sound 2, if you heard
"eats," you'd say,

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.360
OK, I'd imagine
eating in some way.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.137
And Sound 3, "man," you have
some visualization of it.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:19.720
And if it was a
non-symbolic language,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.020
that's all you could get
out of those three sounds.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.730
But now, in a symbolic
language, we can combine those.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.160
We could say, "dog eats man."

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.290
So once again, we just reused
the three sounds, the three

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.150
symbols.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.580
But now, they're referring to
a whole new, much more complex,

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.170
meaning than just referring
to certain objects

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.230
or certain actions.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.645
Or you could have,
"man eats dog."

00:12:40.645 --> 00:12:43.180
It's not pleasant, but I guess
in a desperate situation.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.070
But once again, it
is another meaning

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.090
that we can get out
of the same sounds.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.800
And what these
symbolic languages do,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.900
besides giving you an
infinite number of meanings,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.566
they're allowed to
give you more nuance,

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:58.070
and really refer to things that
are abstract, and including--

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.080
and maybe most
importantly-- things

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.130
like the present,
the future, the past,

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.000
kind of hypothetical things that
really are necessary in order

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.790
to really communicate
or optimally communicate

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.910
all of the experiences or
the learnings from one entity

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.680
to another.
