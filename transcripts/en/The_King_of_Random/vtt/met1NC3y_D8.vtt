Hey guys, today we're experimenting to see what happens when you throw a cap dart at gasoline

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.900
because you asked for it.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.900
These cap darts are super simple to make, they use a #6 machine screw and some of these kids' cap gun

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.780
caps to put over the top and turn them into exploding-tipped blow darts. This gives the

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.300
dart the ability that when the dart hits the ground, it makes a loud sharp snap. These cap darts are super easy to make, they're super

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.760
fun to play with, and they're not really that dangerous until today because our friend "landon main"

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.360
asks "The real question is can it light gasoline", so we're going to find out. (Cracking) Got my trusty

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.020
fire extinguisher hope we don't have to use that today, douse it with a little bit more gasoline

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.300
just so it's kind of refreshed and ready and I'm going to put this really far away. The first test

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.020
I'm going to try is just dropping it from here, let's just see what happens, so let's give it a try here

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.320
3... 2... 1... (Cracking) Now did you see that? There was actually a spark (Slow motion crack) of fire

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.280
on there, but I didn't actually see the gasoline light, which is amazing because this brick is actually pretty

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.200
well soaked with gasoline. (Continuous cracking) Nothing! All right so here's the cap dart if you take

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.240
a look at the cap here, you probably noticed there's no real noticeable damage, it's not cracked open and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.600
I think most of the blast shot back upward towards the top of the cap. We actually need to blast

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.400
forward out of the cap, so let's try it one more time, but this time, let's throw it quite a bit harder to see

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:34.880
if we can get the sparks to fly forward. (Cracking) Whoa, There it is! (Ignition). Here's the cap you can

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.600
actually see it did blast through. That is different than the first one was. Ok so one thing you need to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.880
know about using gasoline on the road is something we learned right now. Look down here at what's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.840
happening to the asphalt. Apparently, gasoline heats the road, ok so don't try this at home!

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.820
We're going to find a little bit safer place to do the next experiments.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.720
Now that we got a little puddle of gasoline, I'm going to hit this hard and hope that it goes off, so we are

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.320
are going to try

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.520
(Continuous cracking)

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.080
(Slow motion crack)

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.320
OK so we're dealing with gasoline, it's a volatile liquid that is supposed to react to sparks, but we're

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.340
throwing exploding cap darts, you can see that the sparks aren't coming out, so why is this not going

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.840
off?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.560
(Cracking)

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.400
Dude, I really want this to light off. I really do. I'm getting a little discouraged

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.960
Ok, so we're kind of thinking like most of the sparks are flying to the back, we might need to prepare

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.320
these a little bit to encourage the sparks to come out the front. I'm going to take these scissors, and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.040
cut a little bit of a hole in the tip there to make it a little bit easier access to that thing when it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.000
explodes. Let's see if that makes a difference.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.080
(Cracking)

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.240
Oh, I missed it, but it worked!

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.400
Dude, I think we're up to something

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520
We have to see it in slow motion

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.120
(Ignition) Oh, dude, I totally missed, but that worked perfectly!

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200
That looks really cool.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200
Let's do this one more time.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.520
Oh, I didn't prepare this!

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.660
(Cracking)

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.000
Yes! Yeah

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.760
(Slow motion cracking)

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.680
I have created fire!

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.280
Not really the fire I want to cook a hot-dog although

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.120
Boom, like Magic!

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.640
(Ignition)

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.560
So now that we've got to figure out how to do it by hand, lets take things up a notch and try it with our

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.720
laser-guided blowgun

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:29.240
(Ignition)

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.560
Alright guys, so in conclusion, I think we finally cracked the code on how to make these things go off.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.700
 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.760
It's not by throwing it as hard as you can, it's by trimming the edges so we can direct the sparks into

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.600
the gasoline, so now that we're getting these things to work 100% of the time. I want to see your

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.220
comments below on what kind of things we should light up with them. Thanks so much for joining me

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.720
for this experiment and while you're waiting for the next one, I've got a lot more videos you can still

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.200
check out at thekingofrandom.com. I'll see you in the next one

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.300
Hey, what's up guys, I made this video because you asked for it, and i'm taking more requests right now.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.200
So what do you want for me to do next? Put your wackiest ideas in the comments and let's see what

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.580
fun we can have in the next video. I'll see you there.
