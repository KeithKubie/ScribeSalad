00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:04.440
CHRIS YING: My
name is Chris Ying,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.750
I'm the editor in chief of
the Lucky Peach magazine.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.680
Welcome, to your own campus.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.120
Another authors at
Google event, this time

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.430
with Chef Thomas McNaughton
of Flour + Water,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.960
Salumeria, and Central
Kitchen in San Francisco.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.630
Three wildly successful places,
that I imagine many of you

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.800
have visited.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.560
AUDIENCE: Yummy.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.435
CHRIS YING: Yummy, we
got a yummy back there.

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:32.119
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Yay.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.869
CHRIS YING: And we're
here to kind of talk

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:38.660
and celebrate your new cookbook,
"Flour + Water: Pasta."

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.160
Let's just jump
right in, unless you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.830
want to say more nice things.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.050
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: No
please, that's perfect.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.110
CHRIS YING: So the first
thing I found interesting

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.480
about this book was that the
very first voices we hear from

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.710
are not yours.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.569
They're from your two
business partners--

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.610
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Right.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.250
CHRIS YING: --kind of giving
the background of how Flour +

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.870
Water came to be, and their
sort of somewhat circuitous path

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.301
to be restaurateurs.

00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:03.300
Can you tell us a little
bit about that decision

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.620
and that story, I think
that one of the-- the book

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.530
is really in three parts, and
the idea behind those three

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.650
parts were, the
first one is that it

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.050
had to be a story of
behind the scenes.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.040
And I think in this day and
age, you know with reality TV,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.411
and everyone wants to see what
goes on behind the scenes.

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:23.910
And we really wanted
to kind of tell

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.130
the story of how the
restaurant, Flour + Water,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.420
came to fruition.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.780
And that really started with
my two business partners,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.050
David White and David Steel.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.400
And the author,
Paolo Lucchesi, he

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.280
wanted to have some
sort of rhythm to it.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.240
And so, if you open the
book right off the bat.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.394
It has rhythm, and
it has, it's supposed

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:45.810
to kind of draw
you in little bit.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.059
And I thought it was great,
it kind of-- just slightly

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:51.730
different type face-- and it
kind of hops back and forth

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.620
their story and how it
kind of intertwines.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.930
And one starts in Ireland,
one starts in South Jersey,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.902
and how my two partners
met at that time.

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:06.110
CHRIS YING: I mean, it's
sort of like a classic tale,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.844
in restaurants of the chef,
and his business partners

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.260
never seeing
eye-to-eye on things.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.850
But it seems, based on
the story you tell here

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.880
that you guys have a very
different relationship

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.360
and that--

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.140
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: I think that
to-- a restaurant is a crazy,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.110
it's a crazy business
venture, it's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.800
a crazy experience
every single day,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.760
and we are three
people that come,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.260
we approach a restaurant three
completely different ways.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.060
And I think that we value
each other's experience.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.020
It's very much, I'm
kind of jumping ahead,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.510
but it's how the restaurants
run a daily basis,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.450
that it's a complete
collaborative nature.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.640
And really, every single
decision along the way

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.080
funnels down to the three of
us, and there's a veto power.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.550
You need two, you need
to votes out of three,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.340
to pass the law
that is being passed

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.594
that day, and that collaborative
nature, in that kind of trust

00:02:58.594 --> 00:02:59.510
so we have each other.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.760
I think it's certainly unique.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.740
It doesn't mean
that-- the meeting may

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.410
start with us arguing for
45 minutes prior to it,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.110
but um-- Yeah, we each
approach something different,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.970
we bring different perspectives.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.270
Outside perspective, from
outside of our industry

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.800
is really, really
important to us.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.725
It's staying away from
the humdrum nature of this

00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:21.440
is how it's done
in a restaurant,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.670
and this is how it's done
in a professional kitchen.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.440
So, we value that
collaborative nature

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.010
of being able to sit
around a roundtable

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.080
and talk about something.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.470
And then, like I said,
arguing 45 minutes

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.984
and then we come
up with a solution.

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:39.150
CHRIS YING: And the way
that you first got this job,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.610
was pretty unorthodox too.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.110
Can you tell us about where you
were, and how that happened?

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.800
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Yeah, I
was traveling a lot in Europe,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.180
and they call it staging.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.600
So staging at a restaurant
means that you can go there

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.020
and you work for free.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.950
It's like working
for a blacksmith.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.750
You can watch them work,
and get hands on experience.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.070
And there's an
intellectual property

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.760
that goes on with cooking
and professional restaurants,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.460
but there's also a physical.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.140
It's a craft.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.420
You have to use your hands.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.180
The more that you use
your training them,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.670
and so that was always
incredibly important to me.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.510
And I was in Bologna, working
at a pasta laboratorio,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.905
at the time and I just had
to go back to San Francisco.

00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:18.279
The honest story
is my girlfriend

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.560
was here at the
time, and I really

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.160
wanted to move back
to San Francisco,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.040
and working at these amazing
restaurants and on some farms.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.160
I saw a random Craigslist ad
for a chef, for a restaurant,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.782
and I just emailed back.

00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:33.865
It was like two sentences.

00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:35.630
It was like, I
don't have a resume.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.810
I worked at Gary Danko,
La Folie, and Quince.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.534
I'm coming back to to Marin
and I really want to goat farm.

00:04:41.534 --> 00:04:42.200
And that was it.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.720
And it was like,
two sentences long,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.030
and I think I even capitalized
"I really want to goat farm."

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.566
And then, my now business
partner Dave White

00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:53.190
e-mailed me back,
because we previously

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.273
worked together at Quince.

00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:56.980
And he's like, Tom is that you?

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.540
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.760
You want to goat farm?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.080
And we just started to
evolve the conversation.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.470
It was perfect timing.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.940
I was in Bologna, which is
the heart of-- Emilia-Romagna

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.480
in Italy is really the heart
of what most Americans think

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.920
of as Italian food.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.510
You know, it's Prusciuto de
Parma, Tagetelli Bolagnase,

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.390
lasagna, fresh rolled egg
doughs, Parmesan Reggiano,

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.490
balsamic vinegar
and he was talking

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.940
about opening this incredibly
rustic Italian restaurant,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.830
and it was focused on pizza.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.870
I thought that Flour + Water
was the worst name ever

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.950
possibly made up
for a restaurant.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.300
I'm still dealing
with it right now.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.909
Nobody ever forgets it though,
which is a great thing.

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.200
And it was just perfect timing.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.660
It was being in Emila-Romagna.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.850
My majority of my
restaurant background

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.690
was from more fine
dining restaurants.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.820
And I just fell
in love with that.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.460
The rustic nature of
the food, but also

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.960
the culture of how Italians eat
and their philosophy on food.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.460
We want to go back
to San Francisco.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.830
There's so much aligned with
the values in San Francisco,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.820
and dealing with food as
well, that it was just

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.260
kind of really,
really good timing.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.652
But I wasn't going to-- I
refused the partnership.

00:06:16.652 --> 00:06:18.110
And I wasn't going
to be a partner.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.962
And I was just going to
act like consulting chef.

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:22.670
And then after the
first couple of months

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.900
it just, so much of
like, blood, sweat,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.050
and tears went into
producing Flour +

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.380
Water that the partnership
just kind of seemed natural.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.380
CHRIS YING: And do you
have a goat farm now, or?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.560
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: We
do not have a goat farm.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.290
We're so close.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.320
We're so close.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.350
CHRIS YING: So you're
a bit of a failure.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.690
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.122
CHRIS YING:
Achieving that dream.

00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:44.080
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: I just
keep getting back up.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.760
CHRIS YING: No, but so that
trip you took to Italy,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.206
you know, you had been
cooking in very high quality

00:06:51.206 --> 00:06:53.080
restaurants in San
Francisco in the Bay Area,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.580
and then you made this sort
of decision to go to Italy

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.297
and do something
a little bit less

00:06:58.297 --> 00:07:00.130
refined to get in touch
with something else.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.050
And in a lot of ways you
were making the same journey

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.620
that Alice Waters
or Jeremiah Tower

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.060
had done 30 or 40
years before you.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.900
And they had had
that same epiphany

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.150
that change the way they cook.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.730
So, what was that
you encountered

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.460
in these places in
Bologna and Emilia-Romagna

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.982
that struck a chord with you?

00:07:18.982 --> 00:07:20.690
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: I
think that just kind

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.670
of traveling the whole
time that, if you--

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:29.610
growing up and having a
completely ADD nature as a kid,

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.020
I wanted to try a little
bit of everything.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.970
And I first fell in
love with kitchens

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.240
because they just coincided
with my personality.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.960
So you're never a master chef.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.250
You're never going to
master cooking and food.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.190
And that's what really
led me to want to travel,

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.650
to see different cultures.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.780
If you want to stage and
learn actual techniques,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.250
I tell most of our young
cooks stay in America.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.610
There's no language barrier.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.260
You can be in front chefs.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.390
You can articulate the things
that you want to say to them,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.930
and for you to grab as
much knowledge as possible.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:09.600
But I always say that going
to France, even Italy, Spain,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.960
Germany, working three-star
Michelin restaurants,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.590
I wasn't nervous at all, because
there's a common food language.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.950
I don't need to speak
German to understand

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.479
who's an hour behind
in the kitchen.

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:24.020
You could just see it on their
face, who needs the most help.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.560
Or you see somebody
picking fava beans.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.060
Like, I know how
to pick fava beans.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.450
I can just belly up and pick
them as fast as I possibly can.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.960
So there's a common
food language

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.868
within kitchens that breaks
down that language barrier.

00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:39.409
And going to
Emilia-Romagna and going

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.590
to pasta laboratorio,
where there's machines.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.430
Pasta machines are
all over Italy.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.690
The metal hand-cranked machines,
they're all over Italy.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.715
They don't exist in the
old walls of Bologna,

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:53.250
and everything's rolled
out by a giant matterello.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.140
It's a massive rolling pin.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.210
And it's like watching
like an artistic show,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.530
as they roll it out.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.720
It's something
completely different.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.580
And it was the first time
I was so incredibly nervous

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.510
in a kitchen.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.200
Because it was old ladies that
have been doing it for 40,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.440
50 years of their life.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.400
They go there to gossip
every single day.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.070
They don't even think about the
motions that they go through.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.900
And that craft, that
one single craft,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.080
to put it under a microscope,
was terrifying to me.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.640
I was shaking the
first time they

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.820
let me pick up one
of the rolling pins.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.910
It was just so specific, so
specific to that culture,

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:39.170
that I was enthralled
with the entire process.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.980
CHRIS YING: Can you
explain for everybody

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.800
this idea of the
pasta laboratorio?

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.300
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Pasta laboratorio

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.890
sounds like it's Google robots
coming in, napping pods.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.140
CHRIS YING: They probably
have a laboratorio somewhere

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.452
here-- a pasta lab.

00:09:53.452 --> 00:09:55.660
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: But it's
a bunch of wooden tables.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.220
And it's essentially just
a bunch of wooden tables.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.150
And it's something
that they produce.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.830
So a salumeria is
something that is based off

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.850
of historic shops in Bologna
that sell cured meats,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.880
and they sell
pasta by the pound.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.440
Some will specialize in
a little bit more cheese.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.810
Some may do sandwiches from it.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.410
But essentially,
it's cured meats

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.510
and it's pasta that
they sell by the pound.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.620
Every single one
of those salumerias

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.580
has a pasta laboratorio that's
associated with it, producing

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:34.430
literally 200 kilos of
fresh pasta a single day.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.460
And the one that I worked
at, Bruno and Franco,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.710
was just 12 old ladies working
around various wooden tables.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.130
And every single thing
is rolled out by hand.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.200
Which means that it's created
over a four-foot rolling pin.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.680
And they roll out
a sheet of pasta

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.240
that's three feet by four feet.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.560
And they do it in about
15 minutes per sheet.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.625
And it's just something
that-- also why

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.250
I've always connected
with Italian food

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.770
is that it's so
based off of culture.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.530
The nuance of what
goes on from a rolling

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.880
pin to a wooden table,
it's two porous natures.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.180
It's really porous.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.040
It's not like flat metal.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.110
And so it goes
down to the science

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.660
of how that pasta
behaves, and how

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.160
it's treated with
the sauce, and why

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.364
that's so important to them.

00:11:23.364 --> 00:11:25.280
But that's not the main
reason why they do it.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.095
They do it based off of
what their grandmother did,

00:11:28.095 --> 00:11:29.470
what their
great-grandmother did.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.100
It's based off of tradition.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.350
Some you could ask, why do
you roll it out with a pin,

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:38.160
you'd get this really, really
archaic-- you just don't ask.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.150
We roll it out by pins.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.940
And then some answers would talk
about the nuances of the wood.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.362
It's a very special place
that you don't see a lot.

00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:52.570
CHRIS YING: It's interesting.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.370
I spoke to the chef
Massimo Bottura

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.740
from this three Michelin
star hypermodernist

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.000
restaurant in Modena.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.160
And there they use roto vaps and
all sorts of crazy contraptions

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.780
when it comes o making
the tagliatelle.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.920
They will only do
it on a wooden table

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.190
with a wooden rolling
pin, because for whatever

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.530
grandmotherly reasons, plus
the real reasons that you're

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.250
talking about, it does matter.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.830
You can't improve
upon this thing.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.020
That seems very rustic.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.720
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Very, very shortly on I

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.670
had to calm my American-esque
questions to them.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.450
It was like, well, how come you
guys don't stay an hour longer

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.890
and roll out another 25 kilos,
and then you'd make this money,

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.800
and then you can
buy this machine?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.990
And why don't you have an
automated dryer for the pasta?

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.310
And they just weren't
interested in it.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.780
It was like, I'm going home
to cook to feed my family.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.810
That food culture--
or even a culture--

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.950
is so directly
connected with food.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.990
That's why I thought
traveling was so important.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.781
It's not just training
yourself for a chef,

00:12:56.781 --> 00:12:59.360
or working on your knife
skills, or learning

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.850
how to roll something
by rolling pin.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.020
Culture is so
interrelated with food.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.260
It's the common denominator
of every single person

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.630
in this room, is that
we all have to eat.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.240
We all don't have
fancy cafeterias

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.080
that make this amazing
food on a daily basis.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.840
But we're constantly--
whether you

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.860
aren't that interested
in food, you're

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.870
talking about food
on an weekly basis.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.035
Maybe where do we
eat tomorrow night?

00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:26.410
CHRIS YING: Do
you feel like it's

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.810
difficult to translate
that kind of spirit

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:34.390
of Italian eating culture to
the San Francisco restaurant

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.380
culture?

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.360
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: It's great.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.160
The reason why,
when we were first

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.430
approached to write
the book, it was we

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.999
want to do a Flour
+ Water cookbook.

00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:45.540
And it never really
made sense to me.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.400
I was like, well, such
a young restaurant.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.910
And I just didn't like
the scarcity of it.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.020
And when we finally
decided to do pasta,

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.570
it made so much sense to me.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.912
Because I think there's
a mystery behind pasta.

00:13:58.912 --> 00:14:01.370
There's a mystery behind pasta,
because not a lot of people

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.040
replicate it.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.100
We may have all, in this
room, been in the backyard

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.947
and thrown a steak on a grill.

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.030
And we're a little bit
more comfortable with that.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.980
And we've produced that before.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.750
There's a mystery behind pasta.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.760
And people, especially
in San Francisco,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.132
love Italian, rustic
Italian restaurants,

00:14:17.132 --> 00:14:19.590
because it's not something that
they make every single day.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.910
It's not a part of that
daily culture to, like, OK.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.470
Let's get the rolling pin
and start rolling out.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.330
I think that you certainly see
a resurge of people putting more

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.240
time into creating their
meals throughout the day.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.090
But I think it's based
off of something good,

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.430
and that's post-war how do
we have the family work?

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.380
How do we can items?

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.720
How do we can something
and have it available

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.629
all across America?

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:50.170
And that American
mentality of making

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.150
it faster and faster and faster.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.900
I think it's kind of reached a
point where people are slowly

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.710
stepping back and saying
is this a food culture

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.650
that were proud of?

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.441
Not to say there's
something wrong with it.

00:15:01.441 --> 00:15:04.210
It's based off of
something good.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.940
It's just going home and cooking
for two hours with a family

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.344
is engraved in them there.

00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:12.260
And it's something that
they don't necessarily

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.130
question that.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.220
And sure, you can get
a really fast panini

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.670
and a cappuccino on the street.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.880
But that daily
exercise of cooking,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:26.010
I think that it's interesting
to see it, maybe, slightly

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.889
evolve in America.

00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:29.430
CHRIS YING: And,
like you said, there

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:33.150
is no real shortage of that
rustic Italian restaurant

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.100
in San Francisco.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.200
People go nuts for pasta.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.200
And I want to hear why
Flour + Water stands out.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.930
But you also mentioned
that originally the Davids

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.610
had a different vision for what
Flour + Water was going to be.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.920
And it evolved into
something what it is now.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.296
Can you talk about what it is
now and how it became that?

00:15:51.296 --> 00:15:52.586
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: What is now?

00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:54.290
I don't even know
what it is now.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.840
The train has gone
off the tracks.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.460
But the original
vision, first, when

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:05.310
I would buy two hours with
the phone cards in Italy,

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.893
and just sit in a
phone booth and talk

00:16:06.893 --> 00:16:08.518
to them about the
business plan and how

00:16:08.518 --> 00:16:11.190
we were developing
the business plan.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.150
They wanted incredibly,
incredibly rustic Italian food.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.847
It was your antipasti was
a bowl of marinated beets,

00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:19.430
and that's it.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.929
Just marinated, and it's rustic,
and it's sitting in a bowl.

00:16:25.939 --> 00:16:27.605
Pizza is a huge focus
of the restaurant.

00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:29.296
When we first
opened up, everyone

00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:30.420
thought we were a pizzeria.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.190
And we were selling a billion
pizzas every single night.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.020
In the first week, we sold
four times the amount of pizzas

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.540
nightly than we do
now, because pasta's

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.840
taken such a
forefront to the menu.

00:16:48.086 --> 00:16:49.460
And my approach
was, why can't we

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.910
have a seemingly rustic
atmosphere in nature

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:58.140
of a restaurant and still
have refinement on the plate?

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:03.130
And it's something that I think
so many restaurants strive for.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.190
And a lot of it, you
can't really explain.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.579
It's like how can you have a
pizza whizzing by your head,

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.995
and it's cramped,
an it's crowded,

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.250
and it's uncomfortable
to wait for a table.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.329
And then have something
that's put on the plate

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:18.760
that maybe you could swap out
at a Michelin star restaurant.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.819
I got increasingly--
not annoyed,

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.740
but increasingly I want to
feel as normal as possible.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.490
I want to feel as
comfortable as possible.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.180
And if I have to put on a
suit that I wear once a year,

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.980
and I sit down at a formal
table and feel like I

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.450
have to whisper the whole time.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.570
Someone comes over and
you're like, oh, sorry.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.780
Why can't we have this
incredibly rustic nature

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.490
of an atmosphere, and then still
have refinement on a plate?

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.450
Michelin-starred
restaurant in New York City

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.210
that serves a burger.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.950
That burger's so
incredibly rustic.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.640
It's not made very
differently than most burgers.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.810
But it's that
attention to detail.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.880
I want that burger
perfectly cooked.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.052
I want that bun
perfectly toasted,

00:18:04.052 --> 00:18:05.510
that blue cheese
should always melt

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.745
a certain way on top of it.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.130
I think having a rustic
restaurant doesn't

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.838
mean that you have to
lose that attention

00:18:12.838 --> 00:18:15.110
to detail in every single thing.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.320
How clean the floor
is in the kitchen,

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.920
and having a
kitchen that can run

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.080
like a Michelin-starred
restaurant,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.530
I think, affects the food.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:28.980
CHRIS YING: I
wanted to go back--

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.625
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Did I-- I don't even

00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:30.580
think I answered that.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.121
CHRIS YING: Enh,
doesn't even matter.

00:18:32.121 --> 00:18:34.780
I don't even know what I asked.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.280
No.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.560
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: We're back.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.530
We're back.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:36.795
CHRIS YING: Just kidding.

00:18:36.795 --> 00:18:37.060
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
We're coming back.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.871
CHRIS YING: We did a great job.

00:18:38.871 --> 00:18:40.870
I want to go back to those
formative experiences

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.080
you were having in Bologna.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.110
You talk about,
in the book, going

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.590
beyond just like to the
trattorias on the street

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.260
and just the tourist places, and
finding these experiences that

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.190
are under the table.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.190
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Sure.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.720
CHRIS YING: And I
wondered if that's

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.860
something that your average
person can go to Italy

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.740
and find, or if being a chef,
being a cook, doing stages,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.750
opens those doors for you?

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.320
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Yeah, certainly.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.630
I was so fortunate when I
rented an apartment in Bologna.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.630
I didn't realize that I
was renting an apartment

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.680
from someone that
does culinary tours.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.820
And it wasn't like
him on a big bus.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.704
It was him taking
people in his car

00:19:14.704 --> 00:19:16.620
and bringing them to the
prosciutto factories,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.760
to where they make Parmesan,
seeing them firsthand.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.980
And certainly in southern Italy,
there's different dialects,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.930
there's a really rude
comment to somebody

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.330
is, you're the type of person
that eats at a restaurant.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.910
That's slang for you
have no idea what you're

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.710
talking about when
it comes to food.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.900
And so much of the
amazing experiences

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.590
that I had were
at people's table.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.319
And, also, understanding
that culture.

00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:45.110
When it comes to pasta,
I've been at tables

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.740
where someone's started grating
a truffle on top of a pasta,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.170
and half the table's
in an uproar.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.086
And they're like, what
the hell are you doing?

00:19:52.086 --> 00:19:53.910
That doesn't belong
on the pasta.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.990
And like for me, it's
like, keep shaving.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.880
Just keep shaving.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.510
More truffle.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.050
More truffle.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.380
That culture, and how it
interplays with that dining

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.950
atmosphere, is so important.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.824
It's like being in San
Francisco and seeing people--

00:20:08.824 --> 00:20:10.490
I'll see tourists
walking through there,

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.489
I'm like, how did they
get to this neighborhood?

00:20:12.489 --> 00:20:13.720
This is terrible.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.452
Not saying like they're in
a not-cool neighborhood.

00:20:16.452 --> 00:20:17.910
They're going to
Fisherman's Wharf.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.910
And they're like, well,
I had this chowder bowl,

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.330
and this is San Francisco food.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.250
This is crazy.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.750
I think it's just that
I love understanding

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.320
what goes into a city.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.560
I would never want
to travel to a city

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.684
again that I didn't have
that insider viewpoint.

00:20:33.684 --> 00:20:34.850
I think that's so important.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.860
I think I was really
fortunate enough

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.840
to find that in a
foreign country.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.460
CHRIS YING: It's
funny to me, given

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.890
how much Americans-- and San
Franciscans, specifically--

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.870
love Italian food, and how
much influence Italian food has

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.860
had on California cooking,
how many things get crazily

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.640
mistranslated when
they're brought here.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.580
And I think that things
like from Emilia-Romagna

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.560
and Bologna-- like
tortellini, for example--

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.352
feels like one of the most
tortured things in the world.

00:21:03.352 --> 00:21:04.810
What is that supposed
to look like?

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.157
What is tortellini about?

00:21:07.157 --> 00:21:08.740
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Tortellini in brodo

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.780
is like the pinnacle of
Bologna or Emilia-Romagna food.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.790
It's used as a standard
of whether it's

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.300
sub-par or traditional.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:26.800
I think that you can't take--
I keep going back to culture,

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.050
but you can't take a trattoria
in the middle of Italy

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:35.690
and place in San Francisco
and it be a success.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.350
You can't take Flour + Water
and put it in the middle of Rome

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.100
and think that it's
going to be a success.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.120
Because there's different--
maybe Italian and American food

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.990
is easier to compare,
but think of textures

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.490
of certain Asian cultures,
and some of those dishes

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.060
not really relating
to an American palate.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.450
I think it's the same thing
with any sort of food culture.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.290
And it kind of gets adapted.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.732
And maybe it starts
as a good thing,

00:22:02.732 --> 00:22:04.190
adapting it to a
different culture.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:10.800
But balsamic vinegar is one of
the most protected processes

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.350
in Italy.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.360
You can't have Extravecchio
25-year-old balsamic,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.110
has to be a jar, or has to
be put into a bottle, that's

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.750
specific to where that bottle
and that glass is blown.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.350
It's a very, very
specific shape.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.160
An then it has to get
a seal of approval.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:34.870
And then it's Extravecchio
balsamic vinegar traditionale.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.730
It's so protected.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.354
You go in the
supermarket here, and you

00:22:37.354 --> 00:22:39.750
get a gallon of caramel.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.520
It's literally like caramel
that has acid introduced to it.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.120
Middle America that's
only seen that big thing

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.130
of balsamic vinegar,
do they really

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.620
understand the culture
of balsamic vinegar?

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.430
And it kind of gets bastardized.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.996
I think that, too, it's
like, more, bigger, more.

00:23:00.996 --> 00:23:02.870
CHRIS YING: You worked
in Italian restaurants

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.192
before you made this
seminal trip to Bologna.

00:23:06.192 --> 00:23:08.150
And then you talk about
when you're in Bologna,

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.250
just that really
opening your eyes

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.020
to how pasta is
supposed to be eaten.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.490
How did your view of cooking
it and eating it change?

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.500
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: I just
think going to that source

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.055
is so enlightening.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.100
For the cookbook, we bugged
the hell out of Harold McGee--

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.330
if anybody knows "On
Food and Cooking"--

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.550
we would just keep buying
him lunch at Salumeria.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.960
Come on, we'll buy you lunch.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.480
And we'd entice him out.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.600
We'd just basically
interview him

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.974
the entire time
for the cookbook.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.850
"On Food and Cooking"
was written a year

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.140
after I was born.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.096
And it's still the most stolen
cookbook from our test kitchen.

00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:51.720
Because it has so
much relevance today.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.390
He was one of the
first food scientists

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.600
to really put food forward.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.560
It's understanding how
it behaves, and just

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.120
being incredibly
inquisitive about just

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.810
such a specific item.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.720
It's just pasta.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.540
How does it behave?

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.850
How does it eat?

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:11.040
What are the traditional sauces
that it's accompanied with?

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.480
There's something
that's protected

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.590
with that pasta that's like,
truffles don't belong on there.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.280
I love that how
that forces somewhat

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.230
of a different creative nature.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.770
So stick to the tradition.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.690
And we say that the
food at Flour + Water

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.030
is regional Italian food without
turning our backs on California

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:31.980
ingredients.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.230
You're not going to see that
many avocados over there.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.890
And I didn't go to
Bologna to be like, wow,

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.067
they use avocados here, too.

00:24:37.067 --> 00:24:37.650
This is great.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.430
Let's bring it back
to Flour + Water.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.460
But it was that
Italian sensibility--

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.150
what grows around you,
treating it simply.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.360
So much of that has to do with
how pasta is treated there.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.150
How it's behaving.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.040
And then from a restaurant
setting, it's like, well,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.373
how are they slightly drying it?

00:24:52.373 --> 00:24:54.428
How do they store it?

00:24:54.428 --> 00:24:56.636
CHRIS YING: How does that
creative process at Flour +

00:24:56.636 --> 00:24:57.215
Water work?

00:24:57.215 --> 00:25:00.310
Does everything begin with
the traditional references,

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.795
every shape preexisting?

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.170
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: We buy
our food from small farms.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.730
And the tagline that
everyone uses now--

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.450
small farms and whole animals.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:16.920
And we don't really think of
a dish and then order in food.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.140
We just order the best
possible food we can,

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.400
and we say, OK, well, what do
I want to do with that lam?

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.520
Today it's lamb shoulders.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.730
Tomorrow it's lamb belly.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.640
The next day it's lamb leg.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.940
That feeds the creative
nature to the menu.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.360
As far as the
pasta program goes,

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.260
we want to adhere--
we don't want

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:41.750
it to be too much of a
blasphemy about that pasta.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.700
Tortellini in brodo.

00:25:45.054 --> 00:25:46.720
In my opinion, it's
tortellini in brodo.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.560
It should be served in brodo.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.749
So it shouldn't be picked up
in a cheesy Alfredo sauce.

00:25:52.749 --> 00:25:53.790
It's tortellini in brodo.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.895
It's meant to be in brodo.

00:25:55.895 --> 00:25:57.270
Well, we're in
California, and we

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.680
have 12 extra cases of tomatoes
that a farmer gave to us,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.840
and they're really beautiful.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.060
We can make tomato
water and serve around

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.230
that tortellini in
a broth, but that

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.930
broth we made of tomato water.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.702
We can serve it as a lightened
dish inside of summertime.

00:26:15.702 --> 00:26:17.410
So it's still sticking
to that tradition,

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:18.784
saying well, it's
brodo, but what

00:26:18.784 --> 00:26:20.110
do we have around us right now?

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.110
Let's create this
broth out of tomato.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.680
I think that we tried
to adhere to it,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.740
but then we always put that
little California twist

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.150
on the end of it.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.802
CHRIS YING: Do you ever get
hardliner Italian people

00:26:32.802 --> 00:26:34.760
in there who are just
like, this isn't Italian?

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.135
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Italian people

00:26:36.135 --> 00:26:38.240
are the worst people to
cook for in the world.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.740
Whether they're Italian American
or whether they're straight

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.410
off the boat, they want to tell
you how their mother did it.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:47.730
This is good, but my
mother-- Yeah, certainly.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:55.640
And I think that the biggest
compliment that we get--

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.670
and it seems like we get it
all the time-- is when Italian

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:03.270
comes in, they order something
that is seemingly not

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.720
traditionally Italian,
and the response

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.570
is, this is so Italian.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.350
And maybe that avocado
salad, but that sensibility

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.900
of what goes into it is
that Italian sensibility.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.810
And that, to me, is the
ultimate compliment.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.060
It's not like, my mother
used to put a little bit more

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.620
nutmeg in the
broth, and you know.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.834
But yeah, it's a huge
compliment to hear that.

00:27:24.834 --> 00:27:26.250
CHRIS YING: One
of things I really

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.700
love about this book is
just how in-depth you

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.180
go with these things.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.330
We've probably heard lots of
fresh pasta dough recipes,

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:39.420
but then there's four pages of
pretty small type describing

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:39.920
it.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.840
And I also really
like the thinking

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.780
that goes into arriving
at these methods.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.460
You talk about your experience
with in the laboratorio,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.035
and the women only wanting
to rest their dough

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:52.270
for 18 to 24 hours.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.780
But 30 minutes is enough here.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.890
Or one of my favorite
things is this idea

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.470
that I had never even read about
in a cookbook of absorption

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.560
versus adsorption.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.790
Actually, will you just
explain that a little bit?

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.790
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: That
was a Harold McGee lunch

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.380
where we were like,
well, what goes on here?

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.540
I think that to back
it up, the book--

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.720
pasta-- I'll open
a pasta cookbook,

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.100
and it's just written word.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.870
And I have no idea
what it's saying.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.230
I'm like, it's so complicated.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.000
It's like right
lateral triangle into.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.350
You have to do math to figure
out how to create this shape.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.880
It was so important to
us that, like, let's

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.490
get as geeky as we possibly
can about this subject,

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.820
but make it as
PC-friendly as possible.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.780
As friendly in nature
of someone that

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.020
knows pasta and wants to
learn something about it to

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.630
we've just used flour and
eggs for the first time.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.710
How do we dive into the subject
and still engage people?

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.730
And it was written
word, and we found

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.040
that photos were
so important to us.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.740
Because you can have
this completely elaborate

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.130
thought-out paragraph, and
then you turn the page,

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.290
and it's like, oh, OK.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.780
Because I'm such
a visual person.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:12.030
But it's that single subject,
diving in as much as possible.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.850
We created a dough room
to create all this pastas

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.100
and breads.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.310
And then we created a test
kitchen for the cookbook.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.260
And we really like--
this is permanent.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.300
You can do little edits.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.089
Maybe we make it to
a second printing.

00:29:24.089 --> 00:29:24.880
But it's permanent.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.324
It's out there.

00:29:26.324 --> 00:29:28.490
And that was it's terrifying
to me, because I really

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.040
wanted to A, make sure all
the recipes actually worked,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.780
then anything we said that
we're held accountable to.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.670
And there's cookbooks that
I read that's like, oh. man.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.460
That's just wrong.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.880
It's crazy that that went
through all the edits.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.410
And one of the things that I
was teaching all of the cooks

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.230
is, I do say I was
culinarily abused

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.400
as a child in South Jersey.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.760
And my mother used
to boil spaghetti,

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.770
to take the lid off of the
Prego can and heat up the sauce,

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.270
and then put the
spaghetti in a bowl

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.260
and then just pour the
sauce on top of it.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.700
And forever, I was
teaching, we cook

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.410
all of our pastas 80% of
the way in pasta water,

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.789
and then 20% of the
way in the sauce.

00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:15.080
It's always so important to me.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.800
And I was always
teaching these cooks

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.740
there's two things that happen.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.940
The pasta itself is weeping
a little bit of the starch

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.050
into the sauce itself.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.800
It's helping to
stabilize the sauce

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.670
and concentrate the sauce.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.900
And also, two, the pasta's
absorbing all this flavor.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.685
So it's heavily salted water.

00:30:31.685 --> 00:30:33.060
It's absorbing
that salted water.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.050
You put it in the sauce, it's
absorbing all the flavors

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.660
of that amazing
way-braised pork shoulder.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.160
CHRIS YING: And this
is super common.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.660
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Common knowledge,

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.240
is what I was taught.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.750
I said that to Harold,
and he starts laughing.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.560
You're wrong.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.440
You are just wrong.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.570
And I was saying that it was
absorbing all that flavor.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.970
Starch is water-soluble.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.010
So starch and that pasta
and that wheat-based product

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.720
can only absorb water.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.980
It can't absorb any fats.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.620
You can't cook pasta
in a fat and then

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.880
have it hydrate, right?

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.300
It'll absorb it all.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:16.780
Everything that's romanticized
and amazing about that braise

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.790
is mostly essential oils
that come off of the herbs,

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:26.310
all these things, the fat that's
rendered off from the product.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:31.064
What it is is that the pasta
is only absorbing water.

00:31:31.064 --> 00:31:32.730
It's literally you
have all this braise,

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.396
and it's literally
just hydrating itself

00:31:34.396 --> 00:31:36.570
with just water.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.290
If you cook
spaghetti in red wine

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.180
and you look at that
spaghetti, there's

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.230
really only a red
wine ring around it.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:49.170
It's only pulling out all the
H2O from the braise itself.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:53.440
Adsorption with a D is a
term that he taught me,

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.440
that it's how products adhere
to the outside of that noodle.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.787
So that matterello
makes an amazing texture

00:32:00.787 --> 00:32:03.120
on the outside of that noodle,
because you're rolling it

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.700
from that wooden rolling
pin on the wooden board.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.120
Its porous nature is putting
all of these little crevices,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.010
these little nooks and crannies,
around all of that pasta

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.080
that you can barely
even see by the eye.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.010
And that's giving
adsorption the upper hand,

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.780
because it's able
to link more things

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.030
on the outside of that noodle.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.960
So the concept of finishing
in the pan was right.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.870
The fact of absorption
and absorption

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.740
was completely wrong.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.860
CHRIS YING: I just love
how the entire story is

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.820
in this book of something that
we all-- if you're a cook,

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.595
or if you read
cookbooks, it's just

00:32:34.595 --> 00:32:35.720
that's something you think.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.830
Oh, it absorbs the sauce.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:37.190
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: No, totally.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.670
Yeah.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.878
CHRIS YING: And then you
kind of explode that theory,

00:32:39.878 --> 00:32:42.020
but still give the
reason why it truly

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.560
is good to finish your
pasta in the sauce.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.520
Among the other things
I liked about this book

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.449
is that you answer
a question-- which

00:32:49.449 --> 00:32:50.990
I'm sure you get
all the time-- which

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.500
is what's your favorite pasta?

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.000
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Is that in there?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.890
CHRIS YING: It's
in there somewhere.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.560
Which was the bigoli.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.240
Can you tell us a little
bit about that dish?

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.230
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: You can't
really talk about Italian food,

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.200
and you certainly can't
talk about pastas,

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.390
without talking about how
regional Italy actually is.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.940
Northern Italian food
and southern Italian food

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.080
are two completely
different things.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.050
And that goes from not
only each region to region,

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.920
but also town to town.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.060
My favorite pasta in the
world is called bigoli.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.380
And bigoli really comes
from a hand-cranked machine

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.730
called a torchio.

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.605
It's made of brass,
has a brass die.

00:33:28.605 --> 00:33:31.310
It's very similar to spaghetti,
but it's hand-cranked,

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.370
and it goes through
this brass die,

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.880
and it puts this
incredible texture

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.570
on the outside of the dough.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.935
The dough itself is
made with semolina.

00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:42.990
It has butter,
cream, eggs in it.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.450
It's incredibly enriched.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:47.919
It's almost like an
enriched udon noodle.

00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:49.502
But when it comes
out of this machine,

00:33:49.502 --> 00:33:50.918
it looks like a
dreadlock, almost.

00:33:50.918 --> 00:33:53.120
It's got this crazy
pulls and textures to it.

00:33:57.902 --> 00:33:59.670
I love the texture
of that noodle.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.340
And it adds so much about how
that grips with the sauce.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.980
But the last time, right
before I wrote this book,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.100
I was in Italy.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.520
And I was in Rome trying to
go to all these restaurant

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.232
supply stores because my
friend wanted a torchio

00:34:11.232 --> 00:34:12.190
to bring back with him.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.929
It's that hand-cranked machine.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.310
And I was going around, like,
do you guys have torchio?

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.290
And every single response is
like, what is that, American?

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.909
What is it?

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.469
What are you talking about?

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.510
And I was like, no, no,
no, it's from the Veneto.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.409
It's from Venice,
from Venice, up north.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:25.699
And it's like, no,
it's from the Veneto.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:26.639
It's a hand-crank machine.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.881
Every single response was
like, dude, you're in Rome.

00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:29.380
No.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.889
We don't have that here.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:33.380
It was just incredibly
enlightening

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.780
about how that plays
on with those regions.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.800
It just doesn't
exist down there.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.409
Torchio is unimportant to them.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.909
CHRIS YING: I sort
of implied that I

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.770
would know when time
was coming to an end,

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.181
but I have no idea what
time it is whatsoever.

00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:51.389
SPEAKER: Few more questions
if there's anything you--

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.560
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.810
I have more questions, but
if you guys have questions.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.080
Does anybody want to--

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.340
AUDIENCE: I live a block
away from Flour + Water,

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.900
so I feel like
I'm your neighbor.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.530
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Say
hello sometime, will you?

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.488
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know.

00:35:01.488 --> 00:35:02.201
Seriously.

00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:03.450
We eat there pretty regularly.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.184
And I wanted to hear
about the neighborhood.

00:35:06.184 --> 00:35:07.600
Because you guys
have been playing

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.745
a huge role in neighborhood,
especially now expanding

00:35:10.745 --> 00:35:13.020
to Salumeria and
Central Kitchen.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.430
It feels like Gourmet
Alley's going on.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.400
I wanted to know what's your
vision for it and of how

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.430
it's evolved?

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.600
I've heard a lot of
stories about 09.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.610
You guys kind of put yourself
in the middle of nowhere.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.080
And now you've created
a spot in San Francisco.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Sure.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.050
It's a great question.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:39.790
In '09, obviously, it was not
the best economical times.

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:43.780
You hear of 12 restaurants
a month, now, opening.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.620
And that's crazy.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.830
And there wasn't a
lot of restaurants

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:46.663
opening at the time.

00:35:46.663 --> 00:35:49.470
And we were really lucky
how we went about it.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:53.940
And that neighborhood I
likened to-- it sounds cheesy,

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.262
but it's like Brooklyn.

00:35:55.262 --> 00:35:57.470
All of a sudden, people
started finding out about it.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.570
And it was kind of
on the outskirts.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.010
It had big warehouses.

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:03.099
Rent was cheap.

00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:05.140
There wasn't a lot of
people moving out of there.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.265
But there was not a lot of
people moving out there,

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:10.520
because it was not the nicest
neighborhood the world.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.620
We have an amazing
picture of Flour + Water

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.410
before we broke ground
on construction.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.354
And it was abandoned
for 10 years.

00:36:17.354 --> 00:36:19.270
And it was this old El
Salvadorean restaurant.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:20.894
People still come in
to the restaurant,

00:36:20.894 --> 00:36:22.630
and they're like,
oh, six years ago,

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.250
we went to the best rave of
our life inside this building.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.130
It was taking a chance.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.270
It was gambling on
that neighborhood.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.060
It's this huge,
amazing juxtaposition

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:41.140
of amazing old Victorian
homes and then industry.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.586
Industry of businesses that are
throughout that neighborhood.

00:36:44.586 --> 00:36:46.210
And we just thought
it was a great mix.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.000
And fortunately,
everything on 20th Street

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.780
is actually the same landlord.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.320
So we started with
Flour + Water.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.940
We always wanted a salumeria.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.080
We always want somewhere
to sell our cured meats,

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.788
to sell the products
that we're proud of,

00:36:58.788 --> 00:37:00.450
the salts, the olive oils.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.170
And so Salumeria sits at the
corner of an old German sausage

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.220
factory.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.760
And so it really just started
with that tiny little 500

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.760
square foot.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.307
And then there was more
building behind it.

00:37:12.307 --> 00:37:14.140
And we were like, oh,
what could we do here?

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.092
Than there was a little bar
space that wasn't a bar yet.

00:37:17.092 --> 00:37:18.550
It was like, what
could we do here?

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.890
And then Sightglass moving in.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.590
And we actually took
over the whole building,

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.360
and then helped
divide up the leases.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.120
So we didn't want a Burger King.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.870
And Burger King would
never move in there.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.370
But we didn't want a Burger
King moving into this spot.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.410
And so we helped orchestrate
that whole building,

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.555
which was really
big at the time.

00:37:38.555 --> 00:37:39.930
There's not that
many more plans.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.160
We're opening Cafe du
Nord in Upper Market.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.830
So Cafe du Nord is in the
Swedish American Hall.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.630
It opened in 1907.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:52.430
Cafe du Nord, since 1907, has
continued to operate as a bar,

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:53.550
even through Prohibition.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:57.350
It's got these weird
crazy things about it.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.870
So we're partnering, again, with
the bon vivants from Trick Dog.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.512
Fun, underground, lively bar.

00:38:06.512 --> 00:38:08.220
And then we're opening
another restaurant

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.280
above that called Ache, which
is a Spanish restaurant that we

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.899
just made our longtime
chef de cuisine, Ryan

00:38:15.899 --> 00:38:17.690
Pollnow, a partner in
the restaurant group,

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:19.610
to help him open
his own restaurant.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.820
So besides that, nothing.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.960
We're doing the whole roof.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.670
It's going to be a crazy year.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.640
Above Trick Dog, the bar,
is a 4,000-square-foot roof.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.160
And we just got
done retrofitting

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.682
that whole roof to have a
4000-square-foot garden.

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:39.640
AUDIENCE: And you had
some influence over that.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.650
Everything there is
very high quality.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:42.650
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.310
We didn't buy the building.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.540
We took over the master lease,
and then orchestrated it

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.330
from there.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:50.160
It was just important to us.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.880
It's like that
collaborative nature

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.380
of how we run the business,
how the cooks come up

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.270
with a menu with me.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.020
It's like well, what do you
want to work with today?

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.270
Do you want to work with this?

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.057
And that collaborative
nature is very much

00:39:01.057 --> 00:39:02.140
that neighborhood as well.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.910
It's just getting good people
to do what they're good at.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.700
Sightglass is just good people
that do good at what they do.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.700
I think that was really,
really important to us.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.080
I live above Flour + Water.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.350
I live, literally,
above the restaurant.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.600
AUDIENCE: So we are neighbors.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.056
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Yeah, we are neighbors.

00:39:20.056 --> 00:39:21.180
Come over for a beer, yeah?

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.710
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
I couldn't imagine

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.860
having these restaurants
in other parts of the city.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.570
It's crazy.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.990
I'm terrified of du Nord,
because it's a 10-minute drive

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:33.330
away.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.369
And it's amazing
to be able to be

00:39:35.369 --> 00:39:37.160
on that street and just
kind of hop around.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.400
I don't even have
a home anymore.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.840
I just hop around
from restaurant

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.449
to restaurant putting out fires.

00:39:42.449 --> 00:39:42.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.320
Could you talk more about
the staging process,

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.750
and how maybe amateurs
or regular people would

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.550
go about doing that,
if that's an option?

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.820
Because I imagine it's
probably selective

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.357
for certain restaurants.

00:39:55.357 --> 00:39:56.940
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Certain restaurants

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.000
are really, really
strict about it.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.981
The higher-end restaurants,
the higher you go,

00:40:00.981 --> 00:40:02.980
sometimes they're more
and more strict about it.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.520
If you're going to stage, you
have to sign a piece of paper,

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.360
and you have to stage
for at least 30 days.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.240
Because they put so much time
and effort into having you

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.740
there, that they want it
to be beneficial for both

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.095
the restaurant and yourself.

00:40:17.095 --> 00:40:18.470
Find the restaurant
that you want

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:20.620
to stage at, and then just
bug the hell out of the chef.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.120
That's it.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.890
Write him a bunch of emails.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:24.972
The more novice--

00:40:24.972 --> 00:40:26.430
CHRIS YING: Make
sure you tell them

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.234
Thomas told you to
do that, though.

00:40:28.234 --> 00:40:29.900
I'm sure they'll
really appreciate that.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.400
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Yeah, no,
I've never met that guy before.

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.110
The more novice you are, it
depends on the restaurant.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.970
If the restaurant's kitchen
is like this little shoebox,

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.970
it might be very, very
difficult to take you on,

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.010
because it takes time.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.310
And when you're there, it's
like the two-way street.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.810
I love it.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:47.976
We have an open door policy.

00:40:47.976 --> 00:40:50.630
And it's great, because when
someone's asking somebody

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:53.635
a question, it's forcing
them to retrain themselves.

00:40:53.635 --> 00:40:55.343
So if you're on
garde-manger with a cook,

00:40:55.343 --> 00:40:56.870
and you're like, well,
why do you do that?

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.578
The cook's like, well,
why do we do that?

00:40:58.578 --> 00:41:01.000
Why don't we just put it there?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.240
But it depends on the space.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.234
The smaller the space,
the more difficult.

00:41:05.234 --> 00:41:06.900
And every single
restaurant's different.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.358
Sometimes they'll
just be like, you

00:41:08.358 --> 00:41:09.660
have to stand in that corner.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.270
And you're literally not
allowed to leave the corner.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.756
And it just depends
on the restaurant.

00:41:14.756 --> 00:41:17.708
AUDIENCE: So what's Flour
+ Water's policy on this?

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:20.207
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Just email
the chef and just bug the hell

00:41:20.207 --> 00:41:22.580
out of him.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.800
I'm terrible at email.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.670
I'm really bad.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.000
It depends.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.670
We have a ton of stages.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.885
And then, if you just
contact the restaurant-- just

00:41:31.885 --> 00:41:36.420
info@flourandwater-- and then
it fits in with the time--

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.220
If it fits in with
the time means

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.430
there's not a ton of
stages there, or depending

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.388
on what's going on, if
there's a ton of events,

00:41:42.388 --> 00:41:43.440
if it fits the timing.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.010
And then open-door policy.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.370
Open-door policy for one day.

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:49.220
And then beyond that one
day, depends how you do.

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.010
CHRIS YING: Becomes
a closed-door policy.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:51.850
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:53.141
But don't be offended if it is.

00:41:53.141 --> 00:41:55.227
But it just depends
on that individual.

00:41:55.227 --> 00:41:57.560
There's certain people that
come to the restaurant group

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.764
with zero experience,
and they're amazing.

00:42:00.764 --> 00:42:01.430
They're awesome.

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.400
They just have a good attitude.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.930
They want to be
taught what to do.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:05.710
They want to get in there.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:07.251
They have no problem
just jumping in.

00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:08.147
And they're amazing.

00:42:08.147 --> 00:42:10.230
There's people that come
to the restaurant with 20

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.875
years of experience,
and they're just a jerk.

00:42:12.875 --> 00:42:14.120
They don't fit in here.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:14.930
So it depends.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.860
Every single person's
completely different.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.340
AUDIENCE: So I studied
in Florence in college,

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.470
and my host grandmother would
make this just plain marinara.

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.130
It was the best
thing in the world.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.450
And she would often joke.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.234
She gave me the recipe, and
I've made it every summer since,

00:42:30.234 --> 00:42:31.400
and it never tastes as good.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.340
So I think part of it
might be just nostalgia.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.380
But she often joked that
it's the soil in Italy,

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.220
and it's the very
specific types of tomatoes

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.470
that you're using and whatnot.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.670
And so I was curious-- are
there any dishes or any flavors

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.560
that you've struggled to
recreate in San Francisco

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.220
that you tasted or
enjoyed in Bologna?

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.220
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.550
I think that terroir
is a real thing.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.210
It's not just about
growing grapes.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:59.305
You can take the same
grapevine, and you can grow it

00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:01.555
in three different locations,
and it's the same grape.

00:43:01.555 --> 00:43:03.640
It comes from the same vine.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.252
And it's three completely
different glasses of wine

00:43:06.252 --> 00:43:07.460
when you're all done with it.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.020
That's true with anything.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.720
We use San Marzano tomatoes.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.690
We use incredibly,
incredibly local ingredients.

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:19.720
Our pigs come from 45
minutes above the restaurant.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.740
That is because of the
terroir that is those pigs.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:32.880
Could we buy some crazy, crazy
acorn-fed pork from Spain?

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.680
And it's incredibly-- the
marbling's ridiculous.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.870
That's not our pork here.

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.660
I'd much rather use
our local ingredients.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.120
And it just adds a nuance, or
a flavor nuance, to each dish

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.810
that you can't really explain.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.500
And it's the same
thing with any food.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.560
The San Marzano
tomatoes, San Marzanos.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.330
you can grow the same
variety in California,

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.100
but they're San Marzano style.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.850
Because those San
Marzanos in Italy

00:43:55.850 --> 00:44:00.020
have come from a very
volcanic enriched soil.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.580
So there's truth
to every product.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.155
That's why I fell in love with
San Francisco and California

00:44:08.155 --> 00:44:08.780
the first time.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.270
Because when I first moved
out here, it was like,

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.190
well, shit-- this is
what sage tastes like?

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.863
Or that's the most
amazing turnip

00:44:14.863 --> 00:44:16.150
I've ever had in my life.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.740
That's crazy.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.698
And it was just sage,
and it was just a turnip.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.700
Most of our pork comes
from Devil's Gulch.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.284
It's in Nicasio.

00:44:25.284 --> 00:44:26.200
That's awesome for us.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.080
It's a 45-minute drive.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.300
We can go feed them
apples, and he'll

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.160
be on the menu in the
next couple of weeks.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.820
It's amazing to see
that full circle.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.960
And then also, he, now, because
we have such a relationship

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.910
with them, he grows pigs for us.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:46.440
He grows pigs,
quails, lambs for us.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:51.310
And we have control
over it-- from size

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:55.627
to weight to what they feed the
actual pigs, like the apples

00:44:55.627 --> 00:44:56.460
and stuff like that.

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.070
And so, it's cool.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.160
That, to me is a
responsibility of a chef

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.840
in northern California.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.581
It's going beyond.

00:45:07.581 --> 00:45:09.830
Because we're capable of
sourcing amazing ingredients,

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:12.299
it should be a part of
the job description.

00:45:12.299 --> 00:45:13.840
AUDIENCE: When's
the last time you've

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.830
had dried store-bought pasta?

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:16.630
And--

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.920
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Uh--

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.710
AUDIENCE: Oh, go ahead.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.360
You can answer.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.360
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: No, no, no--

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.360
AUDIENCE: The second one
is in the restaurant,

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.370
do you use SF tap water
when you're making pasta?

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:27.350
And maybe talk a little bit
about the flours you use?

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:28.650
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: Sure.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:34.290
The dried store-bought
pasta is not a bad thing.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.390
We focus more on
northern Italian regions,

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.860
certainly with pasta.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.990
When it becomes
summertime, and we

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:45.660
start growing the things that
are grown in southern Italy--

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.220
tomatoes, chilies,
peppers-- our menu

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.530
takes more of a southern Italian
influence in the summertime.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.980
But when you think of
fresh pasta-- pappardelle,

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.770
garganelli, tagliatelle--
all those things?

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.680
That fresh pasta is from a
region in northern Italy.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.150
Every single thing that
you see in the supermarket

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.180
is southern Italian pasta.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.730
So spaghetti,
bucatini, rigatoni--

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.550
all those things are
southern Italian pasta.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.690
Just because it's dried
doesn't mean it's bad.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.460
There's some amazing
companies that

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.917
are in America that
have dried pastas.

00:46:19.917 --> 00:46:20.750
We have an extruder.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.220
All that comes from an extruder.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.280
Means it's pushing
out through a die.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.220
It's a mechanism.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.890
And we extrude fresh.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:30.680
So instead of having
dried spaghetti,

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.626
we make spaghetti
every single day.

00:46:32.626 --> 00:46:33.250
And it's fresh.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.350
It's pliable.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.440
It has a completely
different texture.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.240
So dried pasta
isn't a bad thing.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.877
It's just specifically
from southern Italy.

00:46:42.877 --> 00:46:44.960
And that's how it's bought
and sold there as well.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:53.141
But no, there's some good
brands of dried pasta.

00:46:53.141 --> 00:46:53.640
The

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.306
AUDIENCE: Water?

00:46:54.306 --> 00:46:56.010
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Oh, the water.

00:46:56.010 --> 00:47:02.140
The argument with the water is
that it is more bread-making.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.300
So there's zero yeast
inside of pasta.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.550
Anything that's yeast-related.

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:09.830
So bagels is a big argument.

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.920
There's not a single good
bagel in San Francisco.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:18.240
And then the nutrients, or lack
of nutrients, in that water,

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.780
and how it behaves with yeast.

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.620
And so, yeah, we
use San Francisco

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.467
tap water for everything.

00:47:23.467 --> 00:47:24.550
And our bread's different.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.425
We make all the bread
at the restaurant, too,

00:47:26.425 --> 00:47:28.290
and it's different than
if we were making it

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.060
on the east coast.

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.860
But like I said, there's
people that fly in.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:38.150
There's people that fly in water
to certain parts of the world

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.340
to make that New
York-style bagel.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:44.850
Yeah, it's just
kind of crazy to me.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:49.044
I love a good bagel
from the east coast.

00:47:49.044 --> 00:47:49.960
CHRIS YING: All right.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.100
Well, thank you guys for coming.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.540
Thank you, sir, for coming.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.680
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON:
Thanks for having us.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.740
CHRIS YING: You're going to
sit around and sign some books,

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.460
or you have to go do a thing?

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.760
THOMAS MCNAUGHTON: We're going
to sign some books, yeah.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.745
CHRIS YING: Well, thanks, guys.
