00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.800
Problem 100.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.190
They draw this graph, which I
guess I should also draw.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.060
So they draw it pretty big.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.810
So I'll draw it pretty
big as well.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.530
They have a line that goes from
the center to there, it's

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.000
a pie graph.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.650
Then they call that category
like that, and another

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.160
category that looks something
like that, and then they have

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.600
a final category that looks
something like that.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.010
They say that this is
the highway trust

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.390
fund, which is 72%.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.056
They say x% is a tire tax.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.480
This is 12%, which
is a gas tax.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.760
Then you have x plus 4%, which
is a tax on trucks.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.560
According to the graph above,
what percent of the funds for

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.239
highway maintenance-- oh, and
this title says sources of

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.920
funds for highway maintenance.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.640
So that's what this
whole thing is.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.850
According to the graph above,
what percent of the funds for

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.220
highway maintenance came
from the tax on tires?

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.080
So we need to solve for x.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.785
So let's think about it.

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:26.590
x plus 12 plus x plus 4, that's
this, plus 72 have to

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.860
equal 100%.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.780
We have two x's, get those out
of the way, and then what is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.710
this equal to?

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.020
12 plus 4 is 16.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.430
16 plus 72-- let me
write that down.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.450
I always make careless
mistakes.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.380
That's 16.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.670
16 plus 72 is 88.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.300
2x plus 88 is equal to 100.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.620
Then you have 2x is equal
to, subtract 88

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.170
from both sides, 12.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.540
x is equal to 6.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990
That's exactly what we're
looking for, the tire tax.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.660
So that's 6%.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.910
That's choice B.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.410
Drawing it was harder
than solving it.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.270
Problem 101.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.640
A poll reveals that the average
arithmetic mean income

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.900
of 10 households is $25,000.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.630
So we could say, average
of 10 is equal to 25K.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.570
If 6 of the households have
income of $30,000 each, what

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.400
is the average of the
other 4 households?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.090
So if we were to average all of
them, we could say it would

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.050
be 6 times the households that
are 30,000, so 6 times 30K,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.400
plus 4 times the average
of the other 4.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.840
So let's say that's what we're
trying to solve for, 4 times

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.820
the average of the other
4 households.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.280
This would be the sum of
all of the households.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.520
If we were to divide that by
10, we're going to get the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.190
total average of all
10, which is 25.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.910
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.010
You have 6 households making
30K, so the sum of those

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.390
households is going
to be 6 times 30.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.440
Then the sum of the other 4
households is going to be 4

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.850
times their average.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.440
That's what they're asking
us for, what

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.690
is the average income?

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.700
If you take the sum of all the
households, all 10, you divide

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.310
it by 10, you get
their average.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.030
So you get 6 times 30-- I don't
want to make this look

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.340
like a variable,
that's 30,000.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.120
We know we're dealing
in thousands.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.220
So 6 times 30 is 180 plus 4x
is equal to 10 times 25, is

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.930
equal to 250.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.770
4x is equal to, what's
250 minus 180?

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.200
That's 50, and you have another
20, it's equal to 70.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.910
Then you have x is equal to,
let's see, 4 goes into 70,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.240
130, goes into it 7,
7 times 4 is 28.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.070
Goes into 20 5 times,
and the decimal.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.260
So 17.5, and we're dealing with
thousands, so $17,500.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.970
That's choice C.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.200
Problem 102.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:34.350
If T is equal to 5/9 times K
minus 32, and T is equal to

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.020
290, then what is K equal to?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.660
This is kind of one of
those speed problems.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.260
So we have 290 is equal to
5/9 times K minus 32.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.700
So multiply both sides by 9/5,
you get 9/5 times 290 is equal

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.380
to K minus 32.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.070
So what's 290 divided by 5?

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.130
5 goes into 29 5 times,
25, 40, 58 times.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.450
So it's 9 times 58 is
equal to K minus 32.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:19.750
58 times 9, 8 times 9 is 72.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.950
5 times 9 is 45 plus 7 is 52.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.210
522.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.130
So 522 is equal to K minus 32.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:44.020
So K is equal to 522 plus 32,
which is equal to 554, Which

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.580
is choice D.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.100
After doing all that math, I
was afraid that I'd made a

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.880
careless mistake.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.300
But it's reassuring
to see that 554

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.660
is one of the choices.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.160
Problem 103.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.020
The water from one outlet
flowing at a constant rate can

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.620
fill a swimming pool
in 9 hours.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.610
So you could say 1 pool per
9 hours from 1 outlet.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.240
The water from a second outlet
flowing at a constant rate can

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.820
fill the same pool in 5 hours.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.190
So 1 pool in 5 hours, that's
the second one.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.630
If both outlets are used at the
same time, approximately

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.850
what is the number of hours
required to fill the pool?

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.750
So essentially, we can just
add their two rates.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:41.870
This one does 1/9 pool per hour,
plus 1/5 pool per hour.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.570
I just rewrote those two.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.295
So what's 1/9 plus 1/5?

00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:47.500
Let's find a common
denominator.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.120
45 I think is the first
common denominator.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.710
1/9 is 5 over 45.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.810
1/5 is 9 over 45.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:06.840
So together, they fill 5 plus
9 is 14/45 pool per hour.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.100
If you want to fill exactly
1 pool, so it's just like

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.100
production is equal to
rate times time.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.450
So now your production is, you
want to fill 1 pool, and you

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.150
can fill it at 14 over
45 pools per

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.750
hour, what is the time?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.190
Well the time is going to be
equal to 1/1 pool divided by

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:40.400
14/45 pools per hour, which is
equal to, 45/14-- 1 over a

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.850
fraction is just the
inverse of that

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.350
fraction-- so 45/14 hours.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.553
How many times does
14 going into 45?

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:54.190
14 goes into 45,
is it 3 times?

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.935
3 times 14 is 12, is 42.

00:07:58.935 --> 00:08:03.030
Then you have another 30.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.320
Well, I already see one of the
choices, 3 point something.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.310
But 14 goes into 30 2 times.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.650
2 times 14 is 28.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.250
Let's see if one of our choices
is already-- yes,

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.090
choice D is already close
enough to what we did.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.570
We don't have to do
any more math.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.150
So we get 3.2 hours.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.900
If we'd kept dividing,
we'd get 3.21.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.940
That's choice D.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.200
It's just a little confusing.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.780
The important thing
is to always get

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.910
it in terms of rate.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.700
Add the rate, and just remember
distance is equal to

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.400
rate times time, or production
is equal to rate times time.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.360
Don't let all these fractions
daunt you too much.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.602
Next problem.

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:39.659
I'm almost out of space.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.590
Problem 104.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.550
Diana bought a stereo for $530,
which was the retail

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.890
price, plus a 6% sales tax.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.470
So that is equal to 1.06 times
the retail, 6% percent more

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.570
than the retail.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.280
How much could she have saved
if she had bought the stereo

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.890
at the same retail price in a
neighboring state, where she

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.250
would have paid a
sales tax of 5%?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.880
So essentially we want to
figure out how much she

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.760
would've saved.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.460
So let's figure out what
the retail price was.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.950
So retail is equal to
530 divided by 1.06.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:32.890
1.06 goes into 530, it's a
decimal, add two 0's, shift

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.300
the decimal over to
the right twice.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.270
106 goes into it
5 times, right?

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:47.700
106 goes into 530 5 times.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:56.330
5 times 106, it's 530.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.220
OK, so the math here
was simple.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.280
so you have two 0's.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:07.310
So the retail price is $500.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.280
So she paid $30 in
tax, fair enough.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.270
If she went to the neighboring
state and paid 5%, how much

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.980
would she have paid in taxes?

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:24.800
So times 0.05, 5 times 5, well 5
times 500 is 2,500, plus two

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.000
decimals, so it's $25 in tax.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.980
So in the neighboring
state, she

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.250
would've paid $25 in taxes.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.350
She paid $30 in taxes.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.420
So she would have saved $5.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.855
So the choice is D.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.440
Let's just try to fit one more
problem in here, just so we

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.690
finish this page.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.720
They say, if a square mirror has
a 20 inch diagonal, what

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.300
was the approximate perimeter
of the mirror in inches?

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.550
Let's try to do that.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.060
That's not what I want to do.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.945
I have a square mirror,
it has a diagonal.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.340
That diagonal, they're telling
us, is 20 inches.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.330
It's a square, so all the
sides are the same.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.360
They want to know
its perimeter.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.430
So they want to know essentially
what 4x is equal

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.190
to if we add up all the sides.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.710
So what is x?

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.260
Well we just use Pythagorean
theorem.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.440
This is a right angle.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.010
So we know that x squared plus
x squared is equal to 20

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.710
squared, is equal to
the hypotenuse

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.520
squared, is equal to 400.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.670
2x squared is equal to 400.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.065
x squared is equal to 200.

00:11:41.065 --> 00:11:45.680
x is equal to the square
root of 200.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.540
They want to know
the perimeter.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.410
Well, it's going to
be 4 times that.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.820
So the perimeter is going to be
equal to 4 times the square

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.570
root of 200.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.990
Now this becomes an
approximation problem.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.350
So let's think about that.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:05.960
The square root of
200 is about 15.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.670
15 times 15 is 225.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.810
Yeah, I think 15 would be a
pretty good approximation.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.330
14 would also work.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.875
14, when you square
it, is 196.

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:24.690
14 times 14, 4 times 16 is 56.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.980
Then you have 140.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.910
So 14 is about as close as
you're going to get to 200.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.620
It's going to be someplace
between 14 and 15.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.850
So 14 times 4 is 40.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:44.010
So 4 times 4 is 16, it's 56.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.680
So it's going to be something
higher than 56.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.850
If we pick 14, it's 56.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.840
If we pick 15, it's 60.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.600
So someplace between 56 and 60
is going to be the perimeter

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.860
of that mirror.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.900
So it's one of the
choices B, 60.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.360
So that's going to be
the closest one.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.520
So I'd go with B.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.670
I'll see you in the
next video.
