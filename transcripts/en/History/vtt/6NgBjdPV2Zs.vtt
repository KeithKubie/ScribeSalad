00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.040
[music playing]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.710
NARRATOR: Hitachi
Province, Japan, 1803.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.540
Local fishermen on
the Harayadori Shore

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.380
spot an unusual craft
drifting in the distance.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.710
When the vessel washes
ashore, they are astonished

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.500
by what they witness.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.420
NICK POPE: This craft
was likened to the shape

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.580
of a Japanese incense burner.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.080
It is almost literally a
flying disk, a flying saucer.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.170
On the outside of this craft
were multiple small metal

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.330
plates, not too dissimilar
to heat-resistant tiles

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.920
that you'd find, say,
on a space shuttle.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.380
NICK REDFERN: A hatch opened,
and a young woman came out

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.710
of the craft dressed in clothes
that had never been seen

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.790
before, and speaking
a language that nobody

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.210
understood in the slightest.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.920
DAVID CHILDRESS: When they
looked inside the craft,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.120
they could see hieroglyphs
and strange writing

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.790
all inside of the craft.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.620
NICK POPE: The story of the
strange Utsuro-bune craft

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.120
appears in three
different Japanese texts.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.210
Even today, modern
historians struggle

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.540
to understand what this means.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.580
Nobody can really decipher this.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.120
DAVID CHILDRESS:
Japanese today are

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.620
very familiar with this
story, and to them, this

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.120
is a curious story of one of
the gods of their ancestry

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.330
who had somehow arrived
there on the island

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.460
in this mysterious
craft, and then departed.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.750
NARRATOR: Could the
Utsuro-bune incident

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.960
have marked the return of
extraterrestrial beings

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.830
that were present in
Japan in the distant past?

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.830
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.330
and claim further evidence
can be found by examining

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.080
a strange monolithic stone
that many believe was carved

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.000
to resemble the very craft
that have been visiting

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.210
Japan for thousands of years.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.040
Asuka Park, Japan, April, 2017.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.460
Does that say rock ship?

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.830
Masuda rock ship.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.620
Oh, all right.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.040
NARRATOR: Giorgio Tsoukalos
and ancient astronaut theorist

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.330
Takeharu Mikami set out to
examine Masuda-no-Iwafune,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.790
an 800-ton rock
structure that was carved

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.670
from a single piece of
granite, and resembles

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.000
no other architecture in Japan.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.460
Hey, check out this
square grid on the sides.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.040
I mean, this is something
that I've seen before

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.420
in India, in Mahabalipuram.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.420
And they had
something very similar

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.580
on the side of some of
their rocks, as well.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.040
I can't wait to see the top.
- Yeah.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040
[inaudible]
- Amazing.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.920
Oh, man.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.380
TAKEHARU MIKAMI: Whoa.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.920
[japanese]
- Wow.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.040
That is-- I mean, I've
never seen anything like it.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.080
NARRATOR: While some
researchers believe

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.500
the Masuda-no-Iwafune
megalith is a tomb,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.000
others claim it
is meant to depict

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.880
the sky boats that are described
in ancient Japanese stories.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.710
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: So the idea
is that this was the entrance

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.920
to a Buddhist temple.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.920
What do they mean by that?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.540
Inside-- I mean, where?

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.420
TAKEHARU MIKAMI: It would
actually predate Buddhism

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.460
in Japan, so it
wouldn't have anything

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.960
to do with Buddhist temples.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.580
Right, so what is
the actual translation

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.920
of Masuda-no-Iwafune?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.460
[speaking japanese]

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.080
Masuda is the
name of a region,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.960
and Iwafune literally means
stone ship, or a rock ship.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.710
OK.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.290
MAN: [speaking japanese]
TAKEHARU MIKAMI: Yes.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.380
It's naturally the
Iwafune or the rock ship

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.080
would have come down
from the heavens

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.500
as a vehicle for the gods
to descend upon earth.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.170
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: So I
guess with the combination

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.580
of those mythologies
of celestial beings,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.000
this could be some type
of representation of one

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.120
of those flying vehicles
that our ancestors

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.330
perhaps witnessed.
