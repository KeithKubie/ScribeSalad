00:00:00.576 --> 00:00:02.770
- [Voiceover] So I have this
big rectangle here that's

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.592
divided into four smaller
rectangles, and what I wanna

00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:09.238
do is I wanna express the
area of this larger rectangle

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:10.933
and I wanna do it two ways.

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.591
The first way I wanna
express it as the product

00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.969
of two binomials and
then I wanna express it

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:20.313
as a trinomial, so let's
think about this a little bit.

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:23.447
So one way to say well look,
the height of this larger

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:27.951
rectangle from here to here,
we see that that distance is x,

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:30.528
and then from here to here it's two,

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:33.512
so the entire height right over here,

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:38.133
the entire height right over
here is going to be x plus two.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:42.033
So the height is x plus
two, and what's the width?

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:46.908
Well the width is, we go
from there to there is x,

00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:50.446
and then from there to there is three,

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.521
so the entire width is x plus three.

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:55.239
x plus three.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.365
So just like that, I've
expressed the area of the

00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:01.126
entire rectangle, and it's
the product of two binomials.

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:03.901
But now let's express it as a trinomial.

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:06.559
Well to do that, we can
break down the larger area

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:09.624
into the areas of each of
these smaller rectangles.

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:13.223
So what's the area of this
purple rectangle right over here?

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:15.777
Well the purple rectangle, its height is x

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:20.502
and its width is x, so
its area is x squared.

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:23.520
Let me write that, that's x squared.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.235
What's the area of this yellow rectangle?

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:30.799
Well it's height is x, same
height as right over here,

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.316
its height is x and its width is three,

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:38.843
so it's gonna be x times three, or 3x.

00:01:38.843 --> 00:01:41.258
It'll have an area of 3x.

00:01:41.258 --> 00:01:44.115
So that area is 3x, if
we're summing up the area

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:47.156
of the entire thing,
this would be plus 3x.

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:49.083
So this expression right
over here, that's the area

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.241
of this purple region, plus
the area of this yellow region,

00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.156
and then we can move on
to this green region.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.083
What's the area going to be here?

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:58.893
Well the height is two and the width is x,

00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:03.235
so multiply height times
width is gonna be two times x,

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:07.356
and we can just add
that, plus two times x,

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:10.757
and then finally this
little grey box here.

00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:13.578
Its height is two, we see
that right over there,

00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:18.321
its height is two, and its width is three,

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.920
we see it right over there,
so it has an area of six.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.661
Two times three.

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.274
So plus six, and you might say
well this isn't a trinomial,

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:28.455
this has four terms right over here,

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:31.219
but you might notice that we can add,

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.574
that we can add these middle two terms,

00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:38.520
3x plus 2x, if I have three
x's and I add two x's to that,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.518
I'm gonna have five x's.

00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:44.941
So this entire thing
simplifies to x squared,

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:49.886
x squared plus 5x plus six.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:51.646
Plus six.

00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:54.978
So this and this are two
ways of expressing the area,

00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:57.323
so they're going to be
equal, and that makes sense

00:02:57.323 --> 00:02:59.667
'cause if you multiply
it out, these binomials,

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:01.757
and simplify it, you
would get this trinomial,

00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:03.022
and we can do that really fast.

00:03:03.022 --> 00:03:06.285
You multiply the x times the
x, actually let me do that

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.747
in the same colors.

00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:11.632
You multiply the x times the x,

00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:13.907
you get the x squared.

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:18.046
You multiply this x times the three,

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:20.565
you get your 3x.

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:24.792
You multiply the two times the x,

00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:26.775
you get your 2x.

00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:31.176
And then you multiply
the two times the three

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.591
and you get your six.

00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:36.330
So what this, I guess you
can say this area model

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.918
does for us is it hopefully
makes a visual representation

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:43.760
of why it makes sense to
multiply binomials the way we do,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.711
and in other videos we talk
about it as applying the

00:03:45.711 --> 00:03:48.890
distribution property
twice, but this gives you

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.073
a more visual representation for

00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:53.723
why it actually makes sense.
