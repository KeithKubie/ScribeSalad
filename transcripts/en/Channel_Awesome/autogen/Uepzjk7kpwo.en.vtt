00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
complexities going on here then um it
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.180 align:start position:0%

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
more it gives the villains a little bit
 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
more it gives the villains a little bit
more<00:06:50.610><c> of</c><00:06:50.670><c> a</c><00:06:50.700><c> personality</c><00:06:51.120><c> outside</c><00:06:51.840><c> of</c><00:06:52.080><c> just</c>

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 align:start position:0%
going after them it gives them a little
 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.090 align:start position:0%
going after them it gives them a little
bit<00:06:57.000><c> more</c><00:06:57.150><c> of</c><00:06:57.240><c> a</c><00:06:57.330><c> life</c><00:06:57.540><c> and</c><00:06:58.290><c> when</c><00:06:58.830><c> you</c><00:06:58.920><c> do</c><00:06:59.070><c> that</c>

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
bit more of a life and when you do that
 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
bit more of a life and when you do that
it<00:06:59.430><c> just</c><00:06:59.640><c> makes</c><00:06:59.790><c> the</c><00:06:59.940><c> world</c><00:07:00.120><c> more</c><00:07:00.270><c> believable</c>
