00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.884
 In some of the previous videos already 

00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:03.858
 we talked about enzymes but in this video 

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:06.736
 I want to focus 

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:09.949
 of some of the "actors" who help the enzymes. 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.567
 First, make a quick review. 

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.493
 Enzymes help the reactions to take place, 

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:18.486
 they lower their activating energy and help them 

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:21.574
 to run more often or faster. 

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:24.198
 We've already seen some examples of enzymes 

00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:26.776
 and to clarify things, 

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.283
 sometimes in textbooks you can see the enzymes, 

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:31.070
 depicted here. 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.461
 This is called an enzyme. 

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:36.441
 This is called an enzyme 

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:39.759
 and it is said, 

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:41.812
 that it interacts 

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:43.879
 with a substrate here. 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.435
 It will affect the substrate. 

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:48.986
 This is a very abstract idea presented in a textbook - 

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:52.331
 to illustrate that the substrate and the enzyme fit like a key and a lock. 

00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.863
 But they do not look like this 

00:00:53.863 --> 00:00:55.605
 in the biological system. 

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.485
 We have to remember that when we talk about enzymes, 

00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:00.180
 it's about proteins. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.918
 There are also RNA enzymes called ribozymes, 

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:06.588
 but most of the enzymes 

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:08.864
 are proteins. 

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:11.440
 We have long talked about proteins, their structure, 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.808
 they are polypeptides, 

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:16.503
 different side chains of amino acids 

00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:19.400
 determine the folding of proteins in different ways. 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.377
 A better image of an enzyme would be something like this, 

00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:26.325
 as this protein, which is folded in various ways, 

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.623
 maybe there are alpha-helices here, 

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:30.782
 maybe there are beta-folded sheets here. 

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:33.754
 It looks like this strange structure. 

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:35.891
 A substrate may be any kind of molecule, 

00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:40.837
 which is attached to the protein. 

00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:43.784
 You see some examples here. 

00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:46.781
 This is actually a model of hexokinase 

00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:49.613
 and you can see a little of the ATP 

00:01:49.613 --> 00:01:51.912
 here's a little harder to see 

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:54.722
 the glucose to be phosphorylated. 

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:57.276
 The phosphorylation reaction will be helped by this great 

00:01:57.276 --> 00:01:59.784
 protein structure, hexokinase. 

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:01.814
 In this video we will pay attention to that 

00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:04.362
 when talking about enzyme and about 

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:07.023
 proteins, talk about amino acid chains, 

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:09.717
 but there are often other parts of the enzyme, 

00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:11.668
 which are not proteins. 

00:02:11.668 --> 00:02:14.338
 Even when we talked about hexokinases 

00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:16.962
 and for phosphorylation of glucose, 

00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:19.887
 we said that the enzyme lowers the activating energy 

00:02:19.887 --> 00:02:23.629
 thanks to positive magnesium ions. 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.187
 These positive magnesium ions 

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:28.825
 can hold the electrons of the phosphate groups 

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:32.192
 busy, pull them, so 

00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:35.930
 the hydroxyl group may be linked thereto 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.625
 with this phosphate without its electrons 

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:38.995
 obstruct. 

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:42.153
 In fact, these magnesium ions here, 

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:45.288
 are not officially considered part of the protein. 

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:48.190
 They are called cofactors. 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.836
 We can have a cofactor here, 

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:55.969
 to be bound to the border protein. 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.244
 Cofactor is needed 

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.775
 for the reaction, it plays a very important role. 

00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:03.978
 Another drawing you can see in textbooks, 

00:03:03.978 --> 00:03:06.673
 is something like this. It is said that 

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:09.204
 in order for the reaction to proceed 

00:03:09.204 --> 00:03:11.943
 a substrate and cofactor is required. 

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:14.080
 Cofactor. 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.121
 It sounds like a complex word, 

00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:20.790
 but simply means the non-protein part of the enzyme. 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.248
 The cofactor may be another molecule, ion or atom, which 

00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:27.779
 helps the enzyme perform its function. 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.123
 The cofactor is not part of an amino acid 

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:34.373
 either by a side chain or by a protein. 

00:03:34.373 --> 00:03:35.604
 But it is another element that is needed 

00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:37.925
 for catalysing the reaction. 

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.835
 We saw that we had hexokinase 

00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:44.656
 magnesium ions that the complex receives. 

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:47.607
 So when people talk about vitamins 

00:03:47.607 --> 00:03:49.766
 and minerals, many of the vitamins and minerals 

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:54.526
 function as cofactors in enzymes. 

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.987
 As you can see on this drawing 

00:03:56.987 --> 00:04:00.469
 or according to what I have read, these magnesium ions, 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.720
 green-colored cofactors. 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.459
 These are cofactors. 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.057
 Cofactor is the non-protein part of the enzyme. 

00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:14.890
 Now we can make a subdivision of cofactors. 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.653
 We can divide them into organic 

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:20.142
 and inorganic cofactors. 

00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:25.035
 We saw inorganic cofactors, 

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:27.822
 these magnesium ions, 

00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:29.913
 but there may also be sodium ions, calcium ions, 

00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:32.164
 as well as many other types of ions that play cofactors. 

00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:35.717
 They often "distract" the electrons and keep them busy, 

00:04:35.717 --> 00:04:37.668
 for a reaction to occur. 

00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:39.107
 There may also be organic cofactors. 

00:04:39.107 --> 00:04:41.986
 There may also be organic molecules. 

00:04:41.986 --> 00:04:44.054
 Remember Organic Molecules 

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:45.540
 contain carbon, 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.328
 chains of carbon and other atoms. 

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:50.741
 A cofactors, which are organic molecules, 

00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.054
 we call coenzymes. 

00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:54.771
 Coenzymes. 

00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:58.134
 There are many examples of coenzymes. 

00:04:58.134 --> 00:05:00.787
 This is it 

00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:03.967
 the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. 

00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:06.206
 He has coenzyme, 

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:09.294
 which you will often see when dealing with biology. 

00:05:09.294 --> 00:05:12.359
 This is NAD. 

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:15.841
 Note that this is not just an ion but a whole molecule. 

00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.348
 It contains carbon and we call it an organic molecule. 

00:05:18.348 --> 00:05:22.550
 OAD is not a protein, 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.341
 is not part of the amino acids that make up the proteins, 

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.015
 this makes him a cofactor. 

00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:29.661
 And because it's a whole organic molecule, 

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.495
 we call it coenzyme. 

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:34.956
 Coenzyme 

00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:37.905
 But like any other cofactor, 

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:39.762
 it allows the enzyme 

00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:41.991
 to perform its function and to support the reaction. 

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:45.103
 You will meet quite often 

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:46.518
 coenzyme NAD. 

00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:49.885
 It helps with the transport of hydrogen anions. 

00:05:49.885 --> 00:05:53.044
 Hydrogen ions never exist alone, or at least very rarely, 

00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:55.203
 they represent a hydrogen atom with an additional electron, 

00:05:55.203 --> 00:05:58.918
 so they get a negative charge. 

00:05:58.918 --> 00:06:02.603
 It helps to transfer this group 

00:06:03.443 --> 00:06:06.435
 from or to a substrate, 

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:09.361
 as ND 

00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:14.121
 can accept a hydrogen anion and become a NAD. 

00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:16.170
 If you can see his structure, 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.656
 is actually remarkable. 

00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:19.304
 Maybe I will make a whole separate video for NAD, 

00:06:19.304 --> 00:06:21.162
 because in so many textbooks I have seen only the letters 

00:06:21.162 --> 00:06:24.157
 OAD and NAD, but I have always wondered what this compound actually is. 

00:06:24.157 --> 00:06:25.876
 NAD is a remarkable molecule. 

00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.431
 What he does is take 

00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:29.938
 the hydrogen anion is here, 

00:06:29.938 --> 00:06:32.006
 at this carbon atom, another bond may be formed 

00:06:32.006 --> 00:06:34.931
 with hydrogen, I'll do this in another video. 

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:36.695
 I will show the mechanism. 

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.228
 This is a very cool molecule. 

00:06:38.228 --> 00:06:39.459
 This is a very cool molecule. 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:41.363
 Remember, the theme of this video is coenzymes, 

00:06:41.363 --> 00:06:43.824
 but we see similar trends in biology as a whole. 

00:06:43.824 --> 00:06:48.467
 The name of NAD - nicotinamidadinedinucleotide 

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:50.976
 describes the molecule. 

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:55.976
 Nicotinamide - here below 

00:06:56.027 --> 00:07:01.027
 is that part of the molecule, 

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:03.987
 this is the part that can take or give up a hydrogen ion. 

00:07:03.987 --> 00:07:07.028
 We can say that this is the active part of the molecule. 

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:11.487
 Adenin, our good old friend adenine, who meets in DNA, 

00:07:11.487 --> 00:07:15.898
 RNA and ATP. It is 

00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:18.871
 our good old adenine friend here. 

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:21.593
 Finally we have a dinucleotide because 

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:23.635
 the molecule contains two nucleotides, 

00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:25.494
 connected through their phosphate groups. 

00:07:25.494 --> 00:07:27.188
 Let's think about it. 

00:07:27.188 --> 00:07:28.721
 We have adenine here, 

00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:30.811
 we have a ribose and a phosphate group. 

00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:35.527
 If we only look at this part, 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.307
 which I fenced, 

00:07:39.307 --> 00:07:41.815
 we see the building unit, 

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:46.621
 of RNA, 

00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:48.643
 if we have adenine here. 

00:07:48.643 --> 00:07:53.078
 If we include all this, 

00:07:53.078 --> 00:07:56.770
 if we include all this here, 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.951
 we have ADP. The reason to call it a dinucleotide 

00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:01.762
 is that it can be separated in another way. 

00:08:01.762 --> 00:08:04.479
 We can say that we have one nucleotide, 

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:08.635
 which has nicotinamide here, 

00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:11.722
 it is one of the nucleotides, 

00:08:11.722 --> 00:08:14.533
 and the other nucleotide is here, 

00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:17.250
 he has adenine. 

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.479
 That's why it's called the dinucleotide. 

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:22.659
 I hope this made NAD a less mysterious molecule. 

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:25.330
 We will see it often in the future, 

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.350
 but I like to look at its structure, 

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.998
 because it consists of all those components that 

00:08:28.998 --> 00:08:30.460
 we'll see again and again, we'll see them at the ATF, 

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.667
 in RNA, over and over again. 

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:36.916
 But NAD is not the only cofactor or coenzyme. 

00:08:37.896 --> 00:08:39.834
 There are many others, actually when someone tells you 

00:08:39.834 --> 00:08:41.096
 to drink your vitamins or minerals, 

00:08:41.096 --> 00:08:43.162
 is because they function as cofactors. 

00:08:43.162 --> 00:08:45.530
 Vitamin C is a very important cofactor 

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.528
 for enzymes. 

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:48.619
 I will not go into detail 

00:08:48.619 --> 00:08:49.919
 for all its different functions. 

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.614
 These are two different images of vitamin C. 

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.797
 Spatial model and model of spheres and sticks 

00:08:53.797 --> 00:08:55.491
 right here. 

00:08:55.491 --> 00:08:58.278
 Folic acid, again, two different models are shown. 

00:08:58.278 --> 00:09:02.532
 Both folic acid and vitamin C are coenzymes, 

00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:05.455
 if we have a protein here, 

00:09:05.455 --> 00:09:09.006
 with its very complex structure, 

00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:12.444
 we also have substrates, but to help - 

00:09:12.444 --> 00:09:14.905
 I will make the substrates in another color. 

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:18.198
 We have substrates, 

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:20.080
 these are the molecules whose reaction is the enzyme 

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.682
 tries to catalyze. 

00:09:21.682 --> 00:09:23.980
 But we may also have ions, 

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.210
 you may think about the ions 

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.438
 as for 

00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:34.070
 cofactors, and we may also have organic cofactors 

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.503
 such as vitamin C for example. 

00:09:37.503 --> 00:09:41.287
 Cofactors also support the mechanism 

00:09:41.287 --> 00:09:43.516
 or to support the reaction. 

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.908
 Cofactors can help 

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:48.834
 charge stabilization can 

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:51.318
 to accept an electron or to give an electron, 

00:09:51.318 --> 00:09:52.897
 can have a variety of features. 

00:09:52.897 --> 00:09:56.473
 They can also be part of the response mechanism.
