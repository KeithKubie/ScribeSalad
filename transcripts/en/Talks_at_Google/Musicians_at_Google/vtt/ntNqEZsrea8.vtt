Commentator: Hi everybody.
Thanks for coming out today.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.300
It's a great honor for me to be up
here and, and present our artist today.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.433
He's, he's known as simply the voice of South
Africa and he's been a great inspiration to me

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:17.834
and I'm, I'm sure a number of you as well
as many throughout South Africa and,

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.166

I'll be taking you through

and, yeah, I guess after that
we can have maybe questions also.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.000
The song that I'm going to play for you
I'll sort of explain to you after

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000

Vusi Mahlasela: Thank you very much.

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:29.667
Yeah. The song I was singing
is titled Ubuhle Bomhlaba

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:35.633
meaning the beauty of our land,
or may I say the beauty of our country.

00:08:35.633 --> 00:08:38.934
Here it wasn't only just singing about
the beauty of my country or the land,

00:08:38.934 --> 00:08:46.100
but also about quite a lot of things which
were very disturbing and very sad you know.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.900
To sort of like really witness that through
the time when it was really quite a lot of time

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:58.333
when in, in South Africa and Apartheid
where we also witnessed the police brutality,

00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:03.900
police playing with our dead corpses,
thinking that we don't know about it is;

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.633
and here in this song I'm saying we will call
them and teach them about those corpses;

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:13.066
and if they agree we will forgive them.

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:16.934
But if they don't, we will expose them.

00:09:16.934 --> 00:09:20.166
And of course this was written long
before we were putting that to work

00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:26.367
or going to have you know the truth and
reconciliation in South Africa, if you remember.

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:30.467
The truth and reconciliation were just
something that of course it was championed

00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:32.700
by our grandfathers of humanity,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.934
Archbishop Desmond Tutu;

00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:39.934
people who also were talking
about the wisdom of forgiveness:

00:09:39.934 --> 00:09:42.834
Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
Dr. Nelson Mandela

00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:45.834
and the man who lived in South Africa
many years

00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:51.567
and planted a seed of reconciliation,
Mr. Mahatma Ghandi.

00:09:51.567 --> 00:09:56.967
These are the grandfathers of humanity who
taught us that there is wisdom in forgiveness.

00:09:56.967 --> 00:10:00.967
That if you learn to forgive you
learn more to be free.

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:04.867
You know to [inaudible] calmness within the
inner most of yourself and become more free.

00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:07.967
But if you don't forgive,
you are your own prisoner.

00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:11.367
If you don't forgive you are the one
who's suffering the most.

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:14.133
You will become like a bitter leaf
that can just be squashed

00:10:14.133 --> 00:10:16.233
or be swept away by the wind anytime.

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:21.100
So forgiveness is very important and
we should all wear it like a crown.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.400
Thank you.

00:10:27.367 --> 00:10:42.367

okay, the song will explain itself,

00:19:00.834 --> 00:19:05.934
They lived in a dry land where there
was quite a lot of hunger and drought

00:19:05.934 --> 00:19:13.467
and the other birds that didn't have wings
and the other one no eyes.

00:19:13.467 --> 00:19:17.133

come up with a plan here.

It can't just be in stuff,
you know we have to do something."

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.300
And the other bird said: "Okay. Fine. Yeah.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:29.033
We'll have to do this and fly somewhere,
so I'll be your wings and you'll be my eyes."

I felt of course at that time

00:23:57.533 --> 00:24:04.467
I was writing it to some of my friends
who left the country

00:24:04.467 --> 00:24:07.900

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:17.200

I just wondered, would, would love

00:47:08.967 --> 00:47:16.066
something about the role of music
in the struggle against Aparteid.

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:19.734
Vusi Mahlasela: Oh, Yeah.

00:47:19.734 --> 00:47:25.800
Music played quite a lot of a role
during the time of struggle in South Africa,

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:25.967
even before myself was born.

00:47:25.967 --> 00:47:29.433
It didn't before myself I was born.

00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:32.633
There was quite a lot of music.

00:47:32.633 --> 00:47:38.200
Those organizations from the BC,
Black Consciousness Movement,

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.900
example, up until it was like the UTF
and the unions and all that,

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.767
there was just more drive of
the music and all that.

00:47:47.767 --> 00:47:51.333
I don't know, if you have seen
the, the film called "[inaudible]".

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:58.567
The struggle was engaged in four parts:
music, theater, writing.

00:47:58.567 --> 00:48:03.934
And of course

00:48:03.934 --> 00:48:06.567
when I, when I was born,
when I was young,

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:12.867
for me I didn't know that there was like trouble
in my country of injustice and so on.

00:48:12.867 --> 00:48:17.767
So I came to realize this in 1976
when the students of South Africa

00:48:17.767 --> 00:48:22.433
by [inaudible] to the language of Africans [inaudible] of oppression.

00:48:22.433 --> 00:48:25.367
Where the students wanted to
speak to the government

00:48:25.367 --> 00:48:28.500
and the answer was more bullets,
more bullets, more bullets.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:33.834
I was eleven years old and this
escalated to other townships as well.

00:48:33.834 --> 00:48:37.900
I remember in one [inaudible] it was
on the twenty-first of June.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.834
And there was this people marching and
a lot of music and chanting and everything

00:48:41.834 --> 00:48:43.333
and I was like: "Wow."

00:48:43.333 --> 00:48:48.400
You know and I tried to ask questions
and yeah,

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:52.700
that's when my first political education started.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.133
And there was just quite a lot
of music all over and everything.

00:48:56.133 --> 00:49:01.633
And apart from that there has been
music that I've been hearing at home

00:49:01.633 --> 00:49:05.667
because my grandmother owned a [inaudible]
what you call the speakeasy here

00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:08.166
or I think yeah, pub.

00:49:08.166 --> 00:49:12.367
And of course there'll be some songs
that I would hear as people

00:49:12.367 --> 00:49:15.967
who would be singing in the backyard
and also [inaudible]

00:49:15.967 --> 00:49:20.567
that was not allowed to be sung
around that time.

00:49:20.567 --> 00:49:23.700
So music in many different ways
played quite,

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.667
it played quite a lot of role to
encourage people to stand up,

00:49:28.667 --> 00:49:31.000
realize what
was really happening to them.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.467
Through the message on the song it was telling
them what was happening around that time

00:49:35.467 --> 00:49:37.600
and what they have to do.

00:49:41.433 --> 00:49:44.700
Q: I was gonna ask about the languages
that you're singing in

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.166
and how many different languages,
you, you typically do sing in

00:49:48.166 --> 00:49:51.533
and, or how many you speak and how -

00:49:51.533 --> 00:49:54.333
you think about which, which languages
to use where in your songs

00:49:54.333 --> 00:49:56.467
and how to, how to mix them together.

00:49:56.467 --> 00:49:58.734
Vusi Mahlasela: Well I sing
in several languages in my music

00:49:58.734 --> 00:50:03.600
and you know we have eleven official languages,

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.834
but still there are other languages
that people speak in the country

00:50:07.834 --> 00:50:09.700
which are more dialects to other languages,

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.000
but you don't find that in a book form or in print.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.333
And of course when I maybe compose for them,

00:50:19.333 --> 00:50:23.100
it depends what comes first,
whether music or [laughs]

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.700
and sometimes it's good when I can come,
I mean incorporate both,

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.967
you know, the same time.

00:50:28.967 --> 00:50:32.900
But sometimes it's just that the message
that you want to bring across

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:38.033
through the subjects that you are sort
of talking about, the song or poem,

00:50:38.033 --> 00:50:41.467
whether you, you, you, you like it or not,

00:50:41.467 --> 00:50:44.467
you might feel that no, I want everybody
to hear this and everything,

00:50:44.467 --> 00:50:49.166
but you find that when you try to translate it
into English it doesn't work it looks,

00:50:49.166 --> 00:50:52.533
it loses the, the meaning.

00:50:52.533 --> 00:50:56.000
So rather [inaudible]

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.600
but it is something that maybe that's sort
of can work when I can order

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.934
and then I put it in English as well as
everybody or Kenyan, it's, it's okay.

00:51:04.934 --> 00:51:07.433
Those are some of the things that
one sort of like really find.

00:51:07.433 --> 00:51:11.166
And the song directs you
where they want to go,

00:51:11.166 --> 00:51:15.433
and you just have to pay respect and attention

00:51:15.433 --> 00:51:19.166
and follow the way the,
way they direct you.

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.433
Q: Hi. Can you tell us more about your work
in furthering education in Africa,

00:51:28.433 --> 00:51:35.233
and maybe the African Leadership Academy?

00:51:35.233 --> 00:51:39.467
Vusi Mahlasela: Yeah, there is a school
in South Africa which is called the Africa,

00:51:39.467 --> 00:51:42.333
African Leadership Academy.

00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:46.400
Well my role for, for the academy was more,

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.066
I, I performed, and at the opening years;
I think for the past two years.

00:51:52.066 --> 00:51:57.900
And also a friend of [inaudible ]
who is also sitting on the board.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.033
The guy who sort of like really started
the foundation,

00:52:01.033 --> 00:52:06.467
I mean the academy we met at a [inaudible]
conference in Arusha this time.

00:52:06.467 --> 00:52:10.767
And I think what is more important
about the African Leadership,

00:52:10.767 --> 00:52:18.934
Leadership Academy developing leaders
for tomorrow like Nelson Mandela.

00:52:18.934 --> 00:52:23.600
And I think with everything that
they were sort of like really [inaudible ]

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.967
so they have to hide back
and take it back to their,

00:52:26.967 --> 00:52:30.633
to their places where they come
from and all that.

00:52:30.633 --> 00:52:34.333
And I think maybe to explore
more coming to [ ]

00:52:34.333 --> 00:52:37.800
'cause that is maybe in universities like Stanford and so.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:42.500
But I think the African leadership
plays quite a lot,

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.800
important role in that cause.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:49.533
But I've been touring as well here in
schools and universities giving talks,

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:55.367
now going to classes those who are
doing music, arts and music,

00:52:55.367 --> 00:52:59.700
modern history, African history studies
other than the -

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:06.066
I feel also some of the students who are
in African Leadership Academy,

00:53:06.066 --> 00:53:09.233
no, what am I saying,
not African Leadership Academy,

00:53:09.233 --> 00:53:12.567
but that was my role this world now
to do these performances

00:53:12.567 --> 00:53:16.667
and going to colleges and universities
as well to share my points and stories

00:53:16.667 --> 00:53:20.400
in those classes I've mentioned.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.200
Yeah.

00:53:22.767 --> 00:53:24.266
Q: Thank you very much first of all
for the concert.

00:53:24.266 --> 00:53:25.567
I really enjoyed it.

00:53:25.567 --> 00:53:28.133
My question is really are you going to
be in the Bay area

00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:29.500
and having other concerts so friends of

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.266
mine can get a chance to hear you?

00:53:32.266 --> 00:53:34.000
Vusi Mahlasela: Are there
other concerts coming?

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.867
Q: Yeah, you know.

00:53:34.867 --> 00:53:40.533
Vusi Mahlasela: Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm going to
play at the Yoshi's in Oakland tomorrow.

00:53:40.533 --> 00:53:47.100
And then I'll be also in Seattle after that.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.367
And I've got a, a new CD
that I'll be recording.

00:53:50.367 --> 00:53:54.467
After I finish in Seattle I'm going to
Charlottesville in Virginia

00:53:54.467 --> 00:53:56.900
recording at Mr. Dave Matthews' studio.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.667
So and then [inaudible] will be producer
for the album.

00:54:00.667 --> 00:54:05.266
So the song that I play when I say
Africa will be one of the songs

00:54:05.266 --> 00:54:06.800
which are in the album.

00:54:10.834 --> 00:54:14.100
Q: Hi. My name is Finias
and I welcome you here.

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.967
It's, it was great to hear your music.

00:54:16.967 --> 00:54:20.166
I actually just had a question
regarding kind of the motivation,

00:54:20.166 --> 00:54:23.500
you touched on the aspect of African history

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.333
and you know keeping the word going

00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:28.300
and how the young people receiving
your music nowadays

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:33.533
and how do you try to depict that
information through your music

00:54:33.533 --> 00:54:38.333
with the current times and modern times
and the change in history?

00:54:38.333 --> 00:54:44.967
Vusi Mahlasela: Yeah. I think it, it is very much important that

00:54:44.967 --> 00:54:49.734
the youth today of course there's quite a lot of
things that they are really checking out,

00:54:49.734 --> 00:54:55.000
taking especially through technology which is, and the music that they are making

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.300
with some of the effects and everything
that they do,

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:02.433
but I think to check where the raw thing
comes from is very much important.

00:55:02.433 --> 00:55:06.633
Not only just about the music and then
perhaps the indigenous instruments

00:55:06.633 --> 00:55:09.000
which are sort of accompanying
or something like that,

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.133
but I think the message as well
is very much important.

00:55:13.133 --> 00:55:17.200
I think building up on that is like
after the post-Apartheid South Africa,

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.600
what I've witnessed is wild
and in sort of like a, the,

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:25.700
some kind of you know the ignorance
that you see in the youth forgetting

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:30.300
that the privileges and the rights
that they enjoy, they didn't just come by -

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.667
people fought for and died for.

00:55:31.667 --> 00:55:35.400
And therefore they need some kind
of a counter revolution in some way.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:40.200
And songs that say something about
where we come from,

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.000
how it had been so as to
make love today the future

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.533
is very much important that they hear this.

00:55:46.533 --> 00:55:53.367
And it, it's, with what I'm doing as well
going to, to schools and colleges

00:55:53.367 --> 00:55:57.967
and everything where the students are asking
questions and everything wanting to know,

00:55:57.967 --> 00:56:04.300
it is very much important because art, music it's very power.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:11.467
Through music you can sort of like really
bring out things that you want to address

00:56:11.467 --> 00:56:13.967
whereas other people are afraid to say it.

00:56:13.967 --> 00:56:17.266
But with the music you say it and freely without,

00:56:17.266 --> 00:56:20.633
or write whatever you like and nobody
sort of like,

00:56:20.633 --> 00:56:21.900
"No, you don't have to write that and do it."

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:26.100
And when people see you doing that they're,
"Ah. He can do that."

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:30.600
So then they have the courage to stand up
and do something about the situations

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.233
that they see or that they want to correct.

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.600
&gt;&gt;Q: Just a quick question
about your collaborations.

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:53.200
You've collaborated with some amazing
people and hearing your music today

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:59.066
it sounds very personal and very intimate
and you're telling a very profound story.

00:56:59.066 --> 00:57:03.233
I wonder with these collaborations with
like Paul Simon or Dave Matthews,

00:57:03.233 --> 00:57:07.967
how you establish that intimacy
or that connection with that artist

00:57:07.967 --> 00:57:11.600
in order to present that forward in a song?

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:16.767
Vusi Mahlasela: Well, it is more about
just bringing the musical energy

00:57:16.767 --> 00:57:19.200
it doesn't matter within whatever subject

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.133
and all that we sort of like really be
right in there in the song.

00:57:23.133 --> 00:57:28.533
It's just to collaborate and if it is a song
that the artist has chose that is very special,

00:57:28.533 --> 00:57:30.600
I want Vusi to come sing with me.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.400
I, I don't have a problem with that;

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.967
I've collaborated with many artists,
Mr. Warren Haynes

00:57:36.967 --> 00:57:40.600
a song called "Soulshine"
which I love the song.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:48.133
And Mr. Paul Simon also led me to play
and sing his songs like "Under African Skies",

00:57:48.133 --> 00:57:50.200
"Boy in the Bubble".

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:56.333
Then there, one artist also said,
"Look. Make the song your song.

00:57:56.333 --> 00:57:57.800
Give your own treatment.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.000
Don't worry that this is Paul
Simon's song or is whatever.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:01.967
Feel the music."

00:58:01.967 --> 00:58:03.300
Just, I, I love that.

00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.934
And then when they also sing my songs, it,

00:58:06.934 --> 00:58:08.500
it's also about that.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:13.066
And I think this is when politicians
make difference,

00:58:13.066 --> 00:58:18.100
participate that they can have collaboration to start our programs.

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.200
That will work.

00:58:25.233 --> 00:58:26.533
Q: Hi. Just, just one question from me.

00:58:26.533 --> 00:58:28.567
Thank you so much for your presentation.

00:58:28.567 --> 00:58:29.800
My name is Dennis.

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.533
I work with Google in the Nairobi office

00:58:32.533 --> 00:58:38.166
and I'm very passionate about
the role of language

00:58:38.166 --> 00:58:39.600
in the adoption of technology.

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:44.500
So as a follow up to the question
about the role of music,

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:49.867
and music in, in indigenous languages and how you express that

00:58:49.867 --> 00:58:52.834
and how that sort of gets people
into the struggle and that sort of thing.

00:58:52.834 --> 00:58:58.834
What, what do you see as the role
of local languages like Soto and

00:58:58.834 --> 00:59:03.300
so on getting more people
in South Africa to use technology,

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.734
to use the Internet,

00:59:06.734 --> 00:59:11.633
to express themselves and participate
more freely on the Internet?

00:59:11.633 --> 00:59:18.333
Vusi Mahlasela: Yeah. It is important
that people take proud,

00:59:18.333 --> 00:59:21.166
I mean take pride in what they are

00:59:21.166 --> 00:59:24.133
and especially in the language
that they speak.

00:59:24.133 --> 00:59:28.467
It was this African idiom which says
[speaking native language]

00:59:28.467 --> 00:59:32.166
which means a person is a language.

00:59:32.166 --> 00:59:36.467
And if you learn to speak other people's
language we learn more to understand them,

00:59:36.467 --> 00:59:40.433
to know them, to know their culture
and to love them.

00:59:40.433 --> 00:59:43.734
So language plays quite a lot of
important role in the society.

00:59:43.734 --> 00:59:49.767
And when you put a different language
in a song

00:59:49.767 --> 00:59:51.867
and then also collaborate and sing
with other people,

00:59:51.867 --> 00:59:54.867
we teach each other and
then it is like not about hate whatever;

00:59:54.867 --> 00:59:58.900
just to pick a safe song and people
are sort of like,

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.233
"What language are you singing about
and what it is about?"

01:00:01.233 --> 01:00:02.767
And it's really hard.

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:08.867
I read another book where the song lines
about from Aus--,

01:00:08.867 --> 01:00:13.533
it's about Australia and the aboriginal
languages where they have,

01:00:13.533 --> 01:00:18.300
they had this thing whereby
when you're traveled you learned.

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.867
They teach you a song in another
language and you have to travel

01:00:21.867 --> 01:00:24.734
until you come to a certain point
at another border;

01:00:24.734 --> 01:00:27.166
you get another people there,

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:29.734
they will teach you another song
in another language.

01:00:29.734 --> 01:00:35.033
So it teaches you how to travel in a way
you can get water to drink in the wells,

01:00:35.033 --> 01:00:38.133
but if you cannot study or learn the song,

01:00:38.133 --> 01:00:40.533
you won't be able to travel.
You will get lost.

01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:43.800
So you always have to, to learn
the language and different languages

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.700
everywhere you travel.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.367
So you see that the language plays
very much important role

01:00:47.367 --> 01:00:51.633
and there was a must that you have to learn
the language so that you may be able to travel.

01:00:51.633 --> 01:00:53.200
And I think this is what we need.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.533
Through technology and everything

01:00:54.533 --> 01:00:58.667
whatever just for that the language
that we can all like.

01:01:01.734 --> 01:01:04.800
Yeah. That's where immigrating
into a group or village,

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.900
the question is how much
do you want to belong?

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:12.300
I think the thing that will play important role
is the language that we have to learn,

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.567
each other's language and that way,
that way we can get by.

01:01:15.567 --> 01:01:16.767
Q: Wow. Okay, excellent.

01:01:16.767 --> 01:01:21.934
So does this mean you'll sing us a song
about using the Internet in sort of -

01:01:21.934 --> 01:01:23.867
Vusi Mahlasela: [laughs]

01:01:23.867 --> 01:01:29.367
Q: Well that's how you learn, right? So -
Vusi Mahlasela: [laughs] Thank you.

01:01:29.367 --> 01:01:31.867
Female voice: Thank you. On behalf of
Google and the Black Googler Network

01:01:31.867 --> 01:01:35.600
we thank you so much Vusi for sharing
your wonderful music with us.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.600
We appreciate all you Googlers for coming
and making time out of your busy days.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.834
I wanted to invite you all to remember
on 2/25, this Thursday,

01:01:42.834 --> 01:01:47.233
we'll be celebrating more African music
and food in Seville

01:01:47.233 --> 01:01:50.266
and just wrap this up and thank you
so much again for coming

01:01:50.266 --> 01:01:52.500
and thank you, Vusi, again.
It was wonderful.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.600
Vusi Mahlasela: Thank you.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.967
