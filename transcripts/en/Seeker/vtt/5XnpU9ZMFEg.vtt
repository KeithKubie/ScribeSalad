00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.290
Mars used to look a lot like Earth.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.849
The planet had a vast sea under oxygen rich
skies, and as far as we know, all the right

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.709
conditions for life.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.000
But while Earth was beginning to see its first
glimpse of life, Mars was losing its chance

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.339
of becoming a habitable world.

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:28.930
We don’t know why, but roughly 4.2 billion
years ago, Mars’s magnetic field disappeared.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.980
That magnetic field protected the young planet
from a constant barrage of solar winds ejected

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.670
from the sun, but once it was gone...

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:46.320
Mars’s warmer, rich atmosphere was blown
out of the solar system…

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.580
And all that’s left now, is the rocky, cold,
and uninhabitable planet we know today.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.410
But could we make Mars habitable again?

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.120
NASA might have a new strategy to do just
that.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.461
They theorize that by placing a large magnetic
dipole shield between Mars and the Sun, they

00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:09.430
can protect the planet from the Sun’s solar
winds and perhaps establish a new atmospheric

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.750
equilibrium.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.830
Mars would live in the dipole’s magnetotail
essentially restoring its lost magnetosphere,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.940
giving the planet a chance to reestablish
its long lost atmosphere.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.530
NASA’s simulations show that as the atmosphere
thickens, Mars’s climate would become 4

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.820
degrees Celsius warmer, enough to melt the
carbon dioxide ice at the polar cap.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.940
The carbon in the atmosphere would then trap
heat, creating a greenhouse effect that could

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.200
give Mars back its liquid water and allow
for a better chance of a habitable planet.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.070
This, of course, is theoretical, and seems
rather fanciful, but there is already research

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.670
underway into miniature magnetospheres that
may one day protect humans and spacecrafts

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.960
on deep space missions.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.350
So it’s not inconceivable to apply that
technology on a larger scale.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.910
And NASA has stated that if this can be achieved
in a lifetime, the colonization of Mars would

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.790
not be far away.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.269
Scientists are trying to predict the future
of our own protective magnetic shield.
