00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.200
 In your opinion, what is Brady? 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.160
 It's like a graph, or connected circuits? 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.740
 No, this is an ant. You can see the horns of the sensor here, then this is the body of the ant 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.700
 AHA OK 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.420
 We will place a place for consecutive individual integers starting with this ant 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.160
 So, what are these individual integers that begin with one? 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 Well, we need one, three, five, seven, nine 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.280
 We'll put them here 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.800
 So, what number do you want here? 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.140
 Seven 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.380
 Seven, here? 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.239
 three 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.580
 And here? 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.080
 One 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.800
 Let's put nine 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.440
 And ? 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.360
 five 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.280
 Well, this is an example of failure 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.040
 We'll look at five minus one. Equals four 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.580
 Eight minus one equals eight, three minus one equals two 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.819
 Everything looks different and looks good so far 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.419
 It is regrettable that seven minus three also equals four 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.909
 So our failure is an example of failure, your task is trying to make all these differences different 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.609
 If you put seven three and one nine five 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.779
 Then we will have four and eight 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.400
 And six 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.900
 And four. Oh wait no This is still a disaster, I wonder if this is even possible to fix the Ant for the most difficult to fail 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.079
 But I'm supposed to be successful here, okay 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.900
 Let's start, nine, one 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.739
 No, maybe I'll put seven on top 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.470
 Here, five here and three here, will this result? 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.549
 Yes this sounds good so this is nine minus one equals eight, seven minus one 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.509
 Equals six 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.509
 Four and two 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.320
 All are different 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.889
 We managed to reach the end 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.809
 So this is part of a problem that has not been resolved since 1967 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.680
 The tree is called graceful but belongs to all primary school curricula 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.290
 Each time they learn the proposition, so the general problem is given any number of connected circuits 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360
 So that bind is needed 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.940
 Any number you want to be connected to can be rings so it would be a minute insect to solve 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.739
 Let me show you an episode that you can ask to solve so that it can be solved or may not be resolved 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.049
 But it is certainly not an attractive guess of trees, the graceful tree guess is that there are no rings, right? 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.310
 Well, but why not try to solve this so we need one three five seven 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.960
 And nine in 2 and 2 here can be solved 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.760
 Considering the number of even numbers you can get, what is the largest number you can get as a difference between them? 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.530
 Eight, nine, and one, the biggest you can get is eight 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.970
 What is the second largest number you can get? Six Yes 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.839
 The third largest number four and then the last number is two only exists 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.619
 There are four different numbers you can get but how many lines do we have to achieve 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.550
 Our five lines have only 4 pairs to be distributed among these five lines 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.100
 So regardless of how to distribute 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.680
 These are individual numbers 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.309
 You'll end up with a duplicate so we have eight six four two 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.700
 And four again 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.089
 We ended up with repetition here 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.489
 So that this starfish can not be solved it will fail every time if we have n circles and n lines that connect them 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.629
 We will not be able to solve this, maybe we can solve M circuits 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.010
 In this case five circles are n minus one 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.510
 Maximum of four lines 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.859
 We can sometimes solve that, with five circles where you can solve it, you have a butterfly shape 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.849
 There are at least five lines and one connector, so this can be solved 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.489
 Five circuits and four connectors, do not know if this can be solved but may be able to resolve the intuitive agile tree 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.090
 Without including episodes, but this is still 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.919
 An interesting question I do not know is solving this. So the graceful tree intuition is one of the places where all your circles link 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.070
 If you do not have values ​​outside here and there are no loops 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.009
 So that is guaranteed if you have got n circles you will have n minus one links 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.740
 So here we have one two three four five six circles, one two three four five six lines 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.389
 This is not resolved whether n is four circles 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.690
 And n minus 1 lines 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.240
 Where there are no rings 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.510
 You can always put 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.639
 Individual cascading integers are there 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.639
 So that the difference between 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.269
 All the circuits connected to all those differences are different 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.820
 Unless it is certainly confirmed and intended for the old designs of the graceful tree 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.060
 Oh yes to everyone 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.130
 Insects or all the trees that are interested in its design, so this question has been solved by designing seven circles and this is an example 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.619
 On seven circuits and six connected lines, there are already 11 different ways you can do 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.130
 As well as here we have 11 different ways to make all seven circles 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.330
 Connected without loops 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
 What is not resolved? 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.940
 Go for more circles if you draw 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.060
 30 or 40 departments 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.090
 Are all these solvable? 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:13.039
 This was an open guess since 1967. 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.250
 To what number of circles have been resolved? 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:30.079
 There are individual cases that have been resolved, for example: I can put the circle in the middle and I can add any number 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.500
 Of the overseas circuits you want 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.970
 And this is always solvable and I can easily prove that I can put one number in the middle and then move to three five seven nine eleven thirteen fifteen seventeen twenty one twenty-three 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:54.379
 You can imagine that I can stay here and this is always solvable, because these differences are always different. I can also put 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.189
 The largest number in the middle of twenty-three can be in the middle and then I can distribute 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.600
 Other numbers everywhere are solvable Another example: Another example of a species that can always be solved 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.669
 Are snakes so you can imagine a snake of any length you want 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.690
 These are always solvable you may want to try and you can start with one 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.389
 And then you can go to the biggest one I'll just take and I'll move on to one three 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.679
 Five seven and then I will return nine 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.060
 Eleven Thirteen 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.060
 Here, we have teams 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.310
 Of twelve teams of ten teams of eight 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.869
 Teams of six teams of four and teams of two 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.229
 All snakes can be solvable only by repeating this pattern there are so many species out there 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:51.799
 Not all of them are a snake to be assembled by the starfish 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:59.119
 There are so many species that you can easily create and explore new species for example what happens if we have 

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:05.509
 A crazy thing you know about marine stars that have joined the long, long chain 

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:11.929
 If you can imagine for a solution that these can be very complicated very quickly 

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:18.019
 Most species have up to forty circuits for most of those insects 

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.969
 Very difficult to solve, supposed to be good if this question is still unanswered 

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.339
 This means that there is still a type of tree found to be definitely insoluble 

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.859
 Because that would ruin it, that's right 

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.770
 We did not find an example that did not work, but that does not mean it does not exist 

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.479
 There are many mathematicians who believe 

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:48.689
 That tree exists that there is a tree that can not be solved. Would you be happy or sad if it is found solved? 

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:54.929
 I would be thrilled to have found it solved because I do this with primary school children 

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:02.400
 After a week of struggle to find the solution I love to say 

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.930
 We found it! 

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.450
 But it seems 

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.720
 As if nature tells us that it can always be solved as if it looks like 

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.349
 Something nice as it looks like it will break something nice 

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:21.960
 Well, it has already been broken if you look beyond the intuitive tree to make the rings available 

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960
 So we have seven circles 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.509
 Six connectors so that these connectors can not be broken in a way that is already broken but interesting 

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.089
 That work with types that fail with the types 

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.399
 I love that . 

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.399
