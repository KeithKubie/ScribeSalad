00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:05.180
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Without further ado, I'd
like to introduce David Crane from Google

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.660
Ventures.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.140
[applause]

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.349
&gt;&gt;DAVID CRANE: Good late morning/ early afternoon.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.170
Thanks to everybody for coming to Google and
convening together around what's guaranteed

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.910
to be a super exciting screening of a very,
very important documentary.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.661
I think we're brought together today because
something called the "Global Employee Resource

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.340
Group Summit" has been taking place for the
last couple days.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.820
I'm reading my cue notes here, as you can
tell.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.820
This is an important activity, though.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.300
This is a group of Googlers that have come
together to focus attention and time on planning,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.480
leadership development, and relationship-building,
all organized around diversity.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.010
I've been at Google a dozen years and one
of the sources of great personal pride is

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.420
watching this diversity initiative first be
dreamed up and then actually built, scaled,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.420
and executed.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.470
And I'm so proud of what my colleagues do
in all areas of diversity, particularly in

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.370
this one area that we're spending some time
paying attention to today.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.630
This documentary--this is, I think, a multi-year
project at CNN.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.659
We're in the fourth year.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.240
This particular program, as you will soon
see, I had a small participation role.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.079
I spent some time being able to see a number
of very inspired, very talented entrepreneurs

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.750
that spent a summer at Silicon Valley chasing
their dreams and trying to understand whether

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.460
they could turn those dreams into businesses.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.929
It was a pleasure to see them, to interact
with them, to see their first pitches, their

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.819
first public articulations of what they're
doing.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.159
And in just a few minutes, you're gonna see
the output of an interesting project that

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.549
CNN has invested in to chronicle this journey,
to illustrate some of their challenges, some

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.750
of their successes.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.139
As soon as the documentary is over, there
will be a very interesting panel discussion

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:44.810
led by a few folks that are sitting up here.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.359
So please stick around.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.609
Without further ado, let's roll that video.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.039
Thank you.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.039
[applause]

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.999
&gt;&gt;Michelle Thornton: So, we expect you're
gonna tell everyone to watch, right?

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.999
November 13th?

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.999
OK.

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.999
Great.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.999
I'm Michelle Thornton.

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.999
I work for CNN.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.999
I get to hang out with Soledad sometimes.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.890
I try not to stand too close 'cause she always
tries to look kinda cute.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.190
[laughter]

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.100
And I have, or at least, my job at CNN is
to monetize content like this because it's

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.500
important for two reasons.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500
One, of course, funding.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.370
That's what this conversation is about.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.290
But advertisers wanna have this conversation
with you guys.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.680
You guys are consumers.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.490
And they wanna let you know they respect content
like this.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.780
The other reason I wanna do it--let me tell
you--I never get to wear blue jeans at CNN,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.780
OK?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.780
[laughter]

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.969
So, thank you so much for hosting this.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.829
When LaFawn Bailey calls, we say yes.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.650
We don't ask what it is.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.319
But in all seriousness, we don't see conversations
like this, right?

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.640
We see comedy and we see other genres.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.599
But we don't see real conversations about
real serious topics.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.370
So, we want you to support and watch and tweet
and Google+ [laughter] this type of content.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.310
So, I have the privilege today to introduce
all of the panelists.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.250
I was told by my good friend Soledad to tell
you that this wasn't the ending.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.930
So, there is a cliffhanger.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.219
So you'll get to see, hopefully, some good
news.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.109
Our moderator, Navarrow, is the--it says here
CTO.

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.459
Don't you guys hate that?

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.930
He's the Chief Technology Officer, in case
someone didn't know what that meant.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.540
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: This is the one place they would
actually know what that meant.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.540
&gt;&gt;Michelle Thornton: Oh, OK.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.540
All right.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.540
Good.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.540
Good.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.540
Good.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.540
[laughter]

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.540
See?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.540
I kinda fit in.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.540
I kinda don't.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.180
And then, of course, Soledad, who by the way,
is our new morning anchor starting in January.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.370
Yay.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.560
[applause]

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.560
With that being said, we cannot let her get
away from telling stories like this.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.829
So, we're going to see her around these docs,
but she will also be the face from 7 to 9.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.269
So, we're very proud of her.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.459
Second up is Chris Genteel.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.459
Chris?

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.459
All right.

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.130
He said he might sing a song for us.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.130
[applause]

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.130
Or maybe not.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.359
He's said the Black Eyed Peas were here yesterday.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.010
So how come we didn't get to come yesterday?

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.099
What's really going on?

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.129
And then, as you saw on the screen, is Ang--.

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.040
Here goes Angela.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040
Angela.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040
[applause]

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.780
So, we can't show a doc and not have a conversation.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.330
They're gonna talk and then they're gonna
allow you guys to ask some questions.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.330
So, enjoy.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.330
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, how's everybody doing?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.330
&gt;&gt;Audience: Good.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.170
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: It's a little different from the
last time I sat in this chair, as you can

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.670
see on the doc.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.950
So first, I'm sorry, I had to run over there
and charge up my iPhone.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.950
It won't keep a battery.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.160
If you guys can suggest another platform I
might switch to afterwards.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.160
[laughter] Let me know.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.050
We can talk after.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.730
So this is gonna be really informal.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.580
We're gonna have some conversation up here.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.940
I want you guys to be involved.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.650
I'm hoping you have a lot of questions.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.130
And we'll make it engaging.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.980
But first, I wanna start with Soledad.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.790
For people who may not know about the "Black
in America" series, maybe you can talk about

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.630
why you and CNN feel it's important to tell
these stories and what the effect has been.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.330
&gt;&gt;Soledad : I'll have to start at the very
beginning then.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.970
The "Black in America" series started 2007,
when we started working on a six-hour, three-part

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.090
documentary, which really started with the
anniversary--the 40th anniversary, of the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.870
assassination of Dr. King.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.510
And I was asked by the head of CNN Worldwide,
"Do you think there would be an interest in

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.910
a look at the assassination of Dr. King and
also African Americans--'Black in America'?"

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.811
So with that, we took the ball and started
running with it.

00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:26.900
And we did a two-hour documentary on the assassination
of Dr. King, and then, two more days of two-hour

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.230
docs with our first "Black in America."

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.310
And it was wildly successful.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.310
Some people loved it.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.310
Some people hated it.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.970
But what it did do is spur a lot of conversation
about stories that clearly were not being

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.970
told.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.430
And in fact, probably the biggest compliment
that I got when people would stand up at anything

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.830
else I was doing and say, "When are you doing
'Asian in America'?

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.000
How about 'Caribbean in America'?"

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.700
My own mother said, "Oh, so no Afro-Cubans
in your little documentary.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.700
[laughter]

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.700
Interesting.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.820
Those are your own people you let down."

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.601
So, it was just really successful.

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:00.010
And I think it was a moment that people felt--.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.980
For me, we saw that we could do these really
interesting stories about people whose stories

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.490
really didn't get told and you could also
win.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.750
It was wildly successful ratings-wise.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.760
It was just a big win across the board and
it didn't have to be stuck in a, "Well, we're

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.320
doing this programming because it's a good
thing to do.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.750
And if no one watches it, that's OK because
we've done our good deed on the diversity

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.750
front."

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.750
It was like, "Wow.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.750
We can win with this."

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.870
And then after that, we started doing "Latino
in America."

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.360
And then we created the unit, "In America,"
in order to tell a bunch of stories.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.030
We did "Gay in America," "Muslim in America,"
"Education in America," "Working in America"--looking

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.740
at coal miners.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.220
And again, we were just really successful.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.960
So, out of that, the "Black in America" series,
we kept thinking about, "Well, what are the

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.990
stories you could do?"

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.660
The first one was really a survey.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.460
The third one was a look at--.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.360
The second one was another survey and we decided
then to take a look in the third one in a

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.160
single topic, which was a church and a pastor
and what that church was doing at a very tough

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.680
time economically.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.990
And then, this one, of course, was--.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.840
So, we try to connect what's happening in
the story-- a single subject story--to what's

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.190
also happening in the world at that moment.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.050
So, how do you make it relevant news-wise,
but also compelling, interesting?

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:22.930
'Cause a documentary is a story that's unfolding
in real-time, or something is at risk, or

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.380
you're cheering for people, you're rooting
for people and there's something happening.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.660
That's our definition of how we do documentaries.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.730
And so, we really think on this one in particular,
you end up touching a nerve when people start

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.690
arguing about the parts of your documentary,
right?

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.290
Because it means you've really hit something
relevant that people are willing to go and

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.520
shout about their perspective.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.070
And I love, ultimately, for all of our documentaries--it's
about a conversation.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.460
So, if we're able to get people to stand up
and yell on one side or the other, or talk--hopefully--in

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.520
a more calm tone about one side or the other
to start a conversation, then I think we've

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.870
been really successful.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.760
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, I'm sure we can all think
of thousand topics we'd want them to cover.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.000
Can you talk about why you chose this topic?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.630
&gt;&gt;Soledad: You know, again, I think for documentaries--any
documentary--it's "are the characters great?"

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.630
We went out.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.020
Jason Samuels, our producer who's in New York
today, but who's been literally emailing me

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.020
constantly, "Tell me.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.020
What's the blow by blow?

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.020
What are they laughing at?

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.540
What do the people think?”

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.250
So he came out and really met with Angela.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.210
And at first, over the phone, and then met
all the people in the house.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.420
Because the truth is, are they good characters?

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.420
We call them characters?

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.420
Are they interesting?

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.420
Do you care about them?

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.490
Do you want to see them win or lose or struggle?

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.550
If you do not care, it will be a terrible
documentary.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.330
And then, it was clearly in a house--eight
people in a three-bedroom house--was already

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.890
going to provide some issues in terms of just
people close together in a small space who

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.420
have a lot going on and who were stressed.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.470
As Pius pointed out in the doc, no drinking,
no hot tubs.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.520
So, it certainly wasn't going to the "The
Real World" or anything.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.870
But it certainly, I thought, was a way to
explore an issue that was relevant.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:04.520
And then again, "Does race matter?" is a very
interesting question to me.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.050
I think of our "Black in America's" really,
ultimately, can be boiled down to that question.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.460
Does race matter?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.750
[Soledad laughs]

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.900
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Sign off on the crowd.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.900
So, Angela.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.700
Can you tell us a little bit about what made
you decide to create The NewMe Accelerator?

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.540
&gt;&gt;Angela: I'll try not to get too lengthy,
but--.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.460
So, as you saw, I had a site called BlackWhite
2 point 0, and I started that about four years

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.460
ago.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.670
And then, last year in 2010, I had a conference
called the "NewMe Conference."

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:45.210
And we invited entrepreneurs and people in
government and also people in private equity.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.750
And it was a day and a half.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:54.630
And we basically closed it out with brainstorming--what
it would really take for minority entrepreneurs

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.650
to be successful in the technology industry.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.361
And one of those things was an accelerator,
but the idea just seemed so huge, so--it was

00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:04.910
just in the back of my head someplace.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:11.930
Wayne, I've known for a while actually online,
how I meet most of my friends.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.910
[chuckles] But he had the idea for a start-up
house.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:20.310
So, it brought really this residential component
to what an accelerator is.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.560
And then also, when I went back and looked
at my notes from the conference, it really

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.070
helped satisfy a lot of the barriers that
people said existed.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.020
So, it's really expensive to live out here.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:36.550
People felt like they were disconnected and
couldn't actually come out here and just relocate.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.950
So, that was one thing that really helped
lower that barrier.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.710
And then people just felt like they didn't
have a network at all.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:49.630
And that really hindered their ability for
their companies to be successful.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:58.320
So, giving them mentorship, a network, and
just real--not a curriculum--but just knowledge

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.960
from other people's experiences.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.790
It just turned into an accelerator.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.620
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, Chris.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.340
You were here at the welcoming site.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.430
You were sitting in the audience.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.070
Maybe, can you give us some of your impressions
that day of that event?

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.080
&gt;&gt;CHRIS: Sure.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.410
You've got entrepreneurs who have never been
in that position before, maybe being somewhat

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.370
on the spot.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:32.410
And getting access to minds like yours and
David Crane.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:39.000
And getting at that real, live--an old mentor
of mine used to call it--the "oh, shit" moment.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
[laughter]

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.560
This is the real moment.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.620
And you could see from that moment on, over
the course of the summer, and I think the

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:52.350
piece captured it really well, just elevating
the stakes of the whole thing--making it really

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.779
real.

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:57.990
We were proud to see that be at the beginning,
of seeing that.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.190
And then, seeing that transformation.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:09.380
And also knowing that raising that game and
having that success was within their reach

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.880
because now, we're here.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.070
We're part of the mix in Silicon Valley.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.880
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, Angela.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.810
We know that that was a challenging day for
all the entrepreneurs.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.900
Can you talk a little bit about some of the
other challenges you faced that you maybe

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.950
didn't expect to face when you guys started
this program in the Valley?

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.370
&gt;&gt;Angela: Yeah.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:37.350
There are a lot of very little reasons, very
little things, that I just like--just different

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.350
situations.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:43.800
I really just expected, I guess, people to
be a little bit more like me and just really

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:50.290
focus in on the work and not other issues,
and really commit to that for nine weeks.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:58.360
But there were other things that came up around
transportation, [chuckles] around what type

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:04.170
of food people wanted to eat, and just other
little things like that that I didn't even

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.200
think of at all.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.380
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So how important was it to do
it here, in Silicon Valley?

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.150
&gt;&gt;Angela: Oh, it was hugely important.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.760
Mainly because this is the epicenter for technologies.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.910
So, it really had to be here.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:24.640
Not only that, there aren't really many minorities
in the--well, African Americans specifically--area.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:35.000
So, for us to do it in New York or Atlanta,
it would not have had the same impact at all.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.971
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Soledad, after meeting the characters
and getting in-depth in their stories, can

00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:45.510
you talk about maybe who surprised you or
who stood out to you in terms of their stories,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.940
the things you learned about them?

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.110
&gt;&gt;Soledad : You know, when I meet people,
again, 'cause my job is--I'm a storyteller,

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.110
right?

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.250
So, my job is to sit in on this and say, "So,
what's the best way to tell this story?"

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.960
And not just to a room of people who are in
technology, but to a room of people who know

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.010
nothing about technology, or their only technology
is their mobile device and that's it.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.260
And how do we make that story live and be
relevant and interesting?

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.380
So, it really was digging into people's stories.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.290
For me, what struck me about Angela was all
that she was juggling.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.330
That here's a woman who's a mom, a single
mom of three kids, who she has left behind

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.529
at home while she is working on this big idea.

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:28.880
And she's got this company she's also trying
to launch at the same time.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.680
And she has all these little things in the
Accelerator that she has to manage that have

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.360
popped up--some big little things and some
little little things.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.930
And every time I'd see Angela, she was pacing.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.050
On the phone and pacing.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.270
On the phone and pacing.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.680
When I asked the question--.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.310
The first time I saw Angela, we drove up and
Jason said, "Oh yeah.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.310
That's Angela.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.310
The house is down there, but that's Angela."

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.780
And there was a woman in sweats, pacing up
and down.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.120
So I'm like, "That's the woman running the
house?

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.910
She's pacing up and down."

00:14:54.910 --> 00:15:00.870
So, we really wanted to capture that incredible
pressure that is on someone who both really,

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.500
personally wants to make a difference, but
also really personally wants to be successful,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.500
too.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.899
And as a person who has before, many times
in her life, people have low expectations

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:16.510
of what she can achieve and she's always said,
"Well, low expectations doesn't mean I'm not

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.510
gonna achieve."

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.620
So, we wanted to get that in there, too.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.470
I love Anthony and I think when I watch the
doc, I always feel that my love of Anthony

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.430
comes out because he's the youngest.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.580
He's 25.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.649
And he told me--we didn't really have the
ability to put it in the documentary and I

00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:35.370
tried 8000 different ways--but the thing he
said to me, which broke my heart and made

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.570
me love him more, he said, "You know--."

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:42.270
He started really playing around with video
games and really just being in technology

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.480
when he was about 7th grade he said.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.209
And he just loved computers.

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:47.709
He loved technology.

00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:53.730
But as he went through school, there was no
one to capture that and channel him into,

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.910
"Well, if you love that, you should be doing
this.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.100
Well, if you love that, you could be doing
this."

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.770
And so, he was sort of, by his guidance counselor,
who sounds like a jerk, kind of forced in

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.850
a direction, "Well, just go to community college
and do this and do that."

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:12.100
And not really put on a program where he could
take what he's passionate about clearly, and

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.700
combine that with a fabulous job at the end.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:23.430
And he said, "You know, if me, today, had
been in front of me as a 7th grader, my life

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.430
would be totally different."

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.850
Honestly, it just broke my heart.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.780
It just, because he, and he said it in a way--.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.221
And the way I've said it is so inarticulate
compared to how Anthony said it.

00:16:33.221 --> 00:16:39.670
He said, "I would be a totally different person
if the person I am today stood in front of

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:46.930
a classroom full of me, young men, who love
games and who love that kind of technology,

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.260
and I said, 'Be an engineer.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.860
It matters because you can create those games
that you love.'"

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.820
And so, this is his reason for trying to be
part of the Accelerator.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:02.120
He feels really connected to all those other
kids who look like him in Newark, New Jersey.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.550
And we will put some more clips online just
'cause I love that so much.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:11.329
And obviously, we have an hour, so it's not
that you have an unlimited amount of space.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.490
And think that was true for a lot of the founders,
right?

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.220
There's this personal part of it, too, that
makes you want to succeed.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.119
'Cause it's not just about you.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:23.299
If you succeed, that's great 'cause everyone
wants to be a gajillionaire.

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:25.970
But also, you can change the game for other
people.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.440
You could literally open up everybody's--you
know the pattern matching, right?

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.090
You can change the pattern, but you could
also inspire people.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.980
You could be literally a role model and someone
could say, "I wanna be Anthony Frasier.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.980
You saw Anthony Frasier?

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.429
He just sold his company for a billion dollars.

00:17:40.429 --> 00:17:41.830
I wanna be Anthony Frasier."

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:49.980
That, to me, would be an incredibly great
indication of the needle moving for this industry.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.269
&gt;Navarrow: Chris, we've talked about some
of the challenges in trying to connect minorities

00:17:54.269 --> 00:17:55.269
with technology.

00:17:55.269 --> 00:17:58.539
Maybe you can talk about why Google decided
to partner with the NewMe Accelerator?

00:17:58.539 --> 00:18:02.600
And also about just Google's efforts around
diversity in general.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.600
&gt;&gt;CHRIS: Sure.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.590
I'm on our Diversity Inclusion team.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:11.190
And there's literally probably 20 or so people
in this audience who do participate in our

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:18.389
efforts to help black-owned businesses get
online and be successful, using our tools

00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:22.309
and just using the power of the internet to
get their business online and get in front

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:23.840
of customers.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.549
And of course, we're a technology business.

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:32.499
And we've seen the immense profit, immense
growth in technology.

00:18:32.499 --> 00:18:38.820
And we don't see those businesses reflected
in our customer base, and we don't see them

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.850
reflected in the Valley.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:49.340
When we met Angela, who I think is a role
model for a lot the Googlers here, someone

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:56.369
who is successful, young, black, female, in
tech--and she came to Google and spoke to,

00:18:56.369 --> 00:19:01.669
I think, maybe 30 or so black Googlers in
a room that didn't really fit that many, [chuckles]

00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:07.480
and then some by video conference, who video
conferenced in to see her--it was inspiring.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:14.690
And it was obvious that we needed to find
ways to partner with her, to help us change

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.210
what we saw as a problem in Silicon Valley.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:23.799
So, NewMe, Angela and I, were sitting on stage
for a panel at the Black Enterprise Conference

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:28.299
and it was May 23rd, or something, of this
year.

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:34.110
And she said, "I think I wanna do this Accelerator."

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.830
And we were here on June 16th making that
happen.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:43.080
It was incredible, the speed with which she
moved to that, which is something that at

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.429
Google, we know something about, which is
moving really quickly.

00:19:45.429 --> 00:19:52.519
And when you see someone like that, who just
so embodied the spirit of that tech and quick

00:19:52.519 --> 00:19:55.190
and "let's get it done," you know that you
have to partner.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.630
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Can I add just one quick thing
to that?

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.710
And I think for the documentary, what we loved
about Angela is, again, the room that I'm

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:06.320
talking to for our doc is not a room full
of technologists.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.269
I think Angela is inspiring to everyone, right?

00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:12.360
Somebody who says against all odds, "Well,
I have this thing.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.360
And I think I wanna do it.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.360
And I think I can do it.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.400
And if I can just get some support together,
I can do it.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.859
And even if I'm driven a little bit crazy
every step of the way--'cause that's how things

00:20:19.859 --> 00:20:23.740
go--I'm still gonna try to be successful."

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:30.270
I think that's incredibly inspirational to
me, who I hand off my technology when I have

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.270
a problem.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.270
Here, someone fix that for me.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.270
Thank you.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.399
[giggles] So, I think that my goal in this
doc as well, is to highlight people who are

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:39.779
inspirational.

00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:43.379
And the only way to be inspirational is to
go through something on-screen so people see

00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:46.980
what you're dealing with, and the challenges,
and to see how you come out the other side.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.970
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, Angela.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.419
Everyone in this room can appreciate execution.

00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:55.480
We know the value is all about execution and
we've heard several cases now that you moved

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.840
at a rapid pace.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:02.269
How does it feel seeing your idea come from
that idea on the Black Enterprise panel to

00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:04.889
fully-executed, first launch class?

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.309
&gt;&gt;Angela: It feels great.

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:11.889
And actually, every time I see the doc, it
takes me really back to the moments of the

00:21:11.889 --> 00:21:12.889
summer.

00:21:12.889 --> 00:21:14.320
And it's like, I get all happy and stuff inside.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.239
And I can't wait for the next cycles and everything.

00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:20.029
So, it feels great.

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:24.989
And I'm really excited to hear what everyone
else thinks about it.

00:21:24.989 --> 00:21:30.919
And then once it airs on November 13th, just
to see what really, the world, thinks about

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:32.119
it, too.

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:35.730
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, as you can see from the doc,
I had a lot of opinions.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:41.860
So, if you categorize me as the angry uncle
of NewMe, I'd have to categorize Mitch Kapor

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.490
as the Godfather of NewMe.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.090
So, Mitch, I wanna throw a question to you.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.080
You were deeply involved in the process.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.789
Maybe tell everybody your impressions about
the program, the group, and Angela, and just

00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:57.000
the process that happened largely in your
facility.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.879
&gt;&gt;Mitch Kapor: I've been involved in helping
a number of Accelerators, Y Combinator and

00:22:04.879 --> 00:22:08.379
others, and heard about NewMe.

00:22:08.379 --> 00:22:14.960
And because it intersected thematically with
other things that Frieda, my wife and I, are

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:21.940
doing up in San Francisco with the Level Playing
Field Institute and my foundation, I immediately

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.940
said, "Great.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.679
I'll do something here."

00:22:24.679 --> 00:22:34.539
When I met Angela and the entrepreneurs early
in the cycle, I was really impressed.

00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:36.889
I was impressed with the seriousness.

00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:43.389
I was impressed with the dedication and I
thought a number of the ideas that they were

00:22:43.389 --> 00:22:45.359
working on were pretty good ideas.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:49.830
So, I doubled down and said, "All right.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.299
I'll get more involved.

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:52.749
I'll make some time.

00:22:52.749 --> 00:22:57.049
I want to do some mentoring--take people through
the process, share my experience."

00:22:57.049 --> 00:23:03.559
And then, we made our office space available
to hold the demo day in.

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:15.600
And I'm hoping and believing that with Angela
being out here now, the goal of establishing

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:25.230
NewMe as an ongoing, recurring--not a one-time
thing--but something that can regularly be

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:31.360
a way to facilitating increased participation
for African Americans in Silicon Valley.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.360
We're helping with that.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.679
We think that's incredibly important.

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:40.390
Ultimately, we'd like to see it not just in
Silicon Valley, but elsewhere.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.409
It's just that important.

00:23:41.409 --> 00:23:43.649
I mean, the stakes are huge.

00:23:43.649 --> 00:23:48.889
Not just for the individuals, but as I said
in the clip in the movie, economically, if

00:23:48.889 --> 00:23:54.380
you look at demographics in the US, by 2040,
we're gonna be a majority/minority country.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:24:00.750
And if we're not developing every single talented
individual to do what they can, we're not

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:07.779
gonna be competitive as an economy.

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:17.549
So, the other thing to keep in mind though,
is like any other population of entrepreneurs.

00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:25.850
The history, background, skills, quality of
ideas, persistence--there's variation among

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.010
individuals.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:32.590
And it's been very interesting for me to see,
not only during the nine weeks, but subsequently.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:41.299
You can begin to see who is really more likely
to succeed as the group sorts itself out.

00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:46.759
But overall, this is just such a necessary,
such a gratifying thing.

00:24:46.759 --> 00:24:54.409
And I'm so pleased that CNN and Soledad and
Jason and the whole team put all of the effort

00:24:54.409 --> 00:25:02.130
into this because it is gonna shine a light
on this issue and as we say, start conversations

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.820
which need to happen.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.999
Silicon Valley has a very difficult time talking
about race.

00:25:07.999 --> 00:25:13.580
Anybody who follows the twittersphere and
the blogosphere has seen that play itself

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.769
out in the past week.

00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:22.080
And I'm hoping that those conversations will
improve and people will find it easier to

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.560
talk about real and important things--not
necessarily to get everybody to agree, but

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.960
to talk about one more elephant in the room.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.460
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, Soledad.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.460
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Yes.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.820
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Mitch talked about it a little
bit.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.999
Can you talk a little about what the effect
the "Black in America" docs have on raising

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:41.559
the conversation on the given topic?

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:45.710
I think we've all seen over just the last
week, the doc hasn't even aired yet and there's

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.870
been a lot of activity on Twitter.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.259
But I actually only saw it on Google+.

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:50.259
[laughter]

00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:53.659
So, I don't know where anyone else saw it.

00:25:53.659 --> 00:25:54.659
Was it anywhere else?

00:25:54.659 --> 00:25:55.659
I'm not sure.

00:25:55.659 --> 00:25:56.659
[laughter]

00:25:56.659 --> 00:26:02.159
But maybe talk about how the documentaries
have raised conversations on this.

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:04.629
How do you see that this documentary may raise
that conversation?

00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:10.369
&gt;&gt;Soledad : I think the documentaries have
been successful across a number of categories.

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:14.870
And in terms of spawning conversations, they've
been really successful.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:19.909
And I figured that after the first one when
people would stop me in the airport--any airport,

00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:22.750
anywhere--and say, "You wanna know 'Black
in America?'

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.879
My life is 'Black in America.'

00:26:23.879 --> 00:26:24.970
Put me on TV."

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:25.970
[laughter]

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.769
Like, 25 times a day.

00:26:28.769 --> 00:26:32.090
And people who loved it or hated it would
say, "I hated what you did.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.720
I should be the next 'Black in America.'"

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.200
Or, "I loved what you did.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.809
I should be the next 'Black in America.'"

00:26:36.809 --> 00:26:41.530
And it was really clear to me that there were
just all these stories that were not getting

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:47.690
any kind of airtime, and certainly not in
a long form way, but just all stories.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:52.559
I mean, really, not just for African Americans,
but I think for Latinos, for Asians, for Native

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:55.309
Americans, who get literally no coverage at
all.

00:26:55.309 --> 00:27:03.979
And I thought, really what the "Black in America"
series has done, I think, in terms of shining

00:27:03.979 --> 00:27:07.059
a light on "you can tell stories on diverse
populations."

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:11.649
And by "diverse populations," I mean women
who were rescue workers at Ground Zero.

00:27:11.649 --> 00:27:13.200
And you can do really well.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.220
Again, it doesn't have to be often, I think,
in TV news when we tip our hat to diversity,

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.960
it's that "here you go, here it's Women's
Month and here's a story on this.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.749
And now it's Latino Heritage and here's a
story on this.

00:27:26.749 --> 00:27:28.590
“The world is changing.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.909
The audience is changing.

00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:30.909
And guess what.

00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:33.059
Everybody is interested in these conversations.

00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:38.799
You can win and you can do them well, so you
can do quality work that wins awards, that

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:42.232
is well done, that people wanna run home and
watch and be part of and be part of the conversation.

00:27:42.232 --> 00:27:47.090
So, for a journalist, I look at that as winning
across the board.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.240
And that was really critical.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.059
&gt;&gt;Michelle Thornton: Can you just add real
quick, because I think it's changed people's

00:27:52.059 --> 00:27:53.889
lives through pairing and funding and money?

00:27:53.889 --> 00:27:54.889
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Oh, yeah.

00:27:54.889 --> 00:27:55.889
That's true.

00:27:55.889 --> 00:27:56.889
There's no question.

00:27:56.889 --> 00:27:57.889
I mean, I end up keeping in touch very much.

00:27:57.889 --> 00:28:00.419
Like, Angela, in 20 years, you and I will
still be talking because I--.

00:28:00.419 --> 00:28:01.570
&gt;&gt;Michelle Thornton: You'll be famous.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.679
&gt;&gt;Soledad : And I'll be trying to get a seat
to do an interview with you.

00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:05.679
&gt;&gt;Michelle Thornton: Right.

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:11.029
&gt;&gt;Soledad : What we found is that what we
did for our second "Black in America"--.

00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:13.570
The first "Black in America," Roland Fryer,
Professor at Harvard.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.830
He just won a Genius Grant and so we obviously
keep in touch with the work that he's doing

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.039
in education.

00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:23.399
Steve Perry from the second "Black in America,"
who has now expanded his school, which was

00:28:23.399 --> 00:28:24.690
a six through twelve.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.929
And now, he's opened an elementary school.

00:28:26.929 --> 00:28:31.370
And he's a contributor on the education space
on CNN.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.210
We just continually, I think, are able to
change lives.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:39.789
For me personally, my husband and I started
a foundation after Hurricane Katrina.

00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:43.130
But after the first "Black in America," one
of the young women that we interviewed was

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.820
a girl named Nya Buckley and she was getting
an HIV test.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.710
And afterwards, I said to her--this beautiful,
smart, sharp girl.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.600
I said to her, "Why are you here?

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.740
Did you go to college?"

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.809
And she said, "I have a baby.

00:28:54.809 --> 00:28:56.489
I have no one to handle the daycare."

00:28:56.489 --> 00:28:57.849
So I said, "OK."

00:28:57.849 --> 00:29:00.720
After the doc aired, "I'll pay for your daycare
if you go to college."

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.461
And now, she's a junior at Lehman College.

00:29:02.461 --> 00:29:06.720
And we have a bunch of other people--Maria
Arquetto, who we did in Latino in America

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.989
2, who swam across the Rio Grande to get to
America and ended up in detention and then

00:29:11.989 --> 00:29:15.789
was able to get a visa and now is on her path
to citizenship.

00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:18.549
She's starting community college in a couple
months.

00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:22.389
So, I think we were able to really connect
people to those stories because people were

00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:24.739
rooting and caring about those very characters.

00:29:24.739 --> 00:29:25.749
So, I think we have.

00:29:25.749 --> 00:29:29.649
I mean, it sounds so dramatic to say we've
changed lives, but I do think when you open

00:29:29.649 --> 00:29:35.809
things up to a conversation, you certainly
allow for the ability for lives to change.

00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:40.149
&gt;&gt;CHRIS: And Soledad, all those people who
stop you in the airport, we want to remind

00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:45.409
you that they can all be "Black and Latino
in America" on YouTube every day.

00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:46.409
[laughter]

00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:48.080
So, park that one back here.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.200
We're gonna talk about that later.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.200
[clapping]

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.409
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Trademark, "Black in America,"
by the way.

00:29:53.409 --> 00:29:54.409
[laughter]

00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:55.409
&gt;&gt;CHRIS: All right.

00:29:55.409 --> 00:29:56.820
&gt;&gt;Soledad: Our lawyers can talk.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.820
We're good.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.820
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, Angela.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.809
Maybe we can talk a little bit about, you
know, Soledad mentioned there's only so much

00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:03.129
they can show in an hour, right?

00:30:03.129 --> 00:30:07.899
So, what are some of the things that happened
that were key experiences for you and the

00:30:07.899 --> 00:30:13.450
group that didn't make it to the doc that
you really want people to know and understand?

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:17.019
&gt;&gt;Angela: Really, like the sleepless nights.

00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:24.529
So, I think you get a little bit of that,
but we also did--we did work a lot.

00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:26.750
But we really did a lot of other stuff.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:33.019
And I think part of this whole being black
in technology conversation, a part of that

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:34.019
is mentorship.

00:30:34.019 --> 00:30:40.080
So, another thing that we did that didn't
make it to the doc is we actually went--well,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:46.129
not me--but a couple of the founders who have
STEM degrees actually went to UC Berkeley,

00:30:46.129 --> 00:30:51.440
to speak with some children from a program
called SMASH, that's put on by the Level Playing

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.159
Field Institute.

00:30:53.159 --> 00:31:01.389
And that was a really, really rewarding experience
because you could really see it making a connection

00:31:01.389 --> 00:31:02.760
in these kid's lives.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.570
And them coming up even to me-- I was just
there because the founders were there--asking,

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.159
"Can I email you?

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:09.159
I have questions."

00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:14.639
I mean, it was just a really, really good
experience to have in life.

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:19.249
So, it was tons of experiences like that.

00:31:19.249 --> 00:31:29.390
And really, I think you guys got our dynamic
in the house, but really the friendships that

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.669
were developed out of this.

00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:35.580
Like, I saw Pius and Becky last night.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.610
And the people I've been seeing, I've been--.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:41.679
I did move here, but I've been heads-down
for the past month, so a lot of the people

00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:46.649
that I'm seeing, I haven't seen them since
the last day of the program.

00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:53.570
And just rekindling those friendships and
those relationships--that was huge.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:59.179
And I think that's really what makes the program
different from other Incubators and Accelerators

00:31:59.179 --> 00:32:03.000
is the residential part and these relationships
that end up developing.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.190
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Chris, maybe you can talk a little
bit about--.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:10.039
We understand that there's just a lack of
knowledge.

00:32:10.039 --> 00:32:12.739
And I think the key part of Angela bringing
these people in the house is that they were

00:32:12.739 --> 00:32:16.789
exposed to a lot of things that otherwise
they might not have had knowledge of.

00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:17.789
Maybe you can talk a little bit about--.

00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:19.799
I know you guys have programs like Google
Accelerate.

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:24.629
How do we leverage those and get those into
the community in a big way to make sure that

00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:27.559
more people can even know about Angela's program?

00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:29.190
&gt;&gt;Chris: That's what we're working on.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:35.120
I think we have tools that are, for the most
part, free, that can empower the millions

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.779
of, the two and half million black businesses
that are out there.

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:42.599
And a lot of folks just don't know about it.

00:32:42.599 --> 00:32:48.570
So, a couple of things that we're doing is
we're working with some very specific partners,

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:53.429
like the National Supplier Diversity Network,
or Black Enterprise Magazine, to try to tell

00:32:53.429 --> 00:33:00.629
the story very loudly about how the web empowers
business, how the web empowers growth.

00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:05.719
We're also working on some other programs
to make sure that people are using Google

00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:11.769
in their business, that they're using our
Gmail apps and docs apps and things like that.

00:33:11.769 --> 00:33:16.940
And when we get in front of individual folks
and when we give them these products, it lights

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.969
them up.

00:33:17.969 --> 00:33:23.559
We're giving away free websites to every business
in America through a program that we've been

00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:25.499
piloting and getting out.

00:33:25.499 --> 00:33:30.599
In Detroit two weeks ago, we had a thousand
different entrepreneurs come downtown.

00:33:30.599 --> 00:33:36.789
It was a majority minority crowd, which you
would think would be the case if you were

00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:38.100
in downtown Detroit.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.999
But I'll tell you, it's not the case unless
you bring in the right partners, unless you

00:33:42.999 --> 00:33:49.330
bring in folks like Angela and Hajj Flemings,
one of the entrepreneurs from gokit, who's

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.009
one of our partners in Detroit.

00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:54.980
Unless you bring those folks in and they get
the word out to their communities.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.200
Unless you get into the faith community.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.559
Unless you get into the folks who really are
saying, "This is something that can help your

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:03.559
business."

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:07.700
So, we're doing things like that across the
country to raise that awareness, get those

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.040
tools out in front of them and empower them
to create huge businesses online.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.430
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Just a thought, Chris, there's
a little company called Interactive One and

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:16.909
we service maybe 85 percent of the African
American market.

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:20.490
If you're looking for new partners, I could
probably put you in touch with some.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:21.490
&gt;&gt;Chris: All right.

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:22.490
If you know anyone--.

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:23.490
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: You know what?

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:24.490
Let's talk after.

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:25.490
I think I can make that call.

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:26.490
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thanks.

00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:28.580
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, I want to open it up to questions,
but before we do that, I wanna give Angela

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.570
the opportunity to talk to people about what's
in store for the future of the NewMe Accelerator.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:34.760
&gt;&gt;Angela: Wow.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.339
So, all my big ideas.

00:34:37.339 --> 00:34:40.089
So of course, I want it to be everywhere.

00:34:40.089 --> 00:34:42.659
But we're taking baby steps.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:49.319
One of the really great things that I'm excited
to finally be able to tell people today is

00:34:49.319 --> 00:34:54.589
Google is actually gonna be the presenting
sponsor for all of 2012.

00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:58.440
And so what that really means for the program
is that we'll be based in Mountain View again,

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.150
but we'll also be working out of the space
here.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.150
And so, that’s--.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.150
[clapping]

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.240
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: That's clappable, right?

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.413
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Now I have to go into a re-edit.

00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:14.109
&gt;&gt;Angela: Yeah, so lots of re-editing for
you guys, [chuckles] but yeah.

00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:16.789
So that's really exciting.

00:35:16.789 --> 00:35:22.710
Also, some other stuff that I'm working on
is like, yes, there's the Accelerator, which

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.480
will still stay in the same shape that's it's
in.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.730
But some other things that I also want to
do is have a NewMe community, which that goes

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:36.150
into other submarkets--maybe like Atlanta,
Chicago, and so on and so forth.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:42.349
And those are really like community-driven
where it's not the full blown program, but

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:48.780
it's a smaller version of the program where
we can pull from communities that are under-served.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.880
So, we are working with some partners on that.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.630
And so hopefully, I can tell you guys more
about that soon, too.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:57.829
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, great.

00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:58.829
Any questions from the group?

00:35:58.829 --> 00:36:02.770
I think we have a microphone that's ready
to travel if you raise your hand.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.050
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Hi, everybody.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:07.060
Thanks for coming.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.060
My name's Isaiah.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.270
I've been working here at Google for about
a year and a half now.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:15.080
One thing that I thought was really interesting
when watching the documentary was one of the

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.080
characters.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.790
He had success at getting funding before and
had some failures.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:26.200
And so for me, that highlighted a bigger problem
that once minorities actually get here in

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:32.359
this space and got the funding, it seems like
even more people are not achieving the success

00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:33.359
that they would like to.

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:36.990
So, I just wanted to hear your thoughts on
what's being done to address--.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:42.980
Or, what some of the bigger challenges are
in staying here once you've gotten your idea

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.800
adopted and gotten the funding you needed
to and what can be done, or what we can do

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.339
to provide resources to help people maintain
their success?

00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:51.650
&gt;&gt;Angela: Sure.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:56.230
Well, I think, I mean, entrepreneurship, it's--.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:00.609
The Accelerator focuses on something that's
very early-stage, but it really is a journey

00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:03.220
and it's a longer life cycle.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:09.510
So, for Hank, part of the story that wasn't
told is when he was working on Clickradio,

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:13.770
that wasn’t the first dot com bust.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:19.869
So yes, he raised 40 million dollars, but
his business suffered like a lot of other

00:37:19.869 --> 00:37:21.309
businesses.

00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:29.760
So, in terms of how do we make sure that companies
stay successful, honestly I think all of this

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.520
is really just a huge learning opportunity.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:38.180
So, we might not know right now because there
really aren't that many success stories.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:46.970
But over the course of years, we should be
able to get some really good data on what

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:53.029
we can do to make sure that people become
successful, they have exits, they can also

00:37:53.029 --> 00:37:58.450
then reinvest--hopefully in some minority
businesses--and then we can really start to

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:03.869
have a pure life cycle to creating really
great companies.

00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:07.869
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Hi.

00:38:07.869 --> 00:38:09.329
My name is Cynthia and I--.

00:38:09.329 --> 00:38:10.329
&gt;&gt;Soledad : OK.

00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:12.130
Hold it close to your mouth like that.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.130
Thank you.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.410
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: So, I thought the post screen
conversation was at least as interesting as

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:18.410
the film itself.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:22.690
There are a couple of furious blog posts floating
around the internet that were really interesting.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:27.180
I was wondering if you ever considered maybe
doing a Google+ Hangout with Arrington and

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.430
Vic Gundotra and like, Ron Conway, and you're
just getting them all in the same room together

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:36.069
'cause it seemed like they all had different
experiences and they all disagreed with each

00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:37.069
other.

00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:39.660
It would be really interesting to hear all
of them interact, rather than--.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.529
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Sounds like you're inviting me
to be in a Google+ Hangout.

00:38:43.529 --> 00:38:44.529
The answer is yes.

00:38:44.529 --> 00:38:45.789
I'd love to.

00:38:45.789 --> 00:38:50.279
And anyone who wants to email Mr. Arrington,
who's blocked me, is welcome to.

00:38:50.279 --> 00:38:51.279
[laughter]

00:38:51.279 --> 00:38:52.380
I'm kidding.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.440
In all seriousness, I am more than happy to
be part of that conversation.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.440
And I think you're right.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.450
I think what that whole Twitter debate showed
me was that there was anger.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.420
And everybody was stuck in their spots.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:10.220
And really, a lot of what everybody was saying
was actually about a lack of representation.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:16.000
So maybe we could move the conversation for
being stuck down here, and move it up here.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.390
I really think if you look through every single
person's post--all of it--there was a sense

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.569
of, "Well, here's what, here's part of the
issue.

00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:24.820
And here's what could be done."

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.820
Right?

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.869
That's the area of the concentric circles
of where we all agree.

00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:31.160
So, maybe have a conversation about that.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.160
So, yeah.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.160
I fully support that.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.650
I'd be more than happy to be part of that.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.440
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Isn't the premise of Google Hangouts
that everyone has to show up?

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.110
I think we'd have a hard time getting Arrington
to show up.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.110
&gt;&gt;Soledad : You never know.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.110
You never know.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.110
I wouldn't assume that.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.110
Maybe.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.110
[mild laughter]

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:46.950
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Except people at Google docs.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:47.950
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Right.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:48.950
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Way in the back?

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:49.950
Oh, sorry.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:50.950
Go ahead.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:51.950
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Nope.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:52.950
Mic.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:53.950
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Hi.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:54.950
My name is Nava.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:55.950
I had this question and it's open to any of
the panelists.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:04.280
But historically, black-owned businesses weren't
really emerging about maybe in the 90s or

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.280
so.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.339
And according to the US Census, between 2007,
2006 and 2007, black-owned businesses increased

00:40:10.339 --> 00:40:12.480
by about 60 percent.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.480
That's huge.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.049
And granted, those black-owned businesses
were small.

00:40:16.049 --> 00:40:21.529
The fact that, culturally speaking, you had
a father who either owned an auto repair shop

00:40:21.529 --> 00:40:27.450
or a mom who owned her own business in the
health care industries said a lot about how

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.819
they were passing on inheritance.

00:40:30.819 --> 00:40:37.170
And traditionally, allowing their families
to know about why it is important to have

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.170
your own business.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:44.650
So, do you think the digital divide has also
created an issue between both the industries

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:48.920
and the technologies sector and also, the
African American community?

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.900
And I just wanna know what your insights are
on that.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.660
&gt;&gt;Soledad : That's a really interesting question
and I think that that statistic I found very,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.660
very interesting, right?

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.660
This huge--.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:04.220
Blacks completely outscore on entrepreneurship,
way above everybody else.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.089
And so, why do we not see that translate in
technology?

00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:12.710
It's not like, "Well, you know, it's not really
culturally relevant for the African American."

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.890
No, that's not true.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:17.280
We far over index in that--in entrepreneurship.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.160
And so, I'm not sure the answer to that.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.400
And I do think that that digital divide is
part of the answer.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.400
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:35.260
And the other part of that stat, 60 percent
growth over a five-year period--2002 to 2007--however,

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:42.000
in terms of the size of those businesses,
far smaller than the average size.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.529
So, we know there's traditionally been a lack
of access to capital.

00:41:46.529 --> 00:41:53.130
Something that you mentioned, Nava, was we
haven't seen the generational businesses that

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.880
have helped majority businesses succeed.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.710
Something that's really fascinating to us
in our work with Google customers, is we start

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:05.609
to see those black entrepreneurs who are older.

00:42:05.609 --> 00:42:11.090
Those "sons and daughters of" really taking
over and leading those businesses' growth

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.819
into the online space.

00:42:12.819 --> 00:42:19.369
So, that's a promising trend that I think
we can really capitalize on in terms of helping

00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:23.950
those businesses not only exceed in terms
of the number of businesses out there, but

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.920
in terms of the wealth that they're bringing
back into the community as well.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:30.589
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: So, I wanna jump in on that just
because this topic in particular is something

00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:31.589
I'm really passionate about.

00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:35.160
So, I believe we have--and I've said it a
lot--a perception problem, right?

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.720
The challenge we have is that there are a
lot of African American businesses that they

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.140
don't have the understanding and knowledge
of the technology opportunities that are out

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.240
there and that their barriers are so low.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.599
You gave a great example.

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:48.869
You said a bakery.

00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:50.579
You said barber shops.

00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:54.790
None of them know how technology could help
them grow and scale their business.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.789
So, I think there's opportunities there.

00:42:56.789 --> 00:43:01.569
So when you look at the digital divide, really
it's about literacy today more than it's about

00:43:01.569 --> 00:43:02.930
access.

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.890
The numbers show you that African Americans
over index on cellular devices.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:10.190
But if you go and ask them how many of them
know about Square, where they can plug it

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.470
in with no merchant account and immediately
take credit card purchases, the answer will

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:14.470
be slim to none.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.230
So I think the challenge is, how do we bridge
that gap?

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.410
How do we make that connection that they understand?

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:22.880
I mean, Chris talked about any business having
a website for free.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.299
I can guarantee you that that's not made it
into the African American community.

00:43:26.299 --> 00:43:30.099
And I think programs like Angela's will not
only raise the level of entrepreneurship--'cause

00:43:30.099 --> 00:43:33.960
yes, we all wanna be Facebook, we all wanna
be Google--but there's levels below that that

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.150
are incredibly successful and people can support
their families and have a good living and

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.210
create jobs that we have to communicate.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.299
So I think that's the big challenge.

00:43:42.299 --> 00:43:45.240
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: Hi.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.200
Yolanda Mangelini.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.140
So, question probably for Angela, or any of
you can also do this.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.200
So, if I think about one of the challenges
for a black entrepreneur is having access

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.200
to the networks, right?

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.019
I think I saw someone in the documentary mention
that.

00:43:57.019 --> 00:43:59.880
At Google, we believe in doing things that
scale.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.700
And you started with a handful of entrepreneurs.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.760
How do you scale that?

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.769
I think about--.

00:44:04.769 --> 00:44:10.579
I'm a graduate of the Stanford Business School
and my best friend there is black.

00:44:10.579 --> 00:44:12.480
He worked at Merrill Lynch.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.960
He went to Stanford.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.720
He worked at McKinsey.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.670
We were a year behind Jeff Skoll, who's a
founder of eBay.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.049
So he had access to all these networks.

00:44:20.049 --> 00:44:22.330
He started his own business and it failed.

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:25.049
And I think about someone like that, who had
access to the networks.

00:44:25.049 --> 00:44:26.740
How do you scale what you do?

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.260
&gt;&gt;Angela: Yeah, I think--.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.980
Chris and I talk about this a lot.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:36.850
But I think one of the key ways to scaling
something like this is really changing the

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.900
format a little bit so it might look a little
bit different.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:47.510
It might not look like the Accelerator proper,
but it might take on more of--.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:52.550
I guess the idea that I have in my head is
almost like a continuing education course.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.769
And then also something that's accessible
online, something that can also possibly be

00:44:56.769 --> 00:44:57.769
self-guided.

00:44:57.769 --> 00:45:03.450
And then, something that also pulls from networks
of mentors that are highly qualified that

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.859
these individuals can tap into.

00:45:06.859 --> 00:45:11.069
So, that's really the bigger idea that I have.

00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:15.440
Like, how do you scale something like this
that doesn't necessarily need to be something

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.569
that's brick and mortar?

00:45:16.569 --> 00:45:19.359
You know what I mean?

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:26.030
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #6: So, often--just a quick observation--which
is often there's problems that are out there

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.220
that always feel so daunting.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.279
How are we gonna fix education in America?

00:45:29.279 --> 00:45:33.820
How are we gonna get more people who are not
included, in this case, into the economy?

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.820
And I always--.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:35.820
I'm Megan.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:40.300
I lead New Business Development here at Google,
and we get to work with engineers when we're

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.300
starting new things.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.339
So, I have a lot of experience with the beginning
in entrepreneurs.

00:45:44.339 --> 00:45:47.779
I also got to do the acquisitions of Google
Earth and Maps and Picasa and other things.

00:45:47.779 --> 00:45:50.369
So, I've worked with very talented entrepreneurs.

00:45:50.369 --> 00:45:53.980
And one of my observations is on the daunting
problems.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:59.640
Two key things throughout history always are
the things that end up solving them.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.960
And they come in two forms.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:07.480
One is in storytelling, which is somebody
figures out how to tell us the story of what's

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:12.619
happening in a way that opens our minds to
know about something and often includes not

00:46:12.619 --> 00:46:16.830
only the problem, but some of the solutions
so we can begin to pile onto it.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:21.200
And so, Soledad, thank you for "Black in America"
and for focusing on things because it raises

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.420
our consciousness in a way that is significant.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:31.350
And adding in people who are doing great things,
like Angela, let's us pile on Chris and others.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:38.460
And so, that's the second part of it, which
is whether it's a social, political, or economic

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:42.460
invention that's gonna really make actual
change, it always comes from a person or a

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.460
small group.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.460
It's a Margaret Mead quote.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.460
It's always true.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.369
I mean, the founding of our own country comes
from these entrepreneurs.

00:46:49.369 --> 00:46:52.359
We know them: Thomas, Benjamin, Abigail, John.

00:46:52.359 --> 00:46:58.550
And they were funded by the French VC's. [laughter]
And so, when I do development work, I'm like,

00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:59.550
"We're the French.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.550
We're the French.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:01.550
We're the French.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:02.550
Where is the talent?

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:03.550
Who are we gonna help?

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.519
Who are we gonna fund to help in other countries?"

00:47:05.519 --> 00:47:06.519
And I think in our own country.

00:47:06.519 --> 00:47:12.430
So, I just want to acknowledge that this is
the only way out of the problem.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:16.329
The singular only way is to help the entrepreneurs
do their thing.

00:47:16.329 --> 00:47:18.640
It's not about some kind of aid or whatever.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.809
It's about finding the top talent, as Mitch
talks about, and getting behind them and helping

00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:24.809
them.

00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:28.400
And in Silicon Valley, having raised 30 million
dollars here for the company that I ran in

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:33.220
Web 1.0, it is totally an apprentice, journeyman,
master thing.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.400
And we all know that who have gone through
this.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.730
And it's all about the network.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.690
And I've always felt like, as we started the
BOLD program, we finally broke in to the talent

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:46.099
networks of the undergraduate populations,
started pulling them to Google and to Silicon

00:47:46.099 --> 00:47:47.099
Valley.

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:50.220
We need to do that with people mid-career--break
into the talent networks.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:54.150
And in this particular case, you have figured
out a way to break into the talent networks

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.680
on the entrepreneurial side.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.400
And we in Silicon Valley now have to step
up and help you help those guys and then bring

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.420
this to all the other cities and help this
country as well as the Greek economic crisis.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.509
'Cause the only way out of this stuff is through
entrepreneurships.

00:48:07.509 --> 00:48:08.740
So, thank you.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.020
&gt;&gt;Angela: That's a great point.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.410
Thanks for making it.

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:15.010
[applause]

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:20.349
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: When your questions have 20 great
points, [laughter] we just don't know where

00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:21.349
to jump in.

00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:23.759
It's like, great point one, great point two,
great point three.

00:48:23.759 --> 00:48:31.730
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: I had a, I think its economic issue,
follow on question kind of along.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:36.760
When you see folks who start a lot of the
start-ups in Silicon Valley, they tend to

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.480
be computer geeks.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.460
I think Arrington, I think the tech crunch
guy mentioned that.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:48.460
So, do you have any plans to get that pipeline
into your programs so that you don't get,

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:52.780
not so much so entrepreneurs, but people who
are maybe specialists from a technology perspective?

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.780
&gt;&gt;Angela: Yeah--.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.299
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: It seems to be the profile that
works.

00:48:56.299 --> 00:48:57.700
&gt;&gt;Angela: Sure.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:04.210
About half of the founders in the program
were actually developers.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:10.619
But what I think is really interesting, on
the panel last night, Pius had a really great

00:49:10.619 --> 00:49:11.619
point.

00:49:11.619 --> 00:49:16.630
He mentioned that he thinks the pipeline issue
is overplayed a little bit.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:22.230
Like, yes, STEM education is important and
everything, but we all know here in Silicon

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:25.520
Valley and in the technology industry, you
can teach yourself how to code.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.099
That's one of the beautiful things about it.

00:49:28.099 --> 00:49:33.789
And Crissan, he didn't have a computer science
degree at all, but he was coding.

00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:36.269
I mean, he built his product.

00:49:36.269 --> 00:49:42.510
So, when we look at applicants, the program
is very product-driven.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:44.109
So, we look at products.

00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:48.980
Like, yes, we look at the entrepreneurs and
everything, but we also really look at products.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.010
But I think--.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.450
I have a fine arts degree.

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:52.799
You know what I mean?

00:49:52.799 --> 00:49:58.530
So, I'm not just looking at people who have
STEM degrees at all.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:03.570
So, I really just want good people who are
driven to be successful and will do what they

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:04.950
need to do.

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.820
Those people might be developers.

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.420
Those people might be entrepreneurs with a
development team.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.690
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Just, so really quickly.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.539
I think that's an important point to bring
up.

00:50:16.539 --> 00:50:21.630
Because one of the things that Arrington said
that does ring true, one of the challenges

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:25.200
entrepreneurs have is if you aren't technical,
you have to find a technical co-founder.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.410
And that's not a racial thing.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:27.720
That's an entrepreneurial thing.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.890
The challenge that makes it uniquely African
American is that there are so few of us who

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:35.549
take up those technology fields, which goes
back to the perception problem.

00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:37.519
So, how can Google fix that?

00:50:37.519 --> 00:50:42.031
I guarantee you, if you--and Mitch can probably
attest to this through his programs--if you

00:50:42.031 --> 00:50:47.440
bring a busload of kids in here one day from
Oakland and tell them that in order to work

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.980
here, they have to learn how to program.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:52.250
The next day, the Oakland library will be
empty.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.240
Because there's a light at the end of the
tunnel.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.259
The reason why Angela's program is so groundbreaking
is 'cause there's visual examples of the possibility.

00:50:59.259 --> 00:51:02.550
So, what we have to do is continually show
examples.

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:08.200
And in this room, I've seen black Googlers
stand up en masse and they ask questions.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.650
Those are example that people say, "You know
what?

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:11.000
It's really not that hard."

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.369
And to my young woman in the back who gave
us 30 good points that I can't even remember

00:51:15.369 --> 00:51:20.609
them all, she made the point that once you
do that, you've triggered that change.

00:51:20.609 --> 00:51:21.750
You've made that exception.

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:25.470
That's what we have to figure out to do, which
goes back to Soledad telling this story.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:32.010
&gt;&gt;Mitch Kapor: So on that point, something
that companies in the Valley can do is to

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:40.119
continue to intensify their efforts to recognize
that talent comes in many different kinds

00:51:40.119 --> 00:51:41.539
of packages.

00:51:41.539 --> 00:51:47.420
'Cause it's easy to do pattern matchings as
VC and it's easy to do pattern matching as

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.609
an employer.

00:51:48.609 --> 00:51:52.829
You look for the right degree from the right
school and so on.

00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:59.070
And that's all well and good, but there are
a lot of incredibly qualified people who just

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:03.460
look different and they've had a much longer
distance travel.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:07.510
But if you're willing to look, you can see
they can do the job right now.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:12.430
And so the face of Silicon Valley could be
different than it is because there is some

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:18.230
supply coming through the pipeline that is
not landing the jobs that they could be landing.

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.279
And so, that's a call to action for employers
right now.

00:52:21.279 --> 00:52:22.279
[applause]

00:52:22.279 --> 00:52:23.930
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: That's clappable.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:25.920
Thank you, Mitch.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.900
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #8: Hi.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:32.089
I'm from Women at Google in London and just
came for the Diversity Summit.

00:52:32.089 --> 00:52:34.200
I think what you've done is just absolutely
phenomenal.

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:39.130
But I can see how it seems there's less ladies
in the scheme.

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:40.430
Was that a particular challenge?

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:41.430
Was it a focus?

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:45.019
And going forward, is it something you're
gonna particularly look at is how to get more

00:52:45.019 --> 00:52:46.850
ladies involved in this program?

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:53.000
&gt;&gt;Angela: So, the program, even though I think
we've been dubbed like, the Black Accelerator,

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.680
the program is really for underrepresented
minorities in technology.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:03.800
So, that is African Americans, but that's
also women and that's also Latinos.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:10.230
One thing that I think you guys probably weren't
able to see is like, yes, I was a woman and

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.140
Tiffany was a woman and we were in the house.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.519
But Crissan's co-founder was also a woman.

00:53:16.519 --> 00:53:19.059
Pius, Becky, she's a woman.

00:53:19.059 --> 00:53:25.430
So, we did have a good amount of women involved.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:26.460
Could there have been more?

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.460
Yes.

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:33.990
I'm excited to look at applicants for 2012,
so it'll be interesting to see what the makeup

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.470
ends up being in the future.

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:36.470
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #8: Right.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:37.470
Thanks.

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:39.370
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: We're gonna take about three more
questions.

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:42.740
That's puts the pressure on everybody.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:45.210
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #9: Hi.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.210
Thanks for coming.

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:49.650
My name is Sabrina Williams and according
to the documentary, I guess I'm an oddity.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:51.890
So, I'm a black female programmer.

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:52.890
[applause]

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:56.289
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Clappable again, please.

00:53:56.289 --> 00:54:02.530
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #9: And actually, I never thought
it was that big of a deal until I got here.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:03.530
[laughter]

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:09.849
But I was actually, as a follow on question
to that, did you or Tiffany run into any extra

00:54:09.849 --> 00:54:15.710
problems, like being the double-whammy black
and female in the course of the program?

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:21.670
&gt;&gt;Angela: For me, I actually felt like people
didn't listen to me a lot.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:23.319
And I'm short.

00:54:23.319 --> 00:54:24.319
My voice is soft.

00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:28.710
And I mean, I don't know, but I definitely
feel like people didn't listen to me enough,

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:33.680
but luckily I have people like Mitch and Navarrow
backing me up a lot throughout the summer.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.869
So, that's something that I actually didn't
expect, especially because I have a pretty

00:54:37.869 --> 00:54:39.789
strong personality.

00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:45.119
&gt;&gt;MALE #10: I'm gonna steal one of the last
questions.

00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:50.840
Steve Strong, I wanted to ask you, get back
to actually the video and say we saw the journey

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.130
from the beginning to the end and I know you
only had an hour.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:59.690
But I want some insight into what were the
"aha" moments you really transformed the team

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.220
from that first presentation to the end?

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:07.770
They showed some snippets, but were there
a few key events that really transformed the

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:08.809
team?

00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:10.890
&gt;&gt;Angela: Sure.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:16.030
So, part of what you saw was Navarrow's dinner
in the first week.

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:21.109
That was really jarring and people were like,
"Oh, we gotta do better."

00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:23.109
So, that was one point.

00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:32.859
Then we had a midway point at BlueRun Ventures
and people really still weren't up to par.

00:55:32.859 --> 00:55:38.440
From then, we didn't really have a hack-a-thon,
but we had a design-a-thon, and that was really

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:45.319
to get the visual, the UI part of everyone's
products on par.

00:55:45.319 --> 00:55:54.029
After that, I think Mitch spent like his whole
Saturday, the week before demo day, and really

00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:59.859
gave us the extra time, effort, and feedback
that was needed to make sure that people were

00:55:59.859 --> 00:56:07.140
on point because in reality, we only had like,
a day and a half to actually practice in the

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.720
facility.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:13.760
So, those were all key "aha" moments.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:19.920
You could definitely tell after each one of
those events that people got better and better

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.920
after that.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:25.119
&gt;&gt;MALE #11: I guess I'm the last question.

00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:26.779
&gt;&gt;Soledad : I think we're going to do 2.

00:56:26.779 --> 00:56:27.779
Go ahead.

00:56:27.779 --> 00:56:28.779
&gt;&gt;MALE #11: OK.

00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:29.779
My name is Curtis Pope.

00:56:29.779 --> 00:56:32.089
I was one of the new start-ups this summer.

00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:35.410
I can totally attest to what Angela's talking
about.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:42.589
It was a very aggressive schedule and all
the different things were very instrumental

00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:45.150
in helping us to be successful.

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:47.020
My question is more to Angela.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:50.720
You mentioned the community’s part.

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.049
Is part of those communities, is part of that
communities part teaching people how to code?

00:56:56.049 --> 00:56:57.049
Do you think that that's--?

00:56:57.049 --> 00:57:02.680
&gt;&gt;Angela: So, the curriculum for that is not
set yet.

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.680
So, I'm not sure.

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:09.349
I know that I wanna have at least four different
types of programs that can rotate and they'll

00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:12.119
probably be about four to six weeks long.

00:57:12.119 --> 00:57:17.569
But I'm not sure exactly if it'll be teaching
someone how to code.

00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:21.630
I mean, I know we'll definitely have to rely
on a lot of partners also to help.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:25.869
So, I'm not sure exactly what that will entail
yet.

00:57:25.869 --> 00:57:27.829
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Marvin, why don't we give you
the last question?

00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:28.829
&gt;&gt;MALE #12: Hi.

00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:29.829
I'm Marvin Avilez.

00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:32.099
I've been an entrepreneur for about 20 years
now.

00:57:32.099 --> 00:57:34.329
Grew up in the Bay Area, right here.

00:57:34.329 --> 00:57:36.670
Macromedia, Oracle, Apple, a variety of other
companies and--.

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:38.279
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: And now you're just showing off.

00:57:38.279 --> 00:57:39.279
[laughter]

00:57:39.279 --> 00:57:43.460
&gt;&gt;MALE #12: My question to you is, I was once
told and I didn't realize it, when I was about

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.740
23, that I was a minority in the business.

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:49.880
And I was shocked and never thought of it
that way.

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:56.569
And so, I ask you now, with the house and
saying, "We're gonna look at more of the minority

00:57:56.569 --> 00:58:01.670
group, or the female group, or the under-served
group," are you attracting attention that

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:05.670
might be a little bit on the negative side
because we're labeling it that way?

00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:11.660
Or, are you just another great Incubator like,
Y Combinator, or NYU Poly-Tech in New York

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.660
City?

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:13.660
'Cause that's how I see it.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.249
I see that you're taking--.

00:58:15.249 --> 00:58:17.809
You're a start-up of start-ups.

00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:19.920
And that's what was so exciting to see in
the one house, right?

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.819
Well, that's gonna grow next year and now
it's at Google.

00:58:22.819 --> 00:58:24.299
To me, that's how I see it.

00:58:24.299 --> 00:58:25.299
So, I'm curious.

00:58:25.299 --> 00:58:28.329
Have you guys confronted that issue or has
that come up at all?

00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:29.720
&gt;&gt;Angela: Yeah.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:32.609
I think we're a really great program, first
and foremost.

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:36.130
And that's my goal is just to be a really
great program.

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:41.279
But there is a problem and we don't see women
a lot.

00:58:41.279 --> 00:58:44.569
We don't see African Americans and we don't
see Latinos a lot.

00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:50.940
So really, it's a really great program, but
it's also a solution to a problem that some

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.579
people choose to ignore.

00:58:52.579 --> 00:58:54.039
And so that's really all I see it as.

00:58:54.039 --> 00:58:55.400
&gt;&gt;Soledad : And I was gonna add one thing,
too.

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.720
We get a similar question for news stories.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.440
"Well, why do the black story?

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.549
Aren't you really dividing?

00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:04.869
We're really all Americans and we all should
be under the same--.

00:59:04.869 --> 00:59:06.089
Why do Latinos?

00:59:06.089 --> 00:59:07.789
You're separating people out."

00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:12.099
And I'll give you the same answer that a woman
gave on a panel for our documentary called

00:59:12.099 --> 00:59:14.670
"Beyond Bravery: The Women of Ground Zero."

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:15.880
And someone said that very thing.

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:19.290
"You know, women were no more brave than the
men.

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:21.799
Why do you make it seem like the women are
special?"

00:59:21.799 --> 00:59:28.519
And she said, "Well you know, take a guess
at how many dogs of Ground Zero stories were

00:59:28.519 --> 00:59:29.519
done."

00:59:29.519 --> 00:59:30.519
Many.

00:59:30.519 --> 00:59:34.019
[chuckles] And that women stories also just
deserve to be told.

00:59:34.019 --> 00:59:38.329
That sometimes, we go out of our way--and
not really realize it--we're only telling

00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:39.730
one story.

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:44.369
That we were selecting only that one story
and what we're trying to do is just open it

00:59:44.369 --> 00:59:46.400
up and tell more of those stories.

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.240
So yes, do the German Shepherds of Ground
Zero.

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.740
Do the Golden Retrievers of Ground Zero. [laughter]
I am not making that up.

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.009
Those are stories that were done.

00:59:54.009 --> 00:59:55.009
[laughter]

00:59:55.009 --> 00:59:59.260
And then also do the women of Ground Zero
so that you have a more accurate picture of

00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.410
what the environment looks like.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:05.090
But only then, you're really telling the full
story.

01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:06.880
To me, it's not meant to be divisive.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.400
It is really meant to just paint a more full
picture.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:15.380
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: And just one the Accelerator piece,
I think the one thing you think about is anything

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:20.500
that's birthed that's uniquely African American
is birthed out of lack of access in that area,

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.500
right?

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.340
And I think the challenge we need to realize
is just as those Accelerators exist, but they

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.240
haven't been accepting African Americans.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.930
And I'm not gonna speak for them about why
that's the case.

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:30.619
We just know it's not happening.

01:00:30.619 --> 01:00:33.660
So, Angela's program was birthed out of a
need.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.630
And anytime something's birthed out of a need
that people may not agree with, there's gonna

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:37.630
be negatives.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:39.829
But the positives far outweigh the negatives.

01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:42.420
And I think you all guys know here that there's
a process in the Valley.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:47.470
And I think what Angela's program does is
indoctrinate a new demographic to that process

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:52.480
that feeds the need that Mitch talked about
in diverse and new ideas coming to the ecosystem.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.529
So, I think that's important.

01:00:54.529 --> 01:00:56.380
So, we're gonna wrap up.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.010
I'm gonna ask you guys three things.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:01.550
First, on behalf of CNN, please watch the
documentary November 13th at 8 PM.

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:02.550
[applause]

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:04.359
&gt;&gt;Soledad : Tell a million of your closest
friends.

01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:08.549
&gt;&gt;Navarrow: Tell a million of your closest
friends and we're at Google, so we know you

01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:10.849
have a million closest friends.

01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:16.210
The hash tag is pound sign black in America,
so please--I know you guys don't do this--but

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:20.070
tweet it as well as Google+ it and everything
else to let everybody know.

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:23.069
The second thing is I'm gonna make an ask
for Angela.

01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:27.900
There are a lot of great minority entrepreneurs
and engineers in this room.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.900
Please connect with her.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.579
She'd love to have you guys come through the
programs and connect with the future classes

01:01:32.579 --> 01:01:34.140
of the NewMe Accelerator.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.869
And lastly, please give me a hand in giving
this panel a round of applause.

01:01:39.869 --> 01:01:45.390
Thank you guys.

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:47.220
[applause]
