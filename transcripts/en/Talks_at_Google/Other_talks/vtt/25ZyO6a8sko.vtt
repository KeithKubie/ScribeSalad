00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.241
JACK COOKE: Thanks.

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.391
And first thing I have to say
is I used your toilets on my way

00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:06.890
in.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.181
And to be advertised on the
back of a toilet door, that

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:10.800
is a life achievement.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.480
That is great.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.650
I'm so proud of that.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.270
So thank you,
whoever put that up.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.960
Yeah, so today, I want to talk
to you about climbing trees.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.527
Some of you might never
have done it or some of you

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:23.360
might not have done it
since your childhood.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.735
And I want to try and persuade
as many of you as possible

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:27.780
to give it another go.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.810
I've written a book, "The
Tree Climber's Guide,"

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.400
which basically explore my
favorite trees around London.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.880
It's not specific
to London in that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.671
the sort of general
chapters and philosophy

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:40.030
are, say, climb a
tree wherever you are.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.830
But definitely the dynamic
between living in a city

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.680
and feeling a bit of stress
by never having access

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.890
to nature and the trees is
where it all stems from.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.640
I have to say Google
has been invaluable

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.050
because I've used your
satellites to hunt down

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.100
trees across the city.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.550
And I always get very excited
using Google satellite

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.820
and seeing a shadow cast by
a tall tree and thinking,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.319
I've got to go there and see
if that's a good climbing tree.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.300
Before I begin, there's a quite
important thing I should say.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.080
This book is for amateurs.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.570
It says "The Tree
Climber's Guide,"

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.200
but I am in no way a
professional climber,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.860
alpinist, mountaineer.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.780
You don't need any special skill
or strength to climb trees.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.770
You can start low till
your confidence builds

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.180
and explore trees
at your own pace.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.100
I think increasingly, we
try and sort of quantify

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.980
exercise that we do.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.230
You know, we've got to have
the right gear and gadgets

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.950
when we go jogging or
cycling or anything else.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.420
And for me, climbing trees
is the complete antithesis

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.920
of that.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.940
It's just a free
adventure for everyone.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.294
It's easy to do.

00:01:42.294 --> 00:01:43.710
Don't go and get
yourself strapped

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.001
into a harness with a helmet
and some angry instructor.

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.500
Just go and find a nice,
easy tree in your local park.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.830
It's a lot more fun.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.720
We're all instinctive
climbers, really.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.340
I mean, as we know, we
share DNA with the apes

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.584
and a common ancestor.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.250
So our deep history,
we're all climbers.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.680
And I was reading this
theory this morning,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.290
which fascinated
me, about-- you know

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.539
when you go to sleep at night?

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:05.520
And everyone does this.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.000
And suddenly, you're
sort of drifting off,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.574
and then you jerk because you
kind of roll over in the bed.

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:12.740
Well, the theory-- I don't
know if it's apocryphal--

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.140
that I was reading this
morning saying that actually

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.060
stems from when we
lived in the trees.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.616
So it was like a
knee-jerk reaction

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:19.740
to falling off a branch in
the middle of the night.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.650
So I quite like that.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.140
Anyway, I hope you can
all-- can everyone see this?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.107
This is my favorite
London planetree.

00:02:28.107 --> 00:02:29.940
They're called London
planes because they're

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.080
a cross of two different species
of planetree, one from America,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.174
one from the Far East.

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.090
Actually, that's rubbish--
from the Near East.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.270
It's kind of Turkey, Sicily
is where it's all from.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.300
This one is about five minutes
from London's biggest building

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.800
site.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.860
So the Battersea Park
power station development.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.450
And it's all going on there.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.770
So it's one of my favorites.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.020
And I think what it illustrates,
if you look at this--

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.394
and I don't know
how many of you,

00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:56.370
if you just looked at
this out of context,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.703
would have thought that's
right in the middle of London.

00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:01.090
I mean, it's the best escape.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.580
And escape is very much at
the heart of climbing trees.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.110
So yeah, we'll start with that.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.400
Climbing trees is also
an-- that's not in London.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.300
Climbing trees is also an
amazing way of exploring.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.492
How many of you climbed
trees as children?

00:03:18.492 --> 00:03:20.140
Show of hands.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.780
How many of you climbed
trees in the last five years?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.980
Excellent.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.084
A hardcore here of
committed climbers.

00:03:28.084 --> 00:03:30.000
You know, I don't think
there's any reason why

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.320
adults shouldn't enjoy climbing
trees as much as children.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.180
When you see-- if you
go into a London park,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.060
you often see toddlers
swarming around trees

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.530
and reaching up for branches,
again, kind of instinctively.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.080
You very rarely see an adult
in a tree, and if you do,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.538
it's often a little
bit suspicious.

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:49.020
You're like, what are
they doing up there?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.470
But I think children have the
best possible relationship

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.150
to the natural
world because it's

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.440
so unfettered with any
kind of assumptions.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.260
And by climbing
trees, I really feel

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.672
like I've got back to that.

00:04:01.672 --> 00:04:03.130
You know, before
I wrote this book,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.950
I had a very limited knowledge
of different tree species.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.220
But when you're focusing on
not falling out of a tree

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.880
and killing yourself,
you take in all

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.140
of the microscopic details
of different trees you climb.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.260
So now I feel like a much more
competent amateur naturalist,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.480
just through spending
time exploring the trees.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.830
So another amazing thing
about climbing trees

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.950
in London-- or any
city, for that matter--

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.670
is the fresh
perspective it gives you

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.720
on streets you've walk
down hundreds of times,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.060
very familiar places.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.180
So this is in a cedar
tree in Greenwich Park.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.465
And it's not
filtered or anything.

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:39.590
It was a sort of misty day.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.464
But looking back on the
Docklands-- you know,

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:44.855
I'm only a few stops out of the
heart of the financial heart

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:45.910
of London.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.600
But again, you could be
in the middle of nowhere.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.079
And I think getting those
kind of views from a treetop,

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:53.370
it's just a very fresh outlook.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.454
You come back down to the
ground, go back to work.

00:04:55.454 --> 00:04:57.911
You know, you climb a tree on
your lunch break around here.

00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:00.310
And you come back, and you
just feel sort of revitalized.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.495
So it's another nice side of it.

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:06.130
The thing with
trees in the cities,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.770
though, is that people are
very fond of pruning them.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.510
All the lower
branches tend to get

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.869
lopped off when councils and
park authorities and things--

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:15.660
they don't want to be
sued for you stubbing

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.900
your toe by climbing a tree.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.850
So they tend to limb them
up, is the expression.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.020
So often, you find
trees like this.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.280
This is a zelkova tree in
Hyde Park, which is actually

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.880
a kind of elm-- not the ones
that died off in Britain,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.290
but a different Caucasian elm.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.170
And passing a tree like that, if
you're addicted to it as I am,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.050
you see it and think, I've got
to get into that because it's

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.610
just got this amazing kind of
maze of branches higher up.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.660
But how do you do it?

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.640
Best thing-- take a friend.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.090
So this is a very cynical
"Times" journalist

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.270
I forced into a beech tree.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.780
But the great thing about him
is he's at least 6 foot 3".

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.080
So I'm only 5 foot 7".

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.550
But take a tall friend
with you tree-climbing,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.091
and you suddenly open up
this enormous capacity

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:58.840
to get into trees.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.070
Or, you know, you come up
to this trunk and think,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.790
there's no way I
can get up that.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.980
But with the help of Jack or
another Jack, it's very easy.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.170
I think the other
thing this illustrates

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.180
is if you do start climbing
trees again and enjoying

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.690
it and doing more
and more, don't just,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.399
like an adrenaline
junkie, rush up a tree

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:17.898
and come straight
back to the bottom

00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:19.180
and go about your business.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.720
Spend some time in the branches.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.790
Nothing like having a
cup of coffee in a tree,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.020
as we're doing,
shooting the breeze

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.290
and setting the world to rights.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.460
It's a wonderful space, I
think, particularly in summer.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.392
Obviously, deciduous
tree, so it's not in leaf

00:06:35.392 --> 00:06:36.100
when we did this.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.770
But it's sort of like
having your own summer

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.800
house above London.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.490
And it's a great space to take
time out and to really think

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.650
and-- you know, take some
work up there if you want to.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.520
I mean, it's available.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.250
The other thing, I think, is
that a big problem for people

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.791
that are going back
to climbing trees

00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:58.800
after having not done it
for a long time is fear.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.770
As children, we tend to have
a slightly more devil-may-care

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.620
attitude to doing
things like this.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.440
And as you grow up, you
kind of-- just stepping up

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.760
on the kitchen sideboard
is scary from a vertigo

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.460
perspective.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.610
So again, I'd say
start on mature trees.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.365
This is a hornbeam in Glasglow.

00:07:16.365 --> 00:07:17.740
And this branch,
they're actually

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.630
called ironwood because of
the density of the wood.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.519
But you look at that,
there's no way--

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.060
it doesn't matter
if you're 25 stone,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.720
you're not going to
break that branch.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.395
It's an awesome tree.

00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:29.020
And there's lots of
trees around London

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.710
with low branches
like that you can just

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.000
spend some time getting used
to climbing again, swing about

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.542
on it, and then you can
progress and climb higher.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.920
People watching--
I mean, it's great.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.882
Honestly, I'm not a peeping Tom.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:47.840
But going up trees and
watching the world go by

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.940
is one of the best things.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.830
This is a swamp cypress
in St. James Park,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.930
right next to Buckingham Palace.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.392
And you can climb about
60 foot above the city

00:07:57.392 --> 00:07:58.850
because it's just
a natural ladder.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.580
It's got branches
every two feet.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.130
I was a bit worried I was going
to get snipered by someone

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.304
on the Buckingham Palace roof.

00:08:07.304 --> 00:08:08.720
But actually, I
think I might just

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.620
read you the extract
from the book on this one

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.620
because it's a fun tree.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:21.430
"The royal perch, St.
James Park, swamp cypress.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.830
If, like me, your chances
of taking tea with the queen

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.125
are slim, you can indulge in the
next best thing-- an audience

00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.500
with Buckingham Palace from
the summit of neighboring St.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.280
James's Park.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.400
At the park's west end,
facing the wedding cake

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.220
of the royal residence,
stand two giant trees.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.140
Imports from America's deep
south, these twin swamp

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.330
cypresses have been drinking
London lake water for 90 years.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.500
Of the two, the tree to
the south of the lake

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.440
provides the easier ascent.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.350
Making my way across
the blue bridge,

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.530
I nimbly dodge trains of
tourists force-feeding ducks.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.750
Once on the south side,
I follow the water west

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.540
towards the palace.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.389
The swamp cypress
is hard to miss,

00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:00.430
standing head and shoulders
above its neighboring

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.460
trees, straight-backed
as a palace guard.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.170
The climber is
rarely conspicuous,

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.790
but to avoid an audience, I
carefully time my approach.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.870
The lowest branch is
within easy reach.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.090
Once I've gained this and
climbed a little higher,

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.970
I am hidden from
the crowds and pause

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.860
to admire the strange pink hue
of the tree in which I sit.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.000
The bark on the trunk
has a stringy texture,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.170
smoothing in places to
a paper consistency.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.970
Looking up, I see a rosy
stairway spiraling above me

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.520
for 70 feet, the branches
closely spaced with plentiful

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.750
holds.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.720
The thicker arms
grow in a helix.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.820
Ascending, I follow
these around the trunk

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.390
as if climbing a church tower.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.430
Before long, I'm well above
the ice-cream crowds, peepholes

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.240
in the summer foliage revealing
a network of paths below.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.080
At the tree's
peak, four branches

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.690
fan out like the twisted
prongs of a fork.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.310
Sitting at their
junction, I have

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.890
a comfortable saddle for my
legs and a strong support

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.320
for my back.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.460
To the south, the tiny
capsules of the London Eye

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.850
can be seen
revolving in silence.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.850
In front and far
below, the toy soldiers

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.570
of Buckingham Palace
parade between pill boxes

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.740
and Russian pelicans glide
along the length of the lake.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.840
The sound of taxis and cyclists
waging war on the [INAUDIBLE],

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.130
filters through a
canopy of green needles,

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.500
soon to turn cinnamon
orange with autumn.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.560
Unlike most other
conifers, this giant

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.490
will drop its leaves
at the end of the year,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.970
living up to its nickname,
the bald cypress.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.110
I descend the spiral in reverse,
returning to planet Earth

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.840
like a newborn god.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.070
Exiting the tree's shadow, I try
not to startle the man asleep

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.996
on the adjacent bench."

00:10:35.996 --> 00:10:37.370
Other trouble with
climbing trees

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.940
is that you get an ego
from being above everyone.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.282
So I don't actually think
of myself as a newborn god.

00:10:42.282 --> 00:10:42.990
I should clarify.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.970
So some other views of people.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.360
It's Ravenscourt Park, a
cedar tree in West London.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.680
This is a great tree.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.570
This is a horse chestnut in
Temple Gardens on embankment.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.642
And it's actually above the
vent of the London Underground.

00:11:00.642 --> 00:11:02.350
So if you climb it,
you have to use that.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.310
It's got a grill,
so you're going

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:04.510
to fall down onto the track.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.830
But if you use it to
climb into the tree,

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.280
you can see the district
line trains passing

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.020
underneath the branches and
feel the vibration of the steel

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.230
through the roots of the trees
and watch people in suits

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.414
on their phones, as well.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.610
I've taken lots of snapshots.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.110
If any of you are interested
in seeing more photos of London

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.800
from the trees, I have
an Instagram account

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.130
called treetop city,
which you can check out.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.680
But yeah, I take lots of
shots of the city itself.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.860
So this is down in Shadwell
in East London, on the Thames.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.089
[INAUDIBLE]
Islington roundabout,

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:43.130
which has an amazing
Californian pine tree where,

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.320
again, you can very easily,
without any strength or skill,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.004
get right up above
the Holloway Road.

00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:50.420
It is completely
illegal, as well.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.140
But, you know.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.632
So the book is full of
my wife's drawings, who

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.840
was heavily pregnant when
I was writing it so refused

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.923
to climb any of the trees.

00:11:58.923 --> 00:12:01.780
But I was thinking I was going
to read you another extract,

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.600
but I think I'll leave
that one for now.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.845
It's a horse chestnut.

00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:06.470
In the book, they've
all got nicknames.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.428
That's the nostrils,
for obvious reasons.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.100
I think the other fantastic
thing about sitting in trees

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.360
and, you know, whiling
away an hour or two

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.910
is the complexity
of the tree itself

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.580
that you don't see
from the ground.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.651
So this is the same cedar in
Greenwich Park from above.

00:12:27.651 --> 00:12:29.150
And it's a bit like
a roller coaster

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.650
trying to climb up into this.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.380
And you'd never see that kind
of architecture of the tree

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.685
from below.

00:12:35.685 --> 00:12:37.060
There's all kind
of hidden views.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.770
So this is the roots of a
planetree down in the River

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.650
Wandle in South London.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.320
This is a tree in
Glasgow, another hornbeam.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.420
There's no filter on this.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.100
These are the lichens
and the moss growing up

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.100
in the bowl of the tree.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.760
And climbing up, you suddenly
see this amazing sort

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.243
of rainbow universe inside.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.750
It's amazing the
variety of species

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.580
planted within the
city limit, as well.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.870
You think of London,
you don't necessarily

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.120
think there's going to be a
wealth of different trees.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.934
But within the M25, you get
the most extraordinary trees

00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:10.850
from around the world.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.750
This is a chestnut-leaved
oak, from Iran

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.140
is where it's native to.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.430
And it's been growing in
London for about 150 years.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.002
But it's a great tree.

00:13:20.002 --> 00:13:21.460
I mean, climbing
through this, it's

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.740
like sort of doing the limbo
all the way around the tree

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.750
because it's got so many
branches hugging the ground.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.770
This is just a common beech tree
down in Richmond Park, which

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.520
has being coppiced
back to the ground.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.780
So some of you are probably
much better naturalists than me.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.600
But coppicing is basically
a medieval practice

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.477
of cutting wood
from beech and oak

00:13:43.477 --> 00:13:45.560
and cutting the branches
right down to the ground,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.090
and then they regrow.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.930
And this one I call
the tree of knowledge

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.305
because it looks
so like a snake.

00:13:50.305 --> 00:13:53.233
There's a sort of hissing
tongue coming out of the front.

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.316
Great place to take a
sandwich and spend a Sunday.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.910
The other thing is
all over London,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.520
because we're such a
crowded city and so dense,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.869
you find trees with
graffiti on them.

00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:08.160
When I first started climbing,
I was a bit of a purist,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.490
and I was thinking,
this is a tattoo

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.740
that the tree never agreed to.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.340
It's a bit of a
shame that people

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.590
are writing their names on it.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.120
But the more you
climb, actually,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.620
especially when you get high up
and find sort of people saying,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.010
I love whoever.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:22.680
I love God.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.310
God loves me.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.770
It's at 40 foot
above the ground.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.270
They kind of feel a bit like
the living history of the tree.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.940
And bark over time-- this is
another beech, a weeping beach

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.670
in Victoria Park.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.540
The bark is obviously
growing, and it

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.880
tends to meld the graffiti.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.210
Old graffiti tends to become
almost part of the tree's

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.320
own skin.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.320
So it's fun to observe.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.270
I found a lot of
strange things in trees

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.380
that people have left there.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.620
Just to give you a short list--
vodka bottles, chicken bones,

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.690
balloons, keys, coins,
condoms, flower arrangements,

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.620
and a crucifix, which
was very exciting,

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.990
wedged in the trunk
of an oak tree.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.060
So the list goes on.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.070
But yeah, there's
all kinds of things

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.236
to discover in the branches.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.580
People often ask me what my
tips are for climbing trees.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.080
But as I said at
the beginning, this

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.120
is very much an
every man, woman,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.290
and child's amateur book.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.310
So I don't have sage advice.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.410
But a few things I would
say-- climb in bare feet

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.470
if you're prepared to.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.612
It's a much more
immersive experience.

00:15:31.612 --> 00:15:33.570
You're actually less
likely to slip, especially

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.490
if you climb in the
rain in rubber heels.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.460
You're just going to
fall out the tree.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.090
And you're much less likely
to do damage to the tree,

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.990
so that's another bonus.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.940
Look out for deadwood.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.398
Nearly every tree
carries deadwood.

00:15:44.398 --> 00:15:46.070
So as you go up,
tap the branches.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.820
Make sure you're not
climbing on something

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.440
that's got necrosis and is
going to fall under your weight

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.370
or fall on someone beneath you.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.470
And remember the way down.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.840
I think when I first started
climbing trees in London,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.050
I got very excited
by what looked

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.220
like these very easy
ways to just get

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.587
above the city and sort
of 50 foot up without ever

00:16:04.587 --> 00:16:06.920
really thinking about how I
was going to get down again.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.420
So I had some really
terrible moments

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.670
where I thought, oh, I'm
going to have to call someone

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.836
with a ladder, and it's
going to be so embarrassing,

00:16:13.836 --> 00:16:15.520
and the publisher's
going to hate it,

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.478
and all the rest of it.

00:16:16.478 --> 00:16:19.267
So yeah, do always remember
it's much harder to climb down,

00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:20.100
for obvious reasons.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.430
You're kind of tired.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.680
And you can actually look
down and see the drop and sort

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.261
of blindly feel for footholds.

00:16:29.557 --> 00:16:31.890
I think, actually, the best
thing about writing the book

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.352
has been the stories
people have shared with me

00:16:34.352 --> 00:16:35.560
on the back of it coming out.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.730
So I've had all kinds
of correspondence

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.080
from people around
the UK sending

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.850
in their tree-climbing stories.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.870
So I had, actually,
only yesterday,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.140
on the back of some
media coverage,

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.390
I had a lady write
in her late 80s

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.580
to tell me about climbing
her local tree in Oxford

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.814
during the Second World War and
pretending it was a Lancaster

00:16:56.814 --> 00:16:58.230
bomber while the
Battle of Britain

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.910
was raging over the Channel.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.360
It was an amazing story.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.119
Another old guy from
down in Coventry

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.280
wrote to me with a story of
climbing elm trees, 25 million

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.339
of which were wiped out in the
70s and 80s across England,

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.405
but also North America.

00:17:13.405 --> 00:17:15.030
So that was a nice
sort of time capsule

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.740
because you just can't
climb them anymore.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.680
And not just children's
memories, either,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.950
but adults who've used
tree climbing, sometimes,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.251
as a form of therapy.

00:17:27.251 --> 00:17:27.750
So yeah.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.420
I mean, I thought--
I've got a little video

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.290
that I'd like to play you.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.010
But what would be
great is if any of you

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.670
wanted to share your own
tree-climbing stories

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.710
or ask me any
questions, as well.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.570
But let's play the video first.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.600
Actually, this picture here,
just very quickly-- my book's

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.100
free.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.900
So you don't have to buy that.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:45.941
This book you should buy.

00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:49.160
This is by an Italian, dead
Italian, called Italo Calvino.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.250
I don't know if any
of you know him.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.350
"Invisible Cities"
with his famous book.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.080
He's a novelist.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.577
And he wrote a book called
"The Baron in the Trees,"

00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:58.410
which was an inspiration
for me because it's

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.260
set in this mythical Italian
valley when-- at one time,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.520
Europe and Britain would have
been so heavily forested.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.270
The idea of the book
is this kid climbs out

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:12.300
of his dad's palatial
dining room in rebellion

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.780
against living the life
of a sort of aristocrat

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.210
and disappears into a
tree in the park, age 12.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.050
And he doesn't come
down for 60 years.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.340
So he sort of starts
revolutions in the trees,

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.450
makes love in the trees,
just hangs out in trees.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.770
And even when he dies, as
you'll find out in the book,

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.645
it doesn't come back to ground.

00:18:29.645 --> 00:18:32.929
So wonderful book, Italo
Calvino "Baron in the Trees,"

00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:33.804
if you're interested.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.340
So these are some of
the trees from the book.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.870
So, yeah, does anyone
have any questions

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.284
or want to know why I got
stopped by the police?

00:18:46.284 --> 00:18:47.782
AUDIENCE: What did
the police say?

00:18:47.782 --> 00:18:50.240
JACK COOKE: It was-- well, it's
not a funny story, exactly.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.530
But I found it quite funny.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.570
I was climbing in
Brompton Cemetery.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.320
So in the book, there is a
whole chapter on cemeteries.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.790
I must hasten to add I'm not
disrespectful of the dead.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.489
But I do think
climbing in cemeteries

00:19:02.489 --> 00:19:04.030
where there aren't
active internments

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.284
or where you're not actually
next to graves, recent graves,

00:19:08.284 --> 00:19:09.700
is kind of its own
form of tribute

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.825
because all the bodies are
in the branches, anyway.

00:19:11.825 --> 00:19:14.462
So that's my very
personal take on it.

00:19:14.462 --> 00:19:15.920
But yes, I was in
Brompton Cemetery

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.350
climbing another pine tree
above Chelsea stadium.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.680
So it goes-- it's a
very tall tree, again.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.704
And I came down.

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:24.120
If anyone knows
Brompton Cemetery,

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.610
there's kind of three big
marble arches on the north end.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.534
And I came down.

00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:30.200
I'm brushing pine needles out of
my hair and green at the knees.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.810
And this police
car comes screaming

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.689
through the front entrance.

00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:35.480
And I think, this can't
possibly be for me.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.729
I mean, I was climbing a tree.

00:19:36.729 --> 00:19:38.810
I haven't killed
anyone or anything.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.789
And this big, bearded
copper go out.

00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:41.580
And he was smiling.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.430
And he said, where
you just up a tree?

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.680
And I thought, I'd better
be innocent and honest.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.704
So I said, yes.

00:19:46.704 --> 00:19:47.620
Was I not meant to be?

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.370
I'm very sorry.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.786
I'm training to
be a tree surgeon.

00:19:49.786 --> 00:19:51.060
That was a lie.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.280
And he said, a woman just
rang up the Hammersmith

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.530
and Fulham Police Station
to say a young man was

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.064
about to commit suicide.

00:19:58.064 --> 00:19:59.480
So he thought he
was going to find

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.920
me hanging from a
branch, hence the speed

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.250
and haste of response,
and hence the big smile

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.030
and letting me off
with a warning.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.780
But yeah, I mean, I
think my favorite thing

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.390
about sort of this
borderline trespassing

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.040
and the ambiguity of
some of these laws

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.120
is that, especially in
summer or in evergreens,

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.312
you're so hidden from
the city that actually,

00:20:20.312 --> 00:20:22.770
no rational-- no one's going
to bother to stop you, really.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.000
I mean, I would say don't
climb ancient or fragile trees.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Don't climb saplings.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.458
But there's plenty-- there's
seven and a half million trees

00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:31.060
in this city.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.120
There's plenty to climb.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.970
78 in the book.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.290
There's a lot more to discover.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.870
MALE SPEAKER: Anyone
got any other questions?

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.788
JACK COOKE: Or stories
about climbing trees?

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.000
I'm not.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.295
I mean, I think what
I try and lay out

00:20:48.295 --> 00:20:49.670
in the first
chapters of the book

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.177
is this is to encourage
people to climb trees again

00:20:53.177 --> 00:20:54.760
and to use these as
a kind of platform

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.130
to go and find their own.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.240
I would say that I
think any damage done

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.410
to any of these trees,
the experience of getting

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.660
into a tree and that
visceral having to hold on

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.820
and actually pay attention--
because I find in my life,

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.730
and in my last job
particularly, I

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.110
go through a whole
day of routine

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.020
without really paying
attention to anything.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.395
Climbing into a
tree was suddenly

00:21:16.395 --> 00:21:18.650
this focus on everything.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.720
And I think the value of that,
both to children and adults,

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.940
outweighs any damage done.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.030
So I think if you asked, like--
if you went to Kew Gardens,

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.740
where you shouldn't climb
trees-- they're in the book--

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.460
and asked some of
the botanists there

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.570
or the tree surgeons what got
them into tree conservation,

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.700
I think a lot of them
would say climbing trees.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.220
So it's not-- I think the value
of that is more important.

00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:47.550
MALE SPEAKER: Could you
repeat the question, as well?

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.480
JACK COOKE: Oh, yes.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.896
How did I get into
climbing trees?

00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:53.270
So I worked in an office
next to Regent's Park.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.970
And it was this
tiny little attic

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.215
on the fourth floor
that had-- it should

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.840
have had an amazing
view over the park,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.804
but it had a massive
concrete wall built

00:22:00.804 --> 00:22:02.470
across the windows,
which apparently was

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.740
to hide the servants from the
high society of the day that

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.880
built the building.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.400
Anyway, one day the whole
office flooded during a storm

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.300
in summertime.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.720
And the caretaker came in
and opened up the skylights

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.542
onto the roof.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:15.750
And I went out onto the roof.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.882
And I was reading this
book, "Baron in the Trees,"

00:22:17.882 --> 00:22:19.090
circumstantially at the time.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.798
I looked out across
the park and thought,

00:22:20.798 --> 00:22:23.480
I've got to take a sandwich
and go and climb a tree.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.400
So I went down to the park,
found a very easy tree,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.990
climbed up.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.700
And I was probably 30 feet
up this tree or something.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.990
And between the leaves
and the branches,

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.312
this view opened out of
the BT Tower and Warren

00:22:34.312 --> 00:22:35.770
street and all the
hospital blocks,

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.910
just kind of perfectly
framed in the view.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.470
And I thought, I
really want to share

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.470
these views and this
experience and this space

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.770
because London is
overcrowded, but I just

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.360
felt this is sort
of virgin territory.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.729
So yeah.

00:22:48.729 --> 00:22:50.520
And then I became
addicted and quit my job.

00:22:53.407 --> 00:22:55.240
Probably a mistake in
the long run, but hey.

00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:02.050
Yeah.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.890
I'm doing, I think I'm
booked in to do one

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.270
at Wilderness Festival.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.600
I don't know if any of you
know Wilderness Festival.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.190
I've never been,
but wonderful trees.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.780
I'd certainly love to.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.310
I think I'd probably have to get
all kinds of waivers for people

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.540
to sign so if they
fell out, [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.260
But yeah, I mean, there
are some really nice trees.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.770
I was doing-- there's a fun
little video on the Londonist,

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.490
if any of you subscribe
to that, of me

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.760
climbing a tree in Clissold
Park, sort of Stoke Newington

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.550
area.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.770
And that's the kind of tree
you could get 20 people

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.336
into on these low branches.

00:23:34.336 --> 00:23:36.210
And it'd be a really
fun one for a tree tour.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.086
So yeah, I'd definitely
be up for doing that.

00:23:38.086 --> 00:23:38.585
Yeah.

00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:39.160
It'd be fun.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.810
I mean, you know, if you're
a parkour expert or a rock

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.059
climber and you can do multiple
pull-ups on your little

00:23:57.059 --> 00:23:59.600
fingers, then obviously, you're
going to be great at climbing

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.100
trees.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.110
I'm neither of those things.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.080
But I think the
appeal to me of trees

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.070
is that almost anyone
can do it, and you

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.950
don't need that enormous
upper body strength of things.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.780
I've had some sort of
contact from parkour.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.250
People have been like, yeah!

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.700
Can we use this tree to get
from this rooftop to this one?

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.340
And I think, maybe.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.700
You can.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.960
But no, I mean,
there's some sort

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.572
of movements now of people.

00:24:25.572 --> 00:24:27.780
There's one guy from Hampstead
Heath who kind of runs

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.155
these workshops where he-- I
think they're called Evolve,

00:24:30.155 --> 00:24:31.570
Move, Play or something.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.550
And that group,
they're very athletic.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.050
And they're very good at sort
of swinging between branches

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.175
and all that kind of thing.

00:24:39.175 --> 00:24:42.620
Me, I like to just sort of
take it slow and basically idle

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.311
around in trees.

00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:45.060
AUDIENCE: Do you find
it quite meditative?

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.170
JACK COOKE: Very, yeah.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.280
Again, someone said
to me whether the book

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.164
was all about mindfulness.

00:24:51.164 --> 00:24:53.080
I'd never really heard
this expression before,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.160
so I had to look it up.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.010
But it kind of is
because it's-- again,

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:01.740
the space to reflect and just
take time out from your day is

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.380
unparalleled.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.840
I mean, maybe
someone can tell me,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.506
but I don't know
another place in London

00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:08.600
where I feel that opportunity.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.600
So yeah, definitely.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.855
That's a key thing
about it for me.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.090
Yeah.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:40.950
Like an app?

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.470
Again, I say actually
just climbing

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.824
a tree is so much better than
a textbook in that I climbed

00:25:52.824 --> 00:25:53.990
a lot of trees in ignorance.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.240
But because I was
writing the book,

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.622
I bought-- this is like
a plug for my publisher--

00:25:59.622 --> 00:26:01.080
but the "Collins
Tree Guide," which

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.940
is a little handheld book.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.307
And just going back to the
same trees again and again

00:26:06.307 --> 00:26:08.890
and looking them up-- and a lot
of the trees in the book, when

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.306
I was writing it, I still
wasn't sure what species it was.

00:26:11.306 --> 00:26:13.630
So I was constantly
trying to find out.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.627
But I think there's some--
especially if you climb trees

00:26:17.627 --> 00:26:19.710
in winter or deciduous
trees when they haven't got

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.235
their leaves, there's
so many ways to tell

00:26:22.235 --> 00:26:24.360
that it's that tree when
you're up in the branches.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.950
You can look at buds that
stay on the tree over winter,

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.440
different-- the bark
itself, as well.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.710
So this is not a short answer
or particularly helpful.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.610
I think just immersion in it.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.880
The more you climb trees,
the more interested

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.674
you are in finding
out about them.

00:26:41.674 --> 00:26:43.090
So those textbooks
that might seem

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.830
very dry to begin with actually
became really exciting to me

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.360
because I was like, oh,
it's that tree that's

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.610
against St. Paul's Cathedral
that I nearly fell out of

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:50.917
is actually a sweet gum tree.

00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:52.050
Who knew?

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.600
So I think that was
the process for me.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.355
But yeah, no easy
answer, I'm afraid.

00:26:56.355 --> 00:26:57.980
And I've got a long
way to go, as well.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.150
I'm still learning.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.352
For me?

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:12.160
I think my wife might leave
me if I keep climbing trees.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.420
Every holiday we've
been on, I kind of

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.380
force her to stop the car on
every roadside and climb trees.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.290
It's such an obsession.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.140
So no.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.520
I think I would love
to write another book,

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.194
but it won't be about trees
directly, I don't think.

00:27:26.194 --> 00:27:28.236
MALE SPEAKER: Well, if
there's no more questions,

00:27:28.236 --> 00:27:30.111
you're gonna stay around
and sign some books?

00:27:30.111 --> 00:27:30.890
JACK COOKE: Yeah.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.040
MALE SPEAKER: So
thank you very much.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.415
JACK COOKE: Thanks
for having me.

00:27:33.415 --> 00:27:35.960
[APPLAUSE]
