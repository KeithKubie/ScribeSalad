00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.767
So I was sure nothing
would come of Yoda.

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:06.233
And here's Yoda the wise.

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.400
Who's to say?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.166
So who gave you that call?

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.934
Actually, George.

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:12.734
George.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:13.433
George.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:17.767
And the pope.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.700
George Lucas, through
his producer, asked Jim--

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.967
we're doing them up in
a movie in Los Angeles--

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:29.533
Jim was obviously too
busy and knew he hadn't he

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.000
couldn't quite do that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.800
He has an incredible talents,
but this one he couldn't quite

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.700
handle as much as
I could, he felt.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.433
And that's how it happened,
it was through support of Jim.

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.300
And then I started doing it.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.934
So you invented the voice?

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:47.900
Yeah.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.934
Did anyone tell
you, speak this way?

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:52.266
How could anyone
possibly tell you

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.233
to speak that way,
because no one had

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.200
ever spoken that way before?
- Right.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.567
You know why he says that?

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:56.400
Why he talks that way?

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.867
I've no idea.

00:00:57.867 --> 00:00:59.767
There's always a
reason for something.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:02.066
I've come to learn
that as a scientist.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.367
Yeah?

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:06.533
My view of it is--
first of all, it was

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.600
Larry and George who wrote it--

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.667
and I said, hey, this is nice--

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.200
they use it halfway, and I
said, can I do it all the time?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.433
They said yeah.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.033
The way I view it is, Yoda is--

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:20.567
This is where adjectives and
nouns are switched in places--

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.800
I'm not smart
enough enough to know

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.166
what an adjective or a noun is.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.467
OK.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.700
Yeah, the sentence is fully
understandable but clearly

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.500
from another syntax.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.867
It's because that's the
way the original Jedi spoke.

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:34.834
It was a very formal
and elegant language.

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:38.400
He is now 700, 800
years old at that time.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.166
And not unlike the
Native Americans

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.934
trying to keep their
language alive,

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:46.433
he also is trying to
keep the formal Jedi

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.200
language alive while
these surf kids

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.867
are talking to their language.

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:51.000
Right.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.500
And so he feels a
tremendous responsibility

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.100
to talk that way, even though
nobody else talks that way.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.066
Even though he could probably
speak the way everyone else

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.066
speaks?
- Right.

00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.400
But he has the
integrity and he feels--

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.767
A cultural imperative.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.066
Yep.

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.734
That's that's what I believe.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.667
Well, you don't have to
believe it because you did it.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:08.500
So therefore it is.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.333
Yeah,

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.000
It is.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.467
And it gives him dignity
and an integrity that's

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:16.700
important to his gravitas.

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:23.633
So Adam, why is
Yoda so beloved?

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:26.734
I mean, I think, first
of all, the performance

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:29.166
that Frank gives is incredible.

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.600
And it's got-- because
he's right there actually

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.967
puppeting the character,
there's a real humanity

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:35.767
to the performance.

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:37.333
You really connect with it.

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.767
And then he starts out,
this small little creature

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:41.600
living in the bog.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.533
And he turns out to be
this wise, incredibly

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:46.934
powerful creature.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:51.100
That contrast is so interesting
and funny and stays with you.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.834
Charles where you come in?

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.200
I think we all
want to be Yoda.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.100
We all somehow feel
we're inadequate, perhaps

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.066
a little ugly, a little short--

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.500
but within us we have
the power to move

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500
mountains with just our mind.
