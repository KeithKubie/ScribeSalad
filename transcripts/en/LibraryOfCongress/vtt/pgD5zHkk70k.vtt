&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.490
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
Good evening, everyone.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.730
I am Betsy Peterson,
the director

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.080
of the American Folk Life Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.800
And behalf of all of
the staff of the center,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.440
I want to welcome you all this
evening to our latest offering

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.140
in the Homegrown Concert
series, which is today

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.480
or tonight I should say.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420
We are going to hear four groups

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.910
of wonderful musicians
interpreting music

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.950
from the collections

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.080
in the American Folk
Life Center's archives,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.570
hence the term the
Archives Challenge.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.630
As usual, our performance
tonight is going to be recorded

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.380
for later webcast and for
inclusion in our collections.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.980
So with that said, if you do
have a cell phone turned on,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.280
please turn it off at this point

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.160
or forever be immortalized
in our archive.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.280
The Homegrown series, just a
little bit of background for all

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.090
of you, the Homegrown
series is an opportunity

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.280
for the American Folk
Life Center to work

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.500
with folk arts coordinators,
ethno-musicologists,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.400
cultural heritage specialists
from throughout the country

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.760
to identify some of the very
best artists, musicians,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.630
dancers, storytellers, to sharer
their art and their tradition

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.220
with all of you and
with all of us.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.990
So if you want any more
information on the series,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.710
just please go to our website
which is www.LOC.gov/folklife.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.110
A little bit of background now

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.020
about the Archive
Challenge itself.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.670
This is our second
Archive Challenge.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.190
We did one about a
year or so ago here

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.660
in the Coolidge Auditorium.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.590
And the idea is that
we work with musicians

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.840
from around the region to
identify some of the songs

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.120
in the archive that they can
interpret and learn, arrange

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.850
and perform for all of you.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.190
It's an exciting opportunity
for us and an experiment

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.490
that we very much
wish to continue.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.730
So now to tell you a
little bit more about all

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.120
of the artists tonight,
I'm going to turn things

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.530
over to Steve Winick,
our writer/editor

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.520
and folklorist here at
the Folk Life Center.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.680
And actually a musician
in his own right.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.510
So please welcome Steve Winick.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.950
[ Applause ]

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Good evening.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.990
As Betsy said, I
am Steve Winnick.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.960
I am the writer and editor in
the American Folk Life Center

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.790
and I'm a folklorist and I'm
also a singer in the first group

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.200
that will be performing tonight.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.100
So I should say that one of
my jobs here at the Center is

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.390
to write about the great stuff
that we do and the great ways

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.030
that our archive has
been used in the past.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.650
And it came to our
attention over the years

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.160
that our archive
has been used by --

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.240
[ Inaudible ]

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.540
And from Animals to
Feist to Nina Simone,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.450
all kinds of people have
drawn on the archive.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.780
And our thought was, well,
how do we encourage artists

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.960
to continue using the archive?

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.310
And we came up with the idea
of the Archive Challenge.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.360
And it was really my colleague
Jennifer Cutting whose idea

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.660
it was.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.390
And so I am going to
bring out the first group.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.950
I'll tell you a little bit more
about the Archive Challenge

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.760
and how it's worked over
the course of the evening.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.220
But right now I'm going
to bring out my colleagues

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.010
in Ship's Company Chanteymen.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.350
Oh. Can we?

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.040
All right.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.800
So as I said, we are
Ship's Company Chanteymen,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.580
comprising Myron Peterson,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.040
if you can all wave
when I say your name.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.060
[ Applause ]

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.420
Dallas Valley, Michael Bosworth
and myself, Steve Winnick.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.030
And I'm wearing several
hats this evening.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.040
[ Laughter ]

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.860
And we are going to be joined
also by Jennifer Cutting

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.360
who as I said is the person
whose idea the Archive Challenge

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.660
really was.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.650
So we four singers are
part of a larger group

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.210
that is called Ship's Company,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.030
and that performs
historical reenactments

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.450
and nautical education.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.970
And Ship's Company
reenacts several eras

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.000
of American naval history,
especially the war of 1812

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.920
which is what these
uniforms are associated with.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.080
Believe it or not, these
hats were worn aboard ships

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.690
of war while sailing.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.620
And what we know from historical
records is that sailors went

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.320
through several of them a year
because they would blow off

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.730
and then they had
to buy a new one.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.740
So I will be sort of narrating
our set and telling you

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.290
about the songs that we've
selected from the archive.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.400
Our first song was collected
by James Madison Carpenter

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.180
who was a great American
collector of the 1920's

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.230
and early 1930's, kind of
an underrepresented era

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.970
in folk song collecting.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.930
And he collected both in the
United States and in the UK.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.360
He was American.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.290
He was from Mississippi in fact,
but he was a Harvard scholar

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.080
and he was really interested in
sea chanteys and nautical music.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.180
He actually wrote his
dissertation about that.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.090
But his advisor was a man
named George Lyman Kittredge.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.820
And Kittredge had been the
assistant of Francis James Child

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.250
who is such a famous ballad
scholar that we have a subgenre

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.590
of ballads that we refer
to as Child ballads.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.560
And one of the reasons that
Carpenter was very interested

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.440
in this particular song is
that it is a sea chantey

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.050
and it's a very well-known
sea chantey.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.920
It's a version of
Blow The Man Down,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.810
which is possibly the
best-known sea chantey there is.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.510
But the lyrics are
totally different

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.730
from most other versions
of Blow The Man Down,

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.150
except for the refrains.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.980
And the lyrics are in fact
one of these Child ballads

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.900
which is a story
about the devil.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.570
Carpenter collected this
combination of Blow The Man Down

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.160
and The Devil Ballad
twice in New York City

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.740
at Sailor Snug Harbor
in Staten Island

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.320
which was a retired
sailors' home.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.910
And once in South
Wales in Cardiff.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.630
And I kind of combined the
verses from these three versions

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.890
of this song to get the
one that we're going to do.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.180
So this is called
Blow The Man Down.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.960
And now this is your
interactive part of the evening,

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.760
because you're going
to sing with us.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.480
You sing on the refrains.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.130
And many of you will know
this because it is one

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.430
of the best-known
songs out there.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.340
So I'm going to sing, "Who lives
in a pineapple under the sea?"

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.330
And you're going to sing,
"Way-hey blow the man down."

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.140
"Absorbent and porous
and yellow is he."

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.310
"Give me some time to
blow the man down."

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.810
Except of course those
are not the words

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.480
that Carpenter collected.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.680
Carpenter collected these words.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.490
Oh, and I will say there's one
reference in the song which is

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.220
to a commercial traveler.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.640
That's just an old word
for a traveling salesman.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.080
And there's a great tradition

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.490
of traveling salesmen also
being folklore performers

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.790
and folklore collectors.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.150
And so it's appropriate
that the person

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.650
in the song meets a
commercial traveler who has

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.540
that occupation as well.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:00.370
So -- [Singing] As I was
a-walking one morning in spring,

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.270
way-hey blow the man down.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.190
I found myself next
to an old country inn,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.430
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.760
I sat myself down and
I ordered some gin,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.630
way-hey blow the man down.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.190
A commercial traveler
was the next to come in,

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.590
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.800
We talked of the weather
and things of the day,

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.590
way-hey blow the man down.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.900
Says he hears a story
I've learned on my way,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.610
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.830
It's of a poor tailor
in London did dwell,

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.560
way-hey blow the man down.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.550
The devil he came to
him once out of hell,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.290
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.360
Says he my good friend
now, I've come a long way,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.110
way-hey blow the man down.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.270
Especially this visit
to you for to pay,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.810
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.050
Not you nor your son nor
your daughter I crave,

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.760
way-hey blow the man down.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.570
It's your dirty old wife,
she's a drunk old jade,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.490
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.530
So the devil he bundled
her into a sack,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.090
way-hey blow the man down.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.240
And away down to hell
with the wife on his back,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.810
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.640
There were three little imps
there stood outside the gates,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.230
way-hey blow the man down.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.220
She pulled off her slipper
and stove in their pates,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.850
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.920
Three more little devils
were bound down in chains,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.470
way-hey blow the man down.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.280
She took off the other and
bashed in their brains,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.100
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.040
These six little devils
for mercy did bawl,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.620
way-hey blow the man down.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.590
Saying, "Chuck them at
daddy, she'll murder us all,"

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.030
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.930
She can't live in heaven,
she's not fit for hell,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.420
way-hey blow the man down.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.430
I'm thinking that London's
a place she could dwell,

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.880
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.790
So the devil he bundled
her back in the sack,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.230
way-hey blow the man down.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.100
And back to the tailor
with her on his back,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.550
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.570
She went down to hell
and she came back again,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.050
way-hey blow the man down.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:13.300
Which proves that the
women are tougher than men,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:21.510
give me some time to
blow the man down.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.060
[ Applause ]

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Thank you.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.100
That was James Madison
Carpenter's version

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.400
of Blow The Man Down,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.570
mostly from Dennis
O'Connor's in New York City.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.120
And now we're going
to sing another song

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.320
that Carpenter collected, and
we're going to be helped here

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.800
on the button accordion
by Jennifer Cutting.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.840
And this song is a fishing song.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.280
So Carpenter actually did his
dissertation on nautical songs,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.390
and this one he collected
from a Captain Charles Snellin

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.300
in Marblehead, Massachusetts.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.610
One interesting thing about this
song is that we found the tune

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.380
in the Carpenter
collection which he sold

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.750
to the American Folk Life
Center in the 1970's,

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.050
to the Library of Congress.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.350
So it's in the collection,

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.280
but we didn't find
words in the collection.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.660
It turns out that the words he
put in his doctoral dissertation

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.110
and he said it's the same song
collected from the same person.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.080
So we were able to match
the music to the words.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.480
And the song tells the
story of a fishing voyage

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.860
from Massachusetts up
to Atlantic Canada.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.610
And I was familiar with the tune

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.960
from a Newfoundland song
called Feller from Fortune.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.590
So it's still in
oral tradition today.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.890
And this song is going to
be sung by Dallas Valley

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.220
and Jennifer will
give us the key

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.010
and then we'll teach
you the words.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.310
[ Accordion music ]

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.510

goes, the tune is --

We went down to see the skipper

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.400
and finding him a
nice young man,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.020
we told him we'd go a-fishing
all on board the Frigid Ann.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:35.510

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So our
third song, like the first one,

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.500
is a real sea chantey.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.790
And that means that it was
performed by sailors as a way

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.670
of coordinating labor
on tall ships.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.820
And sometimes on these
ships there was a person

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.380
who was a specialist in singing,
and that person was known

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.680
as the chanteyman, and that's

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.150
where our group gets the name
from, Ship's Company Chanteymen.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.850
So the chanteymen had to have
a large repertoire of songs

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.970
and had to have a good voice
like our friend Myron here

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.350
who is also a retired
Navy chief.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.220
Thank you for your service, sir.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.150
And Myron is going
to sing a song

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.730
that is called Rueben Ranzo,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.860
which is a well-known
sea chantey

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.210
about a tailor who goes to sea.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.080
But we have a version of this
in our archive that was recorded

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.490
in 1942 by William
Main Dorflinger

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.210
from a retired chanteyman
in New York City,

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.280
this one at the Seamen's
Church Institute

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.060
down by the South
Street Seaport.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.800
And his name was Patrick Taylor.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.540
And Patrick Taylor
was a real character

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.640
and there were actually
newspaper reports about him

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.880
at the time because he
was such a crazy guy.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.170
He did all kinds of cool things
like walking from Washington DC

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.380
to New York and stuff like
that that got him in the news.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.170
But he also told great
stories about his songs.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.740
And he told a story
about the way

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.320
that Reuben Ranzo was written

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.470
and we thought we'd
let you hear him tell

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.710
that story before
Myron sings the song.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.930
So this is Patrick Taylor

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.370
&gt;&gt; It was made up on
[inaudible] when it was known

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.150
as Castle Gardens
many years ago.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.900
It's of two poor
fellows sitting together.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.810
One was a hobo and the
other was a tailor.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:41.350
This man was really a
singer and really a poet.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.240
So when the boarding master's
runner came up, "Hey, feller,"

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.570
he says, "Would you
like to go to sea?"

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.530
"Why hell no," he
says, "I'm no sailor.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.120
I'm a hobo."

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.160
He went to the fellow next
door and he says, "Say, boy,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.520
how would you like
to go to sea?"

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.170
"Well," he says, "I'd
love to go to sea, but,"

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.850
he says, "I ain't no sailor.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.460
I'm a tailor.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.310
And now I'm busted and broke.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:20.000
I'm down here on Castle
Gardens living my life out."

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.330
And the other fellow looked
at him and the thoughts ran

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:31.710
through his head and
he made this song up.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.820
&gt;&gt; [Singing] It's
poor old Reuben Ranzo,

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.060
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.090
It's poor old Reuben Ranzo,
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:47.020
Now Ranzo was no tailor,
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.880
He was a New York Tailor,
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.100
They gave him lashes 30,
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.710
Because he was so dirty,
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.570
The captain's daughter
Susie, Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.280
She begged her pa for mercy,
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.910
She gave him bread and
water, Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.490
And a little more
than she ought-ter,

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.630
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.180
She taught him navigation,
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.940
Which brought him to his
station, Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.530
Now Ranzo, he's a sailor,
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:39.050
And the captain of the
squalor, Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.470
He's known wherever
the whale-fish blow,

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.470
Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:49.320
As the hardest bastard on the
gulf, Ranzo, me boys, Ranzo.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Reuben Ranzo.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.510
Thank you kindly.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.040
[ Applause ]

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.340
Thank you.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.640
And for our final
song we're going

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.560
to have Jennifer Cutting
come back up, and she's going

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.810
to accompany us on a song
that's called Jolly Roving Tar.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:08.250
And this is a song that all the
nautical groups around know.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.940
Everybody sings a
version of this song.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.900
But what I didn't know until
I started doing some research,

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.380
and particularly until I chatted
with Jeff and Garret Warner

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.190
about this, is that
everybody knows this song

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.000
because of our collections here
at the Library of Congress.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.140
Because Frank and Anne Warner
collected this song in 1940

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.750
from a woman named
Lena Bourne Fish

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.040
in East Jaffrey, New Hampshire.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.610
And Mrs. Fish was a farmer's
widow who lived up there

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.810
and who had learned this song
from a retired whaling sailor.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.930
And this song, the
Warner's liked it so much

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.560
that they played
it for the Lomax's

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.000
and the Lomax's published
it in one of their books

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.050
which is the way in which it
got out into the folk revival.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.000
So now everybody
sings this song.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.360
But what none of these
people knew, not the Lomax's,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.960
not the Warner's, not Mrs. Fish,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.280
was that this song was
actually an old theater song.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:07.560
So it was written in the 1850's
in New York City by Ned Harrigan

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.950
of all people of
Harrigan and Heart fame.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.660
He was a Broadway composer and
he wrote this song and it was

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.650
so popular among sailors
that it went to sea.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.070
And that often happened with
good songs about sailors.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.620
Even though they didn't
originate among sailors,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.730
sailors appropriated them
and took them off to sea.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.940
And we actually have
the original sheet music

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.270
of this song on the
Library of Congress website,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.820
but the title is Get
Up Jack, John Sit Down.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.630
And the reason that
we know that everybody

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.620
who sings this song got it
from Lena Bourne Fish is

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.770
that her version is the
only primary source version

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:46.270
to contain the line Jolly Roving
Tar which is actually the title

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.100
of her version of the song.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.590
So this is going to be sung
for us by Mike Bosworth

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.990
who among other things is
a retired Navy commander,

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.660
but he still hangs
around with us.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.550
So thank you for
your service, sir.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.620
And Jennifer is going to give
us the key and we're going

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.510
to teach you the chorus.

along, me jolly brave boys,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.560
there's lots of grog in the jar.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:17.380
We'll plow the briny ocean
with the jolly roving tar.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.410
Ships may come and ships may
go, as long as the sea doth row.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:27.840
Each sailor lad just like his
dad, he loves the flow and bow.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.500
A trip ashore he does adore with
a girl that's plump and round.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.600
But when your money's all
gone, it's the same old song.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.050
Get up Jack, John sit down.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.660
Come along, come along,
me jolly brave boys,

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.250
there's lots of grog in the jar.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:48.650
We'll plow the briny ocean
with the jolly roving tar.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.430
When Jack gets in,
it's then he'll steer

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.860
for some old boarding house.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.450
Now welcome him with
rum and gin,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.900
that'll feed him on pork souse.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.790
He'll lend and spend and not
offend till he lies drunk

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.090
on the ground.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.850
When your money's all gone,
it's the same old song,

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.410
get up Jack, John sit down.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.100
Come along, come along,
me jolly brave boys,

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.600
there's lots of grog in the jar.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.850
We'll plow the briny ocean
with the jolly roving tar.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:24.650
And then he'll steer aboard
some ship for India or Japan.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:29.090
In Asia there the ladies
fair all love the sailor man.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:35.150
He'll go ashore and on a tear
he'll buy some girl a gown.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.860
When your money's all gone,
it's the same old song,

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.650
get up Jack, John sit down.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.920
Come along, come along,
me jolly brave boys,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.580
there's lots of grog in the jar.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.880
We'll plow the briny ocean
with the jolly roving tar.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.370
And when Jack's old
and weatherbeat,

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.500
too old to rove about,
it's then he'll stop

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.850
in some grog shop till
eight bells calls him out.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:06.230
He'll raise his eyes up to
the skies, saying, "Boys,

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.510
we're homeward bound."

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.270
When your money's all gone,
it's the same old song,

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.830
get up Jack, John sit down.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.330
Come along, come along,
me jolly brave boys,

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.900
there's lots of grog in the jar.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:25.120
We'll plow the briny ocean
with the jolly roving tar.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.790
Come along, come along,
me jolly brave boys,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.190
there's lots of grog in the jar.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:38.510
We'll plow the briny ocean
with the jolly roving tar.

Jolly Roving Tar.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.580
We have been The Ship's
Company Chanteymen.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:51.450
Once again, Mike Bosworth,
Myron Peterson, Dallas Valley

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:56.510
and our good friend and AFC
colleague Jennifer Cutting.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.050
[ Applause ]

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.280
Now they all get to leave, but
I have to stay because I've got

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.630
to tell you about the
next person who's coming

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.450
out onto our stage.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.760
And that will be Jaimeo Brown.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.740
And Jaimeo had been a
drummer since the age of 16

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.150
and has played with some
of the top names in music.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.960
Stevie Wonder, Carlos Santana.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.300
And he has become inspired by
some of our field recordings

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.680
in the Library of Congress.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.870
Especially originally the Gees
Bend recordings from Alabama.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.280
And he put those together
and sort of sampled them

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.280
for a project of his
called Transcendence.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.590
And he's just one in
a long line of artists

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.690
who have sampled AFC material
starting back in the '90's

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.650
with Moby, did a lot of
sampling of our work.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:54.600
And most recently Beyonce used
some of our work as samples.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.970
So it's another way
in which people engage

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.290
with our recordings.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.370
And Jaimeo came to the
reading room a couple years ago

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.190
and I got the opportunity
to meet him and we hung out

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.610
and we showed him
some work songs.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.370
And he's adapted some of
those for his project today.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.750
So this is the great
Jaimeo Brown.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.200
Do you want to speak
before you play?

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.500
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: All right.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.510
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.900
Wow, it's an honor,
honor really being here.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.690
As he mentioned, I've been
interested in the archives

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:37.220
for probably around
four or five years now.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.270
And of course when
I came I didn't know

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.820
that I would actually
be performing here.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:45.830
So it's a great circle
kind of for myself.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.130
What you're about to hear,

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.430
you're about to hear
something that's probably going

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.730
to be a little bit different

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.700
than something you
may have heard before.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.000
The music that you're going

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.840
to hear a sample tonight
specifically comes

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.490
from a collection of Lomax
recordings called kind

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.280
of The Parchman Farms
Collection,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.310
which is actually a
prison in Alabama.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:10.190
And some of the work
songs that were sung

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:16.890
in the prisons were really
songs that retained some

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:20.820
of the very first
concepts and ideas

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.220
of the very first African
American experience

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.520
in the country.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.540
So the music is very important
and significant because out

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.370
of the work songs, out of
the earliest spirituals,

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:39.740
this is really the roots of
so much of what we consider

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.750
to be American music
and American pop music.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:46.230
If we're talking about jazz
or talking about the blues,

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.450
or we're talking about rock
or we're talking about funk

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:53.930
or we're talking about a lot
of forms of electronic music,

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.420
all of these different modern
forms have roots that go back

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.540
to these really early,
early sounds

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.530
and these early spirituals
and work songs.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.820
So from these recordings I took
some of the ideas of things

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.530
that I feel came from these.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.530
So you're going to hear rhythms

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:18.620
that all have roots
in these recordings.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.790
And it's kind of my
interpretation as a drummer here

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.380
as well as you can
see of this material.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.380
So thank you guys so
much for being here,

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.810
and have a wonderful night.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:35.040

Thank you.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.790
Yes, once again, you're
hearing really the roots.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:53.310
Some of those voices and
some of those songs and some

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.160
of those prison songs,
you're hearing a lot of roots

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.160
of where the blues actually
came from within those voices.

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:05.770
So this is very important to
me just because it really is

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:10.370
like when you look at a tree,
a tree that's very old has

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:13.540
so many long branches
on it, you know.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.640
But you don't often
see the roots

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.620
of how deep those roots actually
go, deep underneath the ground.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.930
And that really is a big
purpose of this music,

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.690
to understand really the
deepest roots of this music.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.360
It's an honor being here.

Thank you to Jaimeo Brown.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.810
Yeah, and what Jaimeo is
saying is so important.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:45.790
This really is the
roots of American music

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.790
and pretty much all genres

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:49.760
of American popular
music have their roots

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:54.600
in traditional musics that
you can find in our archive.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.570
And I promised I'd tell you a
little bit more about the origin

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.950
of the Archive Challenge
later in the evening,

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.630
and that's what I'm
going to do now.

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:06.920
So the Archive Challenge, as
I said, it came about because

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.130
for all these years
we've been observing all

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:13.800
of the great musicians who have
found their way to the archive.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.410
But often that finding
was fortuitous.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.710
They found their way
here because of a book

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:22.170
that was published that
had a transcription

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.600
or someone happened to put
out some field recordings

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.080
on a commercial release
and they heard those.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.470
The library did a
little of that too.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.740
We released some of them
on LP's back in those days.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.550
But we were trying
to think of ways

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:39.510
that we could encourage
this more directly.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:43.240
And as I mentioned, my colleague
Jennifer Cutting was the person

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.200
who kind of had this idea,
because Jennifer and I used

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.140
to attend the Folk Alliance
Conference every year.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:53.100
This is sort of an industry
conference for folk music,

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:57.330
where a lot of groups get
together in order to sort

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:02.470
of ply their wares essentially
to promoters and presenters.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.300
And so we thought this
would be a great place

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.520
to actually get the
archive challenge going.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.830
So Jennifer had this idea
of promoting these two bands

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:17.350
at the beginning, a few months
before the meeting was going

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:20.310
to start, get them to learn
stuff from the archive.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:22.240
And they work with
reference librarians

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.590
at the American Folk
Life Center.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:27.840
And we help them find material
that they would like to adapt

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.050
and adapt that material into
something that they can perform.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:35.020
And then at the Folk Alliance
itself, there is a showcase

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:38.200
and this allows these
musicians to put those in front

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.700
of presenters and other people
who might want to put them on.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.090
And so that worked really
well for several years.

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:47.520
But last year we had the
idea, "Hey, why not bring this

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.780
to Washington as well, bring
this right here to the stage

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.430
of the Library of Congress?"

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:56.930
And so we engaged
in that process.

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.510
We did essentially
the same thing,

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:02.420
except it's mostly local artists
or regional, we would say,

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.040
people from around here.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.310
And we got three
or four artists.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.050
Actually last year we
got five artists to come

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:12.980
and do the archive challenge,
and that was a noontime show

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:17.380
like many of our programs in
the Homegrown Concert series.

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.420
This year we decided to
move it to evening time,

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.230
and we've got these
four artists.

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.780
So that was sort
of the trajectory.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:28.480
And again, it's all
about getting this music

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.800
into the hands of artists, not
just listeners, not just people

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.110
who will appreciate it,

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:35.110
but people who will
do something with it.

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:37.450
And so that's what we've
had so far and we're going

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:38.750
to continue in that vein.

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:42.500
Now, the American Folk Life
Center was founded in 1976

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.360
and we were founded by
Congressional legislation.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.810
And that legislation
gives us a mandate,

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:53.850
and one of the first things
that it says about the reason

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:56.550
for creating an American
Folk Life Center is

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:58.150
that the diversity inherent

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.380
in American folk life
is very important

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.640
to the American people, and
that this diversity should

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.940
be maintained.

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.000
And so we're actually
quite proud and happy

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.900
to have diversity at
the heart of what we do

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.220
and as the reason
for what we do.

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.400
And that's one of the
reasons why the showcase

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.260
that you're going to
see tonight has a lot

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.410
of diverse artists in it.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:22.150
And the next act that we're
going to see is in itself --

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.860
there's diversity in the group
because it's a Palestinian

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:29.640
and Persian music
fusion together.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.990
So it's Arabic and Persian.

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:32.940
And it's Huda and Kamyar.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:37.370
And they are the duo of Huda
Asfour and Kamyar Arsani.

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.240
Huda comes from a musical family
and she had formal training

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:44.540
in music in Tunis, in Gaza,
in Ramala and in Cairo.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.670
She's a founder of Jahar Band
which is a musical experiment

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:51.930
which molded together Arabic,
folk and classical Arabic music

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.780
into reinterpretations
that would be relatable

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:56.930
for younger Palestinians.

00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:00.030
And she's the recipient of
several prestigious grants

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:01.950
and awards for her work.

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:05.270
Kamyar is a
multi-instrumentalist, a singer

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:09.330
and a songwriter, and he was
born and raised in Tehran, Iran.

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:11.890
Kamyar has spent over
20 years performing

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:13.870
and researching the
Daf and its roots,

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:15.690
the main instrument
he'll be playing tonight.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.290
And he also plays
several other instruments.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:21.970
And he has taught himself
how to play melodica ukulele

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:25.360
and all kinds of things, but his
central instrument is the Daf.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.320
And his songs and performances
are inspired by the people

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.820
of Iran and their history
of struggle and protest.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:36.510
So next we are going to
present Huda and Kamyar.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:55.100
[ Applause ]

00:53:55.100 --> 00:54:01.300
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: And really when
we looked into the material

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.910
that we found in the
archives, there were a lot

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:09.540
of technical problems in terms
of how old the recordings were,

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.310
how much noise there
was in there.

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:16.230
Most of these were collected
as part of field recordings,

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:19.380
parts of dissertations
and scholarly work.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:25.300
And many of them were sort of
on the way to other places.

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:29.710
So passing by this fusion.

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:35.850
So we chose three different
pieces from different places.

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:42.430
The first was inspired by a
collection of Coptic hymns.

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:45.420
The collection name
is the Divine Liturgy

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.750
of St. Basel with its hymns.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.960
And these are recordings

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:56.020
that were produced
between '64 and '67.

00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:01.500
So we will start with an
improvisation inspired

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.340
by these Coptic hymns.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.450
And the reason I found
those fascinating is

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:13.150
that sometimes I think
in the subconscious --

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:20.010
the social settings that I
grew up in, I get surprised

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:27.030
when I hear Christian hymns that
sound so native to the region

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.750
with a lot of influence

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:33.200
from what could have been had
I not known also recitation

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.500
of Koran.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.530
So for me, it's really beautiful

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:40.360
to see how the local
music plays its role

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:47.880
in defining the identity
of religious recitations.

00:55:53.510 --> 01:02:10.510
[ Music ]

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:32.210
[ Applause ]

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:35.450
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: All
right, this next one,

01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:36.750
this was a tough one too.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:40.980
We found it and we fixed the
recording of [foreign name].

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.410
He was a person from
the Loreson area of Iran

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:45.440
that the song is picked from.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.200
This song was written
during the Iran/Iraq War

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:55.680
and there's a story of a son
of the family getting on a bike

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.990
and wanting to tell his mother
that he's going to the war

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:00.840
and he's going to the
front of the lines.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.670
And it is time for war.

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:04.500
So the chorus of this
song says, "Mother,

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.320
Mother, it's time for war.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.230
And I hope I have all
my bullets on me."

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:12.960
And I think the part
that was amazing

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.560
to us was the description,
the imagery of it

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.470
and how it wasn't a sad moment.

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:19.850
It wasn't that I'm
going to war to die.

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:23.500
It was more of a, "I am
giving my life for my people."

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:29.260
So the song wasn't
supposed to be a sad song.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.400
It actually became a war
hymn during the Iran/Iraq War

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.950
and a lot of soldiers
were singing it

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:36.390
to keep their spirit up.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:38.690
It's called [foreign name].

So in a few minutes we're going
to year from our next group,

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:32.360
Elena and Los Fulanos.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.220
But before we do, I'm going
to tell you a little bit

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:37.800
about upcoming programs, because
the programming team here

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.740
at the American Folk Life
Center never stops working.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.890
We have a symposium coming
up on Monday about the work

01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:47.240
of cultural institutions
including the Center

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.890
for Traditional Music
and Dance in New York,

01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:51.910
Apple Shop in Kentucky, and Drum

01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:54.680
and Spear Bookstore
here in Washington DC.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.050
And there will be
representatives

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.850
of all those organizations
here to talk about the work

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:01.130
that their institutions
have done for,

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:04.000
in some cases, 50 years.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.110
We are having a concert
on the 26th,

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:09.810
that is this coming Wednesday.

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:13.100
The National Heritage
Fellowship winner Eddie Bond

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.100
who is a fiddler,
and he'll be playing

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.090
with the New Ballard's
Branch Bog Trotters

01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:18.960
which is a great old-time band.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.870
And they'll be here in this
room from noon to 1:00.

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:24.330
I'll post all of this, which you
can see our blog is called Folk

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.630
Life Today.

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:28.300
And so Elena was one of the
participants in that program.

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.990
And then I got to see her last
year at Folk Alliance and then

01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:35.550
when we were thinking of
people for this program,

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:37.600
we started to hear
rumblings from our friends

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.330
who were promoters in the
area that you really have

01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:42.120
to have Elena and Los
Fulanos here on the stage.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.810
And we thought, "Hey,
that's a great idea.

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:46.770
We already love her, so
let's get her over here."

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.350
And that's what we did.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.950
So we invited Elena and
Los Fulanos to be here

01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:54.160
for the Archive Challenge.

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.020
So this is a bilingual folk
rock band based right here

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.490
in Washington DC.

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:00.700
They've been performing
since 2011

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.850
and they've been creating
some great music since then.

01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:05.760
They have won Wammy Awards

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.250
from the Washington Area Music
Association, and great accolades

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.620
from the Washington Post.

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:16.510
So a big warm welcome for
Elena and Los Fulanos.

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:20.200

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.500
&gt;&gt; Elena: Thank you.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:22.800
It's such a pleasure
to be here tonight.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.350
And we had this awesome
opportunity

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:31.700
and we were really excited to
dig into the archives here.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.660
If you have heard
of Los Fulanos,

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:39.290
we mostly do original music,
but we do like to think

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:41.490
that we do a little bit
of ethno-musicology.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:44.870
And so it was a really cool
thing to go into the archives,

01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:49.410
and one of the most exciting
things we found was we found

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:54.870
this recording from
1943 -- no, '34.

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:59.530
And it was one of the
early Lomax recordings.

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:02.850
And it was in Spanish and it
was in one of the first kind

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:04.700
of discs that we found.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.260
And no one apparently
had really written

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:11.290
down the lyrics or
translated it.

01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:14.090
On the recording, I think
it's Lomax that sang.

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.870
It's called Conscripted Soldier.

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:21.660
It was recorded in
Texas and it is about --

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:25.120
so the first line and the
only thing that was written

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.910
on the little notecard that
we found was, [Spanish phrase]

01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:35.710
which means President
Wilson conscripted me.

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:37.670
So I was like, "I've got
to look into this song.

01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:40.350
This has got to be
something interesting,

01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:41.650
something political."

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:44.030
And something written
about an American president

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:45.850
but in Spanish.

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:49.610
And so we listened to the
song, wrote out all the lyrics

01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:55.370
and it's about draft dodgers
in Texas that would go instead

01:18:55.370 --> 01:19:00.400
of being drafted into the First
World War, they decided to go

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.990
to Mexico which is a
very reasonable thing,

01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:05.980
considering that Mexican
Americans and Texans

01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.350
in the US were treated
as second-class citizens.

01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:13.230
So this is kind of a story of --
still a lot of Mexican Americans

01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:18.460
and Mexicans, Texanos, went
to war and did fight and die.

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.040
But many of them also escaped.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.680
And those that did go
unfortunately had to come back

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.620
to a country that didn't
see them as full citizens.

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:29.310
So we took this song and the
new kind of built it out.

01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:30.910
When we heard it,
it was just one guy

01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:34.110
with a guitar playing
probably in a living room.

01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:38.850
So we built it up a little bit
and made it more of a song,

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:40.150
more of a complete song.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:43.900
So we're going to
see how this goes.

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:45.200
Ready? Do you remember?

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.500

Thank you so much.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:20.920
This next song -- actually
we included a key change

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.360
for the music people out there.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:23.960
We included a key
change in that song

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.990
because really funnily enough,
in the middle of his recording,

01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:32.160
Jose Villa I think is his
name, the original recording,

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:35.770
he just kind of changes key kind
of in the middle of a phrase.

01:22:35.770 --> 01:22:37.870
We were like, "Oh, that's
kind of an interesting thing."

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.790
So we included it.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:44.240
This next selection
that we picked is

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.190
from an awesome group called
Quetzal which is a group

01:22:48.190 --> 01:22:49.940
that is based out of LA.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:52.590
And they did actually show here

01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:54.860
at the Library of
Congress in 2011.

01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.340
And this is a selection
from that.

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:59.090
I kind of looked through it.

01:22:59.090 --> 01:23:01.430
I really wanted to do
a song from this group

01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:04.800
because they do justice-oriented
music that's informed

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.490
by Son jarocho, which
is a traditional music

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:10.540
from Baracus, Mexico.

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:14.190
And Danny over here is from
[Mexican name] and he was raised

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:18.190
in Mariachi and Son
jarocho traditions.

01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:22.400
Today he's going to be doing El
Sapatial on -- what's it called?

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.060
Tarima, yeah.

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:25.360
Stage name.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.810
Tarima. And he also informed us
that the dance that he's going

01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.210
to be doing today isn't
typically associated

01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:32.700
with the men's side
of the dance.

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:34.890
This is a women's
dance, but we're okay

01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:40.080
with breaking gender stereotypes
here at Elena and Los Fulanos.

[ Applause ]

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.830
But one of the things that I
really loved about this song,

01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:47.600
it's really a fun song to play.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.150
But also the lyrics
are really awesome.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:54.100
It's about a mocking
bird, a sinsonte.

01:23:54.100 --> 01:24:00.830
And one of the lines that really
grabs me about this song is

01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:04.630
that it says, [Spanish
phrase], dignity is the revenge.

01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:05.930
But it's not like revenge.

01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:09.850
It's kind of like dignity is
kind of like your comeback.

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:12.010
You know, and I think a lot
of oppressed communities,

01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:16.680
especially I feel like
it's relevant now,

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.650
is just like carrying your
head high and doing your best

01:24:19.650 --> 01:24:21.570
and being dignified
is the best way

01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:24.500
to show your own
way to fight back.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:28.780
So that's what I really
liked about this song,

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:32.820
and it's also pretty awesome,
so let's see how it goes.

Sweet. So when we were asked
to do this, actually I came

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.510
to a show here that was
very formative for me.

01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:05.140
Actually, after we did
the songwriting workshop,

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.290
which apparently they're
having another one,

01:29:08.290 --> 01:29:09.590
so you should look that up.

01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:10.890
It was a really cool experience.

01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:13.830
But after we had the Corido
workshop here at the Library

01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:15.430
of Congress, I actually came

01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:19.190
to the Canciones de Mexico
concert that evening.

01:29:19.190 --> 01:29:20.810
And it was really awesome.

01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:23.910
The songwriting workshop
was taught be the lead

01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.500
of Canciones de Mexico.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:28.910
And one of the songs that they
did was a bilingual version

01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:35.270
of This Land is Your Land which
has been pretty important for me

01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:37.630
because there's been so
much political activism.

01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:39.930
I've been asked to play at a
lot of protests and rallies.

01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:45.540
And in particular, I started
using This Land is Your Land

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.560
as a song that could really
bring a lot of people together.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:52.610
Everybody knows how the song
goes, everybody can sing along.

01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:55.500
But not everybody knows the
justice elements that went

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:59.040
into the original writing
of This Land is Your Land.

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.920
Woody Guthrie actually wrote it.

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.110
He was originally from
Oklahoma, but he moved

01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:08.600
to California during the
Dust Bowl, and he faced a lot

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.110
of discrimination for
being from Oklahoma.

01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:16.190
And he wrote This Land is Your
Land kind of in response to some

01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:19.660
of the nationalistic
elements that were coming out.

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.650
Some of the kind of same things
that we see now that are coming

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:26.650
out in xenophobia and
that kind of stuff.

01:30:26.650 --> 01:30:29.790
So we're going to do a
bilingual version of that.

01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:31.220
And before we start it,

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:34.080
I want to teach you
the part in Spanish.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.290
It's a little hard, but
might as well give it a try.

01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:39.590
If you guys sing what you
can, are you cool with that?

01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:40.890
Are we good?

01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:42.730
We're going to do
a little performing

01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:44.030
and build participation.

01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:45.810

to say about this is one

01:31:36.650 --> 01:31:41.100
of my favorite verses of this

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:44.100
there's a verse about
getting to a wall.

know it in English.

there was a sign there

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.010
that said no trespassing,

01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:51.820
and on the other side
it didn't say nothing."

01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:56.250
Which Canciones de Mexico retook
and made it about the border,

01:31:56.250 --> 01:31:57.780
