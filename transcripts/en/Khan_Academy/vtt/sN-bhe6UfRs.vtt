00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.830
- [Instructor] What we
have here we can view

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.984
as the long run equilibrium
or long run steady state

00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:07.600
for a perfectly competitive market.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.420
Let's say this is the market for apples

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.530
and this is idealized
perfectly competitive

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.340
situation where you have
many firms producing,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.750
they're non-differentiated,
they have the same

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.460
cost structure, there's no
barriers to entry or exit.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.870
And on the left you can see that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.954
this equilibrium price which is set by

00:00:22.954 --> 00:00:25.445
the intersection of the
supply and demand curves,

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:27.770
that that's just going
to be the price that

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.610
the firms have to take and we've talked

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.240
about that at length in other videos.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.430
That's going to define that the firm's

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.830
marginal revenue, not just this firm,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.514
but all of the participants of the market.

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:38.956
In other videos we've
talked about the fact that

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:41.681
the rational quantity
for this firm to produce

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.760
would be where marginal revenue

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.230
intersects marginal cost.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.890
And it's also gonna be the point where

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.660
you have zero economic profit,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.560
where at that quantity, let's say the

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.220
quantity for the firm,
your average total cost

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.248
is equal to your marginal revenue.

00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:58.470
If marginal revenue were higher than

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.744
average total cost at this quantity,

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:02.810
well then you would have other entrants

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.870
into the market because you're having

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.490
positive economic profit.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.260
If marginal revenue is
below average total cost

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.650
at that quantity, well
then firms are running

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.930
economic losses and you will have people

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.034
exiting the industry.

00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:16.310
And either of those
situations would get us

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.980
back to an equilibrium state that looks

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.881
something like this.

00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:21.708
But now let's imagine
a shock to the market

00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:24.979
somehow, let's say a new
research study comes out

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.520
that says that the apples that this market

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.130
produces, that it's
incredibly good for you,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.000
it'll make you live longer,
it'll make you happier,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.530
it'll make you have more friends.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.573
Well then the demand for apples goes up,

00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:39.621
and so you have a new demand curve

00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:42.358
that looks something like this, D prime.

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:44.993
Well in that situation,
what's going to happen?

00:01:44.993 --> 00:01:47.230
Well now you have a new equilibrium price,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.240
you also have a new
equilibrium quantity over here,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.620
let's call that P Prime.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.560
This is going to define a
new marginal revenue curve,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.750
for the participants in the industry.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.680
So M, marginal revenue, prime.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.170
And now all of a sudden,
the rational quantity

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.900
for them to produce would be out here,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.506
at least for this firm to
produce, so Q prime for,

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:09.500
this firm is out here and you notice

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.336
at that quantity, it is
making economic profit.

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:14.490
For every unit it gets that much,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.010
it costs that much on
average for every unit,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040
so it's making that much per unit,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.450
and then you multiply
that times the number

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.641
of units or the quantity.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.450
This whole area is going to be

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.130
the economic profit that
this firm is getting,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.450
and it's like that all of the firms,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.120
or most of the firms in this perfectly

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.860
competitive market are
going to be getting it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.570
'cause they all have
the same cost structure.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.351
But as we said before,
when you have this positive

00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:39.350
economic profit, and there's
no barriers to entry,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.010
in the long run, more firms will enter

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.690
because there's economic profit to be had.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.380
And in previous videos, we've talked about

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.390
a situation where as
firms enter into a market,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.754
or exit a market, it doesn't change

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:54.346
the cost structures of
the individual firms.

00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:56.350
So let's imagine for a second that because

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.350
of everyone entering into this market

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.040
that seems to have economic profit

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.040
for the firms that are
participating into it,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.160
some of the inputs of say, growing apples,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.420
which is is what these firms do,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.810
start to go up in costs.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.340
So we're not talking about constant costs,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.880
perfectly competitive
market, now we're not

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.510
talking about an increasing cost,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.693
perfectly competitive market.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.760
Well then firm A and every
firm's cost structure

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.589
is going to change because as more firms

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.498
come in, you're going to have to pay more

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:22.720
for maybe apple seeds, pay
more for maybe pesticides,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.200
or wax, or maybe you pay more for land

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.150
on which to grow them.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.643
And so you would have a
different marginal cost curve.

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:31.880
We have the marginal cost
curve now looks like this.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.923
So marginal cost curve prime.

00:03:33.923 --> 00:03:36.978
You would also have a new
average total cost curve,

00:03:36.978 --> 00:03:41.978
maybe it looks something like this.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.710
So average total cost prime.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.580
And so, you can imagine that firms

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.870
will jump into the market
in order to capture

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.470
or think that they might
be able to get some

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.650
economic profit, but they would only do so

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.960
until the economic profit
for all firms goes to zero.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.800
So what point will the
economic profit go to zero?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.430
Well that's when the marginal revenue for

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.800
the firms is equal to our marginal cost

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.670
is equal to our average total cost.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.373
So it's that point right over there.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.920
So we would get to this
point right over here,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.379
let's call that marginal revenue prime.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.610
And so, more and more firms would enter

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.123
into the market up until the point

00:04:19.123 --> 00:04:22.072
that the equilibrium
price gets us to P prime.

00:04:22.072 --> 00:04:24.120
And so the supply would increase,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.860
those folks wanna get that economic profit

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.000
but it would increase until this point.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.557
So it'd shift a little bit to the right,

00:04:30.557 --> 00:04:33.009
and then we would get to S prime.

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.740
As you can see, based on this we can now

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.410
start to imagine a long run supply curve

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.521
in this increasing cost,
perfectly competitive market.

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:45.380
We were over here, that
was our equilibrium

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.417
point before, now we are over here.

00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:53.000
And so our long run supply curve in this

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.618
increasing cost environment,

00:04:55.618 --> 00:04:57.530
even though it's perfectly competitive,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.580
might look something like this.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.060
So in a constant cost
world, this was a flat line.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.695
Now in an increasing cost
world, as more and more

00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:07.070
people enter the market,
the cost structure,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.139
the inputs into producing an apple go up,

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.160
now long run supply is that.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.360
Remember, the long run is enough time

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.582
to go by for people to
enter and exit the market.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:18.513
Or enough time to go by so fixed costs

00:05:18.513 --> 00:05:21.680
aren't fixed anymore,
that they can be shed

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.648
or that they could be increased.

00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:25.970
Now you could do another thought exercise.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.230
Let's say we're dealing with a market

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.110
where the more people
that enter the market,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.960
the inputs actually get cheaper.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.470
And if that seems hard to believe,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.290
you can imagine, well, now people are able

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.520
to produce seeds or wax at a new scale,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.310
so the inputs actually get cheaper.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.100
Well then you would
see the opposite thing.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.000
Then you would see that as more entrants

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.420
enter the market, this
cost structure goes down,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.110
and so the supply can
increase more and more

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.700
and more and more, to a point that

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.430
the equilibrium price is now lower

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.920
than it was before,
and then you would have

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.053
a downward sloping long run supply curve.
