00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:23.280
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: It's a
best selling techno thriller

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.040
turned into a movie, which
is about a demo, a semi

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.240
autonomous program
gaining full autonomy

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.990
and using levelling systems
from an MMORPG to basically turn

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.645
humans into a second speaker
society controlled by computers

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.620
instead of the other way around.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.090
And connected to that
theory is definitely led

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.360
by the rise of the term or
the concept gamification,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.310
somewhere around 2010 or 2011,
if you follow Google search

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.610
interests.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.920
The idea that you could use
elements from games or game

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.720
design as a kind of monosodium
glutamate or crunchy

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.551
flakes to edit some other stuff
to make some other stuff more

00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:05.239
palatable.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.445
And if there is one
thing true to this term

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:11.355
is that it has the heated
debate from the get go.

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:14.330
On the one hand, you have
people like the ones who read,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.230
Gabe Zicherman, he says's
it's the best tools

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.229
humanity has ever invented
to create and sustain

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.700
engagement in people game.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.030
On the other hand, you have
people like Ian Bogus for those

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.720
choice words
[LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.350
which of course is
a technical term,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.780
it's a technical term in
philosophy by Harry G.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.690
Frankfurt, describing people
who just don't care whether what

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.440
they say is true or untrue.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.550
So when me and my colleague
Stephen [INAUDIBLE] we're

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.520
looking at the debate
around 2011-2012,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.440
we couldn't help noticing
a couple of things.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.000
First thing we noticed
is-- as I said,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.400
this is a really heated debate.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.039
This is so heated
that this is not just

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.580
the difference of
opinion, there must

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.750
be something deeper
underlying here

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.450
than just difference of opinion.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.410
And second, while evangelizers
were evangelizing,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.030
and critiques were
chastising, very few people

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.539
asked, well, what does the
gamification even mean?

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.170
What are the larger
consequences, the larger

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.980
ramifications of this for us as
individuals living in a society

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.750
where these kind of systems
become more prevelant,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.870
or for us as a society?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.920
That's kind of the origin story
of how this book came about.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.630
In this book, most
of what I'm talking

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.700
about in the first chaper,
the history chapter,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.849
is basically what I'm
talking about here so.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.890
While we were digging a
bit deeper in this thing,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.130
saying why this
heated discourse?

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.150
Why are people so angry?

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.110
We found that gamification--
the gamification discourse--

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.210
is very much in the same
state that the discourse

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.463
around playing was in
the late 1990s, when

00:02:46.463 --> 00:02:50.960
the late Bryan Smith [INAUDIBLE]
game [INAUDIBLE] play.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.750
Show of hands, anybody
know the ambiguitive play?

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.250
OK.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.850
Show of hands who's involved
in some form of game studies

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.540
or game research program?

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.280
Yeah, that mapping
sort of makes sense,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.115
if you're into game research,
you should at a certain point

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:07.540
come across this book.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.890
What Sutton Smith and this book
basically makes the argument

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.840
and then shows is that he says
the reason why there hasn't

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.140
been a lot of agreement
about what players

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.160
and what we should
do with the play is

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.580
that the different disciplines
of different rhetorics,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.570
different ways of framing
the play that are grounded

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.880
in different deeper cultural
rhetorics about what plays

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.706
should be and how
plays should function.

00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:34.170
As it says, rhetorics
of plays [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.610
placed within broader
value systems.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.559
The popular rhetorics in the
listed settings, the ambiguity

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.600
is that there would be
seven different rhetorics,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.640
and nobody can
ever agree on one.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.190
There are these different, large
scale cultural ways of thought

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.660
in which we, more or
less, all participate.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.785
And that's the reason
why that debate never

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:54.210
really comes really close.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.596
And in the same
way, when we look

00:03:55.596 --> 00:03:57.470
at the gamification
[INAUDIBLE] and say yeah,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.780
that really captures pretty
well the happening here.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.210
There is a disagreement
here about what

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.050
the proper plays
of plain society

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.165
should be to begin with
about should playing games be

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:10.960
used to begin before
anything else or not?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.526
And if so, how
should they be used?

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:15.818
By whom should they be used, and
for what should they be used?

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:17.234
Because the thing
that we observe,

00:04:17.234 --> 00:04:19.915
the series games of
gaminification with playful

00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:22.320
designs-- all these
different terms,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.790
it's basically a kind
of dual cultural moment.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.630
On the one hand, games in play
leave the traditional spaces

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.850
that they've been confined
in within our modern Western

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.020
nation states and cultures.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.186
This was the leisure time
of things you did together

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:40.430
with your friends
in the evening,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.490
and there were certain
kinds of games.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.551
And suddenly, there were
also games for learning.

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.175
Suddenly, there was
games for politics.

00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:48.970
And suddenly, everybody plays.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.500
And then part of that, what
you get as a response to that

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.810
is that just games
become more and more

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.450
pervasive in everyday life,
which we call dilutification

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.830
of culture.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.140
You see that other
social actors become

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.130
interested in using
games and in impressing

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.895
norms, and regulations,
and values onto games.

00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:13.270
So suddenly, you have a big
debate where people say well,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.670
games should be gender
aware, and games

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.170
should be more
diverse, because look

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.490
at what turbo misogynistic
space this is.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.480
And then you have the
existing male game cultures

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.580
revolting against that,
as this result that game

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.380
play becomes more pervasive.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.580
Suddenly, you have a
cultural discourse.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.410
Leave out for all the terrible,
terrible online harassment

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.555
of gamer [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:38.030
But underneath that is this
underlying cultural discourse,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.710
who should be allowed
to play games?

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.090
Who should games be for?

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.260
Who should be able to
make these decisions?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.450
So if Ian Bogost says
something-- gamification

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.950
is marketing bullshit
as a means to capture

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.790
the wild, coveted beast
that is video games

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.340
and to domesticate it.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.830
Games are a mysterious,
magical, powerful medium.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.545
He basically says there's
this nature of games.

00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:00.540
This is how games are.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.459
They're beasts.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:02.250
They're this thing.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.080
And then suddenly, they try
to tame and domesticate.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.730
What he's basically
saying is games

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.920
belong to us, the game
designers, and the gamers,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.145
and the game academics.

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:14.450
But you marketers, please stay
out of our playing fields.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.780
This is not you should lose
games, which obviously forgets

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.670
that games have been used
for all kinds of purposes

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.150
for the longest
period in history.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.137
The art game has
[INAUDIBLE] and fluxes

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:29.970
where Ian Bogost, with
this game [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.210
definitely also
belongs to, or be it

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.790
war gaming, which
basically goes back

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.900
to Sun Tzu and The Art
of War, because Sun

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.980
Tzu, The Art of War, partially
was based on the culture where

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.140
samurai were taught strategy
and cunning with good things

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.672
of [INAUDIBLE] as a board game.

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.995
So the idea that you could
use games for other things

00:06:47.995 --> 00:06:50.600
than entertainment is
culturally very old.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.655
But still, we have suddenly
this new cultural debate

00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:55.855
about how should we
use games in society?

00:06:55.855 --> 00:06:57.740
What should their place be?

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.570
And even deeper underlying
that, what kind of society

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.980
do we want to live in to begin
with, and how do we get there?

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.240
And as we were noticing these
kind of clashes of rhetorics,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.310
we found two
theoreticians very useful

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.410
in mapping the total debate.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.830
The first one is this very
unlikely, with Victor Turner,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.732
of the [INAUDIBLE] to theater.

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:25.000
And he's an anthropologist,
very famous for his early work

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.995
about ritual as a
social phenomenon

00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:29.810
for all of those pictures.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.881
And he noticed that in
pre-modern cultures that

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.630
was played obviously
that was also played,

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:42.510
the play was usually very well
coached and functionalized

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.640
in these cultures,
namely in passage rights.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.350
Passage rights, he says,
were these liminal spaces,

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.470
boundary spaces where
people would temporarily

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.560
leave their existing
space in society,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.190
and play around, and
act excessively to then

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.320
be reintegrated into
society into their new role,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.595
usually in their passage
between being a child,

00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:06.560
and then being the
responsible adult.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.090
You still have that kind of
thing in the Amish [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.550
in certain Amish
communities where

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.112
once you're considered
to be at the age

00:08:14.112 --> 00:08:15.820
where you can become
an adult, basically,

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.280
you get to leave the community,
do all the things you were

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.170
never allowed to do in an
Amish community-- jump around

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.945
is the literal
translation, [GERMAN];

00:08:22.945 --> 00:08:26.050
it's from the Germans-- and then
make the decision whether you

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.110
want to return.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.841
So you get to play around
very literally, as [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:30.845
said, in these places.

00:08:30.845 --> 00:08:33.490
But this is completely
functionalized as a ritual

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.830
to reproduce society.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:42.679
And what we noticed is in modern
societies, singular societies,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.465
these liminal
spaces disappeared.

00:08:44.465 --> 00:08:46.480
We don't have a lot
of them, because we're

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.030
not a strongly religious
society anymore.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.200
But there were
societal spaces that

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.570
retain forms and
shapes of that, only

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.430
they're used and functionalized
in different ways.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.195
And to notify this, to
indicate this distinction,

00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:05.711
he makes a distinction
between liminal and liminoid.

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.735
He says where it's liminal
spaces, like passage rights,

00:09:08.735 --> 00:09:11.718
like the pre-modern, religious,
and collective things that

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:12.462
are obligatory.

00:09:12.462 --> 00:09:16.595
We have to do them, their
play is instrumentalized.

00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:20.770
It's a means towards the end
of getting you into society.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.410
It reproduces the
existing social order

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.753
and improves the means.

00:09:24.753 --> 00:09:30.250
It's a means towards producing
society, whereas limioid spaces

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.380
play becomes something that's
not instrumental, but also

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.100
telling, done for its sake.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.970
Play becomes something where
you can change the order, even

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.870
if temporarily.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.710
You can upset the
social order, and play

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.090
becomes a space where you
can question the end society

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.220
pursuits.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.112
Should we get through this,
instead of just reproducing it?

00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:50.612
Yeah?

00:09:50.612 --> 00:09:52.903
AUDIENCE: Well, what did you
say about the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:52.903 --> 00:09:53.740
What is that?

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.781
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Autotelic is from the Greek.

00:09:55.781 --> 00:09:58.220
Auto, self, and telos is goal.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.930
And autotelic means
something is its own goal.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.849
I do it for its own sake.

00:10:02.849 --> 00:10:03.390
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.890
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
I eat because I

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:10.600
enjoy eating, not because
something else, as an example.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.670
So he notices that we
have not these ritual

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.464
spaces like passage
rights so much anymore,

00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:18.880
but we have these
liminoid spaces.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.560
These are spaces like art.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.330
He uses bases like
science, where you

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.860
get to toy around with ideas.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.275
These are spaces like theater.

00:10:26.275 --> 00:10:28.347
These are spaces like play.

00:10:28.347 --> 00:10:29.180
These are time play.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.555
All these spaces retain
these ritual functions,

00:10:31.555 --> 00:10:34.040
but they're somehow
used differently.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.280
Give you a very
practical example.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.150
Art-- religious art
in pre-modern times

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.530
was a liminal space that
just presented and reproduced

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.480
the religious order
as it should be.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.240
I'm just showing you how it
should be, [INAUDIBLE], and so

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.375
on, whereas modern liminoid
art is allowed to toy

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:55.040
around with this and use the
imagery literally, play around

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.740
with the imagery of
previous pre-modern art,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.690
remix it with Coca-Cola presents
the crucification of Christ

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.380
to make critical,
soulful commentary,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.975
to speak about is this the
kind of commercialized society

00:11:05.975 --> 00:11:09.465
in which we live and should be
living in that kind of society.

00:11:09.465 --> 00:11:12.950
And we found this distinction
between lininal and liminoid

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.420
helped us very well to tease
out the different political

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.140
positions people had
towards communification.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.098
The second poll that we
found was very useful

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.472
is from another book that most
of the game studies people

00:11:24.472 --> 00:11:27.010
know, that is [INAUDIBLE],
a French philosopher

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:33.970
in the 1950s, Men Playing
Games, [FRENCH], or [FRENCH]?

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:34.490
[FRENCH]?

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.960
AUDIENCE: [FRENCH].

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.300
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah,
where he said that basically,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.160
all kinds of play and
game forms, that we

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.020
have a culture, a loosely
folding on a spectrum of two

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.860
poles.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.050
One pole he declares with
the Latin ludus for basically

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.845
a rule based game that's very
orderly, where you strive

00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:59.509
in order to reach goals;
every typical board

00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:01.342
game, or social game,
or video game that you

00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:03.290
can think of on the one hand.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.690
And on the other hand, you have
this free form improvisational,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.790
explorational, tumultuous play.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.940
Think about children playing
pretend play, or Lego.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.690
So all games and play forms have
basically these two ideal poles

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.340
in them, and things fall
somewhere on these poles.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.330
And we notice that if we
take these two dimensions

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.110
and look at all the
different rhetorics--

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.060
and we could talk about
the rhetorics later.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.809
But if we take all the
different rhetorics

00:12:32.809 --> 00:12:38.640
there are, then
they pretty neatly

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.200
form this clear clustering.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.310
They fall into two
clusters of opinions

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.670
which are these underlying
rhetorical disagreements

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.680
about what games and plays
should be in society.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.600
On the one hand, you
have people who very much

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.370
like games-- structures.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.790
There's more structures, more
rules, more feedback systems

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.340
that are very liminal,
but not liminal

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.820
in the traditional,
pre-modern way reproducing

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.260
religious order, but
liminal in a modern way,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.569
reproducing the existing
social order of society.

00:13:09.569 --> 00:13:12.110
Basically, their position's the
current social order is good.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.651
It's perfect.

00:13:12.651 --> 00:13:18.270
Society should be as it is, but
it has some flaws in execution,

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.460
and we should use
gains as technologies

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.250
that governments and
organizations can

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.720
use to perfect the execution.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.060
It's not that the way
organizations or businesses

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.500
organized as broken.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.150
It's just that people
aren't motivated enough,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.376
so games are a great tool
to motivate them more.

00:13:38.376 --> 00:13:41.600
I thought maybe we should fix
the organizations themselves,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.746
whereas the opposite poll, most
people who say gamification's

00:13:44.746 --> 00:13:48.400
bad are the ones
who more or less see

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.790
the current social order as bad.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.210
They are typically
progressive and critical

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.470
in general in their
political views.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.340
But say play-- the
practice of play,

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.170
like the [INAUDIBLE] thing is
a great practice for people

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.620
to resist the existing
order and discover together

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.140
what kind of world
we want to begin with

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.047
and to give you just some ideas
of these different rhetorics

00:14:13.047 --> 00:14:14.710
that we find.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:20.530
So some of the rhetorics
are, for instance, things

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.710
like well being.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.720
That's people like
Jane McGonigal,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.840
people like Miguel [INAUDIBLE],
people like myself that

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.490
speak about self determination
theory, [INAUDIBLE],

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.220
the good life.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.800
And we all say well,
what's the good life

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.430
that we all aspire to?

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.875
And obviously, in light of
that, our current society's

00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:39.960
pretty broken.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.340
But here's the thing about play.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.048
Play is a realized
form of the good life,

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:50.120
so we all strive to get there,
or things like performance.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.030
So these are people
who do pervasive games

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.100
or who do LARPs, like
action role playing games;

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.719
all these much, much more free
form play form to say, well,

00:14:58.719 --> 00:15:00.260
these are great
activities for people

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.140
to get together and
experience that they

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:07.220
can form a community, even if
a temporal community together.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.390
And on the other hand, you have
rhetorics like reinforcement,

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.780
so people like
[INAUDIBLE] and others

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:18.309
who raw on behaviorist modes
of thinking or behaviorist

00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:20.100
modes of thinking about
games and say games

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.170
are basically these
incentives doling machines.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.000
And so therefore,
they're a great way

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.660
of reproducing or incentivizing
certain behaviors.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.790
Or a bit more complex, nudging.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.340
A lot of people say games
are basically nudges.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.340
Just a show of hands, who
knows the term nudging

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.480
as a technical term?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.530
OK.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:45.960
So who knows behavioral
economics as a term?

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.470
So neoclassical
economics basically

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.220
says people are rational actors.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.470
Give me the right information.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.928
Give me the right
incentives, and I

00:15:55.928 --> 00:15:58.440
will do what you want me to do.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.730
If I know this is helpful for
me, and I care about my health,

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.802
I'm definitely going
to act healthy.

00:16:05.802 --> 00:16:08.010
Only then, psychology showed
us that is not the case.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.430
You can give people
as much information,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.929
and they might care as much as
they want about their health,

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.680
but they still don't behave
healthily necessarily

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.500
which led a lot of
economists saying to us well,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.275
why then do people
behave unhealthily?

00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:23.150
And they started to run
empirical experiments

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.890
where they say, this is how
economic theory predicts

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.080
how people will
behave, and here's

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.760
how they actually behave.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.700
So there is a gap
there between the two,

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.612
but this gap is predictable.

00:16:33.612 --> 00:16:34.320
It's a repeating.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.460
It's a reoccurring pattern.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.210
One of these reoccurring
patterns, for instance,

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.800
is temporal discounting, which
is just a fancy technical term

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.490
for I care for the thing
right in front of me

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.610
much more than for a
thing way in the future.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.830
If they did actual economic
disbursement to people saying,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:17:00.293
do you want $1 now or
$100 a month from now?

00:17:00.293 --> 00:17:02.334
A pure rational actor
would always take the $100,

00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:02.834
let's say.

00:17:02.834 --> 00:17:05.903
Because again, in no way,
shape, or form will inflation,

00:17:05.903 --> 00:17:09.970
by that point, have
invalidated the $100 that much.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.177
But they found the majority
of people took the $1 now.

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:15.319
And so they enlisted
all these kind

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.750
of cognitive biases
and heuristics,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.349
these weird ways
in which we deviate

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:20.980
from actual rational behavior.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.561
And then they said look at
games, at least that rhetoric.

00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:24.560
They said look at games.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.190
They're basically
machines for exploiting

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.930
these kind of reliable
flaws in our thinking.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.670
And so therefore,
games are great for us

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.700
to learn how to exploit
them to get people

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.044
to do other stuff, as well.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.670
So so much for that.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.940
I'd like to finish, as I said,
with teasing out scenarios,

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.457
so what are the visions
underlying here then?

00:17:52.457 --> 00:17:54.800
Then we'll get into debating.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.110
Namely, what are the positive or
negative visions that come out

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.000
of these different rhetorics?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.420
Starting with the positive one,
on both sides that we face,

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.690
you can slice and
dice them as you want.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.030
I slice and dice them in three
positive scenarios, and lots

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.280
of issues with them that
we can no longer debate.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.450
The positive vision, the
best possible world version

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.690
of engagement-- the first
one is engagement, which

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.983
is a terrible, over-used term.

00:18:23.983 --> 00:18:32.710
But it's basically the idea that
we can harness all the three

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.420
cycles, all the free
energy, all the cognitive

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.882
surplus', [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:37.882 --> 00:18:40.090
Thanks to the fact that
people are now online, and no

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.951
necessarily always
watching television,

00:18:41.951 --> 00:18:44.075
we can use all the hours
they poured into Wikipedia

00:18:44.075 --> 00:18:47.802
for really productive purposes.

00:18:47.802 --> 00:18:49.260
And then people
like Jane McGonigal

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.510
said well, that's great.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.169
If we could use games,
you can learn from games.

00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:56.210
And she put in this paper,
because it's basically

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.785
the white paper that
underlies, "Reality is Broken,"

00:18:58.785 --> 00:19:02.550
which she wrote back at the
institute for the future.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.460
We can use games as engines
for a massively [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.610
collaboration and participation
to organize and incite people

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.360
towards productive
things like solving

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.376
complex scientific
issues, and science games,

00:19:13.376 --> 00:19:20.970
or stuff like that, or use
games for civic participation,

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.100
or the aspect of games,
like DIY democracy,

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.160
where you would get points
for being an active citizen.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.230
The one issue-- lots of
issues, but one issue

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.565
I have with that is even if
that would insight engagement

00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:38.215
of people-- for instance,
use this to report pot holes

00:19:38.215 --> 00:19:41.340
in your street, it would
always structure participation

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.000
of people in a certain manner.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.425
So if we see this as
a vision of society,

00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:50.844
we have to be aware that every
structure for participation

00:19:50.844 --> 00:19:52.760
creates structures of
who gets to participate,

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.742
who's included in the executing.

00:19:55.742 --> 00:19:57.915
You can also say who
has technological access

00:19:57.915 --> 00:19:58.915
to these kinds of tools?

00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:01.112
Who runs around the whole
time with a smartphone?

00:20:01.112 --> 00:20:02.570
Who even cares about this?

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.041
Who has the technological
literacy to use these tools?

00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:06.790
That is with all the
citizen participation

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.907
tools, who actually uses
this to report pot holes?

00:20:09.907 --> 00:20:12.115
And again, you find that
this is very much stratified

00:20:12.115 --> 00:20:13.750
by socio-economic status.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.060
The second positive
vision is community.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.180
That's what I talked about as
performance is the idea that we

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.280
can use games and play
to bring people together

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.740
and to experience hey,
we like each other.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.100
We're pretty much alike.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.897
We want the same
things, and we think

00:20:32.897 --> 00:20:35.480
that this thing in our society
is built, and so let's together

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.190
get together and fix it.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.898
So it's a way of
bringing together people

00:20:37.898 --> 00:20:40.500
into new forms of community.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.110
This goes back to
early movements,

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.920
like the new games
movement back in the Bay

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.955
Area in the 1970s which
underlies a lot of the still

00:20:50.955 --> 00:20:54.880
Utopian thinking in Silicon
Valley where they basically

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.235
said with the Vietnam
War going, can't we

00:20:57.235 --> 00:21:00.130
create non-competitive games
that get people together

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.950
in order to understand
that that is also

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.425
a form of co-existing instead
of constantly combating

00:21:04.425 --> 00:21:05.610
each other?

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.420
And as Stewart Brand
back then said,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.580
you can't change a game by
winning it, or losing it,

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.130
or refereeing it,
or spectating it,

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.260
because then you're still
playing by the rules.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.650
You still have to create
a new game together

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.560
to leave the old
society and to move on.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.860
And contemporary
examples of that

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.474
are things like you're
guerrilla gardening,

00:21:23.474 --> 00:21:25.390
and there are games
around guerrilla gardening

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.830
as a community.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.450
Or my favorite example is
Massively Multiplayer Soba

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.312
by tilt factor.

00:21:33.312 --> 00:21:34.770
The treasure hunt
through New York,

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.710
through one of New York's
most diverse neighborhoods.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.660
And the idea is the
difference teams

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.200
get sheets with
ingredients that they

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.005
have to bring to
the final cookout,

00:21:44.005 --> 00:21:46.220
where people cook together,
only the ingredients are

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.932
written in different languages;
Hebrew, Hindi, whatever.

00:21:49.932 --> 00:21:52.964
So you have to go through
this neighborhood,

00:21:52.964 --> 00:21:54.964
find people to translate
the ingredients to you,

00:21:54.964 --> 00:21:56.800
and then tell you
where you actually find

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.000
all these local ingredients.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.983
That way, naturally
getting into conversations

00:22:00.983 --> 00:22:03.399
with people in that neighborhood
you would otherwise never

00:22:03.399 --> 00:22:04.139
have talked to.

00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:05.805
And then the game
gives you extra points

00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:08.332
for bringing stories about
food from that culture

00:22:08.332 --> 00:22:10.290
or bringing actual people
from the neighborhood

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.165
to the final cookout.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.260
One issue again--
lots of issues,

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.250
but one issue with
that is that I'm always

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.440
wondering to what extent--
these are basically

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.830
again, things hipsters can do
to make themselves feel well

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.440
versus to what extent are
these things that actually cite

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.755
large scale social action or
commodify your [INAUDIBLE],

00:22:33.755 --> 00:22:35.240
you'll find.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.450
The third positive vision
is hacking; hacking systems.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.115
The underlying idea there,
and a lot of the references

00:22:42.115 --> 00:22:44.930
will say well, if there's
one thing about games that's

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.620
great it's their systems.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.380
Or one thing game's
good at is systems,

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.753
and one thing that
you can do with games

00:22:50.753 --> 00:22:54.200
is you learn systems thinking.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.101
Anybody know September 12?

00:22:57.101 --> 00:23:00.350
One of the early news
games, persuasive games.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.370
The idea came out right
after September 11th,

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.550
shortly thereafter
by Gonzalo Frasca.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.880
You basically see
this little landscape

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.390
in some long,
disparate Arab country.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.590
You see some people
running around

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.620
in quote, unquote,
"terrorist" uniforms,

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.664
and then you just have
this targeting circle.

00:23:21.664 --> 00:23:23.330
And then you can
choose whether you want

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.100
to fire bombs with them or not.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.860
When you fire bombs,
inevitably you

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.676
will create collateral
damage in terms

00:23:29.676 --> 00:23:30.800
of people and other things.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.280
And inevitably,
people standing around

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.165
that will mourn for the
dead, and then some of them

00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:38.580
will likewise transform
into terrorists.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.800
So it's the systemic model
of violence beget violence.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.262
By attacking, you will only
create more resistance,

00:23:45.262 --> 00:23:46.500
basically.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.970
You may disagree
with the argument,

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.657
but it's a basic
way of showing you

00:23:49.657 --> 00:23:52.970
how games can model a
system and show a system

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.160
and can [INAUDIBLE] systems.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.140
So the argument of
hacking, as well;

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.940
games are great for
systems thinking

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.970
or learnings to this
kind of systems thinking.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.140
And by making games
about the broken systems

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.950
we live in, like in those
airport and security,

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.100
about constantly changing
new rules; what is allowed,

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.304
what is not allowed.

00:24:12.304 --> 00:24:17.880
You notice how broken that
kind of TSA system is,

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.855
and by learning to
build systems ourselves

00:24:20.855 --> 00:24:23.530
through game design and all
kinds of tools that open up

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.470
game design for other
people, we might actually

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.401
educate a generation
of people who can then

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:31.192
use that game design
and knowledge in order

00:24:31.192 --> 00:24:34.880
to redesign the broken social
systems in which we live.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.310
The issue with
that is obviously,

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.695
anybody has yet to show me
that there is data for that,

00:24:40.695 --> 00:24:43.380
that that actually happens.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.160
OK.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.870
Final three, dystopia.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.400
The first one is
obviously the one

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.380
that you most likely will come
across the most [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.213
when people were talking
about gamification.

00:24:53.213 --> 00:24:56.300
That is this is a
perfect control society.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.116
And my favorite one, has anybody
seen the talk by Jesse Schell?

00:25:01.116 --> 00:25:02.220
The Gamepocalypse.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.830
That's one of the other
initial pieces of media

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.606
that the whole
gamification thing started.

00:25:06.606 --> 00:25:10.640
It's a talk he gave in 2010
at a game design conference,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.472
and he described the
future world in which game

00:25:13.472 --> 00:25:15.070
designers would rule.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.440
And on, and on, and on it goes.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.610
It's a five minute riff within
the talk where he just runs

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.370
with the idea and says, what
if all kinds of organizations

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.210
and governments
would basically start

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.930
to use point of
incentives systems

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.820
to get people to do
everything they want to do.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.070
And people say, this is silly.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.861
This is ridiculous.

00:25:31.861 --> 00:25:32.700
This is also scary.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.754
The only thing is it's
also becoming a reality.

00:25:34.754 --> 00:25:37.170
Shortly after the talk, there
was this sort of green goose

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.130
which actually did sensor kids.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.589
So you can use ubiquitous
computing everywhere,

00:25:42.589 --> 00:25:43.880
especially to brush your teeth.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.030
Some people are obsessed
with brushing their teeth

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.150
and getting points for it-- to
measure everything, and then

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.930
set up your own reward
system for that,

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.831
and you have these
default senses that you

00:25:52.831 --> 00:25:55.450
can use for everything else.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.760
And if you say well, that's
nice if it's for people.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.170
That's not what
organizations do-- well,

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.130
this year's one part
of the health program

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.290
that I was introduced to at
Northeastern, which I find very

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:06.500
cute, which is Virgin Pulse.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.810
Basically, it's one of these
health trackers, step trackers.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.890
And if I use the step tracker
for my university, hey.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.870
I actually get
points, and the points

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.980
are translated into
reduced insurance premiums.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.420
Now you might say well-- a lot
of my colleagues said well,

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.070
this is great.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.810
You're getting money, so
why shouldn't I do it?

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.000
I said well, I don't
know if I actually

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.820
want either my employer
or my health insurance

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.906
to know how healthy or unhealthy
my behavior [INAUDIBLE] myself.

00:26:35.906 --> 00:26:38.670
And then the next time
I switch an insurance,

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:42.120
the insurance looks at
the data and says-- hm.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.760
We should raise your premium.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.210
The larger issue behind
that is basically

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.740
that most of these
systems are at face value

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.510
are sold as more
fun or rewards or

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.490
empowerment to the individual.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.310
Like Rescue Time
is this application

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.520
that you can let running.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.621
And then it tells
you, just by keeping

00:26:59.621 --> 00:27:01.370
in the back end, what
kind of applications

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.760
were running all through
the day and what kind

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.554
of browser windows
you had open in order

00:27:06.554 --> 00:27:08.970
to discover what you're time
syncs are in order to be more

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.396
productive as an individual.

00:27:10.396 --> 00:27:11.150
Yay.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.700
Only then there's
this nice button,

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.050
Looking for Rescue Time for
Entire Team or Organization,

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.560
click here.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.220
And then you see the
management feature

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.950
which allows the manager,
who installs this

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.090
all across the team to see
exactly what everybody's

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.830
actually doing on their
computer the whole day.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.650
And obviously, this
issue is true everywhere

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.950
we use gamified
applications are installed,

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.510
which according to the
vision, will be everywhere.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.247
So you can even
imagine something

00:27:37.247 --> 00:27:38.810
like Amazon saying
hey, because we

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.490
want people to read
more books, we're

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:41.675
going to deal out
virtual rewards

00:27:41.675 --> 00:27:43.299
and incentives for
people to read more,

00:27:43.299 --> 00:27:46.510
because then we make more
money only while I do so.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.178
And then I read all the
volumes of Das Capital,

00:27:49.178 --> 00:27:50.761
somebody else might
also be interested

00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:53.052
in that kind of data, that
I'm actually currently

00:27:53.052 --> 00:27:55.950
interested in Marxism.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.120
The third issue there is that
face value of fun and self

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.510
realization at companies.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.870
And all Silicon Valley
companies have to have sleds.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.280
This here is at YouTube.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.206
Obviously, a YouTube red.

00:28:08.206 --> 00:28:11.020
I recently did a bit of
research around playful offices.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.498
They really have all sleds
somehow, for some reason.

00:28:13.498 --> 00:28:14.980
We can talk about that.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.190
But that, in the back end, is
really covert exploitation.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.520
We make it so fun and so
comfy here in this place

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.395
that you never want to leave
the workplace, at which point

00:28:24.395 --> 00:28:27.920
then, you get suicides
and exhaustion in places

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:34.230
like the Las Vegas downtown
project run by Zappos there,

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.150
or as [INAUDIBLE] nicely
put it, gamification

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.760
is a mechanism of
decoupling alienation.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.310
I feel like I'm not
realizing myself.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.230
I feel I'm not doing
what I'm passionate

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.770
about from exploitation.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.120
With gamification, I may not
be alienated by my working,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.260
or this is fun.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.020
This is great, but
I'm still exploited.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.120
The majority of the revenue
still stays with your employer.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.070
And the big issue
with these systems

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.076
is they're all
implemented in code.

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:09.510
This is all codified,
algorithmic, automated

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.670
regulation.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.840
And the big issue with that
is you can't argue with it.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.690
If you have an
overdraft on your bank,

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.522
you could still go
to your bank teller,

00:29:19.522 --> 00:29:20.980
depending on which
country you are.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.896
Here, they are typically
very neo autonomized,

00:29:22.896 --> 00:29:24.974
but in European countries, not.

00:29:24.974 --> 00:29:27.390
And then you can say listen,
you've known me for 10 years,

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.265
and I only need an
extension for another day,

00:29:29.265 --> 00:29:31.175
and I'd pay the money
back, and he does so.

00:29:31.175 --> 00:29:32.800
We know there will
always be exceptions

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.660
to the rule in reality.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.600
The only issues with
these algorithmic system.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.981
I can't argue with them.

00:29:36.981 --> 00:29:38.480
I don't even know
according to which

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.965
rules they tell me yes or no
or give me certain rewards.

00:29:40.965 --> 00:29:43.104
And I can't change
that, contrary

00:29:43.104 --> 00:29:45.470
to other political systems.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.069
So basically, the
control fear is

00:29:47.069 --> 00:29:49.235
that it's on the one hand,
big brother watching you,

00:29:49.235 --> 00:29:51.330
because it's constant
surveillance in the back,

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.170
and all your data is captured.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.030
It comes with the
playfuls of veneers,

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.280
so it's the Aldous Huxley soma.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.520
All this is fun and happy, and
why should we care about it?

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.950
And it's a little bit
overload, because all of this

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:04.969
is run by computers.

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:08.400
It's not even run
by people anymore.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.690
As I said, this is going to be
the worst case scenario here.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.980
The big issue obviously,
which I pointed out in text

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.560
here is that these
kind of control systems

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.600
destroy the very thing that
makes games fun to begin with.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.695
They give you the freedom of
playing, voluntary choosing

00:30:23.695 --> 00:30:24.540
to the activity.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:29.196
Second, and third,
and then we're

00:30:29.196 --> 00:30:31.170
done with negative vision.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.401
The second negative
vision is gamification

00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:36.275
doesn't even lead to
more control in society.

00:30:36.275 --> 00:30:38.940
It just reproduces
existing society as it is.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.685
It reproduces the
systems and the rhetorics

00:30:41.685 --> 00:30:44.085
that we have in our system.

00:30:44.085 --> 00:30:46.230
The overarching
narrative, if you

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:50.210
look at persuasive technology
with the quantified self,

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.936
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:54.160
The overarching rhetoric
of all of these systems

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.865
is when we have
social issues or when

00:30:57.865 --> 00:31:00.590
we have individual
issues like obesity,

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.980
like climate change, or
stuff like that, it's

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.390
the individual's fault.
It's the individual's fault,

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.350
because all of these systems
address individual behavior.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.784
If only I motivated you
to run a bit better,

00:31:13.784 --> 00:31:14.700
you'd not [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.440
If only I motivated you to drive
a bit more fuel efficiently

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.450
each day, we wouldn't have
global warming, basically.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.430
That's the argument by
addressing these things

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.990
through specified applications.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.320
So basically, the
underlying rhetoric there

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.617
is this very American one.

00:31:30.617 --> 00:31:32.700
Anything can be accomplished
if one has the desire

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.310
and determination.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.810
If there is a social issue, if
there is an individual issue,

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.850
it's because the individual
didn't have the willpower.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.370
And basically, these
technical tools

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.680
just give you an augmentation
to your willpower

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.124
by motivating you if you
can't motivate yourself.

00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:50.915
Is there anything wrong
with this rhetoric?

00:31:50.915 --> 00:31:51.550
Well, let's see.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.966
There are other places where
the same rhetoric was around,

00:31:53.966 --> 00:31:56.130
like Maoist China, where
we had slogans like when

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:00.080
discipline's reinforced,
revolution cannot fail,

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.110
saying if the great leap forward
trying to mass industrialize

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.180
a country of several hundred
million people within the term

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.440
of five years, if that
kills millions of people,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.984
it's not because the planet
was bonkers to begin with.

00:32:13.984 --> 00:32:18.630
It's because the individuals
didn't put in enough effort.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:22.190
In the same way, I think
gamification and lots

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.955
of persuasive technology
makes the same issue

00:32:24.955 --> 00:32:26.870
of the background
systemic root causes.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.630
The deeper underlying
societal issues

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.706
that are not caused
by individual behavior

00:32:33.706 --> 00:32:35.690
necessarily or that are
not just [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.560
on the individual weather.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.810
You'll interpret the [INAUDIBLE]
of environmental psychology

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.560
that recently made the
same argument where

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.450
it said, we're basically
fooling ourselves

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.222
if we believe that getting
people to recycle more

00:32:48.222 --> 00:32:51.230
will solve any of our
environmental issues,

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:58.120
because municipal loves
production, just as an example.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.800
So all the waste
that everybody of us

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.620
produces in a city
that's collected

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.950
by the municipalities,
all the waste

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.645
that we produce-- how much
is municipal waste production

00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:10.570
from total US waste production?

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.250
What share?

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:12.940
Any numbers?

00:33:17.547 --> 00:33:18.520
AUDIENCE: 10%.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.770
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
10%, more or less.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:21.312
AUDIENCE: 5%.

00:33:21.312 --> 00:33:22.894
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
5%, more or less.

00:33:22.894 --> 00:33:23.650
AUDIENCE: 2%?

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:27.480
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
2%-- too low-- 3%.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.060
So if you all recycle more,
we're reducing 10% of 3%,

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.855
whereas most of the
waste productions

00:33:34.855 --> 00:33:36.230
happens in industrial
production.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.920
Most of the waste production
happens in supply chains.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.120
It doesn't happen at the
level of individual waste.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.880
Same goes for energy savings.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.516
Same goes for all the issues.

00:33:44.516 --> 00:33:48.410
We're addressing the wrong
things with this kind of thing

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.010
if we're always focusing
on the individual behavior.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:55.320
Third and final one
is it's not control.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.640
It's not even reproducing
existing social order.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.510
It's just reference.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.046
My favorite example for
that is the PlayPump,

00:34:04.046 --> 00:34:07.260
a system invented by a civil
engineer in South Africa

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.960
sometime in the 90s.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.764
And in 1994, a retired
advertising executive

00:34:12.764 --> 00:34:14.639
discovered it and said,
this is a great idea.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.290
Let me buy the patent,
and let me make this big.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.460
The idea of the
PlayPump is basically

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.800
lots of cities in Africa
and other developing nations

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.449
don't have enough
fresh water pumps.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.010
So what they said
is hey, instead

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.790
of the traditional
fresh water pumps,

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:33.239
let's install a fresh water pump
that's actually a roundabout

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.880
and put a reservoir on top of
it that's seen here, behind.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:43.960
And so water is pumped for
the local village's water

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.614
consumption by the
children playing.

00:34:45.614 --> 00:34:46.989
Nobody has to work
for the water.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:48.655
The children enjoy
using the roundabout.

00:34:48.655 --> 00:34:50.034
They will pump the water up.

00:34:50.034 --> 00:34:51.909
And you know how we pay
for this whole thing?

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.639
We use the reservoir as
an advertising space.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:58.310
So the advertisers will pay
for the installment of this.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.410
It's a great story.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.160
It's a great new
story to say hey,

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.360
water is easy as child's
play, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.345
It got a great, favorable
PBS documentary,

00:35:06.345 --> 00:35:09.640
lots of other favorable
press attention.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.890
He got then $60
million US dollars

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:15.201
in aid promised from US aid.

00:35:15.201 --> 00:35:17.100
Only then, development
aid workers

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.945
started raising their
hands and saying, sorry.

00:35:19.945 --> 00:35:22.236
Nobody wants to advertise it
to the developing nations,

00:35:22.236 --> 00:35:27.880
it turns out, especially
not in rural villages.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:32.780
And they found out that the pump
is more difficult to install,

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.280
less efficient, more difficult
to service than existing water

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.270
pumps in other cultures.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.740
And they found that the
average water consumption

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.350
of an average African
village is so big

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:46.880
that children would
have to operate

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.379
the roundabout with
their body power

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:51.556
for 27 continuous hours per day.

00:35:51.556 --> 00:35:52.930
So it's impossible.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.140
It's impossible that
children can produce

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.780
enough water [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.882
So therefore, it ended up
that the adults were operating

00:36:01.882 --> 00:36:03.340
the roundabout,
only the roundabout

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.340
was built for children.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.760
So the adults always had to
hunker down and use this one,

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.110
so they were breaking their
backs as they were doing so,

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.910
very literally.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.890
So this thing is
a great new story

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:19.110
that gives you great pictures
with all kinds of things.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.290
And the argument, or the
fear, or the negative vision

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.260
here is that gamification,
like the PlayPump,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.620
is very much this.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.000
If companies, or organizations,
or governments talking

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.918
about we're using games to
power, engage, and dah, dah,

00:36:31.918 --> 00:36:36.060
dah, dah, dah, or when the
current administration says

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.620
we're going to put
constant [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.270
into to the White House Office
of Science and Technology

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.100
Office in order to run
games for brand challenges,

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.170
this is not so much because
it actually changes stuff,

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:51.440
but because it is, in
Elizabeth [INAUDIBLE] word,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.160
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.810
That is it's nice sounding words
with no meaning, whose only

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:03.370
purpose is to appear cool
and modern as organizations.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.590
Enough talk for me.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.220
The rest of the talk should
be about exactly that,

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.950
or you think the proper
place in plain society has .

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.405
Thank you.

00:37:12.405 --> 00:37:15.315
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:15.315 --> 00:37:17.209
I left my water up there.

00:37:17.209 --> 00:37:19.000
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN:
Well, thank you.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.160
It's very interesting
how you really

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.740
frame different kind of
rhetoric about gamification,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.360
because that's really the way
I feel when I read the three

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.660
texts that were at the program
for today that was Zichermann's

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.440
text that was really
what you said,

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.170
like the type of rhetoric that
is very Utopian, conception

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:42.270
of gamification, something that
allows engagement, and so on,

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.960
and so forth.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.060
And there was this
very distopian text

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.810
that we read about that
was a Schrape text,

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.470
and we were thinking
gamification

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:55.270
that was linking gamification
with control, governance,

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.760
surveyance at some extent.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.630
And then that there
was your text,

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:04.310
so I don't know where you rate
yourself on the scale of utopia

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.140
and dystopia.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:10.630
I felt you were in between
trying to compromise all this,

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.329
but maybe I'm wrong.

00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:15.870
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Multiple things.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.720
So A, I am aware
that I am, myself,

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.170
in place there, because
I have my own politics.

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:24.090
I have my own values.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.492
I just tried to be
explicit to compensate.

00:38:25.492 --> 00:38:27.700
Listen, this is the background
from which I'm coming.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.070
And viewed through this
lens, this is what I see.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.245
If you look through
a different lens,

00:38:31.245 --> 00:38:32.453
you might see something else.

00:38:32.453 --> 00:38:36.570
So therefore, I say, I'm
personally a bit more

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.340
interested in play than games,
although [INAUDIBLE] games

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.980
are structures that
[INAUDIBLE] place,

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.410
that they're not
unimportant as that.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:48.210
But it's the same way
as you say ultimately.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.660
It's men hammering and
hammer, hammering and nails,

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.900
but it's still nice to have
a hammer to do something

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.858
to do with [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:53.858 --> 00:38:56.490
So even if a play's
important, and in the end

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:58.730
you want the hammer, but
the nail in the wall,

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.804
it's nice if you have
a game to afford play,

00:39:01.804 --> 00:39:05.280
because that usually
makes things easier.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.330
So in that sense,
in that spectrum,

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.010
I'm sort of in the negative.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:11.090
And then definitely,
in terms of my values,

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.018
I come from virtue
ethical errors

00:39:13.018 --> 00:39:14.312
to the [INAUDIBLE] perspective.

00:39:14.312 --> 00:39:16.020
So the question, what
is the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.453
I just think this is my framing.

00:39:18.453 --> 00:39:20.317
And viewed through
that framing, I

00:39:20.317 --> 00:39:24.632
think, play presents as a
vision of how living could be

00:39:24.632 --> 00:39:27.410
and what we should aspire to.

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.260
And other people might
have other's points.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.088
So I wouldn't view myself
as Utopian or dystopian.

00:39:32.088 --> 00:39:34.080
It's just I have
a view for this.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.530
I think there is potential.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.846
The big issue for me, as I
said, I also design [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:40.846 --> 00:39:42.530
And parallel to
studying this stuff,

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:45.290
I've been running around,
doing workshops, or actually

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:49.865
designing work with companies,
like BMW, the motor company who

00:39:49.865 --> 00:39:53.810
said, can you gamify for
assembly training for us?

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.240
OK.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.641
And that drove my interest.

00:39:59.641 --> 00:40:02.300
Is there a way of
doing this right?

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.466
Is there something we can
actually learn from games?

00:40:04.466 --> 00:40:07.140
And I think that is the case.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:12.970
It's just not what the
current popular conception

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:17.124
of game indication presents as
what we can learn in the case.

00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:18.914
Those are just two
different things.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:25.940
When I now come into an
executive board room,

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.967
basically three years ago,
the challenge was games?

00:40:28.967 --> 00:40:30.630
What are you even doing?

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:35.470
So making people understand the
concept versus the potential.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.550
Now the issue is banks to
immediately [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.615
of the concept.

00:40:39.615 --> 00:40:41.730
That therefore, they
all have already

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:43.680
an existing preconception
of what this means.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.916
Oh, fee [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:44.916 --> 00:40:45.416
Yeah, sure.

00:40:45.416 --> 00:40:46.389
More of that.

00:40:46.389 --> 00:40:48.180
And then you have to
break that conception.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.560
Say yeah, I know, but
that's also something,

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.210
but that's not what you
actually can learn from games.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:58.660
So that's my perception
on this issue.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.620
So questions?

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.127
I had a couple of
initial questions

00:41:01.127 --> 00:41:02.210
from the text [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.949
I've clustered them into
three clusters for me

00:41:04.949 --> 00:41:05.990
that we could go through.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:07.781
But other questions,
as I was talking-- I'm

00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:09.397
just starting
collecting, and then we

00:41:09.397 --> 00:41:12.180
give them to a [INAUDIBLE]
other questions

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.640
that popped up for you.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.390
It's late, I know.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.806
GABRIELLE TREPANIER JOBIN:
Perhaps it's better if we group

00:41:18.806 --> 00:41:19.830
them in categories?

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:20.310
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:21.270
I would do that.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:23.822
Or if you need energy,
we can do a little game

00:41:23.822 --> 00:41:26.550
to get the energy going.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.390
Happy to do so.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.290
I was serious.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.210
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN:
I have many questions.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.560
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: OK.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.460
So here's a thing.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:41.230
I actually would suggest
doing that, if you're all OK.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:42.564
If you don't want to, it's fine.

00:41:42.564 --> 00:41:44.021
You can just sit
here, but in order

00:41:44.021 --> 00:41:46.100
to get the energy up,
because it's actually late,

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.147
I suggest all of us
go out on the floor

00:41:48.147 --> 00:41:50.159
for two minutes at most.

00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:50.868
That's all I ask.

00:41:50.868 --> 00:41:52.700
And again, if you don't
want to participate,

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.630
it's perfectly fine.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.400
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN: It's
their spontaneous reactions

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.690
to what has been said,
because it was slightly

00:41:58.690 --> 00:41:59.990
different than what we read.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.610
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: I know.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:02.420
GABRIELLE TREPANIER JOBIN:
And perhaps that's why.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.750
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: I know.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:04.570
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN:
We can also

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.260
ask you questions
about the readings.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.195
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: You
can ask me all kinds.

00:42:07.195 --> 00:42:09.385
So the three questions I
took out of the readings,

00:42:09.385 --> 00:42:11.642
and I'll just list them as
far as I understood them,

00:42:11.642 --> 00:42:15.040
and then you can add
ad libitum, and we'll

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.570
start a discussion about this.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:30.010
The first one is just when
is a game slash gamification?

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.325
It's really this
definitional debate.

00:42:32.325 --> 00:42:33.700
Is it still the
game [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.110
or is this already gamification?

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.470
Or when starts gamification
flipping through a game?

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.584
That was part of the questions.

00:42:39.584 --> 00:42:41.000
The other one was
this yeah, yeah.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.833
There's all this criticism
about this thing.

00:42:42.833 --> 00:42:54.620
But what is good, as
in useful, actually

00:42:54.620 --> 00:43:00.220
applicable learning from
games slash gamification?

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.250
So is there-- this
is all criticism.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.320
Is there actually a way of
[INAUDIBLE] the situation

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.320
in which it can be used?

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.410
Maybe just a specific audience
and get the audience's change

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.950
based on more peole get used
to games, and stuff like that.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.730
And the third
question is basically,

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.055
I don't know who that was.

00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:20.888
Somebody said, can I
use that in my startup?

00:43:20.888 --> 00:43:22.720
I know it's very
risky, but you pretend

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.870
like there's a question.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:25.270
It follows from the other.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.892
Can I use it, or
when can I use it?

00:43:30.598 --> 00:43:31.500
When can I use it?

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.580
So those are the three.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.320
If you feel misrepresented
or left out, let me know.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.120
Or if you feel no,
based on this one

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.220
here, or now that
I wrote them down,

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.715
other stuff comes to your head.

00:43:40.715 --> 00:43:42.090
So we'll just
collect a good one.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:42.200
Yeah?

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.536
AUDIENCE: I was just curious
with the [INAUDIBLE] space

00:43:44.536 --> 00:43:47.500
you had made earlier
between the styles.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:52.490
Is there anything that exists in
the other two quadrants really?

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.640
[INAUDIBLE] something's
on the line,

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.220
but so there isn't
anything between?

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.240
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
That's a very quick one.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.210
Yes, there are two,
but they're outliers.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:07.440
So if this was liminal-- so
basically reproducing society,

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.370
and this was
liminoid, questioning

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.625
being outside of society.

00:44:12.625 --> 00:44:15.380
And this one here
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.910
So this is games, whether it
be [INAUDIBLE], and rules,

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.600
and feedback, and stuff.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.725
And this is [INAUDIBLE],
so this is free play.

00:44:22.725 --> 00:44:25.593
Everything should be Lego.

00:44:25.593 --> 00:44:28.150
And as you said, there's
the big cluster here,

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.280
and there's the
big cluster here.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:36.950
There is one cluster
here that's basically

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:41.440
Ian Bogost and a
couple of other people.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.510
And then there's
this cluster here,

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.106
which would be called
industrial playfulness.

00:44:50.536 --> 00:44:52.410
This classic procedural
rhetoric is basically

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.732
we can use games,
with a capital G

00:44:54.732 --> 00:44:58.284
as systems to model other
broken systems in society.

00:44:58.284 --> 00:45:01.042
This is how airport
security is programmed.

00:45:01.042 --> 00:45:02.570
This is why
immigration's broken.

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:06.180
However, you make a system
in order to make an argument

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.800
and invite people
to see how the way

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.060
this game models a
piece of society.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.810
Fits, or it doesn't fit my
mental model of that, how

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.562
that piece of society works.

00:45:17.562 --> 00:45:20.150
And me negotiating that
clash between well,

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.002
I thought airport
security works this way.

00:45:22.002 --> 00:45:23.689
This thing drove me that way.

00:45:23.689 --> 00:45:24.855
How do I make sense of that?

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:29.396
Based on that clashing, you
start thinking about society,

00:45:29.396 --> 00:45:31.020
and then maybe come
to a different idea

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.111
or come to criticizing yourself.

00:45:33.111 --> 00:45:35.030
So this is basically
a version that's

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:37.806
deeply critic or
liminoid in its politics,

00:45:37.806 --> 00:45:40.596
but still says let's
use games for that.

00:45:40.596 --> 00:45:43.260
The other one in that corner,
industrial playfulness, these

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.204
are things like innovation
games or game storming.

00:45:47.204 --> 00:45:48.370
Here's a recent [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:51.990
These are people in design
agencies like IDEO or Frog

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:56.296
saying, we can use the
playful activities,

00:45:56.296 --> 00:45:59.150
ways of structuring
processes in order

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:02.665
to reliantly produce creativity.

00:46:02.665 --> 00:46:05.019
The great thing about
design agencies,

00:46:05.019 --> 00:46:06.560
and I've worked with
a couple of them

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:14.470
is that they can promise
enterprises to produce

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.630
innovation accountively.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:18.490
You give us x amount of money.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:21.395
And in y amount of weeks,
we have produced that amount

00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:23.600
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.935
And we use playfulness.

00:46:24.935 --> 00:46:27.260
We use yellow rooms, and
we use brainstorming,

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.160
and we do these silly design
exercises in order to do so.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.720
That's very much used
in play, but very

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.664
much for existing structures.

00:46:37.664 --> 00:46:38.330
Other questions?

00:46:44.006 --> 00:46:45.905
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN:
Well, I have one.

00:46:45.905 --> 00:46:48.940
I wanted to talk a bit about
gamification in workplaces,

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.420
because I think that a lot of
students raise these questions

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.410
and on the forum.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.840
In your text, in
rethinking unification,

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:02.320
you say that most of the
gamification practices

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.900
and workplaces disregard
the context in which people

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.250
come to play and
ignore that play is

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.610
supposed to be a voluntary act.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.510
So you mentioned that
forcing workers to play

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:16.590
decreases that positive
feeling of performance,

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:20.250
and that having to play
in an appropriate context

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:23.180
can lead to
embarrassment, right?

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.020
So I think I was not the
only one to ask myself,

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.750
does it mean that gamification
techniques should never

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.200
be used in the workplaces?

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:36.380
Is the work context not
suitable for gamification?

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.690
Or can gamification be
optional in a workplace?

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:45.710
I think that Ryan--
not Ryan-- Shawn,

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:47.670
he had this similar question.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.900
I don't know if you
want to elaborate on it.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.020
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:57.140
I was just disheartened reading
even a somewhat feeble attempt

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.977
to incorporate gamification--

00:47:58.977 --> 00:48:00.200
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.379
AUDIENCE: --so as far as
the worker's reception went.

00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:05.490
And I was wondering,
is there a way

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:10.440
to include playful elements,
like an opt in strategy?

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.732
Because I would
enjoy a playful work

00:48:12.732 --> 00:48:15.970
environment, or
that sort of thing

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.770
that they see as
an electronic web.

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:20.150
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: OK.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:23.810
I would tease out
two things there.

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:27.920
That is I always like to use
the technical term, autonomy,

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.242
because it has an
established meaning.

00:48:30.242 --> 00:48:31.950
There is an established
theory behind it,

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.951
and psychology was voluntaryist,
freedom; very overdetermined

00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:36.450
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:39.480
This one, I use it, and then
I point to a certain theory,

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.140
and that's why I prefer that
term and to talk about this.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.810
And autonomy is
still a muddled mess,

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.322
in terms of work life and games.

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:46.190
Can we go to that?

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:52.570
And then the second one,
can we learn from games

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:57.950
in the work place in general?

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.966
So disregarding the
voluntaryist issue,

00:49:00.966 --> 00:49:05.880
are there ways in which we could
make life and work anonymous?

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.730
Let's speak about the
autonomy one first.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:16.570
There is this interesting
early book, Julian Dibbell,

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.520
games journalist who
now became a lawyer.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.490
Before time, he was a great
journalist in the late '90s,

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:25.120
looking at all the online games
craze, and he wrote a book.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.466
Rape in Cyberspace, and
all these kind of books.

00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:30.215
So it was in plain
money, how he basically

00:49:30.215 --> 00:49:33.670
made a living with designing
virtual [INAUDIBLE] space.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.460
And he noticed he was one of
the first Western observers

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:41.205
who sold gold farmers.

00:49:41.205 --> 00:49:43.080
For those who are not
familiar with the term,

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.050
gold farmers are basically
people, supposedly always

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.100
Chinese gold farmers.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.475
And then there
are other articles

00:49:48.475 --> 00:49:50.760
saying that's stereotyping,
because we also

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.950
find in other places--
anyhow, Chinese gold farmers

00:49:53.950 --> 00:50:00.240
are people who level up
characters or win virtual items

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.712
in games for a living.

00:50:01.712 --> 00:50:04.955
And so I gain a powerful
sword in World of Warcraft,

00:50:04.955 --> 00:50:08.260
and then I sell it
to other people.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.860
And usually, these kind of gold
farmers themselves don't do it,

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.610
but it's other people
hiring poor people

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:17.840
off the street in China,
young people to basically play

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.590
World of Warcraft.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:23.521
It's day by day, and day in, day
out in 20 hour shifts or more,

00:50:23.521 --> 00:50:24.530
and just sleep.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:29.320
They go back and
play as a waged war.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.380
So the more gold you
play, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:36.740
played for the virtual
gold in real money, which

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:40.246
is a classic form of peace work
which other people, if you've

00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:42.610
ever done peace work in
an actual assembly line,

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.262
so you know that's pretty
excruciating as an activity.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.900
And he found two weird things.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.630
A, he said, they were playing.

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.470
They were working in this game.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.615
And according to
standard theory,

00:50:57.615 --> 00:50:59.545
the should have hated
every minute of it,

00:50:59.545 --> 00:51:00.295
working this game.

00:51:00.295 --> 00:51:03.260
But it seemed pretty
playful at times.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.080
At times, it also
seems pretty stressed.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.230
But at times, they were still
playful in that context.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.610
And then he said
the weirdest thing

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.260
is when they handed
the day off, they

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.780
would hop into the
internet cafe next door

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.666
and play games-- the same games.

00:51:19.666 --> 00:51:22.960
And so how can
that-- I'm puzzled.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.605
I can't even make a story
to begin to make sense.

00:51:25.605 --> 00:51:27.230
Why would they do
the thing voluntarily

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:29.080
that they were
forced to do there?

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:34.160
Why would the forced thing
sometimes still be fun to them?

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.917
And the part of the
argument, or part

00:51:36.917 --> 00:51:38.375
of the way that
you psychologically

00:51:38.375 --> 00:51:40.530
can tease that out
is say that autonomy

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.880
has a lot to do with
your internal perception

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.560
of the situation.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.720
That is if in the
moment you feel

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.871
like this is what I
want to do, I currently

00:51:49.871 --> 00:51:51.610
feel like doing this.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:53.967
And so therefore, I enjoy this.

00:51:53.967 --> 00:51:55.050
This is what I want to do.

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:56.800
You don't have to force
yourself to do it.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.400
It feels like this is a
true expression of yourself.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.555
And so therefore,
it feels autonomous.

00:52:01.555 --> 00:52:05.995
if you go to a cloister
for a six week retreat,

00:52:05.995 --> 00:52:08.370
and somebody tells you at 6:00
AM in the morning, get up.

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:10.903
Sweet the stairs, because
that's part of your retreat.

00:52:10.903 --> 00:52:13.221
If you then think about
I actually put myself

00:52:13.221 --> 00:52:16.240
into this oyster, and
I want to do this,

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.272
and I know it's a good thing--
you might still go-- mm.

00:52:19.272 --> 00:52:21.230
But you feel this is an
expression of yourself,

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:22.813
and you still feel
that certainly this

00:52:22.813 --> 00:52:24.062
is a voluntary act.

00:52:24.062 --> 00:52:25.962
This is still an autonomous act.

00:52:25.962 --> 00:52:29.620
And you might still find
a way of getting absorbed

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.440
in the activity of
[INAUDIBLE], and then

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.880
you forget the fact that
you're actually tired.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:37.175
So the degree to which
I perceive myself

00:52:37.175 --> 00:52:41.480
that this is currently
an outflow of my goals,

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.710
wants, and my
identity is chiefly

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:47.232
responsible to whether this
is autonomous or not for me,

00:52:47.232 --> 00:52:50.970
as an experience, which is
something that [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.135
and [INAUDIBLE],
author of [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:53.135 --> 00:52:56.920
One of the core books in
game studies [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.890
has found where he said
even in concentration camps,

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:02.040
people could be absorbed
in the activity.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.740
People could feel a degree
of control, voluntarism

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.090
in autonomy, because
they chose how

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:10.295
to deal with the task that
were prescribed to them.

00:53:10.295 --> 00:53:11.836
Even if they work
for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:11.836 --> 00:53:13.740
that lent in their
ultimate demise.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.815
So it's this what
internal stance do

00:53:15.815 --> 00:53:18.530
I take to what's my situation?

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:22.490
So it's not that because
workplace, therefore,

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:24.380
obligatory context,
that are therefore

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.720
necessary in autonomous.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.720
It's how do I
perceive this to be

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:34.080
an outflow of my personal self?

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.195
And there's been
research, especially

00:53:36.195 --> 00:53:41.020
in education how people can
facilitate an autonomous

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:44.190
orientation towards an activity,
even in the mandatory context,

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:45.660
like school.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.810
There's stuff teachers can do
to tell the students, listen.

00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:50.720
I know the next
exercise is shitty.

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.850
Sorry for that.

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:56.240
Here is why doing this is still
useful and helpful for you

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.816
personally.

00:53:57.816 --> 00:54:01.202
And I would ask you to do it,
because it's helpful for you;

00:54:01.202 --> 00:54:03.680
asking permission,
explaining why,

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.330
acknowledging that it's
tedious-- all these giving me

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.240
free options how
to do it, with whom

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.310
to do it, how to
approach the problem;

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:13.000
lots of ways in which
you can structure

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.666
an obligatory situation to
still be autonomous [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:16.666 --> 00:54:18.821
So it's a complicated
psychological thing

00:54:18.821 --> 00:54:20.195
that has a lot to
do with what is

00:54:20.195 --> 00:54:21.920
my internal stance towards it?

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.850
But there's a lot
of design things

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:27.522
around the social
situations we still can do,

00:54:27.522 --> 00:54:28.980
which leads us to
the second thing.

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.979
Is there things we can
learn from games in order

00:54:30.979 --> 00:54:33.460
to make a work
environment playful?

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:37.740
As I said, with the sleds, I
looked into their research,

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.920
because I was invited to
give a talk at a conference

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.510
about office furniture.

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:46.540
They wanted to gamify
office furniture.

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.291
Sure.

00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:48.790
And so I looked
into the whole thing

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:51.560
and said, how do people gamify
offices and office furniture?

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.740
And notice that it's actually a
big trend, the playful office.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.120
And if I say playful office,
just what are you thinking?

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.080
What images jumps to your mind?

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.283
Playful office.

00:55:01.283 --> 00:55:02.190
AUDIENCE: Google.

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.740
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Google.

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.176
AUDIENCE: Nerf
guns in the office.

00:55:04.176 --> 00:55:05.020
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Nerf guns in the office.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.400
What else?

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.340
AUDIENCE: Ping pong?

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:07.685
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Ping pong?

00:55:07.685 --> 00:55:08.865
AUDIENCE: Ping
pong in the office.

00:55:08.865 --> 00:55:10.210
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Ping pong in the office.

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:10.834
Yes, what else?

00:55:10.834 --> 00:55:14.730
AUDIENCE: Insert fun
thing in the office.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.396
Bean bag chairs and other
horrible-for-your-back

00:55:18.396 --> 00:55:18.896
furniture.

00:55:18.896 --> 00:55:20.180
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:20.740
What else?

00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:25.265
Playful office, just off
the top of your head.

00:55:25.265 --> 00:55:27.045
AUDIENCE: Free food everywhere.

00:55:27.045 --> 00:55:28.921
AUDIENCE: Weird looking,
ergonomic furniture.

00:55:28.921 --> 00:55:31.545
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Not working
around my furniture, free food

00:55:31.545 --> 00:55:32.337
everywhere, plants.

00:55:32.337 --> 00:55:34.545
Yeah, plants are totally
important, even fake plants.

00:55:34.545 --> 00:55:35.460
AUDIENCE: Scooters.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.776
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Scooters, yes.

00:55:37.776 --> 00:55:38.860
AUDIENCE: Friendly bosses.

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.400
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Friendly bosses?

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.255
Then we're getting
into different topics.

00:55:42.255 --> 00:55:43.093
Yeah, exactly.

00:55:43.093 --> 00:55:44.968
AUDIENCE: Very scary
company open work spaces

00:55:44.968 --> 00:55:46.169
without cubicles.

00:55:46.169 --> 00:55:47.960
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Yes, open work spaces.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.750
The weird thing
about cubicles is

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:52.760
in terms of their
design history,

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:57.840
their point was to be free.

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.740
Back in the 1960s,
people started

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.475
working on designing
the cubicle,

00:56:01.475 --> 00:56:05.260
and their point was to actually
create playful architecture.

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.010
Their point was to make
this is a way in which

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:11.545
individual workers,
without big effort,

00:56:11.545 --> 00:56:14.115
could continue to redesign
the office to their own needs.

00:56:14.115 --> 00:56:16.050
They would just take
the balls and rearrange

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:19.730
them to huddle their space
as they see fit for a project

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:22.000
or for individual close time.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.750
Only then the corporations
discovered hey,

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.920
we can also use
cubicles to give people

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.170
a bit of sound,
and visual privacy,

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:30.580
and cram the most possible
people into the smallest

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.600
possible space.

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.940
Cubicles where initially
invented in order

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:36.430
to be a more free
and open office

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.000
work, and then they would reuse
the floor very differently,

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.580
which points to
an important part

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.940
this is what you put in there
as a design element is often not

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:48.220
so important as how
people use it in practice.

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:51.590
The practice is the way in which
people live something is just

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:54.510
as important as the things
you put into the office,

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:56.930
like bean bags.

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:57.430
So no.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:58.638
All of these things are true.

00:56:58.638 --> 00:57:01.290
Bean bags usually will find
everything that screams

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:04.570
playground; bright colors.

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.300
AUDIENCE: Slides.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.430
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Slides, natural textures.

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:10.770
So you have fake
grass, real grass.

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:14.040
You have sand.

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.020
You have round shapes.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.410
There will always
be round shapes

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:21.306
and all these kind of things--
things that look playful.

00:57:21.306 --> 00:57:24.625
But structurally, if you ask
yourself what makes a toy?

00:57:24.625 --> 00:57:28.890
What makes a good toy, or
the opposite of a good toy.

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:30.034
What makes a good toy?

00:57:30.034 --> 00:57:30.700
Any suggestions?

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.500
What are toys that
you actually enjoy

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.586
toying around for a long,
long, long time ago?

00:57:39.586 --> 00:57:40.086
Mhm?

00:57:40.086 --> 00:57:41.230
AUDIENCE: Call of Duty?

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:42.688
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
That's a game.

00:57:42.688 --> 00:57:43.800
A toy.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.625
Call of Duty can
be used as a toy.

00:57:45.625 --> 00:57:46.520
We'll get to that.

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.220
AUDIENCE: Simple,
multi-purpose objects?

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.250
Kickballs, and shopping
lists, and buckets, and stuff

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:51.880
like that?

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.963
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

00:57:52.963 --> 00:57:53.530
Wide shock.

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:56.070
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN:
It stimulates creativity?

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:58.570
AUDIENCE: Because you can use
it for more than one thing.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.160
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: You can
use it for more than one thing.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.056
AUDIENCE: Because when
a teacher's not looking,

00:58:01.056 --> 00:58:02.420
I could hit people with it.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.669
But if it's still the other
stuff with it, [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:04.669 --> 00:58:06.630
like oh.

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:08.971
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Other suggestions?

00:58:08.971 --> 00:58:09.720
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.460
Nerf gun?

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.298
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Why?

00:58:12.298 --> 00:58:14.730
AUDIENCE: It's fun.

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:16.934
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
What makes Nerf guns fun?

00:58:16.934 --> 00:58:18.600
AUDIENCE: Give it to
a couple of people.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.683
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

00:58:19.683 --> 00:58:22.245
AUDIENCE: And then it
becomes fun, all of a sudden.

00:58:22.245 --> 00:58:22.986
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:22.986 --> 00:58:25.402
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Again,
Nerf gun, as such, is not fun.

00:58:25.402 --> 00:58:27.445
Fun is when the people actually
decide to go around and--

00:58:27.445 --> 00:58:28.278
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:58:28.278 --> 00:58:29.230
I see.

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:31.223
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
And I would say

00:58:31.223 --> 00:58:35.120
the Nerf gun invites people
to actually temporarily go out

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.140
of bounds and go out
of their regular rules.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.690
So a lot of playing--

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:41.870
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say a Barbie doll.

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:42.390
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Barbie doll.

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.253
Why Barbie doll?

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.711
AUDIENCE: Because you could
basically do whatever you want.

00:58:45.711 --> 00:58:46.919
You could play house with it.

00:58:46.919 --> 00:58:48.610
You can make up a story with it.

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.350
You could act out going to work.

00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:53.820
You can pretend that your
Barbie doll's having a wedding.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.784
[INAUDIBLE] sort of thing.

00:58:56.784 --> 00:59:00.590
AUDIENCE: I think it totally
solves the blank canvas

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:04.628
problem that involved-- if I
say I want to play something,

00:59:04.628 --> 00:59:06.044
but I have nothing
in front of me,

00:59:06.044 --> 00:59:08.969
I'm not going to be inspired
to do anything necessarily.

00:59:08.969 --> 00:59:12.285
But if I have a toy, [INAUDIBLE]
it's a Barbie doll, oh.

00:59:12.285 --> 00:59:12.995
It's a person.

00:59:12.995 --> 00:59:14.174
I can pretend it's a person.

00:59:14.174 --> 00:59:15.423
I can play like it's a person.

00:59:15.423 --> 00:59:17.644
Or a Nerf gun gives
me, oh, it's a gun.

00:59:17.644 --> 00:59:18.685
I can pretend it's a gun.

00:59:18.685 --> 00:59:21.150
It gives me something
to work on though.

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:22.620
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Mhm.

00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.078
AUDIENCE: It's like
modular things.

00:59:24.078 --> 00:59:25.119
It's like those K'nex.

00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:26.160
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yep.

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.832
AUDIENCE: Little sheets, and
marbles, and things like that.

00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:31.220
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.792
You teased out
very successfully,

00:59:33.792 --> 00:59:34.696
the two [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:34.696 --> 00:59:36.096
The one thing is it
involved a purpose.

00:59:36.096 --> 00:59:36.972
It's underspecified.

00:59:36.972 --> 00:59:39.670
It doesn't prescribe
one specific way

00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:40.544
in which [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:40.544 --> 00:59:43.664
Think about Fisher Price
will often [INAUDIBLE] toys.

00:59:43.664 --> 00:59:45.487
They're the worst
possible toys imaginable.

00:59:45.487 --> 00:59:46.945
They just have a
number of buttons,

00:59:46.945 --> 00:59:48.111
and then you hit the button.

00:59:48.111 --> 00:59:50.690
It makes a certain sound, or
it flashes a certain light.

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:52.401
And I discovered yeah,
that button always

00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:53.234
produces that light.

00:59:53.234 --> 00:59:54.800
That button always
produces that sound

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.920
until it becomes a social
experiment where you only

00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.586
try to find out which
is the button that

00:59:58.586 --> 01:00:00.880
annoys mom and dad [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.300
That's fun.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.600
The thing itself is
not necessarily fun,

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.780
so it's underspecified.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.761
There are loads of different
things you can do with them,

01:00:08.761 --> 01:00:11.700
and you can explore this
possibility space, which

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.108
is the possibly of space
in Legos, or in Barbies,

01:00:14.108 --> 01:00:15.820
or in any other thing.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.801
And in addition, it gives you a
constraint or a starting point.

01:00:18.801 --> 01:00:20.605
It's not just a blank canvas.

01:00:20.605 --> 01:00:23.740
It gives you a seed
for the exploration

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.587
of that [INAUDIBLE], whereas
most of these other spaces,

01:00:26.587 --> 01:00:28.170
or like Fisher Price
toys [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.040
They look playful.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.700
Colors, [INAUDIBLE] sleds.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.080
But they are not an
underspecified possibility

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:34.906
space.

01:00:34.906 --> 01:00:38.060
They are not things that you
can use in very many ways that

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.810
invite you to reuse,
and abuse, and jump

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:45.389
over existing [INAUDIBLE] how to
use this thing as you see fit.

01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:47.680
And if you look into what
acclimates [INAUDIBLE] office

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.278
architecture, you find
stuff like actually, what's

01:00:52.278 --> 01:00:54.470
the building-- building 20?

01:00:54.470 --> 01:01:01.060
The historically famous
building where most of the MIT

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.885
innovations that you
were involved with--

01:01:02.885 --> 01:01:03.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.408
Quite a different [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:05.408 --> 01:01:06.866
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:06.866 --> 01:01:08.100
That building.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.790
And when [INAUDIBLE],
some people here at MIT,

01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:14.022
looked at what made that
thing such an incubator, apart

01:01:14.022 --> 01:01:16.188
from the fact that it was
a collision space for lots

01:01:16.188 --> 01:01:17.726
of people in
different disciplines,

01:01:17.726 --> 01:01:20.622
they had no way but to bump
into each other the whole time.

01:01:20.622 --> 01:01:23.640
The second thing is
it was a barrack.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.580
And it was such a
run down barrack

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.655
that nobody cared if
you wanted to have

01:01:27.655 --> 01:01:30.590
this big machine in there that
took three floors that you just

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:32.882
[INAUDIBLE] your balls
through, forced through,

01:01:32.882 --> 01:01:34.505
which was that
everybody was doing it.

01:01:34.505 --> 01:01:37.077
It was a modulous case that
everybody deems as they

01:01:37.077 --> 01:01:41.138
see fit for weird things.

01:01:41.138 --> 01:01:43.262
So the question, can we
learn from games for office

01:01:43.262 --> 01:01:44.318
work to make it playful?

01:01:44.318 --> 01:01:47.400
Well, if one of the
things that invites play

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.430
is an open possibility
space for exploration

01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:53.260
where I get to choose
where it's autonomy

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.010
supported, because I have a
lot of choices what to do.

01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:58.690
Give me an office space
that works like that.

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:02.520
Give me working rules
that are like that,

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.900
like results only
work environments.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.910
I don't prescribe to
you how you do it.

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:10.972
I give you a goal, and you
choose who you want to do it,

01:02:10.972 --> 01:02:12.388
how you want to
do it, et cetera .

01:02:12.388 --> 01:02:14.320
If you feel that is too
little structure for you,

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.580
then the good game
designer would give you

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.190
a bit of scaffolding
and say, then

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.530
come back to me as a supervisor,
and I give you a tip.

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:21.860
But other than that, go out.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.830
Just come back when
you have it done.

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:27.749
That would be one
of the many ways

01:02:27.749 --> 01:02:29.290
you can learn from
games that are not

01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:31.024
about having a feedback system.

01:02:36.834 --> 01:02:38.466
AUDIENCE: I play a
lot of games, and we

01:02:38.466 --> 01:02:42.970
move towards implementing trying
to make an exterior to the game

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:46.062
economist and things like
that, and trademark [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.765
exteriorly, and start to model
the real world in that sense.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.370
What do you think
about a lot of that?

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:54.155
I think you gave it as the other
half of the equation, where you

01:02:54.155 --> 01:02:56.540
take the real world into
the game, so to speak,

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.240
where people now
dish on commodities,

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.392
and so a form of betting is
they can't bet real world items.

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:07.892
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
It's interesting.

01:03:07.892 --> 01:03:09.850
It's the point where I
am then the sociologist,

01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:11.160
and you start to notice.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:18.720
We have certain cultural notions
about what games all should be,

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.245
a traditionally
modern notion, which

01:03:20.245 --> 01:03:21.540
is this leisure time activity.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.250
It's voluntary.

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.990
You can't gain or
lose anything by it.

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:26.610
The moment you do
that, it's gambling.

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:27.190
It's not really gaming.

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:29.080
That's a different thing,
gambling and gaming,

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.770
although the gambling
industry, because of that

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:31.936
always wants to say, no, no.

01:03:31.936 --> 01:03:33.050
Gambling is gaming.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:34.850
But culturally, we
make that distinction

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:36.766
to say the moment there
is something at stake,

01:03:36.766 --> 01:03:38.787
it's not really gaming anymore.

01:03:38.787 --> 01:03:40.870
And the interesting thing
with all of these things

01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:44.025
is that it basically upturns
existing institutionalizations

01:03:44.025 --> 01:03:46.540
of how games
traditionally happen.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.550
And then people look
at this thing and say,

01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:50.550
how the heck are we going
to make sense of this?

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:53.275
And how the heck are we going
to regulate it, or legislate

01:03:53.275 --> 01:03:54.900
it, and what's right,
and what's wrong?

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.030
So first of all, I just
find it interesting,

01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:59.806
because like every other
media convergence phenomenon,

01:03:59.806 --> 01:04:03.310
it just throws existing
orders into relief,

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:05.520
and then people have to
scramble through the mess.

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:14.210
What else I make of
the-- it's the same

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:21.179
as freemium games, where you pay
for in game advancements, where

01:04:21.179 --> 01:04:23.220
a lot of them, the
traditional triple [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.836
says no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:24.836 --> 01:04:25.690
This is dirty.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:26.250
This is evil.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:30.500
You bring economic things into
our shiny, pristine little

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.615
temples where
economics has no place.

01:04:36.345 --> 01:04:38.760
And then as terrible as the
concept of the magic circle

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.301
is, what they're
basically describing

01:04:40.301 --> 01:04:46.030
is in the old AAA
industry economic model,

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.350
they play games,
the Call of Duties,

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:54.102
money was admittance and
allowed into that game space.

01:04:54.102 --> 01:04:57.161
But when I'm in the game
space, money has no role.

01:04:57.161 --> 01:05:01.135
In the freemium world, you
get into the game for free.

01:05:01.135 --> 01:05:03.885
And then to get ahead, within
the game, sometimes you

01:05:03.885 --> 01:05:05.520
have to pay money.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.175
It's just a different way in
which money factors into game

01:05:08.175 --> 01:05:09.570
play.

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:11.665
It's just that most people
are used to this model

01:05:11.665 --> 01:05:15.810
and say game play should be free
from economic considerations.

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:21.210
Only it hasn't
been for AAA games

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:23.150
either, because AAA
games traditionally,

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:25.435
because of the kind of
business models they have,

01:05:25.435 --> 01:05:27.740
were built such that they
gave great tradeoff for it,

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:32.290
because that's the way you get
a lot of people to do this.

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:36.320
AAA games are
notoriously risk averse.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.940
You just get Call of Duty
24/7, and the next version,

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.810
the next version,
or the next version.

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:43.510
Why?

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:47.980
Because traditional AAA games
are so investment intensive;

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:52.270
dozens of millions of
dollars, that the people who

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:54.570
give the money say,
the only way we

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:56.321
know we're going to
recoup our investments

01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:57.945
is due to the very
same recipe-- again,

01:05:57.945 --> 01:05:59.850
that we did before where
we reduce the risk.

01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:01.363
So in that sense,
money influences

01:06:01.363 --> 01:06:03.946
what happens within the game as
well, just in a different way,

01:06:03.946 --> 01:06:09.335
and in a way people are not used
to, and people scream murder.

01:06:09.335 --> 01:06:11.835
There are then different things
with [INAUDIBLE] I would ask

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:14.650
is that do I like that
aesthetically or not?

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:17.870
That's a different [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:20.175
Based on my personal,
ethical evaluation,

01:06:20.175 --> 01:06:22.940
do I think certain ways
of free to play games

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.490
are organized in
a nice way or not?

01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:30.080
And I would also say no, but
it's the same phenomenon.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.060
Mhm?

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.832
AUDIENCE: So I know you
talk about using people

01:06:33.832 --> 01:06:36.213
or [INAUDIBLE] to [INAUDIBLE]
you hide within games,

01:06:36.213 --> 01:06:37.837
and then you turn
around and sell that.

01:06:37.837 --> 01:06:40.420
What about games
or situations where

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.910
you end up making
a lot of money,

01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:44.311
but not really intending to?

01:06:44.311 --> 01:06:45.769
Like you're still
out there playing

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:49.360
the game even online or
something and you find items,

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.779
or you acquire assets that
are then worth a lot of money.

01:06:52.779 --> 01:06:53.820
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Mhm.

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.380
AUDIENCE: And games like Dodo 2
and TF2 that now, [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.500
So people sell characters after
a point, and then [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:00.902
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:07:00.902 --> 01:07:01.438
AUDIENCE: You play
through a game,

01:07:01.438 --> 01:07:03.229
you get past a certain
point of aggression.

01:07:03.229 --> 01:07:05.750
You cite your character,
and statutes like that.

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:08.059
Or like he was saying,
recent games like Dodo

01:07:08.059 --> 01:07:10.225
and Counter-Strike, a lot
of the battle games, where

01:07:10.225 --> 01:07:12.720
they try the policy
that you can get drops

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.725
that are worth large amounts of
money by simply playing a game.

01:07:15.725 --> 01:07:18.240
AUDIENCE: So they're not
necessarily purposely farming

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.670
for items, but being aware
that that's a possibility,

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:24.536
and that also being part of
the [INAUDIBLE] proclaim.

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:28.157
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:07:28.157 --> 01:07:30.448
From the outset I would say,
whatever floats your boat.

01:07:30.448 --> 01:07:32.550
If you, as an individual
say that's something

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:34.423
that I enjoy doing,
or that's something

01:07:34.423 --> 01:07:37.290
that I want to do for
all kinds of reasons,

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:39.870
then feel free to do so.

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:43.600
So to what extent is
that then still a game?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:50.942
Or is it a game that I play is
an interesting question, which

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:52.900
basically brings us to
when is the game a game,

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.639
or when is the game
a gamification?

01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:58.180
The first thing I would do is
as long as I, as an individual,

01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:01.040
play this predominantly
in order to have fun,

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.346
it fits the regular mold
of how we would say that.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:05.804
Incidentally, in the end, you
find that the exhaust of what

01:08:05.804 --> 01:08:07.225
you can do, you
can also set off.

01:08:07.225 --> 01:08:07.815
It's just oh.

01:08:07.815 --> 01:08:12.400
At that point, it's nice,
interesting, and weird.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:16.120
So let's try and explicate
this one here, actually.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.760
Just shout out.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.206
When is something a game?

01:08:20.206 --> 01:08:22.362
What are the conditions
that have to--

01:08:22.362 --> 01:08:24.082
or how to determine
whether something

01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:26.401
is a game or [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:26.900
Yeah?

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.316
AUDIENCE: I think
that the biggest

01:08:28.316 --> 01:08:30.260
thing is the voluntary playing.

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:34.151
So it's a game if
it's voluntary.

01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:35.609
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Voluntary, OK.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.161
AUDIENCE: A reward system?

01:08:37.161 --> 01:08:38.160
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: OK.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.410
If it has a reward
system, it's a game.

01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:42.165
If it doesn't, it's not a game?

01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:47.225
AUDIENCE: Not
necessarily, right?

01:08:47.225 --> 01:08:48.724
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
I'm asking you.

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:49.166
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:50.319
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: You
suggested a reward system.

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:51.315
I'm just asking.

01:08:51.315 --> 01:08:53.805
AUDIENCE: I think it
is not unique to games,

01:08:53.805 --> 01:08:57.291
but games should definitely
have a reward system.

01:08:57.291 --> 01:09:00.789
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: They
should have one because--

01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:02.330
AUDIENCE: Well,
what's the incentive?

01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:04.370
There should be
one behind a game.

01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:07.319
So it may be a feeling that
you're getting smarter,

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:09.143
or maybe you're getting points.

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:13.560
Or solving a puzzle.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.643
There should be something
that is captivating you.

01:09:15.643 --> 01:09:20.500
But the reward system-- when
you walk in doing your job,

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.270
and you're getting paid for
it, it's also a reward system.

01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:25.986
So I feel like it's
not unique to games,

01:09:25.986 --> 01:09:28.680
but games should definitely
offer a reward system.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.680
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: OK.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.425
Is voluntarynism
unique to games?

01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:35.080
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN: No.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:35.887
AUDIENCE: No.

01:09:35.887 --> 01:09:40.149
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: I can cook
for the enjoyment of cooking.

01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:44.120
So we were playing
a game outside.

01:09:46.928 --> 01:09:52.719
Did you get a reward for that in
your understanding of a reward?

01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:56.260
AUDIENCE: It may not be
something as trivial as hey,

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.040
just get plus one point
or plus two points.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.257
But definitely, you
could bond with people.

01:10:03.257 --> 01:10:04.340
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:06.570
AUDIENCE: So yes,
it was a reward.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:07.570
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: OK.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.270
So I'm just making
sure that you're--

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:11.530
AUDIENCE: Besides the
energy of waking up--

01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:12.800
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.340
I'm just saying that your way
of understanding the reward here

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.920
is something that is
not necessarily tied

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.240
to a reward system.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.713
As you do x number of things,
you get the x number of points

01:10:25.713 --> 01:10:27.838
translatable into the y
number with something else.

01:10:27.838 --> 01:10:33.780
So the suggestion is
you award [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:43.164
broccoli as there
is a desired result,

01:10:43.164 --> 01:10:45.164
however you want to
construe the desired result.

01:10:45.164 --> 01:10:48.454
That's like economists say
preferences, which basically

01:10:48.454 --> 01:10:49.662
means everything [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:50.123
Mhm?

01:10:50.123 --> 01:10:50.737
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:10:50.737 --> 01:10:52.717
Are we just saying when
is something a game?

01:10:52.717 --> 01:10:54.092
Or are we trying
to differentiate

01:10:54.092 --> 01:10:57.148
between when it's a game
and when it's gamification?

01:10:57.148 --> 01:10:58.096
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: We'll
get the gamification.

01:10:58.096 --> 01:10:59.518
Now it's just when
is something a game?

01:10:59.518 --> 01:11:00.059
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:11:00.059 --> 01:11:02.236
Because then voluntary
is not [INAUDIBLE],

01:11:02.236 --> 01:11:04.230
because I was thinking
of it in terms of--

01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:05.230
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Ah.

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:07.097
AUDIENCE: --is it a
game or a gamification?

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:08.930
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
So a game is voluntary.

01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:13.390
Gamification is [INAUDIBLE],
or the other way around.

01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:15.524
Why?

01:11:15.524 --> 01:11:17.980
AUDIENCE: Because gamification
is more of a system

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.220
that I guess you could
choose to be part of it.

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.028
So if you go to a
weird place that does

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:26.190
have a game like culture, or
you're choosing to do that.

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:31.110
But then you could
also inevitably end up

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:34.400
in a gamification culture
where you don't-- if everything

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.890
becomes like that, or you
don't want to be in it.

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:39.570
But a game, like say
video games are playing.

01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:42.410
I could have refrained from
going outside and playing tag.

01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:44.443
So it wasn't a voluntary action.

01:11:44.443 --> 01:11:45.526
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:11:45.526 --> 01:11:48.330
AUDIENCE: I don't know if I
agree that it's necessarily not

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:48.830
voluntary.

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:49.830
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: OK.

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:54.748
AUDIENCE: So I think that games
are that may be non-voluntary,

01:11:54.748 --> 01:11:58.378
but then gamification,
something like it's

01:11:58.378 --> 01:12:02.008
a game if I just play sports
because I enjoy playing sports.

01:12:02.008 --> 01:12:06.654
But if I'm playing
soccer because I

01:12:06.654 --> 01:12:09.888
want to get the
statistics on my Fitbit

01:12:09.888 --> 01:12:13.650
or my pace counter for
my health insurance,

01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:15.430
then it's gamification.

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:17.910
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: What
about professional sports?

01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:21.444
Like I play soccer, because
I earn $5 million a year

01:12:21.444 --> 01:12:22.680
for playing soccer.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.280
And if I know if I
lose that next game,

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.845
I won't win that marketing
contract [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.800
I really have to play
well at this game.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.980
Is that then, still a game?

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:33.926
Or is it gamification?

01:12:33.926 --> 01:12:35.400
Or is it something else?

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.511
AUDIENCE: I can't play.

01:12:37.511 --> 01:12:39.052
AUDIENCE: I could,
and that goes back

01:12:39.052 --> 01:12:42.889
to what you're saying about
the economy, [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:42.889 --> 01:12:46.772
If you say, it's
really cool that I get

01:12:46.772 --> 01:12:48.724
paid to do what I love, yeah.

01:12:48.724 --> 01:12:50.188
I think it's cool.

01:12:50.188 --> 01:12:52.696
I have tons of money.

01:12:52.696 --> 01:12:56.242
But also it [INAUDIBLE] like
if you pay me half as much,

01:12:56.242 --> 01:12:57.396
I would still do it.

01:12:57.396 --> 01:12:57.852
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:12:57.852 --> 01:12:59.643
AUDIENCE: I would still
enjoy this as much,

01:12:59.643 --> 01:13:01.050
then it's more of a game.

01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:02.850
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: So it's
voluntarynist less in terms

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:05.100
of the empirical conditions,
or you pay the amount.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.641
It's voluntarynism
more then in terms

01:13:06.641 --> 01:13:10.732
of how do I perceive
myself as I do this thing?

01:13:10.732 --> 01:13:14.270
Which isn't important
at some point.

01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:16.400
AUDIENCE: I feel
that my time would

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:22.037
be better used doing something
else when it's a game.

01:13:22.037 --> 01:13:24.400
It's pretty useless.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.600
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Ah.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.850
That's interesting.

01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:32.169
So a game has to be a
waste, is it, in some way.

01:13:32.169 --> 01:13:33.919
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
professional player,

01:13:33.919 --> 01:13:36.374
you have to make more
money [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:36.374 --> 01:13:37.242
AUDIENCE: Really?

01:13:37.242 --> 01:13:37.950
AUDIENCE: Really?

01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:40.492
What are you going to do?

01:13:40.492 --> 01:13:43.608
AUDIENCE: Like look
at it honestly.

01:13:43.608 --> 01:13:45.982
Aside from some of the most
recent tournaments and things

01:13:45.982 --> 01:13:47.638
like that where they've
actually stepped up [INAUDIBLE],

01:13:47.638 --> 01:13:49.072
but a lot of that--

01:13:49.072 --> 01:13:50.984
AUDIENCE: Like football
players, right?

01:13:50.984 --> 01:13:53.015
AUDIENCE: So yeah, you're
stepping [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:53.015 --> 01:13:55.390
Some might say conventional
sports, and things like that,

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:57.442
But what's your chances
of making it there?

01:13:57.442 --> 01:13:59.782
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm saying,
if you're Tom Brady,

01:13:59.782 --> 01:14:02.851
you're not making any more
money doing anything else.

01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:03.850
It's a horrible example.

01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:05.016
Brady keeps taking pay cuts.

01:14:05.016 --> 01:14:05.730
Man, [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:11.940
You're not going to get any
more money doing something else,

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:14.540
but it's still something
they find [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.945
Does that mean they don't
think of it like a game?

01:14:16.945 --> 01:14:19.107
I don't know.

01:14:19.107 --> 01:14:20.690
That steps into the
same space that we

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.689
were just at before where we're
asking a question of if you're

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:26.230
playing a sport, because that's
what makes you all the money,

01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:29.166
and it's almost no longer
in your own choice to do it,

01:14:29.166 --> 01:14:31.035
because this is the
best possible option

01:14:31.035 --> 01:14:31.860
for your utility.

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.165
You make more money doing this.

01:14:33.165 --> 01:14:34.090
You're Tiger Woods.

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:36.815
You make more money by playing
golf than mowing your own lawn.

01:14:36.815 --> 01:14:39.190
So naturally, you pay somebody
else to mow your own lawn.

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:40.630
Well, at a certain
point in time,

01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:42.710
you make the most
money by being filmed

01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:46.193
as if you were playing golf.

01:14:46.193 --> 01:14:49.282
AUDIENCE: I really disagree
with calling the game a waste.

01:14:49.282 --> 01:14:50.365
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Sure.

01:14:50.365 --> 01:14:53.140
AUDIENCE: And if I were to
tweet that out right now to Anna

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.754
Anthropy, she would kill me.

01:14:56.754 --> 01:14:57.670
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:04.270
AUDIENCE: People don't generally
consider reading a book

01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:06.270
or reading a newspaper
article a waste.

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:07.665
But there are a
lot of games that

01:15:07.665 --> 01:15:09.916
are like the equivalent
of doing that.

01:15:09.916 --> 01:15:12.630
Like Anna Anthropy's
games, pretty much just

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:15.150
all of her games.

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:19.171
Or like Squinkies
games are all very--

01:15:19.171 --> 01:15:20.670
they're meant to
teach you something

01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:22.911
a lot more than the
bottom right hand corner.

01:15:22.911 --> 01:15:24.786
AUDIENCE: So I would
say the idea of it being

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:28.600
a waste can be more voluntary.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.390
I'm not playing
this game because I

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:34.908
need to do it to finish
a graduation requirement.

01:15:34.908 --> 01:15:39.024
I'm playing this game, because
it's a recreational thing.

01:15:39.024 --> 01:15:40.928
So in some sense,
it's like games

01:15:40.928 --> 01:15:43.860
can be a waste so that's
a really negative turn,

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:47.707
but that gamification is usually
framed into this is a.k.a.

01:15:47.707 --> 01:15:53.100
You should be doing, because its
ulterior motive is [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.850
The market is something
that has to be

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:59.688
valuable in some other context
than just the enjoyment

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:02.740
of the experience.

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:07.770
like you're being more fit or
learning more about something.

01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:10.270
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: You're
just describing the reverse case

01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:11.821
of what they were
actually-- a couple

01:16:11.821 --> 01:16:14.404
of nice [INAUDIBLE] experiments
about in the younger learning.

01:16:14.404 --> 01:16:16.760
In fact, when people
say if you give somebody

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.700
a reward for doing
that, they will later on

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.116
reconstrue why
they did something.

01:16:20.116 --> 01:16:22.188
Oh, it was a good reward.

01:16:22.188 --> 01:16:25.220
Therefore, it cannot be
something that I should do

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.220
for its own sake, just
because I enjoy doing it.

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.386
Or therefore, maybe I didn't
do it for its own sake.

01:16:29.386 --> 01:16:32.020
So next time, I should
expect [INAUDIBLE] for that

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.590
so I'm less motivated to
do it without a motivation

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.820
the next time.

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:38.200
So if you add an extrinsic
reward [INAUDIBLE],

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.494
it becomes less
motivated to begin with,

01:16:41.494 --> 01:16:43.530
because you underline
the perception

01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:47.860
of autonomy of the description
[INAUDIBLE] to begin with.

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.530
Whereas if you say well, if
it's really wasteful, if I

01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:54.705
say there's nothing that
comes out of it reliably,

01:16:54.705 --> 01:16:56.205
I can look at the
situation and say,

01:16:56.205 --> 01:16:59.260
well if it's really
wasteful, the only reason

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.100
why I may do this is because
I enjoy the [INAUDIBLE];

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:04.260
not because I'm getting
a reward for that.

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:09.160
Ergo, this is an activity
that I'm really [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.632
Therefore, if it's
very autonomous,

01:17:10.632 --> 01:17:14.177
[INAUDIBLE], this is something
where I fully just-- this

01:17:14.177 --> 01:17:16.302
comes to us out of my own
personal beliefs, wishes,

01:17:16.302 --> 01:17:20.270
and goals, nothing else.

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:22.686
Or you could use the Calvinist
version of that saying,

01:17:22.686 --> 01:17:23.940
this is a waste.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.490
I shouldn't do this.

01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:28.430
And by the fact
that I put myself

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:32.864
against the moral tub of a
Calvinist culture around me

01:17:32.864 --> 01:17:34.322
that always wants
to be productive,

01:17:34.322 --> 01:17:36.571
and so I intentionally
[INAUDIBLE] completely wasteful

01:17:36.571 --> 01:17:38.751
to show you that I'm
not always controlled

01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:39.836
by your damn culture.

01:17:39.836 --> 01:17:42.134
In the same way, you are
reinserting your autonomy

01:17:42.134 --> 01:17:44.895
by doing something intentionally
[INAUDIBLE], potentially.

01:17:44.895 --> 01:17:48.594
So yes, they're definitely
in these psychological ways,

01:17:48.594 --> 01:17:49.730
intertwined.

01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:52.350
AUDIENCE: I'm curious if that
means the example we said where

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:54.190
they were being paid
to play the game,

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:56.706
but then they also played
it in their days off.

01:17:56.706 --> 01:17:57.052
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:17:57.052 --> 01:17:59.392
AUDIENCE: Then would it be
a game when they played it

01:17:59.392 --> 01:18:03.620
on during their free time,
but it's gamification

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.240
when they do it as a job?

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.530
The same exact game,
with the same exact,

01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:10.096
enjoyment for the
person playing it?

01:18:10.096 --> 01:18:11.845
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
It's a good question,

01:18:11.845 --> 01:18:13.595
but I'll get to that
in one second please.

01:18:13.595 --> 01:18:17.071
AUDIENCE: I think it's worth
unpacking the word game,

01:18:17.071 --> 01:18:19.071
and that we're using it
in two different senses.

01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:23.610
I think you might have just
said there is the people who

01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:25.397
are planning to play
the game for work,

01:18:25.397 --> 01:18:26.730
and then play the game for play.

01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:30.585
But when they're playing a game
outside of the context of work,

01:18:30.585 --> 01:18:35.270
I think they might see it
as I am playing a game right

01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:37.662
now, whereas that other
thing they are playing,

01:18:37.662 --> 01:18:41.030
this game-- how
do I describe it?

01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:43.610
There's a difference
between the game

01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:47.334
that everyone calls a game, this
program system that everyone

01:18:47.334 --> 01:18:50.515
plays, and the activity of
the person actually playing

01:18:50.515 --> 01:18:51.175
the game.

01:18:51.175 --> 01:18:53.216
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] as
a subset of [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:53.216 --> 01:18:54.200
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.665
Gold farming is a thing
you can do in this system

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:59.380
that we call a game, because
people tend to play it.

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:01.070
In that case, there
are ways of playing

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.070
the game that don't meet
that normal expectation

01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:04.740
and might look like work.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.620
And then there's the normal way
of playing the game that they

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.590
return to on their own time that
perhaps is more fun and less

01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:13.189
for this external reward.

01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:14.230
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yep.

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:16.650
That is a very important one,
and one that is especially

01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:20.430
in game study is
usually completed

01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:24.236
that is the distinction between
object and activity [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:24.236 --> 01:19:26.940
of engagement.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:30.514
Because [INAUDIBLE] like to
say well, if I'm the toddler,

01:19:30.514 --> 01:19:32.446
I have no concept
of game theory.

01:19:32.446 --> 01:19:34.190
I haven't been
socialized into games,

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:37.160
and I accidentally happen to
hack under the chess computer,

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.510
entering the exact commands
that are legal commands based

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:42.990
on the rules of chess.

01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:45.242
Is the toddler playing chess?

01:19:45.242 --> 01:19:48.056
Or is the toddler toying around
with the chess set, [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:48.056 --> 01:19:52.680
the concept of what playing
the game of chess means?

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.166
No, but those are free.

01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:55.540
Give the toddler
his [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.290
I'm trying to play chess here.

01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:02.150
In the same way, if I'm
the usability engineer,

01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:05.656
and I am clicking my way
through Halo in order

01:20:05.656 --> 01:20:09.950
to [INAUDIBLE]
usability products.

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:10.910
Am I playing Halo?

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:13.420
Or am I testing Halo?

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:15.495
The activity that
I'm engaged in--

01:20:15.495 --> 01:20:18.025
and this is actually
the court subject,

01:20:18.025 --> 01:20:21.275
what was the subject matter of
my PhD research [INAUDIBLE],

01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:23.650
for exactly that
kind of experience.

01:20:23.650 --> 01:20:25.475
The activity that
they're engaged in

01:20:25.475 --> 01:20:30.005
is testing, even though the
object they're operating with

01:20:30.005 --> 01:20:31.064
is a game.

01:20:31.064 --> 01:20:33.120
So keeping these two
separate you could say well,

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.000
it was the game.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.093
But maybe some points,
when they felt oh, now I'm

01:20:37.093 --> 01:20:39.540
engaged in World of Warcraft
in order to make money,

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.060
they felt this feels
like-- it's still

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.742
game play, what I do, but
it's game play as work.

01:20:44.742 --> 01:20:47.730
It's game play reorganized,
reframed as working to me.

01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:50.052
So it's not really
playing the game anymore.

01:20:50.052 --> 01:20:50.986
It's work playing.

01:20:50.986 --> 01:20:51.922
It's a weird mixture.

01:20:51.922 --> 01:20:54.110
It's a new type of
activity, but it's not

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.570
playing as we know
leisure time [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:56.570 --> 01:21:00.610
So that's definitely an
important distinction.

01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:02.506
The second thing,
or the final thing

01:21:02.506 --> 01:21:05.131
that I want to turn on, in terms
of when it is something a game

01:21:05.131 --> 01:21:06.920
or a gamification?

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.530
First thing to notice--
all of this was tested,

01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:11.085
and you could throw
in new points,

01:21:11.085 --> 01:21:13.610
and you would get it to
the same [INAUDIBLE];

01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:17.380
yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.

01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:21.540
So how do we know if a term is
correctly used for something

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:22.392
or not?

01:21:22.392 --> 01:21:24.668
What determines whether
a word is currently

01:21:24.668 --> 01:21:27.810
used within the device
[INAUDIBLE] or not?

01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:32.794
When is something
correctly called oxygen?

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.235
When is correctly or incorrectly
identified as oxygen?

01:21:40.235 --> 01:21:43.400
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't all
these depend on the context?

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.400
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: How so?

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.820
AUDIENCE: Because if you
just give it time by itself,

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.625
without much context, you
can actually figure out

01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:55.050
if it is correctly used or not.

01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:58.884
So for example, oxygen, just
given the word like that,

01:21:58.884 --> 01:22:04.281
I can say something like we
all need oxygen to break.

01:22:04.281 --> 01:22:05.772
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:22:05.772 --> 01:22:07.760
AUDIENCE: But then
you can also say

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:14.802
something else like too much
oxygen can asphyxiate us.

01:22:14.802 --> 01:22:16.750
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Mhm.

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:18.211
AUDIENCE: Actually,
is that true?

01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:19.862
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:19.862 --> 01:22:21.570
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
I see what you mean.

01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:24.885
So definitely, whether a
statement using the word

01:22:24.885 --> 01:22:27.600
is correct or not depends
on the total statement.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.710
Totally.

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:32.096
Second point is so when
is the term correctly used

01:22:32.096 --> 01:22:32.984
or incorrectly used?

01:22:32.984 --> 01:22:35.400
How do we determine if the
term's correctly or incorrectly

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.230
used to identifying something--
a phenomenon, an object

01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:41.038
in the world, [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:41.038 --> 01:22:45.420
AUDIENCE: I would say it's
really hard to do that.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.444
And there's a reason.

01:22:46.444 --> 01:22:48.235
It's like oxygen,
everyone's thinking here.

01:22:48.235 --> 01:22:49.747
It's also the name
of a TV channel.

01:22:49.747 --> 01:22:50.830
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:51.790
AUDIENCE: And that's
fully correct.

01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:53.020
It just felt like that.

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.730
So I think the context of what
you were saying is important.

01:22:55.730 --> 01:22:58.734
So when you wrote that word
down and asked that question,

01:22:58.734 --> 01:23:00.442
the answer was what
you were thinking of,

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:02.888
because it was in the
context that you have.

01:23:02.888 --> 01:23:04.846
So we would have to figure
out what context you

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:06.595
were talking about and then
answer that question correctly.

01:23:06.595 --> 01:23:08.612
But someone else could come
up and ask the same question

01:23:08.612 --> 01:23:10.880
with a different context,
and the answer would change.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.194
And you could make this
argument for almost every word.

01:23:13.194 --> 01:23:14.689
That's part of the
reason why it's

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:17.105
really hard to get computers
to understand what humans are

01:23:17.105 --> 01:23:18.938
talking about, because
you have to give them

01:23:18.938 --> 01:23:21.080
this conflict and the context.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.381
So I don't know if you can
for sure define something

01:23:23.381 --> 01:23:24.144
like that.

01:23:24.144 --> 01:23:26.060
I may run around with a
different [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.060
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: OK.

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.905
If you ask a
scientist, a chemist,

01:23:28.905 --> 01:23:30.956
how do I identify whether
something's correctly

01:23:30.956 --> 01:23:32.871
or incorrectly called oxygen?

01:23:32.871 --> 01:23:34.164
How do you go about that?

01:23:34.164 --> 01:23:35.773
AUDIENCE: And at
that point, you claim

01:23:35.773 --> 01:23:38.700
that there's some fundamental
principle of the object as such

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:42.550
that you can identify about it
that identifies it as oxygen.

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:45.860
And so you can concoct some
series of tests that allow you

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.882
to verify the things
that make it as such,

01:23:47.882 --> 01:23:49.340
because you have
some set of rules.

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:50.798
You verified against
all the rules,

01:23:50.798 --> 01:23:53.600
and you claim that therefore,
this thing's oxygen.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:54.170
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
Scientists that

01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:55.711
basically were
chemists in that case,

01:23:55.711 --> 01:23:57.160
have operationalized
that concept.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.880
Or the other way
around the concept

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.920
is defined by the very
set of operationalization.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.494
So if it passes these
tests, it counts as oxygen.

01:24:05.494 --> 01:24:07.669
That's how we define that term.

01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:09.210
So that's the
definition [INAUDIBLE],

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.605
which works great for
scientific constructs,

01:24:11.605 --> 01:24:14.890
if that's how scientific
concepts work basically.

01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:17.970
Now, what about
something like delicious?

01:24:20.782 --> 01:24:22.490
When do I know whether
the word delicious

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:27.425
is correctly or incorrectly used
to apply it to a given object?

01:24:27.425 --> 01:24:31.892
AUDIENCE: Isn't that
extremely subjective?

01:24:31.892 --> 01:24:33.475
AUDIENCE: That's
correct, and identify

01:24:33.475 --> 01:24:35.433
against everybody in the
room and prove to them

01:24:35.433 --> 01:24:36.960
that that's delicious.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.918
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
[JOKINGLY] It is delicious

01:24:38.918 --> 01:24:40.770
when I tell you.

01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:41.292
Right.

01:24:41.292 --> 01:24:42.250
It's a subjective term.

01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:44.134
Delicious isn't true
or untrue based on

01:24:44.134 --> 01:24:45.634
whether it passes
a number of tests.

01:24:45.634 --> 01:24:49.948
Delicious is an expression of
a subjective value experience.

01:24:49.948 --> 01:24:52.484
If I find it delicious, I
can use the term delicious.

01:24:52.484 --> 01:24:54.900
It would be incorrectly used
if I used the word delicious,

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:57.200
although I think this is
their choice [INAUDIBLE],

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.270
but it's delicious
for me or not.

01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:05.730
What about as a
kind of middle term?

01:25:05.730 --> 01:25:06.900
It's not a middle term.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.300
This mixes all kinds of things.

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:19.776
What about something
like faux pas?

01:25:23.238 --> 01:25:27.044
A social faux pas or
inappropriateness-- something

01:25:27.044 --> 01:25:28.000
like that.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.474
When is the words
inappropriate and so faux pas

01:25:31.474 --> 01:25:32.468
appropriately used?

01:25:39.923 --> 01:25:43.415
AUDIENCE: It both depends on the
context and if it's subjective.

01:25:43.415 --> 01:25:46.740
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
How is it subjective?

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:51.520
AUDIENCE: In France, something
might be illegal, or in the US,

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.307
it is not.

01:25:52.307 --> 01:25:53.390
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yeah.

01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:57.160
AUDIENCE: And depending on
the context of the thing,

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.672
of what happened, then
even in the same country

01:26:01.672 --> 01:26:04.590
or same location with
the same set of rules,

01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:07.394
it might be good
or bad, depending

01:26:07.394 --> 01:26:10.319
on who is the person
actually looking at it.

01:26:10.319 --> 01:26:11.360
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Mhm.

01:26:16.105 --> 01:26:17.472
So I flush that out.

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:20.790
It's something that we have,
like a formal definition

01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:22.273
to the way that it works.

01:26:22.273 --> 01:26:25.560
There's a set of
[INAUDIBLE] rules you're

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.518
supposed to adhere to, a
way that the context has

01:26:28.518 --> 01:26:30.629
been misinterpreted, or
something of that nature.

01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:32.920
It's like using the word
irony, or something like that.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.882
There's a specific
formula for how you

01:26:34.882 --> 01:26:36.250
know something is [INAUDIBLE].

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:38.640
But past that, there's
also still the fact

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.500
that you have
identify it as such,

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.240
and that's dependent on the
context or the situation

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.160
you read that inside of, because
what it is in one situation may

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.851
not be in another.

01:26:49.851 --> 01:26:51.550
And it's definitely
my situation.

01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:55.660
It's highly situation dependent
on [INAUDIBLE] culturally.

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:58.262
How to properly or
improperly [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:58.262 --> 01:27:00.524
taken that into the business
partisan [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:00.524 --> 01:27:04.140
different depending on
the different cultures.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.942
I do this usually to
how people think about--

01:27:06.942 --> 01:27:08.400
if you'd look at
a certain concept,

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.340
is this more like a
scientific construct?

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.412
Is this more like a
subjective value statement,

01:27:13.412 --> 01:27:17.405
or is this more a
social convention?

01:27:17.405 --> 01:27:21.370
And I would say games
and gamification,

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:25.620
because they weren't around
before people were around.

01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:30.120
But it's still something
that we use as a sure term to

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.065
[INAUDIBLE].

01:27:31.065 --> 01:27:33.627
And don't think that somebody
can say for me, this is a game.

01:27:33.627 --> 01:27:34.712
For me, this is not a game.

01:27:34.712 --> 01:27:35.990
Like you would say for
me, this is delicious.

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:38.175
For me, this is not
delicious, that it's basically

01:27:38.175 --> 01:27:39.938
the social convention
[INAUDIBLE].

01:27:39.938 --> 01:27:43.850
This is this sure
cultural sense of this

01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:46.470
is what a game is
or shouldn't be.

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:49.433
So to an extent, teasing out
when is the game, or when

01:27:49.433 --> 01:27:50.042
is not a game.

01:27:50.042 --> 01:27:51.500
What you're doing
here is basically

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.565
you're doing social linguistics.

01:27:53.565 --> 01:27:56.070
You're teasing out what are
the conventions of a shared

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:58.120
community of people
what they consider

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.872
to be a proper game or not?

01:27:59.872 --> 01:28:01.580
And then you run into
all the [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:03.805
cases where the language
community in front of you.

01:28:03.805 --> 01:28:06.592
And you hear people say, is
that a game I don't know?

01:28:06.592 --> 01:28:07.230
That's weird.

01:28:07.230 --> 01:28:08.250
That's odd.

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:11.882
It doesn't fit my prototype
case of how games should be.

01:28:11.882 --> 01:28:14.560
And gamification
presents us with all

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.950
of these cases for
real money trading

01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:20.160
and stuff like that that,
[INAUDIBLE] all these cases

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.454
that don't fit our
existing social conventions

01:28:22.454 --> 01:28:24.840
of the category of gamers.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.551
And so therefore, we
have all [INAUDIBLE],

01:28:27.551 --> 01:28:29.000
because their
challenge-- they're

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.650
an empirically new
phenomenon that

01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:32.963
don't fit our existing
conceptual categories.

01:28:32.963 --> 01:28:36.020
I was [INAUDIBLE]
existing categories.

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.690
So to a certain extent
when is it games,

01:28:37.690 --> 01:28:39.840
or when is it gamification?

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:45.107
Let's see how society solidifies
opinion around these terms.

01:28:45.107 --> 01:28:50.060
Right now, it's up in the
air, to a certain extent.

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:53.900
Or that's what I suggest, so
that's what I sometimes do.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:56.210
If I introduce an
article I say, I'm not

01:28:56.210 --> 01:28:57.662
doing social [INAUDIBLE] here.

01:28:57.662 --> 01:29:00.640
I'm not trying to tease up
what people think collectively,

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.500
the way they police
language together,

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.416
whether this is a game
or not, or whether this

01:29:04.416 --> 01:29:06.848
is an unsettled
matter [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:06.848 --> 01:29:08.306
I use it as a
scientific construct,

01:29:08.306 --> 01:29:10.040
and here is my
operationalization

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.930
of that scientific construct.

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:13.600
I use the term [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.070
It is supposed to mean that it's
to pass the following tests.

01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:19.690
And if it fits these
tests, it is gamification.

01:29:19.690 --> 01:29:21.826
If it doesn't fit
these tests, it's game.

01:29:21.826 --> 01:29:22.950
You can disagree with that.

01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:24.741
You can make up another
operationalization.

01:29:24.741 --> 01:29:26.684
But in that sense, the
meaning of the word

01:29:26.684 --> 01:29:28.632
is I use it in
[INAUDIBLE] of this text.

01:29:32.050 --> 01:29:33.970
Another interesting
thing in a second.

01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:36.076
Another interesting
thing is that

01:29:36.076 --> 01:29:37.995
is this still a game
or not, or is this this

01:29:37.995 --> 01:29:40.704
or that is that
you often conflict

01:29:40.704 --> 01:29:46.090
normative and
descriptive [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:46.940
This isn't a game.

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.725
If you look at
[INAUDIBLE], it very often

01:29:48.725 --> 01:29:50.433
just means this is
not a game I'm liking.

01:29:52.717 --> 01:29:55.300
It doesn't mean that it doesn't
fit the descriptive categories

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:57.890
that you can say, according
to this game theoretician,

01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:59.820
it's set up list
the five defining

01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:01.445
criteria of whether
it's a game or not.

01:30:01.445 --> 01:30:04.662
It fits the bill, but it's
not a kind of game I'm liking.

01:30:04.662 --> 01:30:07.459
So if we say, is this still
a game or gamification

01:30:07.459 --> 01:30:10.620
it often says is this
a certain kind of game

01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:14.910
that I like versus the certain
kind that I dislike, Dido?

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:18.360
AUDIENCE: So if we're
talking, in regards

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.890
to the more subjective
view of this distinction,

01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:26.236
I was wondering if you
think whether or not

01:30:26.236 --> 01:30:30.540
a person looking at you for a
game or a [INAUDIBLE] context,

01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.940
whether or not if they
identify as the gamer,

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:35.210
or if they had prior
experience with even

01:30:35.210 --> 01:30:38.840
more traditional games will
effect their typecasting of

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.901
whether or not it's a
game or a gamification.

01:30:40.901 --> 01:30:42.734
Will people who are
more familiar with games

01:30:42.734 --> 01:30:44.358
recognize things
that are more subtle

01:30:44.358 --> 01:30:46.195
and say oh, that's
gamification faster?

01:30:46.195 --> 01:30:48.330
Or is it they're more
accustomed to it?

01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:51.227
They won't see it
as much, and just

01:30:51.227 --> 01:30:53.950
wondering the different-- that
would be like me or my mother

01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:55.930
basically.

01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:57.650
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
There are lots

01:30:57.650 --> 01:30:59.190
of interesting [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:02.208
A, there is beginning data,
especially when people

01:31:02.208 --> 01:31:04.152
do gamification [INAUDIBLE].

01:31:04.152 --> 01:31:06.510
We find old people play games.

01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:08.054
They just don't
play video games.

01:31:08.054 --> 01:31:10.053
They play board games,
card games, social games,

01:31:10.053 --> 01:31:11.532
all kinds of games.

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:14.490
It's not as if they were not
introduced to the concept.

01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:19.146
But they don't know the video
game lexicon [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:19.146 --> 01:31:19.646
necessarily.

01:31:19.646 --> 01:31:21.366
So they don't know
progress bars.

01:31:21.366 --> 01:31:23.370
They don't know achievements.

01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:25.566
And so it's all of
that [INAUDIBLE].

01:31:25.566 --> 01:31:26.462
What's that then?

01:31:26.462 --> 01:31:27.358
What happens now?

01:31:27.358 --> 01:31:28.864
And I remember a
former girlfriend

01:31:28.864 --> 01:31:30.448
of mine, the first
time she played.

01:31:30.448 --> 01:31:32.407
[INAUDIBLE] obviously,
there were achievements.

01:31:32.407 --> 01:31:34.198
She was in the achievements
screen and say,

01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:35.280
the game is broken.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.044
How do I get back?

01:31:37.044 --> 01:31:41.580
She wasn't absolutely not
introduced to the concept.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.210
And as gamification
for the elderly

01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:47.700
do is they show
data that indicates

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.440
there is another nice little
identification in the work

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.310
place by [INAUDIBLE]
molecule a bit

01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:59.163
that [INAUDIBLE], that people
who are socialized into games

01:31:59.163 --> 01:32:03.102
tend to pick up gamification
more easily or usually

01:32:03.102 --> 01:32:08.430
a bit more lenient
towards it, whereas people

01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:11.924
who don't have a
game of socialization

01:32:11.924 --> 01:32:13.358
are more [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:19.387 --> 01:32:20.345
The second [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:23.634 --> 01:32:24.135
Yeah?

01:32:24.135 --> 01:32:26.509
AUDIENCE: This is going to
sound really stupid coming out

01:32:26.509 --> 01:32:29.270
of my mouth, but are games
these days gamified in the sense

01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:31.650
that so it takes me to
the achievement system.

01:32:31.650 --> 01:32:34.689
That wasn't in games that
should go back in time?

01:32:34.689 --> 01:32:35.730
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Yep.

01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:37.354
AUDIENCE: And now
you see that it's now

01:32:37.354 --> 01:32:39.982
almost a requisite part of
any game that comes out.

01:32:39.982 --> 01:32:42.229
A game doesn't come out
without achieving things.

01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:44.520
A shooting game doesn't come
without her filling health

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:47.470
bars, and fields,
and things like that.

01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:50.390
These tropes that define
the topic itself necessarily

01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:52.370
comes reflexible with
[INAUDIBLE] on it,

01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:56.100
and it's pointless
to describe things

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.300
as gamified and everything.

01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.512
Both games and non-games
can have that slim set

01:33:00.512 --> 01:33:01.238
of [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:06.442 --> 01:33:08.692
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: I said
one of the things in terms

01:33:08.692 --> 01:33:10.924
of distinctions, you
typically-- and I apologize

01:33:10.924 --> 01:33:12.090
for my terrible handwriting.

01:33:12.090 --> 01:33:14.990
This isn't working [INAUDIBLE]
involving AIDS for me.

01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:17.211
It is between descriptive
and normative.

01:33:17.211 --> 01:33:18.960
Are you using these
terms of indescriptive

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.729
or a normative way?

01:33:19.729 --> 01:33:21.562
I've seen a lot of
people using gamification

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:25.110
in a normative way. [INAUDIBLE]
communication, evaluating that.

01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:27.334
Another one is if you
do a descriptive way,

01:33:27.334 --> 01:33:30.320
how do you operationalize
that definition if you say,

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:32.620
it is gamification if
it has certain features,

01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.860
like an achievement system.

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:38.086
Or is it gamification if
it describes the outcome

01:33:38.086 --> 01:33:40.710
of a certain design process?

01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:43.140
Designers about to make
something more [INAUDIBLE]

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.310
about thinking about [INAUDIBLE]
games to make this more fun.

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:49.120
Then the out come of that,
by definition of unification.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.125
Or not even by the design
process, just by the intention.

01:33:53.125 --> 01:33:56.070
Does the user see
this as something

01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:57.420
that is gamified or not?

01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:00.177
Or did the designer, in doing
this, think about this as now

01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:02.150
I'm doing gamification
or not, which

01:34:02.150 --> 01:34:06.340
answers the question that some
people here ask saying well,

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:09.139
how come this [INAUDIBLE] of
ordinance called gamification,

01:34:09.139 --> 01:34:11.015
whereas we have the
same kind of incentive

01:34:11.015 --> 01:34:15.930
schemes in the big corporations
for decades before that?

01:34:15.930 --> 01:34:18.490
And key performance indicators,
this intelligence dashboard.

01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:20.365
Nobody called it
gamification, even though it

01:34:20.365 --> 01:34:22.913
was the exact same thing.

01:34:22.913 --> 01:34:26.022
It comes down to how do you
operationalize and formalize

01:34:26.022 --> 01:34:27.315
that [INAUDIBLE]?

01:34:27.315 --> 01:34:29.817
If you say it's dependent
on tension and you say well,

01:34:29.817 --> 01:34:30.900
that wasn't the attention.

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.920
This wasn't intended to be
[INAUDIBLE], no matter what

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.084
it was [INAUDIBLE].

01:34:37.084 --> 01:34:40.356
If I define gamification
by a certain feature list.

01:34:40.356 --> 01:34:42.150
So as long as it fits
the feature list.

01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:43.290
Yes?

01:34:43.290 --> 01:34:45.115
So again, how do
you define the term?

01:34:45.115 --> 01:34:47.095
And there, it follows
the [INAUDIBLE].

01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:57.770
GABRIELLE
TREPANIER-JOBIN: Maybe you

01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:02.330
can talk to kids about the
debates around gamification,

01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:05.810
ideologies,
governance, surveyance.

01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:09.330
Maybe it's not like you're an
expertise, or I don't know.

01:35:11.622 --> 01:35:13.705
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: If I
talk about reproduction,

01:35:13.705 --> 01:35:16.375
like gamification of
reproduction, that to me

01:35:16.375 --> 01:35:20.778
is an immediate outflow of
[INAUDIBLE] gamification

01:35:20.778 --> 01:35:21.977
as government [INAUDIBLE].

01:35:21.977 --> 01:35:23.268
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN: Mhm.

01:35:23.268 --> 01:35:25.260
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Definitely.

01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:30.752
So I'm happy to talk about
governmentality and ideology.

01:35:30.752 --> 01:35:31.710
That's a good question.

01:35:31.710 --> 01:35:33.293
Other questions in
the room right now?

01:35:33.293 --> 01:35:37.771
We also have two more
questions on the board.

01:35:37.771 --> 01:35:38.270
Sorry.

01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:39.686
AUDIENCE: I was
going back to what

01:35:39.686 --> 01:35:43.970
you talked about earlier
on the note of autonomy

01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:46.745
being the marker for whether
something feels like a game

01:35:46.745 --> 01:35:48.589
or feels like gamification.

01:35:48.589 --> 01:35:52.770
I feel like autonomy is almost
a loaded term, in this sense

01:35:52.770 --> 01:35:55.220
and that yes, you
could have autonomy,

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:57.615
and that when someone
gives you a test,

01:35:57.615 --> 01:35:59.052
you can decide how to do it.

01:35:59.052 --> 01:36:01.686
And as long as you return
the test in a finished state,

01:36:01.686 --> 01:36:03.655
then you're fine or whatever.

01:36:03.655 --> 01:36:05.670
But there's also
not the autonomy

01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:08.515
where you can go against the
logic of the system, which

01:36:08.515 --> 01:36:10.722
in this case, would be
the logic of the business.

01:36:10.722 --> 01:36:14.610
So I feel like in
this example, it

01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:16.830
felt more like gamification
or a bad attempt

01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:21.930
at gamification to these
people, because the logic was

01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:23.030
pretty one directional.

01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:27.040
It was only ever increasing the
end product for the business,

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:28.680
not letting OK.

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.030
If I want to, I can have
agency against the business.

01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:35.297
And that might have
certain consequences,

01:36:35.297 --> 01:36:36.797
but it would still
be like I already

01:36:36.797 --> 01:36:38.958
know the consequences
beforehand as part

01:36:38.958 --> 01:36:41.410
of having some sort of agency.

01:36:41.410 --> 01:36:44.796
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: This
leads to an age old question

01:36:44.796 --> 01:36:48.334
in humanism.

01:36:48.334 --> 01:36:51.454
It goes back to Kant
and the Enlightenment.

01:36:51.454 --> 01:36:54.080
It goes back to Aristotle.

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:59.660
That is the question, how do
you not instrumentalize people?

01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:03.355
If you take the idea that people
are self-determined actors,

01:37:03.355 --> 01:37:08.020
or that they can become--
we can help people race

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:10.790
towards being
self-driven actors.

01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:13.829
How can we not make them
other determined actors

01:37:13.829 --> 01:37:17.070
in [INAUDIBLE]?

01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:20.430
And that's actually an
interesting question for me,

01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:22.530
because I started out
working in civic education.

01:37:22.530 --> 01:37:27.590
And civic education very much,
at least in Germany thanks

01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:30.051
to the Second World War, and
then thanks to the Allied

01:37:30.051 --> 01:37:31.550
Forces occupying
Germany and saying,

01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:34.540
we should learn a thing
or two about democracy.

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:38.150
So civic education in
Germany, which originally

01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:42.070
was a democracy age that happens
very interesting [INAUDIBLE].

01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:46.680
How can we create
a democratic state?

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.350
Or can we educate
people about democracy

01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:51.370
being a good thing
without ourselves

01:37:51.370 --> 01:37:53.090
becoming a totalitarian rule?

01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:57.310
Without this itself
becoming again, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:59.955
And the argument, or the
point that civic education

01:37:59.955 --> 01:38:03.250
in Germany camp as the
moral stem point which

01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:07.060
reflects the point that
Aristotle had for education,

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.826
in general-- how did we
get to educate people

01:38:09.826 --> 01:38:12.700
to become really
selfish [INAUDIBLE]

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:19.125
is to say as long as for
all intensive purposes,

01:38:19.125 --> 01:38:23.000
according to your own best
knowledge and intentions

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.550
you try to set up this
system of education such

01:38:27.550 --> 01:38:32.030
that you enable the person
going through that education

01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:34.813
at the end of it to make
the independent judgment

01:38:34.813 --> 01:38:36.900
whether that education
is actually the best

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:40.090
possible thing happening to me,
so retrospectively embracing

01:38:40.090 --> 01:38:44.434
what was done to [INAUDIBLE]
saying afterwards,

01:38:44.434 --> 01:38:46.100
without you training
me some discipline,

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:48.580
I would have never
developed the faculties

01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:51.110
in order to be able to be
an independent flourishing

01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:51.610
[INAUDIBLE].

01:38:51.610 --> 01:38:52.630
So thanks for that.

01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:54.255
That was actually
good afterwards, even

01:38:54.255 --> 01:38:56.600
though during the process,
I felt other [INAUDIBLE],

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.600
and I hated it.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:02.230
But as long as you're doing
it in my best interest,

01:39:02.230 --> 01:39:04.930
to bring me to the situation
where you can reflexively

01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:08.560
look at what you did to me
and then say, that was wrong.

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.200
Let's change this.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.260
So as long as everybody
going through the system

01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.851
is the critical
corrector that comes out

01:39:14.851 --> 01:39:16.794
to look afterwards at the system
that says this was actually

01:39:16.794 --> 01:39:18.377
good, or this was
actually [INAUDIBLE]

01:39:18.377 --> 01:39:19.431
way to change the system.

01:39:19.431 --> 01:39:20.430
Then things [INAUDIBLE].

01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:21.957
So that's the procedural order.

01:39:21.957 --> 01:39:23.540
The system is built
with the intention

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:28.060
of making people critical--
changes of the system they

01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:30.240
themselves run through,
then it's fine.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.078
Then it supports
their independence

01:39:32.078 --> 01:39:33.470
and their autonomy [INAUDIBLE].

01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:34.400
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.483
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: There
are very few businesses

01:39:36.483 --> 01:39:38.252
that do that that I'm aware of.

01:39:38.252 --> 01:39:39.335
That's in civic education.

01:39:39.335 --> 01:39:39.960
Oh there it is.

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:42.795
That's the answer to it.

01:39:42.795 --> 01:39:45.294
We'll get to govermentality,
and we'll get to the two others

01:39:45.294 --> 01:39:45.835
on the board.

01:39:45.835 --> 01:39:50.068
Any other thing that you
would like to be addressed?

01:39:50.068 --> 01:39:52.548
[INAUDIBLE] to worry about.

01:39:57.504 --> 01:39:58.004
Sweet.

01:39:58.004 --> 01:40:00.045
Then let's talk about
governmentality very quick,

01:40:00.045 --> 01:40:03.058
and then about what is learning
from games or gamification?

01:40:03.058 --> 01:40:07.430
So can we do this
interestingly or responsibly,

01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:09.600
and can I have some of it?

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.475
So governmentality--
just a show of hands.

01:40:12.475 --> 01:40:16.126
Who knows the term
governmentality?

01:40:16.126 --> 01:40:17.620
Yeah.

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:19.631
It's this ugly
[INAUDIBLE] created

01:40:19.631 --> 01:40:21.880
by Michel Foucault, which
was the bald, gay Frenchman.

01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.319
It was correct, right?

01:40:28.319 --> 01:40:29.360
Anything incorrect here--

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.026
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN:
It's correct.

01:40:32.282 --> 01:40:33.990
SEBASTIAN DETERDING:
I can only say that,

01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:35.475
because I wrote
my master's thesis

01:40:35.475 --> 01:40:37.100
chugging through old
books of Foucault,

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:42.800
so I feel I've
earned saying that.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.725
Governmentality is
basically-- there

01:40:44.725 --> 01:40:47.200
are lots of dimensions of how
it's basically been played.

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.740
But one part of that is to
say modern liberal nation

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:56.390
states, in specific, do
not rule by punishment.

01:40:56.390 --> 01:41:00.060
They do not rule by if you do x
wrong, I'm going to whack you.

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:03.660
Or if you do x well, I'm
going to give you something.

01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:06.570
They rule by putting
people into the mindset

01:41:06.570 --> 01:41:08.649
that they individually
regulate themselves

01:41:08.649 --> 01:41:09.565
and that they believe.

01:41:09.565 --> 01:41:11.626
It's in their own best interest
to regulate their own behavior

01:41:11.626 --> 01:41:13.075
that they internalize it.

01:41:13.075 --> 01:41:14.699
It's a Freudian argument.

01:41:14.699 --> 01:41:16.490
It's not my parents
telling me stuff to do.

01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:20.310
I have my inner parents
telling me that I'm horrible.

01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:22.470
So in the same way,
the state operates

01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:24.760
by getting you to
internalize regulations

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:28.816
so that the state doesn't have
to inefficiently whack you

01:41:28.816 --> 01:41:29.586
the whole time.

01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:35.610
How does governmentality
connect to games?

01:41:35.610 --> 01:41:38.150
Well, you can make the argument
gamification is specific.

01:41:38.150 --> 01:41:41.500
Well, we can make the argument,
or I would make the argument

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:47.720
that a big part of how current
Western nation states manage

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.210
to keep this governmentality
is to tell us

01:41:50.210 --> 01:41:51.570
in order to realize ourselves.

01:41:51.570 --> 01:41:54.832
In order to be our best selves,
in order to be all we can be,

01:41:54.832 --> 01:41:55.790
we have to self-manage.

01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:57.410
We have to self-optimize.

01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:59.930
We have to be productive,
productive productive,

01:41:59.930 --> 01:42:02.157
and manage ourselves, and
become ever more productive

01:42:02.157 --> 01:42:03.011
throughout.

01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:05.450
And then gamification
will quantify itself.

01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:07.630
All of these are basically
tools society then

01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:09.869
gives us or people
give us to say,

01:42:09.869 --> 01:42:12.160
these are ways in which you
can manage yourself better,

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.618
and these are ways
in which you can

01:42:13.618 --> 01:42:16.545
monitor yourself better to make
yourself evermore productive.

01:42:16.545 --> 01:42:18.785
And that was supporting
and reinforcing

01:42:18.785 --> 01:42:21.120
the very societal system
at which we're all

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:25.350
kept to be as productive as
we can be-- that way, actually

01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:28.585
regulating ourselves, instead
of having other people have

01:42:28.585 --> 01:42:29.834
to regulate some of that form.

01:42:29.834 --> 01:42:32.032
And then you can ask yourself,
is that actually a society

01:42:32.032 --> 01:42:33.334
in which I want to live in?

01:42:33.334 --> 01:42:35.290
Do I subscribe to that?

01:42:35.290 --> 01:42:37.922
So that's my one minute
stick on governmentality.

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:42.660
What is good
learning from games,

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.880
or what is good gamification?

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.640
I tried in the
Eudaimonic design article

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:52.300
to tease that outwards,
[INAUDIBLE] on how to do this

01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:55.270
well would look like, and
there's another article

01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:59.475
out the lens of intrinsic skill
[INAUDIBLE] right now on SSRM,

01:42:59.475 --> 01:43:01.270
and the proofs
should fly around.

01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:03.270
Somewhere we've reached
the [INAUDIBLE] journal.

01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:04.481
But there's another
article you could

01:43:04.481 --> 01:43:06.330
find online, the lens
of intrinsic skill

01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:10.140
[INAUDIBLE] where I describe
an actual design method.

01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:12.760
The basic things, I
would say, is do not

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.090
put the cart before the voice.

01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:15.625
That is if you're
a good designer

01:43:15.625 --> 01:43:18.070
you do not say, this is a
solution space, gamification.

01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:20.777
Now, where can I use it, but
work the other way around.

01:43:20.777 --> 01:43:22.485
Look at the problem
and say, what problem

01:43:22.485 --> 01:43:25.660
do I try to solve
in the context?

01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.830
So good, very practical example.

01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:32.540
A friend of mine
uses for Fitbit,

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:36.310
came in Rochester,
Upstate New York.

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:39.160
She walked about
3,000 steps a day.

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:42.544
She's now on a Fulbright
in Croatia in Dubrovnik,

01:43:42.544 --> 01:43:43.210
and [INAUDIBLE].

01:43:46.765 --> 01:43:49.010
Is that a sudden
boost of motivation?

01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:50.820
Is that a sudden
boost of willpower?

01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:55.745
Is that because the Fitbit
has a new feature or some new

01:43:55.745 --> 01:43:57.830
achievements to unlock?

01:43:57.830 --> 01:44:02.335
It's because if you try to get
around in Dubrovnik with a car,

01:44:02.335 --> 01:44:05.090
it's the most complicated
and inefficient way

01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:06.140
of getting around.

01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:09.830
And the city is basically just
one huge flight of stairs.

01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:11.730
So there is no way
for you to do anything

01:44:11.730 --> 01:44:15.310
but walk through your whole day.

01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:19.030
So if I look, Step
Trackers has this solution

01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:21.140
to people's lacking mobility.

01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:24.305
I say well, it's not as
if Americans are slackers

01:44:24.305 --> 01:44:30.260
and Europeans are
monsters of willpower.

01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.820
It's just when I was back
in Hamburg, getting around

01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:36.420
in [INAUDIBLE] was the easiest,
cheapest, most efficient

01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:40.807
way to get form A to B, so
I was biking all the time.

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:42.390
And it was completely
self-sufficient,

01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:43.900
because whenever I couldn't
reach something with a bike,

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:46.445
I could reach it with a well
built out public transportation

01:44:46.445 --> 01:44:47.410
system.

01:44:47.410 --> 01:44:49.910
And drivers, therefore, were
expecting that there were bikes

01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:52.750
all the time.

01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:55.670
Here, especially in Rochester,
which is a car city-- other way

01:44:55.670 --> 01:44:56.980
around.

01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:59.470
I couldn't bike,
even if I wanted to.

01:44:59.470 --> 01:45:01.910
The city architecture
works against me.

01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:04.320
Drivers not being used
to that works against me.

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.130
Wrong roads works against me.

01:45:06.130 --> 01:45:07.720
So suddenly, I
need all willpower

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:10.980
to put myself against the
friction of the environment

01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:13.345
to bike against all odds.

01:45:13.345 --> 01:45:14.970
So don't put the cart
before the horse.

01:45:14.970 --> 01:45:16.496
Look at the problem
and say oh, we actually

01:45:16.496 --> 01:45:17.579
have to change the zoning.

01:45:17.579 --> 01:45:19.100
If we introduce
mixed zoning, people

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.930
will walk, because there's an
easier way between supermarket

01:45:21.930 --> 01:45:25.790
and home, and you will just
walk the small ways [INAUDIBLE].

01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:28.487
So that's the first part.

01:45:28.487 --> 01:45:30.570
And then the second part
is part of your analysis.

01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:32.446
So say to yourself, is
motivation the issue?

01:45:32.446 --> 01:45:35.280
What games do well is indeed,
motivate in certain ways.

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:37.780
That are things that are fun
and enjoyable to a lot of kids.

01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:39.905
And look at the issue and
say, is motivation really

01:45:39.905 --> 01:45:44.390
what is lacking here, motivation
due to a lack of structure,

01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:46.755
due to a lack of
frequent feedback,

01:45:46.755 --> 01:45:49.595
due to a lack of clearly
explicated goals,

01:45:49.595 --> 01:45:52.280
due to a lack of interestingly
varied challenge?

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.090
And again, all of these
are the components

01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:56.296
by which games
actually create fun,

01:45:56.296 --> 01:45:57.670
engaging experience
of competence

01:45:57.670 --> 01:46:00.800
being absorbed in the activity.

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.150
If that's the case, great.

01:46:03.150 --> 01:46:04.580
Take structures from games.

01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:05.700
Take those structures.

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.550
Have better articulated goals.

01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:08.747
Have more frequent feedback.

01:46:08.747 --> 01:46:10.330
Vary the challenge
in interesting ways

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:13.580
so I don't do the same old thing
over, and over, and over again.

01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.190
If that's not the issue, why
should you even try games?

01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:18.540
Again, using the wrong tool.

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:22.800
Like 80% of problems
where I get flown in,

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.485
I look at whatever software
thinking they built and say,

01:46:25.485 --> 01:46:26.610
you have a usability issue.

01:46:26.610 --> 01:46:29.230
You don't have an
engagement issue.

01:46:29.230 --> 01:46:32.000
First people have to figure out
where even to click before you

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.927
have to motivate them
to click, and that's

01:46:33.927 --> 01:46:35.260
hard, and [INAUDIBLE] interface.

01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:36.500
Let's fix that first.

01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:43.445
So that's the short answer.

01:46:43.445 --> 01:46:46.254
And the long answer then,
look into that article,

01:46:46.254 --> 01:46:50.006
and I go into great lengths
to [INAUDIBLE] one, what is it

01:46:50.006 --> 01:46:53.590
we can assure in games?

01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:56.160
Any final questions?

01:47:00.265 --> 01:47:02.140
GABRIELLE TREPANIER-JOBIN:
Thank you so much.

01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:03.431
SEBASTIAN DETERDING: Thank you.

01:47:03.431 --> 01:47:04.390
[APPLAUSE]
