00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.880
NARRATOR: Before he
concluded his broadcast

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.880
with RT Television
Network in 2013,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.960
former Canadian Defense Minister
Paul Hellyer publicly urged

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.000
officials to reveal the truth
about extra terrestrials

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.210
overseeing earth.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.380
This information is
top secret in a way

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.880
that the governments
aren't talking about it,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.080
but if you listen to the
whistleblowers and the people

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.420
who have worked in the industry
and who know what is going on,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.250
there is just a lot of
information out there,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.920
and it doesn't take very
long to get your hands on.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.420
The future of the world depends
on us knowing what is going on

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.000
not only in our own
world, but in others that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.920
are monitoring us and
attempting to influence

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.420
us for better or for worse.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.920
And there are people here
who know a lot about that.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.750
This idea that there are
other entities, whether

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.580
from other dimensions, other
galaxies, other planets, who

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.750
are actually
controlling or somehow

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.540
influencing what is
happening with life on Earth

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.290
is fascinating.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.960
And we always have to ask that
question, what is their agenda?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.620
Is it benevolent?

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.620
Are they here to protect us?

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.420
Or is there another agenda?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.460
Is there an agenda
to control us?

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.120
Is there an agenda
to influence the way

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.290
that we live in a negative way?

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.460
So you have to wonder if
there is in fact some kind

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.290
of extraterrestrial council
that's watching over planet

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.420
Earth, that they are here
to look at our advancement

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.120
and to warn us of
possible catastrophes

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.580
that may be occurring.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.420
And hopefully, we will
heed their warnings.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.000
If we're being monitored by
extraterrestrials, if they're

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.170
watching human affairs, I think
they would be very concerned

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.250
about things that we might do
that would destroy ourselves

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.000
and destroy the planet.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.620
And perhaps part
of the alien agenda

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.250
is our moral
development as well as

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.580
our technological development.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.830
Perhaps this is our ticket to
join the Galactic Federation.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.120
We might never know
their ultimate purpose,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.540
but if this is an experiment,
we should be very, very careful.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.880
Because quite clearly if they
don't like people challenging

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.040
them, well, we are doomed.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.210
NARRATOR: If there are in fact
nine extraterrestrial entities

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.830
overseeing Earth, are they here
to help us as ancient astronaut

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.120
theorists suggest?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.210
Or could they have a
more sinister motive?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.830
Perhaps the answer
will only be revealed

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.500
when they make
contact once again,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.500
and when we are more
ready to accept the truth.
