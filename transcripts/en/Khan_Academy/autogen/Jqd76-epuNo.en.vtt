question to you is you know when you
when you imagine college admissions is

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
when you imagine college admissions is
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.740
when you imagine college admissions is
traditional notion of you get a GPA and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
traditional notion of you get a GPA and
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.240
traditional notion of you get a GPA and
a certain type so you know you have to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
a certain type so you know you have to
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.980
a certain type so you know you have to
take certain classes and all of these to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
take certain classes and all of these to
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.160
take certain classes and all of these to
be quote-unquote qualified is that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
be quote-unquote qualified is that
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.620
be quote-unquote qualified is that
always the case or is there a path for

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
always the case or is there a path for
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.029
always the case or is there a path for
students who might not have a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
students who might not have a
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.099
students who might not have a
traditional GPA or might not have all

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109
traditional GPA or might not have all
 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.470
traditional GPA or might not have all
the traditional classes so I would say

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
the traditional classes so I would say
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.380
the traditional classes so I would say
that particularly in selective

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
that particularly in selective
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.569
that particularly in selective
admissions our job is not so much to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
admissions our job is not so much to
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.030
admissions our job is not so much to
focus on the admit rate and what those

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
focus on the admit rate and what those
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.190
focus on the admit rate and what those
numbers look like when you look at the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
numbers look like when you look at the
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.889
numbers look like when you look at the
incoming profile much more to think

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
incoming profile much more to think
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.209
incoming profile much more to think
about who's the student is going to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
about who's the student is going to
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.619
about who's the student is going to
graduate successfully from our

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
graduate successfully from our
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260
graduate successfully from our
institution and I think if we're doing

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
institution and I think if we're doing
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.119
institution and I think if we're doing
our job well we're finding those

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
our job well we're finding those
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.130
our job well we're finding those
students and it means that to keep up

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
students and it means that to keep up
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380
students and it means that to keep up
with the way students learn today we

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
with the way students learn today we
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.060
with the way students learn today we
have to look beyond those traditional

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
have to look beyond those traditional
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369
have to look beyond those traditional
measures so we do look past GPAs and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
measures so we do look past GPAs and
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.299
measures so we do look past GPAs and
look beyond test scores we don't in

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
look beyond test scores we don't in
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.939
look beyond test scores we don't in
terms of the tools that we use we

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
terms of the tools that we use we
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.160
terms of the tools that we use we
probably haven't tapped into the very

probably haven't tapped into the very
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.920
probably haven't tapped into the very
best ones available yet but we do read

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
best ones available yet but we do read
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.880
best ones available yet but we do read
their writing and we look to see what if

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890
their writing and we look to see what if
 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.649
their writing and we look to see what if
extracurriculars are part of there's

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
extracurriculars are part of there's

really it's thinking about academically

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
really it's thinking about academically
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.719
really it's thinking about academically
are you prepared for a classroom like

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
are you prepared for a classroom like
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.670
are you prepared for a classroom like
the one at Berkeley or the one in

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
the one at Berkeley or the one in
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830
the one at Berkeley or the one in
Virginia or the one at Stanford right to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
Virginia or the one at Stanford right to
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.270
Virginia or the one at Stanford right to
make sure that you'll succeed when

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
make sure that you'll succeed when
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.219
make sure that you'll succeed when
you're there I think for us we really

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
you're there I think for us we really
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109
you're there I think for us we really
have started to see students who are

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
have started to see students who are
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.700
have started to see students who are
branching out and learning in different

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
branching out and learning in different
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.569
branching out and learning in different
ways and they're leading us right we're

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
ways and they're leading us right we're
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.460
ways and they're leading us right we're
having to figure out the ways to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
having to figure out the ways to
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.700
having to figure out the ways to
evaluate and we don't have a whole lot

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
evaluate and we don't have a whole lot
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.030
evaluate and we don't have a whole lot
of experience we certainly have a whole

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040
of experience we certainly have a whole
 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.649
of experience we certainly have a whole
whole group of schools in the Northeast

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
whole group of schools in the Northeast
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.539
whole group of schools in the Northeast
that are some of our oldest secondary

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
that are some of our oldest secondary
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.389
that are some of our oldest secondary
schools who haven't given a letter grade

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
schools who haven't given a letter grade
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.030
schools who haven't given a letter grade
and that's fine we work with those we

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
and that's fine we work with those we
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010
and that's fine we work with those we
always have we've worked with homeschool

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
always have we've worked with homeschool
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.200
always have we've worked with homeschool
students who typically bring us a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
students who typically bring us a
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.260
students who typically bring us a
different kind of high school record so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
different kind of high school record so
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.050
different kind of high school record so
we're learning but I do think that the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
we're learning but I do think that the
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.139
we're learning but I do think that the
process of changing secondary age

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
process of changing secondary age
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.559
process of changing secondary age
kitchen is slowly also changing what we

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
kitchen is slowly also changing what we
 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.619
kitchen is slowly also changing what we
will get and how we evaluate for success

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629
will get and how we evaluate for success
 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.750
will get and how we evaluate for success
once you get onto our campus so how do

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
once you get onto our campus so how do
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.759
once you get onto our campus so how do
you mention academics are very important

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769
you mention academics are very important
 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.649
you mention academics are very important
and completely understand that but how

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659
and completely understand that but how
 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.660
and completely understand that but how
would you evaluate someone's academic

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
would you evaluate someone's academic
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.710
would you evaluate someone's academic
potential if they don't have a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
potential if they don't have a
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.530
potential if they don't have a
traditional GPA so a lot of what we're

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
traditional GPA so a lot of what we're
 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.420
traditional GPA so a lot of what we're
gonna rely on the school to provide is

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
gonna rely on the school to provide is
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.839
gonna rely on the school to provide is
something that articulates in words or

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849
something that articulates in words or
 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:33.619
something that articulates in words or
numbers

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629
numbers
 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.000
numbers
letters whatever it is the type of

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010
letters whatever it is the type of
 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.319
letters whatever it is the type of
environment the student is learning in

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329
environment the student is learning in
 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.979
environment the student is learning in
what the core mastery is supposed to be

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989
what the core mastery is supposed to be
 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.879
what the core mastery is supposed to be
and then just helping us understand the

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889
and then just helping us understand the
 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.460
and then just helping us understand the
evaluation scale and what where does the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
evaluation scale and what where does the
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.920
evaluation scale and what where does the
student fall on that scale and I think

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
student fall on that scale and I think
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960
student fall on that scale and I think
sometimes that could be in the form of a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
sometimes that could be in the form of a
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.390
sometimes that could be in the form of a
paragraph sometimes it may be in the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
paragraph sometimes it may be in the
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.920
paragraph sometimes it may be in the
form of a chart I bet it's not it's not

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930
form of a chart I bet it's not it's not
 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.160
form of a chart I bet it's not it's not
what we do now is really we read within

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
what we do now is really we read within
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.289
what we do now is really we read within
context so it's not crazy to think that

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299
context so it's not crazy to think that
 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.080
context so it's not crazy to think that
we have to investigate the way of school

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090
we have to investigate the way of school
 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.940
we have to investigate the way of school
teachers before we can make the very

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950
teachers before we can make the very
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.069
teachers before we can make the very
best decisions about how the student

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079
best decisions about how the student
 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.930
best decisions about how the student
learns in that school and that's

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940
learns in that school and that's
 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.909
learns in that school and that's
something that we just it's our

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919
something that we just it's our
 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.339
something that we just it's our
responsibility to do we're not in the

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349
responsibility to do we're not in the
 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.680
responsibility to do we're not in the
business of building secondary school

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690
business of building secondary school
 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.900
business of building secondary school
curriculums right we just need to learn

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910
curriculums right we just need to learn
 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.990
curriculums right we just need to learn
what type of curriculum you have and how

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000
what type of curriculum you have and how
 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.170
what type of curriculum you have and how
its articulated to us in terms of the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
its articulated to us in terms of the
 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.569
its articulated to us in terms of the
measurement of success so y'all look at

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579
measurement of success so y'all look at
 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.369
measurement of success so y'all look at
y'all take a closer look or as much

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379
y'all take a closer look or as much
 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.259
y'all take a closer look or as much
context you can have on that particular

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269
context you can have on that particular
 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.449
context you can have on that particular

standardized testing right there's
 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.100
standardized testing right there's
something about it that feels

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110
something about it that feels
 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.040
something about it that feels
standardized so that you can trust it a

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050
standardized so that you can trust it a
 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.010

building up that confidence level and

00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:30.349
building up that confidence level and
 

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:30.700
building up that confidence level and
whether

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:30.710

not they should go talk to the Nuge or
 

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.200
not they should go talk to the Nuge or
whether or not they could possibly

whether or not they could possibly
participate in hands-on learning and so

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:39.020
participate in hands-on learning and so
 

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.270
