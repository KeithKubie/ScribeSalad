00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.570
 In the video about the molecular structure of DNA 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.229
 we saw that DNA consists of two chains, 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.030
 the backbone of which 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.010
 is composed of phosphate - 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.390
 I will use different colors. 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.110
 From a phosphate group and sugar. 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.880
 We have a phosphate group. 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 And sugar (in the backbone of the molecule). 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.159
 Here we have a phosphate group. 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.470
 And sugar. 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.130
 I can draw the chain in this way. 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.320
 We have phosphate and sugar. 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.850
 I'll draw all the phosphates in advance. 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.710
 So let's see the phosphates on this side 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.950
 and then the sugars. 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.160
 We see the same thing on the other circuit. 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.660
 We have 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.129
 phosphate and sugar, 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.120
 then another phosphate and other sugar, 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.850
 then another phosphate. 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.860
 I will also surround the sugars. 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.360
 We have sugar here 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.630
 and here. 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.850
 The other circuit will look the same way. 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.420
 I'll paint the phosphates. 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.560
 I only show them. 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.750
 We have phosphates, then we draw the sugars 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.660
 between phosphates. 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.320
 What connects them can be likened to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.000
 the steps of the ladder. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.762
 The steps are the complementary nitrogen bases. 

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:27.730
 We call them nitrogen bases because - 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.600
 actually forgot to talk about it in the previous videos, 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.000
 because these nitrogen atoms are very electronegative 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.990
 and can also take on hydrogen protons. 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.100
 They have an additional free e-pair. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.200
 Nitrogen atoms have an additional free pair, 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.830
 which, under appropriate conditions, 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.690
 can also attract more hydrogen protons. 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.590
 Many people ask, 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.060
 "Once we have nitrogen bases here," 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.500
 "why DNA is called acid?" 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.120
 "Why is it called acid?" 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.620
 First, the basic properties 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.700
 the nitrogen bases are largely offset 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.010
 from bases forming 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.420
 hydrogen bonds with each other. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.960
 This is how they form 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.660
 the stairs of the ladder, 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.590
 when the complementary nitrogen bases 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.670
 form hydrogen bonds with each other. 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.980
 But the more important reason why we call DNA acid, 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.220
 are the phosphate groups. When protonated, they are acidic. 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.750
 The reason to paint them deprotonated is, 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.660
 that they are so acidic that if they are placed 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.160
 in neutral solution, will be deprotonated. 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.180
 This is the form that is more likely 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.520
 to find in the core of a real cell. 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.557
 The deprotonated form of DNA. 

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:36.590
 Phosphate groups are considered acidic. 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.100
 If I want to draw a cleaner phosphate group, 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.250
 I talked about this in the previous video, 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.763
 I will have to protonate it and it will not 

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.070
 to put the negative charge here. 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.990
 This is a review from the previous video. 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.860
 Let's go on 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.420
 forward. 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.490
 Draw the bases of nitrogen. 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.600
 Here we have thymine. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.760
 I will color the finish in this green color. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.260
 This is a thymin here. 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.500
 This is related to thymine. 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.060
 And the complementary nitrogen base 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.680
 thymine is adenine. 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.778
 Who will -- 

00:03:19.778 --> 00:03:21.720
 to see, end my colors. 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.860
 Let's see. Adenine. 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.430
 I will paint it in orange, 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.100
 because it contains so much nitrogen. 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.740
 In fact, it must also include this hydrogen here. 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.380
 This is adenine here. 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.390
 They have hydrogen bonds 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.820
 with each other. 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.000
 Because they have partially negative and positive charges 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.070
 at both ends, attracted to each other. 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.130
 Now let's go downstairs. 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.860
 What is happening? 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.810
 Let's see -- 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.770
 Now the colors are really over. 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.313
 This nitrogen base is cytosine. 

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:02.510
 This nitrogen base here is cytosine. 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.180
 This nitrogen base here is cytosine. 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.230
 And it connects with guanine. 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.690
 It is associated with guanine. 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.820
 I will draw a guanine in this color. 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.490
 They are connected. 

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.620
 We have guanin here. 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.190
 We saw this even in the introductory video about DNA. 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.340
 Now you can say, "Oh, look, these two chains" 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.010
 "look parallel to one another." 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.602
 And in some ways it is. 

00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:33.500
 But there may be another 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.220
 an interesting thing you noticed - 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.990
 the direction in which the chains are oriented. 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.020
 I guess this is the best way to say it. 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.720
 This is especially noticeable when we concentrate on sugars. 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.760
 Notice the sugars here, the deoxyribosides 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.160
 or portions of the nucleotides resulting from deoxyribose. 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.060
 You see the oxygen atoms at the top, 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.560
 at the top of these five-membered rings. 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.030
 Oxygen is on top. 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.020
 Well, on this side, the oxygen is below. 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.060
 So, the chains are oriented in different directions. 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.560
 Here the oxygen points upwards, 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.850
 here the oxygen points down. 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.330
 And to make it a little clearer, 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.490
 we can number the carbon atoms, 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.530
 to think about the direction 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.320
 and use the sequential numbers of carbon atoms, 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.930
 to describe the different directions. 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.980
 To number the carbon atoms. 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.820
 These two molecules are ribose, 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.530
 we saw them in the video about the molecular structure of DNA. 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.370
 When we talk about DNA, 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.300
 we are talking about deoxyribose. 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.530
 Instead of having a hydroxyl group, 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.250
 connected to carbon atom number two, the deoxyribose has hydrogen. 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.730
 Instead of a hydroxyl group, 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.430
 connected to carbon atom number two, the deoxyribose has hydrogen. 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.990
 Let's number them. 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.750
 This is a carbon atom, 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.250
 we begin with the carbonyl group. 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.860
 Let me make it in a different color. 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.100
 This is a carbon atom a primacy. 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.850
 I number them starting from the carbonyl group. 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.220
 One example (1 '). Two prim. 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.710
 Three prim. Four Prix. 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.900
 Five Prim. 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.590
 When we look at the cyclic shape, 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.200
 it is a carbon atom a primacy. 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.760
 This is two examples. 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.390
 This is three prim. 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.900
 This is four prim. 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.590
 This is five prim. 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.970
 If we have to number them 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.760
 of this scheme here, 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.480
 in the DNA molecule, 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.200
 this is a primacy. 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.060
 This is a carbon atom two primes. 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.060
 This is the carbon atom three primes. 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.960
 This is the carbon atom four primes. 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.690
 And this is the carbon atom five prim. 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.530
 It is important to think 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.010
 for the phosphate group, it participates in the 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.560
 phosphodiester bonds. 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.260
 Phosphodiester bonds 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.340
 allow the individual parts of the DNA backbone to bind. 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.260
 After phosphate, we have a carbon atom five 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.000
 and then through sugar, we come to a carbon atom three primes. 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.330
 Then we get to another phosphate. 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.960
 Then we have a carbon atom five. 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.090
 I will note that this is carbon atom five. 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.890
 Then we come to a carbon atom three primes. 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.790
 And this stems only from the numbering of carbon atoms, 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.600
 starting from carbon atom number one. 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.030
 When in open form, 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.360
 it is part of a carbonyl group. 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.860
 But you see we're starting at five. 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.320
 We start with phosphate, five primes, three primes, 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.780
 phosphate, five, three, phosphate. 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.630
 We can describe the orientation of this circuit, 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.990
 "Hey, we're going in the direction 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.120
 "from five to three," 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.060
 We can say the direction 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.530
 of the left chain is 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.650
 from five to three. 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.760
 And what about the right chain? 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.490
 Let's number the carbon atoms again. 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.400
 This is a carbon atom a primacy. 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.920
 Now this in comparison with that 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.660
 is headed down, this chain is inverted. 

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.860
 Thus, a favor. Two prim. 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.120
 Three prim. Four Prix. 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.410
 Five Prim. 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.360
 I can do it here too. 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.300
 Carbon atom one preference. Carbon atom two prim. 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.260
 Carbon atom three exemplified. 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.520
 Carbon atom four by. Carbon atom 5 exempt. 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.360
 Here we go from phosphate to 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.120
 three primes, five primes, phosphate. 

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.060
 Three primes, five primes, phosphate. 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.930
 The way sugars are oriented, 

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.060
 when we go from top to bottom 

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.830
 it is 

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.970
 from three to five. 

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.460
 The chain on the right side is oriented 

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.050
 from three to five. 

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.170
 We could draw an arrow 

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.300
 from five to three, 

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.271
 like this. 

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.920
 It can be said that these circuits are parallel, 

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.150
 but since 

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.790
 are directed in different directions, 

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.390
 although they are parallel, 

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.400
 we call the structure of DNA - antiparallel. 

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.200
 It is 

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.400
 antiparallel structure of DNA. 

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.120
 These two chains are complementary. 

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.590
 They are defined from one another. 

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.590
 Timin binds to adenine, 

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.990
 cytosine - with guanine. 

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.520
 They are attracted to one another 

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.060
 and are linked via hydrogen bonds. 

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.670
 But the two spine, 

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.050
 are directed in opposite directions. 

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.990
 Another interesting topic for reflection, 

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.190
 when we talk about the structure of DNA, 

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.130
 is how these things are formed? 

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.664
 How do they know they should be oriented in this way? 

00:09:03.664 --> 00:09:06.220
 An important role is played by the fact that 

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.420
 phosphate groups are negative. 

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.490
 The parts they have 

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.810
 negative charge, 

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.230
 will try to get as far as possible 

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.930
 from each other. 

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.230
 Then they continue to orient themselves 

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.690
 and to distract themselves. 

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:18.620
 And they are long. 

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.120
 These molecules are very, very, very, very long. 

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.673
 In the introductory video about DNA 

00:09:22.673 --> 00:09:25.494
 we talk about how long chromosomes are 

00:09:25.494 --> 00:09:27.200
 how many base pairs we have. 

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200
 These are long molecules. 

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.760
 So all these phosphate groups on each of the chains, 

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.660
 want to move away from each other. 

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.950
 And those parts want to get closer 

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.150
 because of hydrogen bonds. 

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.179
 Thus, this ladder-like structure is obtained. 

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:42.520
 DNA is a fascinating molecule, 

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.929
 we can talk about it for days. 

00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:45.370
 It is disturbing 

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.960
 how huge a role it plays in determining who we are. 

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.160
 I hope this video has given you a better idea 

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.390
 about what is DNA molecule molecular, molecular - 

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.819
 I can not say it. At the molecular level.
