Speaker 2:          00:23          headspace. More than 80% of the people I have interviewed, world-class performers across the military, entertainment, sports, and beyond all have some type of meditative practice. I tried for years and years and failed miserably. The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just 10 minutes a day. And technology can help you. This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most popular app for this purpose. More than 4 million users. It's meditation made simple. So what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation, which is rooted in thousands of years of tradition, supported by thousands of scientific studies, and try it for 10 minutes a day for 10 days. That's all you need to do. You could also check out the founder, Andy Puddicombe, uh, ted talk, which has more than 5.5 million views. His last name is p, U. D. D. I. C. O. M. B. E.

Speaker 2:          02:33          Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. Where does usually my job to deconstruct world class performers across all different areas and industries, whether they be military, chess, sports, entertainment, or otherwise. Business. Of course, the obvious one. This time it is a conversation between friends and I am extremely excited to have Kevin Kelly back on the Kevin Kelly. I've said this before, might be the real life, most interesting man in the world. I'm not making up what I'm about to read to you. He is senior maverick at wired magazine, which he cofounded in 1983 he also cofounded the all Species Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on earth in his spare time. Of course, I'm using that tongue and cheek. He writes bestselling books, many of them cofounded the Rosetta project, which is building an archive of all documented human languages and serves on the board of the long now foundation as part of the last, he's investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species, including the wooly mammoth that is not made up. Folks. We touched on a lot of really fun stuff in this episode and when Kevin arrived at my house to record, I had certain plans and I asked him what he wanted to highlight or focus on and we just decided to catch up as friends. So this is very truly the type of conversation that led me in the first place many moons ago.
