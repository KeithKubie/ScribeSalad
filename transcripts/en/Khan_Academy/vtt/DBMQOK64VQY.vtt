00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.210
- [Voiceover] Hey Paige!

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.043
- [Voiceover] What's up David?

00:00:02.043 --> 00:00:02.876
- [Voiceover] Is this right?

00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:04.972
Okay, so I'm about to
go to the grocery store,

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:07.224
and it looks like it says,
"I need to get squid pickles

00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:09.918
and chocolate at the grocery store."

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:10.751
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:11.584
- [Voiceover] Did you want squid pickles?

00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:14.701
- [Voiceover] No, I
wanted squid and pickles.

00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:16.048
- [Voiceover] I must have
written it down wrong, okay.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:18.973
So I think what we need to
do in order to fix this list

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:20.831
and avoid confusion like this

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:24.546
in the future is using
commas to punctuate a list.

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:27.193
'Cause right now this just
looks like squid pickles,

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.237
which, I mean probably
delicious, pickled squid.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.070
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.903
- [Voiceover] Probably delicious.

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:31.736
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:33.244
- [Voiceover] But not what
we were looking to get today.

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:34.077
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:38.608
- [Voiceover] If we don't want
to get pickled squid today,

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:39.978
then we have to put commas

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:41.836
in between the elements of the list.

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:42.669
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:44.204
- [Voiceover] Right, because
this is what commas do.

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:46.224
The separate elements of every everything.

00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:49.034
So let's put in those dividers.

00:00:49.034 --> 00:00:53.260
I need to get squid,
comma, pickles, comma,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.257
and chocolate at the grocery store.

00:00:55.257 --> 00:00:56.090
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.509
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
we can punctuate a list

00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:00.894
by separating out nouns, and
I see from the second sentence

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.307
here, Paige could you
give me a read for that?

00:01:04.307 --> 00:01:06.490
- [Voiceover] I'm going to
go for a run, read a chapter

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.184
of my book and go see the
new Colonel Justice movie.

00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:10.438
- [Voiceover] Oh I hear that's good.

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:13.363
So right now it says that,
but it could also just

00:01:13.363 --> 00:01:15.663
be "I'm going to go for
a run read a chapter

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:17.510
of my book, and go see..."

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.843
you know there's like no--

00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:19.676
- [Voiceover] It's a little confusing.

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:20.948
- [Voiceover] It's a
little confusing, right?

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:23.339
There could be such a thing as a run read.

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:24.268
- [Voiceover] There probably is.

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:25.406
- [Voiceover] You know, like where you go

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:27.774
for a jog while holding a book.

00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:28.657
- [Voiceover] Sounds difficult.

00:01:28.657 --> 00:01:30.793
- [Voiceover] And so we can
also use commas in lists

00:01:30.793 --> 00:01:33.974
to separate not just nouns
like in this first one,

00:01:33.974 --> 00:01:35.437
but also verb phrases.

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:39.082
So I'm going for a run, comma,
read a chapter of my book,

00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:42.008
comma, and go see the new
Colonel Justice movie.

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:43.285
- [Voiceover] Perfect.

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:44.237
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.211
So that's how you punctuate
a list with commas.

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:47.511
- [Voiceover] Yeah, you got it.

00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:48.607
- [Voiceover] You can learn anything.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:49.440
David out.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.662
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
