1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,710
This is Jocko podcast number
22 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,630
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,200
And I would say that it is a good evening.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,090
Sure because we are free,

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,230
we are free

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,110
and I talk about that

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,330
all the time and you hear me
say discipline equals freedom.

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,310
You hear me say free your mind

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,560
and here in America and in places around
the world that have the ability to be

10
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,300
listening to this podcast,

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,750
a lot of times we take freedom for granted

12
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,950
and we all want freedom.
We want the ability,

13
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,430
the capability to move around
and go where we want to go.

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,390
But more importantly

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,260
we want freedom of the mind

16
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,210
and freedom of the heart.
And those things sound abstract.

17
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,290
They seem like things
that cannot be taken away.

18
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,790
We don't even know what that means to
have them taken away because of the way we

19
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:32,770
live and how we were raised

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,090
to think what you want to think and
believe what you want to believe

21
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,870
to be who you want to be,

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,160
to have and to exercise
the freedom to question

23
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,370
and the question,
everything.

24
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,020
That's freedom.

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,920
And there are parts of the world

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,850
where none of those freedoms exist.

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,130
Yeah.

28
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,120
In worse,

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,210
there's parts of the world where any
chance of free thought is exterminated.

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,200
From childhood,

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,200
we'll broken

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,420
dreams,
extinguished,

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,590
faults controlled.

34
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,203
So

35
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,380
let's go to a place where that

36
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,230
is the reality, and again,
I'm going to point this out.

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,440
This is not a dystopian movie
or some post apocalyptic novel.

38
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,910
This is real,
real life

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,700
with real people.

40
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,533
Cool.

41
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,180
Red is reserved for the lettering
of the propaganda signs.

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,560
The Korean language uses a unique
alphabet made up of circles and lines.

43
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,140
The red letters leap out of the
gray landscape with urgency.

44
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,230
They march across the fields,

45
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,620
preside over the granite
cliffs of the mountains,

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,500
punctuate the main roads like mileage,

47
00:03:55,501 --> 00:04:00,501
markers and dance on top of railroad
stations and other public buildings.

48
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,380
They say things like this,

49
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,640
we have nothing to envy in the world.

50
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,160
If the party decides we do

51
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,620
long live, Kim, Il Sung,

52
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,430
let's live our own way.

53
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,210
We will do as the party tells us,

54
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,520
we will do as the party tells us.

55
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,250
And like I said,
this isn't a book.

56
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,890
This is real.
This is North Korea.

57
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,580
This is a story of horror,

58
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,610
end of slavery and of brain washing.

59
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,960
And it's also a story of choices,

60
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,820
story of freedom.

61
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,510
And it's also a story of the
strength of the human will.

62
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,640
This is a book that is
called nothing to envy,

63
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,120
ordinary lives in North Korea.

64
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,560
It's by Barbara Dimmick

65
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,060
or DEMEC.

66
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,223
Yeah,

67
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,030
it Teresa's a bunch of
people that defected,

68
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,570
who Barbara Dematic was able to interview,
who wants,

69
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,220
they left North Korea,

70
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,700
but it traces their lives and
what their lives were like.

71
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,440
And one of the characters, and
again, I want to call it a character,

72
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:05,170
one of the people that's
in the book is named me,

73
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:08,470
ran and going to the book here,
me,

74
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,200
his father was a pow,
and it talks about that me,

75
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,730
his father never talked about being a pow,

76
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,590
but there's a nother fellow
pow who wrote a memoir,

77
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,040
and in his memoir,
and I'm going to the book here,

78
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,140
he said that men were housed in squalid
camps where they were not permitted to

79
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:34,120
bathe or brush their teeth.
Their hair became infested with lice.

80
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,550
Untreated wounds swarmed with maggots.

81
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,100
They were fed one meal of
rice and salt water a day

82
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,930
under the name construction unit of the
Interior Department knew pow camps had

83
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,030
been built near the mines.

84
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,990
Coal Mining in North Korea was not only
dirty but exceedingly dangerous since

85
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:01,570
the mines frequently
collapsed or caught fire

86
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,840
and that same former pow wrote,

87
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,070
the life of a pow was
worth less than a fly.

88
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,870
Every day we walked into the mines,

89
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,140
I shuttered with fear like a cow
walking to the slaughter house.

90
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,880
I never knew if I were to emerge alive.

91
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,640
So if you don't know
anything about anything,

92
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,730
the leader in North Korea at
this time post war is Kim Il Sung

93
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,560
and you still hear his.

94
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,270
His grandson now is in
charge of North Korea,

95
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,570
but at this time, I'm going
to the book. After the war,

96
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Kim Il Sung made it his first order of
business to weed out fo from friend.

97
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,420
He started at the top with
potential rivals for leadership.

98
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,100
He disposed of many of his comrades
in arms who had led the struggle from

99
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:13,300
Manchuria to unseat the
Japanese Japanese occupiers.

100
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,680
He ordered the arrest of the founding
members of the Communist Party in South

101
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,350
Korea.
They had been invaluable during the war.

102
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,030
Now that they'd served their purpose.

103
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,930
They could be discarded throughout the
1950s many more were purged in what was

104
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:32,050
increasingly coming to resemble
an ancient Chinese empire.

105
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:36,640
With Kim Il Sung the
unchallenged master of the realm.

106
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,610
Kim Il Sung then turns his
attention to ordinary people.

107
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,120
In 1958 he ordered up an elaborate
project to classify all North Koreans by

108
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,050
their political reliability,

109
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,180
ambitiously seeking to reorganize
an entire human population.

110
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,530
The North Koreans were
methodical to a fault.

111
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,760
Each person was put through
eight background checks.

112
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,940
Your Song Bun,
as the rating was called,

113
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,110
took into account the backgrounds
of your parents, grandparents,

114
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,120
and even second cousins.

115
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,990
The loyalty surveys were carried out
in various phases with inspiring names.

116
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,670
Intensive guidance by the central
party was the first announced phase.

117
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,360
The classifications became more refined
in subsequent phases such as the

118
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,880
understanding people project
between 1972 and 1974

119
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,760
so those things to me,
they all sound like just bad movie

120
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,710
plots,
right?

121
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,470
The in in intensive guidance
by the central party.

122
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,850
Okay,

123
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,590
that's something you
don't want to mess with

124
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,660
and here's how they would be.
Here's what life was like.

125
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,250
A little bit of life. People would be
closely watched by their neighbors.

126
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,840
North Koreans are organized into
what are called in men bond,

127
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,150
literally people's groups,

128
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,780
cooperatives of 20 or so families whose
job it is to keep tabs on one another

129
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,530
and run the neighborhood.
The Inman bond have an elected leader,

130
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,120
usually a middle aged woman who reports
anything suspicious to higher ranking

131
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,170
authorities.

132
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,680
It was almost impossible for North
Korean of low rank to improve his status.

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,833
Okay,

134
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,620
now we talked about
this character or sorry,

135
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:52,621
the person Miron that's being talked
about and she talks about her father

136
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,600
and here's what she says about her.
Father.

137
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,500
Me Round often found her
father's passivity maddening.

138
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,200
Only later did she understand
this was a survival mechanism.

139
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,920
It was as though he had hammered down his
own personality to avoid drawing undue

140
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:18,321
attention to himself among the thousands
of former South Korean soldiers who

141
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:23,890
tried to assimilate into North
Korean society. Many slipped up me,

142
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,631
Ron's mother.

143
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:29,631
Later later told her that four of
her father's buddies in the mines,

144
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,410
fellow South Koreans had been
executed for minor infractions.

145
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,720
Their bodies dumped in mass graves.

146
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,910
Being a member of the hostel class meant
you would never get the benefit of a

147
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:42,744
doubt.

148
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,240
I'll sarcastic inflection when referring
to Kim Il Sung or nostalgic remark

149
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,970
about South Korea could
get you in serious trouble.

150
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,990
It was especially taboo to talk about
the Korean War and who started it in the

151
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:03,361
official histories and there was nothing
but official history in North Korea.

152
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,270
It was the South Korean army that invaded
acting on orders from the Americans,

153
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,840
not the North Korean army
storming across the 38th parallel.

154
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,840
Anybody who remembered what
really happened on June 25th,

155
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,050
1950 new,
it was wise to keep one's mouth shut.

156
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,320
So even history,

157
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,700
even facts that you learned that
the country learned or just lies

158
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,490
me ran, didn't have any particular
artistic or athletic talent,

159
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,380
but like her older sisters did. But she
was a good student and she was beautiful.

160
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,750
When she was 15 years old,

161
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,890
her school was visited by a team of
serious looking men and women in somber

162
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:54,760
suits.

163
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,300
These were aqua members of the fifth
division of the Central Workers' Party

164
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,180
recruiter recruiters who
scoured the country looking
for young women to serve on

165
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:10,840
the personal staff of Kim
Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.

166
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,700
If selected,

167
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,080
the girls would be sent off to military
style training camp before being

168
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:21,250
assigned to one of the leadership's.
Many residences around the country.

169
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,260
North Korean girls her age
didn't know what a concubine was.

170
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,120
Only that whatever you might do to serve
the leadership would be a tremendous

171
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:33,954
honor.

172
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,680
Only the smartest and prettiest
girls would be selected.

173
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,220
I think we can all imagine what that

174
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,190
looks like.

175
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,750
Twisted men in seats of power,

176
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,320
preying on the entire
nations for young girls.

177
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,223
Disturbing.

178
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,390
Now another character in the book,
and I'm getting,

179
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:11,720
I keep using that term character.
You hear that even me,

180
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,850
I'm sitting here trying to tell everyone,
hey,

181
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,830
remember these are people but
I'm calling them characters.

182
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:18,290
These are characters in a book.
These are people

183
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,390
and this person was named
Mrs Song and Mrs Song.

184
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:30,230
What's interesting about Mrs
Song is she's a true believer.

185
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,320
She's a true believer,
and you're going to hear some of this,

186
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:37,490
but these folks that are raised in
North Korea, they just believe that,

187
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,620
that they believe the propaganda.

188
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,330
They believe that North Korea is the best
place on earth and it everywhere else

189
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:47,990
is suffering and that because
of their great leader,

190
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,210
their lives are better than anyone else
in the world and she truly believes that.

191
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,750
And here's kind of what her attitude,
here's what her life was like.

192
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,280
And her attitude was like,

193
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,140
Mrs Song usually went to work with one
baby strapped to her back in one or two

194
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:05,030
daughters dragging along behind her.

195
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,790
Her children basically grew
up at the daycare center.

196
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,540
She was supposed to work eight hours with
a lunch break and a nap in the middle

197
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,460
of her shift after work.

198
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,580
She had to spend several more hours in
ideological training in the factories

199
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,753
auditorium.

200
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,260
One day the lecture might be about
the struggle against us imperialism.

201
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,513
On other time.

202
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,350
It might be about Kim Il songs exploits
actual or exaggerating fighting the

203
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,940
Japanese.
During World War II.

204
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,680
She had to write essays on the latest
pronouncements of the Worker's Party.

205
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,050
By the time she got home,

206
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,460
it would be 10:30 PM she would
do her housework and cooking.

207
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,450
Then get up before dawn to prepare
herself and her family for the day ahead

208
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,190
before leaving home around 7:00 AM
she seldom slept more than five hours.

209
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,670
Some days were harder than others.
On Wednesday mornings,

210
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,320
she had to report to work
early for mandatory meetings
of the Socialist Women's

211
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,700
Federation. Friday night she stayed
especially late for self criticism.

212
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,360
In these sessions,
members of her work unit,

213
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,200
the department to which she was assigned
would stand up and reveal to the group

214
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,640
anything they had done wrong.

215
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,660
Mrs Song would usually
say in all sincerity,

216
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,640
sincerity that she feared she
wasn't working hard enough.

217
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,690
Mrs Song believed what she said.

218
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,120
All those years of sleep deprivation,
all those lectures and self criticisms,

219
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,160
the very same tools used in brainwashing
or interrogations had wiped out any

220
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:39,320
possibility of resistance.

221
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,340
She had been molded into cumulus songs,

222
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,910
improved human beings.
Kim Il Sung,

223
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,520
his goal wasn't merely
to build a new country.

224
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,910
He wanted to build better
people to reshape human nature.

225
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,640
Once in power,
Kim Il Sung retooled.

226
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:10,641
The ideas developed during his time as
an anti Japanese guerilla fighter as

227
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:15,690
instruments into instruments
of social control.

228
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,380
He instructed North Koreans that
their power as human beings came from

229
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,390
subsuming. Their individual
will to that of the collective.

230
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,800
The collective couldn't go off Willy
Nilly doing whatever the people chose to

231
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,810
some democratic process.

232
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,740
The people had to follow an absolute
supreme leader without question.

233
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,550
That leader of course was Kim.

234
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,410
Il Sung himself.

235
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,950
So they're being told
through multiple channels,

236
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,780
through every instrument available,
newspapers,

237
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,570
radio, television, all
controlled by the state.

238
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,950
And through all these they're being
told that they have to submit their

239
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:11,330
individual will

240
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,680
and perform at the will of the collective.

241
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,740
And you know, you, you
will hear me refer to,

242
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,283
for me

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the most important piece of humanity
is the individual individual freedom

244
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,963
[inaudible]

245
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,560
and obviously this attitude is the
opposite of individual freedom.

246
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,270
And also you got to remember
from a leadership perspective,

247
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,930
the way you maximize a team's effort isn't
through a supreme authority trying to

248
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,900
control everything.
It doesn't work.

249
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,260
That's why we have a little something
called decentralized command.

250
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,220
I want my front line leaders to think I
want my front line troops to understand

251
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:13,980
what they're trying to make happen and
use their free will to make it happen.

252
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,690
Use their own brain to make it happen.

253
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,470
So if you're in a leadership position
and you realize that you're trying to

254
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:20,970
control everything yourself,

255
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,770
you're not getting the most
effective performance from your team.

256
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,933
Hmm.

257
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,660
And we're going to see this on
a grand scale. And you know,

258
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:35,661
we do see it on a grand scale when
governments try to control humans.

259
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,160
It doesn't work.

260
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,800
Now, it might seem crazy that you
would buy into this propaganda.

261
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,440
And here's a, here's a paragraph
in a statement about that.

262
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,670
Back to the book.

263
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,830
We laugh at the excesses of propaganda
and the gullibility of the people,

264
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,880
but consider that their indoctrination
began in their infancy during 14 hour day

265
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:11,781
spent in factory daycare centers
that for the subsequent 50 years,

266
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,880
every song film,
newspaper,

267
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,370
Article and billboard was helped,

268
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,880
was designed to deify Kim Il Sung,

269
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,820
that the country was hermetically seal
to keep out anything that Mike might cast

270
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:29,430
doubt on Kim Il Sung his divinity

271
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,590
who could possibly resist or you're not
just being told that this guy is the

272
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,180
leader you being told he's God.

273
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,423
Mm hmm.

274
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,340
In 1972 on the occasion
of his 60th birthday,

275
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,510
a milestone in Korean culture,

276
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,630
the Workers' Party began distributing
lapel pins of Kim Il Sung before long.

277
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:59,650
The entire population was required to
wear them on the left breast over the

278
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:03,850
heart and Mrs Songs
home as in every other,

279
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,060
a framed portrait of Kim Il Sung
hung on an otherwise bare wall.

280
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,230
People were not permitted to
put anything else on that wall,

281
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,680
not even pictures of
their blood relatives.

282
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,370
The children were never to forget that
they owed everything to the national

283
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:27,760
leadership.
North Korean children.

284
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,860
They didn't celebrate their own birthdays,

285
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:35,010
but those of Kim Il Sung on April
15th and Kim Jong Il on February 16th

286
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,550
when the time came,

287
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,640
the children lined up in front of the
portraits to express their gratitude in

288
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:49,150
unison. They would bend from the
waist, bowing deeply with feeling.

289
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,500
Thank you, dear Father Kim. Il Sung,

290
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,590
the children repeated has their
mother looked on with satisfaction,

291
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,090
televisions and radios and North Korea
are preset so they can receive only

292
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:08,800
official government channels.

293
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,310
Still the programming was relatively
entertaining besides the usual speeches of

294
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:19,000
Kim Il Sung on a typical weeknight,
you might have sports concerts,

295
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,950
television dramas and
movies produced by Kim Il,

296
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,460
Kim Jong Ils film studio.

297
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,290
On weekends you might get a
Russian movie as a special treat.

298
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,520
The newspapers would occasionally run
feature stories about heroic children who

299
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:40,240
ratted out their parents to
be denounced by a neighbor.

300
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:44,390
For bowed mapping the regime
was nothing extra ordinary.

301
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,560
Starting to get a little feeling
for what we've got going on here.

302
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,543
Now,

303
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,080
what happens when the government tries
to control everything and you take the

304
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,940
the freedom of the people away?
Communism,

305
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
obviously,
and

306
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,490
things are not as
productive as they could be.

307
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,840
That's what happens when there's
no individual drive to succeed.

308
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,160
Because if you're a farmer,
once you plant your food,

309
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,150
it's just going to get taken away
by the government and redistributed.

310
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,430
So what's your, what's your drive to grow
the right amount of food or more food?

311
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,460
There is none because it's all just
going to be taken away anyways.

312
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,160
They avoid punishment. So
they do the minimum. Yes.

313
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,980
Rather than the opposite.
When they strive for the maximum,

314
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,750
that means they're focused on what can
be, you know? Yes. Avoiding what can be.

315
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,540
Yes.
And so now this is again,

316
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:52,490
I'm breezing through chunks of this
book to get to some of the highlights.

317
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,650
So now we're into the 80s and

318
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,570
we're starting to run out of food.

319
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,530
Kim Jong Il,
who by the 1980s was increasingly,

320
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,970
it's assuming his father's duties
offered on the spot guidance to,

321
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,190
to address the country's woes.

322
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,520
Father and son were experts
in absolutely everything.

323
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,530
Be at geology or farming.

324
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,520
Kim Jong Il onsite
instructions and is warm.

325
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:29,780
Benevolence are bringing out the,

326
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,690
bringing about a great advancing goat
breeding and output of dairy products.

327
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,680
The Korean Central News Agency opined
after Kim Jong Il visited a goat farm near

328
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,970
Chung Gyn. So that's the kind of, that's
the kind of headlines in the news.

329
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:47,830
Okay.

330
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,400
One day he would decree that the country's
had switched from rice to potatoes

331
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:52,600
for staple food.

332
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,890
The next you would decide that raising
ostriches was the cure for North Korea is

333
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:58,660
food certed shortage,

334
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,310
the country lurched from one
harebrained scheme to another.

335
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,400
So w the fact of the matter is that
even if this guy was a brilliant or is a

336
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,310
brilliant farmer,

337
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,150
he's not taking into account the various
terrain and the different climates that

338
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,270
are in the area and who can get what done.

339
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:23,510
Whereas if you let the free market decide
what can be grown and let individuals

340
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:25,380
decide and let freedom

341
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,360
and guide people things, work things,

342
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,230
find a way,

343
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,540
the control does not work.

344
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,033
Okay?

345
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,170
And you'll see that here.

346
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,470
Back to the book soon the country was
sucked into a vicious death spiral without

347
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,410
cheap fuel,
oil and raw material.

348
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,810
It couldn't keep the factories running,

349
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,860
which meant it had nothing
to export with no exports.

350
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,430
There was no hard currency
and without hard currency,

351
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,580
fuel imports fell even further
and the electricity stopped.

352
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,170
The coal mines couldn't operate without
electricity because they required

353
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,000
electric pumps to safe and water.

354
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,470
The shortage of coal worsened
the electricity shortage,

355
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,640
the electricity shortage further
lowered agricultural output.

356
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,050
Even the collective farms couldn't
operate properly without electricity.

357
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,100
It had never been easy to eek out enough
harvest from North Korea's hardscrabble

358
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:38,810
terrain for a population of 23 million
and the agricultural techniques developed

359
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:40,020
to boost the outport,

360
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:45,021
relied on electrically powered artificial
irrigation and on chemical fertilizers

361
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,950
and pesticides produced it.

362
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:51,951
Factories that were now closed for
lack of fuel and raw materials.

363
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,580
North Korea started running out
of food and as people went hungry,

364
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,210
they didn't have the energy to
work and so output plunged further.

365
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,390
The economy was in a free fall.

366
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:10,650
North Korea was the last place on place
on earth where virtually all staples are

367
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,840
grown on collective farms.

368
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,220
The state confiscates the entire harvest
and then gives a portion back to the

369
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,054
farmer.

370
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,460
But as harvest withered in the early
1990s the farmers themselves were going

371
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:26,490
hungry and began stashing
some of the harvest away.

372
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,410
There were stories from the countryside
of roofs that collapsed under the weight

373
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:33,480
of grain hidden away in the eaves.

374
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,380
The farmers also neglected the collective
fields for their private kitchen

375
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:43,440
gardens next to their
houses or small steep plots.

376
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:48,441
The carved out of the side of uncultivated
mountain slopes driving through the

377
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:49,950
countryside.

378
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,630
You could see clearly the contrast
between private gardens bursting with

379
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,390
vegetables being pulled,
soaring skyward,

380
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,510
vines drooping with Pumpkin's next to the
collective fields with they're stunted

381
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,820
stunted haphazard rows of corn that had
been planted by so called volunteers

382
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,810
doing their patriotic duty.

383
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,990
Case in point.

384
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,870
Koreans like to think to themselves
as tough. And so they are.

385
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,300
The propaganda machine launched a new
campaign playing up Korean pride by

386
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:33,301
recalling a fable from 1938 to 1939 in
which Kim Il Sung commanded a small band

387
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:39,340
of Anti-japanese gorillas fighting
against thousands of enemies in 20 degrees

388
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:43,150
below zero breathing through a
heavy snowfall and starvation.

389
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,850
The red flag fluttering
in front of the rank,

390
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,500
the arduous march,
as they called it,

391
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,100
would later become a
metaphor for the famine.

392
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,103
And here's a,

393
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,700
one of the statements that they would
make no force on Earth can borrow the

394
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:08,320
Korean people from making an onward
march for victory and the revolutionary

395
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:10,990
spirit of the arduous march

396
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:18,410
and the d p d p r a k will
always remain a powerful nation.

397
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,290
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

398
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,730
So people are starving

399
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,280
and the government is saying, yeah, we're
going to drive on. It's a tough road,

400
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:41,090
but we're going to make it
enduring. Hungary became part,

401
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,220
one's patriotic duty.
Billboards went up in Pyongyang,

402
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,270
touting the new slogan,
let's eat two meals a day.

403
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,080
North Korean television ran a documentary
about a man who stomach burst.

404
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,900
It was claimed from eating too much rice.

405
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,480
In any case, the food shortage
was temporary. Agriculture.

406
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,940
Agricultural officials quoted in the
newspapers reported that bumper crops of

407
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:10,280
rice were expected in the next harvest.

408
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,510
When the foreign press reported on food
shortages in north in the north in 1992

409
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:23,020
the North Korean news service
was indignant and here's
what the new North Korean

410
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,160
new service had to say.

411
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,400
The state supplies the people with food
at a cheap price so that the people do

412
00:30:30,771 --> 00:30:32,960
not know how much rice costs.

413
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,440
This is the reality of the
northern half of Korea.

414
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,330
All people live a happy life
without any worries about food.

415
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,380
In our land,

416
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,830
people are starving in
the government is lying.

417
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,620
If North Koreans pause to contemplate
the obvious inconsistencies and lies in

418
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:57,920
what they were told, they would find
themselves in a dangerous place.

419
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,630
They didn't have a choice.
They couldn't flee their country,

420
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,170
depose of their leadership,
speak out or protest.

421
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,000
In order to fit in.

422
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:13,180
The average citizen had to discipline
himself not to think too much.

423
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Then there was the natural human survival
instinct to be optimistic like German

424
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:27,290
Jews in the early 1930s who told
themselves that couldn't get any worse.

425
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,340
The North Koreans deceive themselves.
They thought it was temporary.

426
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,290
Things would get better.
A hungry stomach shouldn't believe a lie,

427
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,900
but somehow it did.

428
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,230
Along with the new propaganda campaign,

429
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,850
the regime stepped up its extensive
network of domestic surveillance.

430
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,300
The more there was to complain about,

431
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,230
the more important it was
to ensure that nobody did.

432
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,563
Yeah.

433
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,110
Okay.
Now at this point,

434
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,670
further in the book,

435
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Miran has gone off to college to
become a teacher and she shows up there

436
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,400
and this is what she deals with.
The food in the cafeteria was even worse.

437
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,350
North Korea was starting.
It's let's eat two meals a day campaign,

438
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,430
but the school took it a step
further and offered only one meal.

439
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,410
A fin soup made of salt water
and dried turnip leaves.

440
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,930
The cafeteria would,

441
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,200
would sometimes add a spoon of rice and
that had been cooked for hours to plump

442
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:42,380
up the grains.

443
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,610
The girls in college began getting sick.
One of me,

444
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:53,390
Rand's roommates was so malnourished that
the skin was flaking off of her face.

445
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,700
She dropped out of school
and others followed.

446
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,640
Now,
during the,

447
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,520
during the middle of this,

448
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,260
Kim Il Sung dies and you know,

449
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:27,490
it's, um, it's crazy to
hear how the people reacted.

450
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,020
And so I'm going to start off with
this announcement that was made

451
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,240
and I, this is long, a little
bit of a long announcement,

452
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,610
but just to get the tone of
it is worth it. Here we go.

453
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,610
The central committee of
the Worker's Party of Korea,

454
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,630
the Central Military Commission of the
Party, the National Defense Commission,

455
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,860
the Central People's Committee and the
Administration Council of the Democratic

456
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:58,180
People's Republic of Korea report to
the entire people of the country with

457
00:33:58,181 --> 00:34:00,580
deepest grief that the great leader,

458
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Comrade Kim Il Sung general secretary
of the Central Committee of the Worker's

459
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:07,654
Party

460
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,390
of Korea and president of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea,

461
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:18,630
passed away from a sudden attack of
illness at 2:00 AM are respected fatherly

462
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:25,231
leader who has devoted his whole
life to the popular masses because of

463
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:31,441
independence and engaged himself in
tireless an energetic activities for the

464
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:36,760
prosperity of the motherland and
the happiness of the people for the

465
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:41,761
reunification of the country
and independence of the
world till the last moments

466
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:48,850
of his life departed from
us to our greatest sorrow.

467
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,540
Very disturbing.

468
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,460
And what's crazy is you hear
all these bureaucratic names.

469
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:02,660
That's what's crazy about it.

470
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:07,661
All of these government organizations
picking away at the people.

471
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,640
And here's some of the reactions.

472
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,700
The morning that went through
and and people like Mrs Song,

473
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:26,630
who is a true believer, this is
how they felt the old women wailed.

474
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,770
How could you leave us?
So suddenly the men's screamed.

475
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,830
Those waiting in line would jump up and
down pound their heads collapsed into

476
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,420
theatrical swoons, rip their clothes
and pound their fists at the air.

477
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,460
In few tile rage,

478
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,090
the men wept copiously as the women.

479
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,650
The histrionics of grief took on a
competitive quality who could weep the

480
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,540
loudest,
who was most distraught?

481
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,460
The mourners were Egged on by the TV news,

482
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:07,080
which broadcast hours and hours of people
wailing grown men with tears rolling

483
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,420
down their cheeks,
banging their heads on trees,

484
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:12,090
sailors banging their heads
against the massive, there's ships,

485
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,820
pilots weeping in the cockpit and so on.

486
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,460
These scenes were interspersed with
footage of lightning and pouring rain.

487
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,800
It looked like Armageddon.

488
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:31,230
Our country is envelops in the deepest
sorrow in the 5,000 year history of the

489
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:36,010
Korean nation.
Intoned in an announcer on television

490
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,670
and they had these little miss that they
throw out there like this one. Here's a,

491
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,120
here's an official release.
When the Great Marshall died,

492
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,260
thousands of cranes descended
from heaven [inaudible] fetch him.

493
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,510
The birds couldn't take him because
they saw that North Koreans cried and

494
00:36:56,511 --> 00:37:01,130
screamed and pummeled their chests,
pulled their hair and pounded the ground.

495
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,660
They couldn't let him go,

496
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,830
but nonetheless,

497
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,630
despite the heroic efforts
of the Grand Marshal,

498
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,180
okay,

499
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,040
the famine continued

500
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,970
and here we go to another
person in the book

501
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,770
whose name is Dr. Kim,

502
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,130
a woman doctor in North
Korea in the pediatric ward.

503
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,260
Dr. Kim noticed that her patients
were exhibiting peculiar symptoms.

504
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,890
The children she treated born in
the late 1980s and early 1990s were

505
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:51,970
surprisingly smaller,

506
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,560
even smaller than she'd been
as the tiniest kid in her
elementary school class.

507
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,920
Now their upper arms were so skinny,

508
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,980
she couldn't circle them with
her thumb and forefingers.

509
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,620
Their muscle tone was a week.

510
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,430
It was a syndrome known as wasting where
the starved body eats away at its own

511
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:13,120
muscle tissue.

512
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,440
Children came in for
constipation that was so acute.

513
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,110
They were doubled over in pain,
screaming.

514
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,010
The problem was with the food housewives.

515
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,320
It started to pick weeds and wild grasses
to add to their soups to create an

516
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:30,970
illusion of vegetables.

517
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,930
Corn was increasingly the
staple again instead of,

518
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,540
but people were adding leaves,

519
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,650
husks stems and carbs
to make it go further.

520
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:47,320
That was okay for adults, but it
couldn't be digested by the tenders.

521
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,640
Stomachs of children,

522
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,200
the babies were in the worst shapes.

523
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:58,780
Their mothers themselves under nourished
didn't produce enough breast milk for

524
00:38:58,781 --> 00:38:59,614
them.

525
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,180
Baby formula was nonexistent
and milk was rare

526
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,683
in the past.

527
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Mothers who couldn't produce enough
breast milk would feed their babies a

528
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:13,380
watered down Kong he made
have made from cooked rice,

529
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,920
but now most of them
couldn't afford rice either.

530
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,960
And here's Dr. Kim talking
about the toddlers.

531
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,250
They would look at me with accusing eyes.

532
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,290
Even four year olds knew they were dying
and that I wasn't doing anything to

533
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:40,010
help them.
Dr. Kim told me years later,

534
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:45,050
all I was capable of doing was to cry
with their mothers and their bodies

535
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,430
afterwards.

536
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,620
Dr. Kim hadn't been a Dr.
Long enough to have a record,

537
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:55,670
the protective wall that would insulate
her from the suffering around her.

538
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,270
The children's pain was her pain

539
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,280
years later when I asked
her if she remembered any
of the children who had died

540
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:09,890
on her watch,
she answered sharply.

541
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,990
I remember all of them

542
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,290
now, me ran, has graduated from college
and she's an actual school teacher.

543
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,490
Dan Actually requirement of school
teachers was that they knew would need to

544
00:40:29,491 --> 00:40:33,610
know how to play the accordion,
which is like a transportable instruments.

545
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,020
So therefore was considered to be a good
thing because you could carry it on a

546
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:40,820
march. So all school teachers had
to play the accordion. Today's,

547
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,240
they sang songs like this

548
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,680
and they would sing it with the class.
Our Father,

549
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,530
we have nothing to envy in the world.

550
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,250
Our houses within the embrace
of the Worker's Party,

551
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,460
we are all brothers and sisters.

552
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,340
Even if a sea of fire comes towards us,

553
00:41:02,341 --> 00:41:05,370
sweet children do not need to be afraid.

554
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,650
Our Father is here.

555
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,890
We have nothing to envy in this world.

556
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,430
Another one of the songs that they'd sing.
Where have we gone?

557
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,410
We've gone to the forest. Where are
we going? We're going over the hills.

558
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,360
What are we going to do?
We are going to kill Japanese soldiers.

559
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,900
And another classic that was taught in
the music classes called shoot the Yankee

560
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:37,070
bastards.

561
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,930
Our enemies are the American bastards
who are trying to take over our beautiful

562
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,950
fatherland with guns that
I make with my own hands.

563
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:50,340
I will shoot them, Bang, Bang, Bang.

564
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,890
That idea of nothing to envy
in the world and, and again,

565
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,270
you know,
as you read through this book,

566
00:41:57,271 --> 00:42:00,930
you hear the people saying that
they believed whole heartedly,

567
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,050
that they had nothing
to envy in the world,

568
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:09,410
that this dismal life of starvation or
near starvation was as good as it gets.

569
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,020
Then here's what the hunger would look
like in school. According to me ran,

570
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,730
each child was supposed to bring from
home a bundle of firewood for the furnace

571
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:27,180
in the school basement,
but many had trouble carrying it

572
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,720
there. Big heads load on top of scrawny
necks. They're delicate rib cages,

573
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:37,860
protruded over their waste so small that
she could encircle them with our hands.

574
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,040
Some of them were starting
to swell in the stomach.

575
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,050
It was all becoming clear to her.

576
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,010
Miran remember seeing a photograph
of a famine victim in Somalia with a

577
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:51,060
protruding stomach, although she
didn't know the medical terminology.

578
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,650
She remembered from our teachers,

579
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,790
teachers college course on nutrition
that it was caused by severe protein

580
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:57,630
deficiency.

581
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,010
Me Ran also noticed that the children's
black hair was getting lighter,

582
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,630
more copper toned.

583
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,720
It was always the same progression.
First,

584
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:12,390
the family wouldn't be able
to send the quote of firewood.

585
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,180
Then the lunch bag would disappear.

586
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,280
Then the child would stop participating
in class and would sleep through recess.

587
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,100
Then without explanation,

588
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:27,600
the child would stop coming
to school over three years.

589
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,550
Enrollment in the kindergarten
drop from 50 students to 15

590
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,090
what happened to all those children?

591
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:37,960
Yeah.

592
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,140
Miran didn't pry too deeply for fear.

593
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,420
The answer she didn't want to hear

594
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,100
a decade later when we ran was a mother
herself trying to lose or pros pregnancy

595
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,960
weight through aerobics.

596
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,430
This period of her life waited
like a stone on her conscience.

597
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:06,390
She often felt sick over what she did
and didn't do to help the young students.

598
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,700
How could she have eaten so well
herself when they were starving

599
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,870
is axiomatic that one death is a tragedy.
1,000 a statistic.

600
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,180
So it was from me ran.

601
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,260
What she didn't realize is that in her
is that her in difference was an acquired

602
00:44:25,601 --> 00:44:30,601
survival skill in order to get through
the 1990s alive one to suppress any

603
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,900
impulse to share food.

604
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,250
Yeah,

605
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,110
to avoid going insane one,

606
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:41,070
how to learn to stop caring in time.

607
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,730
Miran would learn how to walk around a
dead body on the street without paying

608
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:45,570
much attention.

609
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,460
She could pass a five year old on the
verge of death without feeling a feeling

610
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:51,510
obliged to help.

611
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,890
If she wasn't going to share
food with her favorite pupil,

612
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,400
she certainly wasn't going
to help a perfect stranger.

613
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,793
And here's some,

614
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,510
I guess I would say thoughts on
a famine or realities of famine

615
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:16,390
in a famine.
People don't necessarily starved to death.

616
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,730
Often.
Some other ailment gets them first.

617
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,040
Chronic malnutrition impairs the body's
ability to battle infection and the

618
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:30,750
Hungary become increasingly susceptible
to tuberculosis, tuberculosis,

619
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,613
and typhoid.

620
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:37,710
The starved body is too weak to metabolize
antibiotics even if they're available

621
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,850
and normal.
Normally curable.

622
00:45:39,851 --> 00:45:42,930
Does illnesses suddenly become fatal?

623
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:48,770
Wild fluctuations of body chemistry
can trigger strokes and heart attacks.

624
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,880
People die from eating substitute
foods that their bodies can't digest.

625
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:00,140
Starvation can be a sneaky killer that
disguises itself under blend statistics

626
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:05,130
of increased child mortality
or decreased life expectancy.

627
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,180
It leaves behind only circumstantial
evidence of excess morality.

628
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,750
There's excess mortality statistics that
show a higher than normal desk during a

629
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:18,650
certain period.

630
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:20,440
Yeah.

631
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,630
Yet another gratuitous cruelty.

632
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:28,240
The killer famine targets
the most innocent.

633
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,960
The people who would never
steal food, lie, cheat,

634
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,420
break the law or betray a friend.

635
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,570
It was a phenomenon that the
Italian writer, Primo Levi,

636
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:44,571
identified after emerging from Auschwitz
when he wrote that he and his fellow

637
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:47,430
survivors never wanted
to see another one again,

638
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,750
one another again after the war because
they had all done something of which

639
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:52,860
they were ashamed

640
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:59,140
as Mrs Song would observe a decade later
when she thought back on all the people

641
00:46:59,141 --> 00:47:01,600
she knew who died during those years,

642
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:07,620
it was the simple and kindhearted people
who did what they were told they were

643
00:47:08,781 --> 00:47:09,920
the first to die.

644
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,400
Yeah,
yeah.

645
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,650
By 1998 an estimated 600,000 to 2 million
North Koreans had died as a result of

646
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:29,310
the famine.
As much as 10% of the population.

647
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,140
By the end of 1998 the worst
of the famine was over,

648
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,290
not necessarily because
anything had improved,

649
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,170
but as mrs song later surmised,

650
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,480
because there were fewer mouths to feed,

651
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:48,100
everybody who was going
to die was already dead.

652
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,373
Now.

653
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,730
That's how the famine wrapped up.

654
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,790
But to go a little bit in depth of what
it was like once the famine was raging,

655
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,560
people became homeless,

656
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,490
which was strange because in North
Korea they never had a problem with

657
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:08,290
homelessness because if you wanted food,

658
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:11,110
you needed to live in your home because
if the government would allegedly bring

659
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:12,790
you food, well once they
won't bring in food anymore,

660
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:13,900
there was no reason to stay at home.

661
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,860
So now you had people going
out trying to survive. Right.

662
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,080
And this talks a little bit about that,
especially for the children.

663
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:26,930
It was a dangerous life.

664
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,390
The children couldn't sleep
without worrying that somebody,

665
00:48:29,391 --> 00:48:32,450
perhaps another gang member
would steal what little they had.

666
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,400
There were strange stories going around
about adults who preyed on children,

667
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,250
not just for sex but for food.

668
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,600
High ACC was told about people who had
drug children kill them and butcher them

669
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,224
from meat.

670
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:56,410
Behind the station near the railroad
tracks were vendors who cooked up soup and

671
00:48:56,931 --> 00:49:01,460
noodles over small burners and it was
said that the great chunks of meat

672
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:05,030
floating in the broth or human flesh.

673
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,730
The stories got more and more horrific.

674
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Supposedly one father went so insane
with hunger that he ate his own baby.

675
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,300
A market woman were said to have been
arrested for selling soup made from human

676
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:25,590
bones.
From my interviews with the defectors,

677
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:30,770
it does appear that there were cases in
which people were arrested and executed

678
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,730
for cannibalism.
What did our wonderful,

679
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:39,650
uh,
leaders do during this?

680
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:47,990
Here's how they handled the people as
the people who started black markets and

681
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:52,510
started growing these gardens and
selling what they could to get, you know,

682
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,750
people started to try and survive

683
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,890
through exercising
their personal freedoms.

684
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:05,960
And here's one of the ways that are,
here's their comments about this.

685
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,260
This is coming from Kim Jong,

686
00:50:07,261 --> 00:50:12,261
Il as well as any of
the world's strong men.

687
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,140
He understood perfectly the cliche that
an absolute just regime needs absolute

688
00:50:18,211 --> 00:50:19,044
power.

689
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,300
Everything good in life was to
be bequeathed by the government.

690
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,440
He couldn't tolerate people going off
to gather their own food or buying rice

691
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:31,670
with their own money.

692
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,050
Telling people to solve the food problem
on their own only increases the number

693
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:41,560
of farmers, markets and
peddlers. In addition,

694
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:46,740
this creates egoism among the people and
the base of the party's class may come

695
00:50:47,051 --> 00:50:48,070
to collapse.

696
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,940
So He's trying to stop people.

697
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,130
Yeah,

698
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,700
from solving the problems themselves,
which they have the capability to do,

699
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,460
and I don't talk about it too deeply near,
but they'd go into the,

700
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:04,520
the massive black market that was
started and there was people that were

701
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,610
surviving,
were people that were doing that,

702
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,880
that we're figuring out
a way to make money.

703
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:18,710
And Kim Jong Il retaliated against that
free market excessively to try and stop

704
00:51:20,431 --> 00:51:20,551
it.

705
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:25,551
It was better that people die of
starvation than they have the freedom

706
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,160
to try and let their get
their family to survive.

707
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,820
And here's an example of what they
did with one man that was trying to

708
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,150
get money so his family could survive.
Back to the book,

709
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:48,380
the man was accused of climbing electric
poles and cutting copper wire to sell

710
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:54,520
the theft caused extensive damage to the
nation's property and was done with the

711
00:51:54,521 --> 00:51:56,680
intention to damage our social system.

712
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,300
It was an act of treason that aided
the enemies of the socialist state.

713
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,900
The prosecutor read his voice bellowing
through the scratchy speakers than a man

714
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:10,780
acting as a sort of lawyer
for the accused spoke.

715
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,150
Although he offered no defense.

716
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:17,380
I have determined that what
the prosecutor says is true.

717
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:24,160
The accused is the hereby sentence to
death and the sentence will be carried out

718
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:26,380
immediately.
Decreed a third man,

719
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:32,900
the condemned man was bound
to a wooden stake at the eyes,

720
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,030
the chest and the legs.

721
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,420
The firing squad would aim to sever the
ropes in order three bullets in each

722
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:46,600
location. Nine in total, top to bottom.

723
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:48,931
First,

724
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:53,430
the lifeless head would slump over so
that the body would crumble in an orderly

725
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:58,140
heap at the foot of the steak.
Neat and efficient.

726
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,210
It would look like the condemned
man was bowing in death,

727
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,790
as if to apologize.

728
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,670
A murmur went through the crowd who
thought the execution was excessive

729
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,800
punishment for a minor theft,

730
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,310
the electric lines or
weren't working anyways,

731
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,060
the few meters of copper
wiring the man had stolen,

732
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,480
probably had gotten him no
more than a few bags of rice.

733
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,950
A pity he has a younger sister.
Somebody said,

734
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:34,020
two sisters set another.
The man's parents must be dead.

735
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,850
Clearly he knew nobody with
influence to intervene on his behalf.

736
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,330
You probably had a poor
class background as well.

737
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,130
Maybe he was the son of a miner.

738
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,510
The shots rang out

739
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,080
head, chest, legs,

740
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,850
the head

741
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:01,770
burst open like a water balloon,
blood spurted out over the dirt,

742
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:05,100
almost spilling onto
the feet of the crowd.

743
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:17,803
Now

744
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,280
what do people do to stop this?
You know,

745
00:54:24,281 --> 00:54:28,300
and you have rebellion in the world.

746
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,230
You have people turn against
the government in the world.

747
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,170
But in North Korea that did not happen.

748
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,270
And here's why.

749
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:45,510
The level of repression in North Korea
was so great that no organized resistance

750
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:46,600
could take root.

751
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,100
Any anti regime activity would have,

752
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:54,490
would have terrible
consequences for the protester,

753
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:59,700
his immediate family and all other known
relatives under a system that sought to

754
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:05,560
stamp out tainted blood
for three generations.

755
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,390
The punishment would extend to
parents, grandparents, brothers,

756
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,650
sisters, nieces, nephews and cousins.

757
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:19,780
A lot of people felt if
you had to give one life,

758
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,960
you would give it to get
rid of this terrible regime.

759
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,240
But here you are not the
only one getting punished.

760
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:31,960
Your whole family would go through hell.

761
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:41,650
So with the fact that they're
going to give you protest,

762
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,660
they're going to kill everybody.
So there was no protest.

763
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,390
So now the only thing you
can possibly think of doing

764
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,470
okay
is escaping.

765
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:04,690
And it goes through the various people
in the book and how they escaped.

766
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,820
But I thought what was interesting,

767
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:13,690
in fact the most interesting
sort of mental transition
to make was for Mrs Song.

768
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:20,291
And again she was referred to as the true
believer and her daughter had escaped

769
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,710
and made it actually to South Korea

770
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,570
and her daughter arranged to have Mrs Song

771
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,140
Visit China,

772
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:39,130
but she visited China sort of against
the rules thinking that she was going to

773
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:40,180
go back to North Korea.

774
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,280
Yeah,

775
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,490
because she truly believed that
North Korea was the better place.

776
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:51,710
She believed that South Korea
was the enemy. Indie was evil.

777
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,150
And so she spends,

778
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:59,950
but she does go to China and she spent
some time in China and when she's in

779
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:03,580
China,
she staying in the House that you know,

780
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:08,140
her daughter set up for her to stay in
and they have TV and they have microwave

781
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:11,890
oven and they have dishwasher
and they have a rice cooker,

782
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,760
which, which like is miraculous to
her. I mean she's talking about it,

783
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:21,130
she's saying at a certain time the light
would come on and it would make a chirp

784
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:25,390
and that means the rice was now being
cooked. And by the way, at this time,

785
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:27,010
they didn't have rice in North Korea.

786
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,030
So there's this thing that
just automatically cooks up
your rice in the morning.

787
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,740
And it was that combination
of things that broker,

788
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,160
because when she first saw that stuff,
she said, oh, this is imperialistic.

789
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,050
You know, this is capitalism. It's evil.

790
00:57:41,051 --> 00:57:44,320
They're trying to buy us and
enslave us with their capitalism.

791
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,780
That's what she'd been
convinced her whole life.

792
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:47,883
Hmm.

793
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,660
And then she has the realization

794
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,860
bad at Madden would close with this
because after this it goes through the

795
00:57:57,861 --> 00:58:02,150
stories of how they escaped and whatnot.
But this realization,

796
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:08,250
this moment in time when
our mind becomes free

797
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,820
and here's, here's how it
goes, how much they all,

798
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,180
how much had they all missed herself?

799
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:23,520
Her daughter's locked away in North
Korea working themselves to death

800
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,380
for what
we will do,

801
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:35,330
what the party tells us,
we will die for the general,

802
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,700
we have nothing to envy.

803
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,570
She had believed it all
than wasted her life

804
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,380
or maybe not.

805
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,640
Yeah.

806
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,080
Was it really over?

807
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:00,930
She was 57 years old,
still in good health.

808
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,580
This was her wake up call.

809
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,600
She was ready to go.

810
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,560
So I ask,

811
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,113
yeah,

812
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,560
what is your wake call?

813
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,863
Yeah.

814
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,150
What is in sleeving you?

815
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,060
What is controlling your thoughts?

816
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,533
Okay.

817
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:41,050
Is it the television set feeding your
mind images of what life should be?

818
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,430
Is it the Internet drawing you
in and controlling your time?

819
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:56,680
Is it drugs or alcohol numbing your brain

820
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,610
and diminishing your desires?

821
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,420
Or is it weakness,

822
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:12,260
a lack of discipline that prevents you
from accomplishing what you want to

823
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:14,430
accomplish?

824
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,420
And I'm not saying that you have to rebel.

825
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,720
I'm not saying that there aren't
things in life that we just have to do.

826
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,860
There are.

827
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:35,050
But what I am saying is ask questions.

828
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,640
Don't believe everything that you're told
and don't follow the path just because

829
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:42,600
it's there.

830
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:50,550
Don't get in line just
because other people are.

831
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:56,723
Get up

832
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:03,290
and wake up and be conscious of
what is creeping into your mind.

833
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,210
What's getting in there?
What are you letting in there?

834
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,640
What is forcing itself in there

835
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,310
and what does it want you to do?

836
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,090
You have only one life.

837
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:32,760
So don't waste it
being controlled

838
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:36,030
by someone else.

839
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:42,540
That's one of the things that's um,
it's everywhere.

840
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:46,500
Like you can easily be controlled
by stuff. Like I'm a big one is,

841
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,700
I hate it. I hate to harp on
parents, but like your parents,

842
01:01:50,701 --> 01:01:53,310
so nobody's perfect,
right?

843
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:57,470
So all your imperfections or a lot of
your imperfections will be passed onto

844
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,790
your kids just because
you don't know any better.

845
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:03,660
Like that Mrs Song Lady like she just
believed it. She didn't know any better.

846
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:09,230
And so you can end up passing these
things down like certain traditions or um,

847
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:10,531
you know,

848
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:15,531
just methodologies of raising kids
that you might hear otherwise.

849
01:02:16,261 --> 01:02:17,580
But that's your thing.

850
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:20,850
You know that you believed it it
in your mind because your parents,

851
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:21,930
their parents,
you know,

852
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,080
and you don't like how you say ask
questions and you don't ask questions,

853
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:28,260
you're just like, hey, that's
how I was raised. You pass it on.

854
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,020
Meanwhile you're doing the
wrong thing the whole time.

855
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,780
That's what happens when
you don't ask questions.

856
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:36,250
That's what happens when you
don't ask questions. You know,

857
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,740
that's what happens when you believe
authority all the time. Yeah.

858
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,860
And Hey, this might come across as
some people are sitting there saying,

859
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,270
wait a second, Jocko worn shoe in the
military for 20 years. You're damn right.

860
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:49,470
I was,
yeah.

861
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,520
And there was a definitely,

862
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,940
I was a rebellious kid and when I was
in the military I was always questioned

863
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,720
everything that we did and why we did it.
So,

864
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,740
and I think that's one of the things that
helped me get to a leadership position

865
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:08,540
and become a,

866
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:12,750
a decent leader was the fact that I didn't
just take everyone's word for it and

867
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:15,390
say, Oh yeah, that's what we're going to
do. Okay. All right. No, you know what?

868
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:18,810
We're actually going to
change the strategy. We're
going to change the tactics.

869
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:23,010
What why was taught isn't working right
now. We're going to do it differently.

870
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:28,140
Yeah. They did that all the time.
Yeah. But this is a broader scale.

871
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,400
This is a broader scale. This
is life, not just in the book,

872
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:35,880
but life in general.
Life in general.

873
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:37,740
Like what are you doing?

874
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:42,810
Where are you getting your
direction from? Yeah. Who is,

875
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,230
who's got a hold of your
steering wheel. Yeah. Yeah.

876
01:03:47,231 --> 01:03:51,570
And make sure it's you that's got
a hold of your steering wheel.

877
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:52,520
Yeah.

878
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,810
And that's one of the things where it's
tough because you've got to balance it

879
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:58,530
as well. You know, so if you're
just rolling around saying, hey,

880
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,500
nothing's true until I figure it
out, it's Kinda like, you know,

881
01:04:01,501 --> 01:04:04,700
you've got to consider the opportunity
cost where some people you got it,

882
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,430
you know,

883
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:08,310
you got to consider their credibility
and then you got to kind of just go with

884
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,020
it.
And again,

885
01:04:10,021 --> 01:04:13,740
this is just kind of demonstrating
like there's a balance there,

886
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,990
but just like are you're
saying if something,

887
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:21,120
if it's not working and someone
presents you with some alternative,

888
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:24,480
don't just be like, Hey, I've
done it this way, so, you know,

889
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:29,490
leave me alone type of thing. You know,
ask those questions and listen to them.

890
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,270
You know,

891
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:34,560
chances are you might find
a little improved method
and doing some stuff. Yeah.

892
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:37,710
Or you might find out that you've
been sucked into a trap, you know,

893
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,580
do you don't want to be in,
no, you got to free your mind.

894
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:47,400
You got to free your mind. You got to get
out of that box, out of that cage. Yeah.

895
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:52,800
Think of that. You know,
I meet people now and

896
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,630
it's so bizarre because,

897
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,720
because I've traveled a lot and I've,

898
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,320
and I've walked with a lot of different
kinds of people, you know, oh,

899
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,080
from all different walks of life.

900
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,090
And I meet people sometimes
and I think to myself, man,

901
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:13,950
this guy is pretty awesome.
He's got all this, you know,

902
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:18,010
I wonder what this person's goal is.
And sometimes I'll ask like, you know,

903
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,800
what do you want to do? Or
like, what are you, hey,

904
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:25,810
how meet some kid or what you want to do.
And some people say,

905
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:31,120
you know, well, I want to do,
you know, I, I think they're,

906
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,820
I think they're going to come
out with this giant dream

907
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:36,670
and they come out with like a

908
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,260
little mediocre idea.
And I,

909
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:46,120
and I won it and I,
I haven't done this yet.

910
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:51,450
I've talked to five people in the last
six months that I thought were going to

911
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:56,701
tell me about their dream and that I
was going to be like in shock and I was

912
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:03,460
going to be impressed and say, yeah,
that's what I'm talking about, brother.

913
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:04,294
Go get it.

914
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:11,280
And instead I had to bite my tongue
because they were telling me their dream,

915
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,180
but it wasn't big enough. It
wasn't big enough. It wasn't.

916
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,990
It was too realistic. You know, you now,

917
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:22,570
you meet some people sometimes and
they tell me their dream and I go, man,

918
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:25,900
you ain't got a chance at that. You
need to, you need to tone that down.

919
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,990
You need to get a grip. Right.
These people that are like,

920
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,610
you can achieve anything you want.
No,

921
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:33,610
actually you can't
achieve anything you want.

922
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,830
If you could achieve anything you want,
you know,

923
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:40,831
everyone would be sitting on a yacht
or doing whatever big badass thing that

924
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:46,010
they want to do. Kind of depends on what
you mean by can't though. But yeah. Yeah,

925
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:50,170
it's true. I mean can't,
that's what I mean.

926
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,550
These guys, these people that are
like, you can do whatever you want. No,

927
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:58,990
actually there's limitations to that.
All people are not created equal.

928
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,120
Some people are smarter than other people.

929
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:05,170
Some people are better athletes
than other people. Hey,

930
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:09,970
reality.
Now what can you hear the question?

931
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:14,971
Isn't that the question is
what can you do with your,

932
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:18,760
with what you've got,
what can you do?

933
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:23,500
And I'd much rather,
I love to hear people overshooting,

934
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,450
but don't trap yourself in a
box where you're like, well,

935
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:33,250
I'll be happy if I can do
this. Right. And there's whole,

936
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:36,760
the other part of this is,
it's sorta like North Korea.

937
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:41,560
There's people that are trapped in a
paradigm in their head of the world.

938
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:44,740
They think that the world is,
this is this thing that they live in.

939
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,170
They think that the world is this small,

940
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,780
this small place that the
people that they know, right?

941
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:56,110
And the,
the atmosphere that they live inside.

942
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,620
And it's really,
really small.

943
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,140
And I think to myself,
man, you gots to get out.

944
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:06,911
And I'll tell you,

945
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:10,630
part of this came when I got out of the
military because my whole life, you know,

946
01:08:10,631 --> 01:08:14,410
the only guys I knew were seals.
So I mean that's just who I knew.

947
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,740
And so when I got out and
I started meeting other
people and especially started

948
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:21,350
working with big businesses,
started meeting really

949
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:27,970
not just successful in terms of financial
people but people that had really done

950
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:32,930
something [inaudible] and I started
realizing that there was a whole nother

951
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:36,950
level that, not a, not a higher level
but there's just another world. Yeah,

952
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:40,460
like in the seal teams.
Oh well you know a, I did,

953
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:43,850
I did my seal platoon to silk Tim
commander, you know you do these certain,

954
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:45,170
I did task unit commander,

955
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:49,400
you do these things and that's what you
do and it's awesome and that's a whole

956
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:53,450
world. But there's other worlds.
And I remember telling him,

957
01:08:53,451 --> 01:08:55,370
one of my seal buddies,

958
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:59,000
we were out surfing and this is after
I'd been out for like two years.

959
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:02,300
I had this exact conversation
with them. I said, hey man,

960
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:04,021
like we were taught,

961
01:09:04,021 --> 01:09:07,820
we were out there surfing for an hour and
for 58 minutes we're talking about the

962
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:10,130
seal teams, the seal teams, the seal
teams, the seal teams in the seal teams.

963
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:15,020
And then I w I said, hey man,
the seal teams is awesome.

964
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,600
But just so you know,

965
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:24,040
there's other things in the world and
it's stuff that I'm saying my mind was in

966
01:09:24,381 --> 01:09:28,190
North Korea, my mind was just
seal team, you know, and I,

967
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:33,050
and I'll tell you what I'm glad it was
because it made my life very simple and I

968
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:36,350
still, you know, obviously I love
the seal teams more than anything,

969
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:42,250
but there are other worlds out there and
you can do other things in the world.

970
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:48,130
And so now when I meet people in different
environments and different jobs and

971
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:49,850
each little,

972
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,740
each little environment
that I poke my head into,

973
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:57,950
cause we work in different industries
all over different, you know,

974
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,730
manufacturing and gas,
oil and,

975
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:05,330
and financial and they're
all their own little worlds.

976
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:09,140
And sometimes people are trapped in those
worlds. And I just want to say, man,

977
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,740
free your mind, free your mind
and see what else is out there.

978
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,210
Yeah.
Kinda like what you and Tim,

979
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,210
Tim Kennedy were talking
about how you guys,

980
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:26,350
you guys are an example of
people who have seen the really,

981
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:29,200
really bad parts of the world and the
really, really good parts of the world.

982
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:32,820
Cause you guys travel all over and you
live in San Diego, which is, you know,

983
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,930
arguably one of the,
one of the best places to live.

984
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:38,740
So you have that expanded
view. Meanwhile, some people,

985
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,290
they only go on vacation when they travel,
so they have,

986
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,800
although a real positive
and really nice view,

987
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:48,850
but it's really narrow or other
people who only lived in bad places,

988
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:51,730
just like people who grew up
in a real negative household.

989
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,320
When they go out into the world,

990
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:56,110
just their beginning view
of the world is negative.

991
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:59,500
Like money's just so hard to come
by because be when they grew up,

992
01:10:59,501 --> 01:11:03,040
their parents are complaining about the
rent and bills are piling up and all

993
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:05,740
this stuff. So that's their
attitude when they go out and then,

994
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:07,990
then that's how they kind
of take on the world. Man,

995
01:11:07,991 --> 01:11:11,500
I know this and this kind of a different
thing. Same, same content, same subject,

996
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:15,900
but, um, I had a friend in,
in high school in this people,

997
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,700
I grew up in quite a
small island in Hawaii,

998
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:22,701
so some people straight up have their
whole life having been off of choir in no

999
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,090
less than mainland.

1000
01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:28,050
The mainland is this fantasy world place
with where Disneyland is and Hollywood

1001
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:31,800
and all this stuff. So I had a
friend, one of my good friends,

1002
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:36,300
he moved to the mainland, but it was
just this small, teeny tiny town,

1003
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:41,250
just as small as coy. So I remember one
time what state was the down in Colorado?

1004
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:44,580
Colorado is he moved to Pueblo,
it's called.

1005
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:48,480
So I remember we were just
having a conversation later
and I was like, Hey, yeah,

1006
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:51,300
let's, let's go to Las Vegas. A lot
of white people go to Las Vegas.

1007
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,920
And I was like, let's go to Las Vegas
or whatever. I was like, when do you do,

1008
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:58,920
what do you do you rent a car? He was
like, I would never drive in Las Vegas.

1009
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:03,010
I would never drive in Las Vegas
because it's too crazy. You know,

1010
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,510
there's freeways, there's
no freeway on quiet on who
there, there's a highway, but,

1011
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:12,240
and he, a grown adult, so to speak,

1012
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,380
um, can't even dry, you know? So that's
like an example of that's how narrow his,

1013
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,560
his whole view was world,
his whole world.

1014
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:22,680
And I'm that extended to
his driving skill. You know,

1015
01:12:22,681 --> 01:12:27,681
this was just so hectic on a
freeway highway Las Vegas even,

1016
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,730
I don't even know how crazy that is.
I mean,

1017
01:12:29,731 --> 01:12:33,060
that's not a crazy place to drive really.
You know, compared to like, I don't know,

1018
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,343
whatever.
Yeah.

1019
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:39,300
So to La man hit the 405
north on a Thursday afternoon.

1020
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,610
Yeah.
There's no doubt.

1021
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,810
There's so much out there and if
you stay comfortable in your world,

1022
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:51,920
you can get used to, you can get
comfortable starving in North Korea.

1023
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:54,020
That's what the scary thing is.

1024
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:58,700
That's the point that I think I'm trying
to make is don't be comfortable because

1025
01:12:58,701 --> 01:13:01,610
what you think is awesome right now,

1026
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,970
there could be so much more.
You know,

1027
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,600
if you can envision and pay attention
to what's going on in the rest of the

1028
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:15,851
world and break out of that paradigm
that you're in and see that you can fly,

1029
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:25,160
you can fly around the world,
you can do it.

1030
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:29,980
Yeah. Just don't get trapped
and for your mind. Yeah.

1031
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,600
All right,

1032
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:36,600
let's get to some questions
from the interwebs in webs.

1033
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:41,890
Speaking to Inter webs. If you
like supplements, good supplements,

1034
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:45,130
which I think we both recommend,
right?

1035
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:48,050
As far as supplements go get on it.

1036
01:13:48,051 --> 01:13:51,910
Supplements and the,
and we are uh,

1037
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,700
sponsored as it so happens by on it.

1038
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,910
But I would say get on its supplements
anyway cause I was taking them even

1039
01:13:57,911 --> 01:13:58,990
before we were sponsored by on it

1040
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,500
on it.com/jocko and get 10% off.
Get your Krill oil supplements.

1041
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,480
Get Your Alpha brainy.
Yeah.

1042
01:14:07,481 --> 01:14:12,040
Krill oil and Krill oil is anything
for your joints is critical.

1043
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,670
Cause like when you, even even when
I was young, when you lift hard,

1044
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:19,390
when you get after it working out.
Um,

1045
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,960
so okay, so if you gain strength, right,

1046
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:26,110
which of course we all kind
of want to do or whatever, um,

1047
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:28,630
you don't have to put a
whatever on the end of the day.

1048
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:33,040
We just all want to just period
generally best not to speak for everyone,

1049
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:36,700
but I think it's safe to assume that yes,
we're getting straight straight.

1050
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:39,100
But when you have a higher
capacity for strength,

1051
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:42,130
a lot of times your muscles will
just want to fire real heart.

1052
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:46,900
So what that can end up with is
this weird stiffness, you know,

1053
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:48,850
so you're going to end like,
it's like you got to,

1054
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,510
it's almost like you've got a warm up
in life. It's almost like that feeling,

1055
01:14:52,511 --> 01:14:54,580
you know, so it's like,
yeah, you're strong,

1056
01:14:54,581 --> 01:14:59,581
you're about to carry like the whole
bloat of groceries in and you can do that.

1057
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:01,301
It may be,
you know,

1058
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:06,280
you grown a grocery you to come up with
song saying everyday stuff and you can,

1059
01:15:06,281 --> 01:15:09,220
you can get after doing that. But
you kind of got a warm up, you know,

1060
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:14,140
it's kind of like eh could have anyway,
groceries, you have a lot man. Hey Man,

1061
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,650
get after in the store, out
of the store. So anyway,

1062
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:22,090
so the point being like when you have
stuff like for your joints or you don't

1063
01:15:22,091 --> 01:15:25,060
take care of your joints, see I would
have told this totally differently.

1064
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:28,510
I like if you want to Jack big steel,
you want to do Jujitsu,

1065
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,090
you want to jump off things,
you want to throw stuff around,

1066
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:35,530
get some krill oil so you stay healthy.
Yeah. Talking about groceries. No,

1067
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,850
but I'm saying though it's, it's,
it is, it seems counter productive.

1068
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:42,820
Cause I've experienced, experienced
this where I'm like, yeah,

1069
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:47,680
but then I kinda gotta like
do twists. You know, Dan,

1070
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:52,630
I'm strong, you know, it's kind of cold
out. And then I'd go to live, I'm like,

1071
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:53,930
Dang,
I can lift a lot of weights.

1072
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:57,520
But why on this first set I can't even
lift anything. You just need to Krill oil.

1073
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:01,300
I'm just saying your joints gotta be like,
good to go.

1074
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:06,950
That was a long explanation, right? It's
absolutely true. I'm telling you, if,

1075
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,660
if you take it, you take that to
heart. Well you already take Krill oil,

1076
01:16:10,661 --> 01:16:15,010
so you're the man anyway.
Yeah on it.com/jocko get 10% off.

1080
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,360
Click on the Amazon link on the top.
And um,

1081
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,000
it gives us a percentage and you
know, you don't pay nothing. Um,

1082
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,230
people have been a few people
mentioned that like the, the,

1083
01:16:36,231 --> 01:16:39,580
the link doesn't work or whatever.
And I found out through one of the,

1084
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,470
the true pursuer in the know,

1085
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,750
sometimes you have ad blockers on
your browser and they're activated,

1086
01:16:46,751 --> 01:16:49,330
which is a good thing by the way.
It's, it's good to, you know,

1087
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:53,120
cause sometimes they can air can get
it back anyway. Yeah. Because it's,

1088
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:57,110
it's an actual code and it
works in, in, in the same ways.

1089
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:01,750
Don't tell those small stuff
to me. Yeah. Anyway, so
deactivate it. If, um, you know,

1090
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,320
you want to get past it, there it is.
Or if you want to buy some shirts,

1091
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:10,490
which uncle was hit and or
name on it, go Jocko, store.com

1092
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:16,060
that's it's cool way to represent
anyway. Yep, there it is. Alright,

1093
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:19,610
let's get it first question. Any
questions? Okay. First question,

1094
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:25,880
how do you continue to train
Jujitsu when hurt or injured being?

1095
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:29,150
Same thing with whatever kind of interact.
Got In whatever I'm going to do,

1096
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:33,560
I'm going to do what I can. You know?
Now one thing you do have to do what?

1097
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:36,830
You have to let yourself rest enough
that you can heal because sometimes they

1098
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:41,390
get the sprained ankle and instead of
lasting one month, it lasts 18 months.

1099
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:45,080
No kidding. If you push, if
you just won't let it heal,

1100
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,820
that thing is not going to heal.

1101
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,390
So you have to let things heels now,

1102
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:54,920
but you can go through
all kinds of positions.

1103
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:57,080
You can work different transitions,

1104
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,720
but sometimes you get an injury
and if you're a Jujitsu person,

1105
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:00,740
you know what I'm talking about?

1106
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:05,420
Like you get a weird injury that you can't
do certain movements. Yeah, like guy,

1107
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:08,360
I'll have a hurt back, can't get
on top. I can't be on top, I can't.

1108
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:13,700
So you just practice your guard or
you have a hurt, you know, groin,

1109
01:18:13,701 --> 01:18:18,680
muscle. So you can't hold any guard.
You have to work like side control only.

1110
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:21,470
Okay, cool. Let's keep side
control or be inside control.

1111
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,170
So you can definitely do those things.

1112
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:25,790
You just figure out what
movements you can do.

1113
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:30,500
You figure out what training partners
aren't going to go psychopathic on you and

1114
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:35,360
dis hurt you even worse. So
that's important. You know,

1115
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:38,500
just being in class and you're learning
some new technique. You know, I find if,

1116
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:41,450
if I cannot roll when I'm in class,

1117
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:45,650
I'll like pay a little bit more attention
to what the instruction is being given

1118
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:46,730
because I know I can't roll.

1119
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:49,190
So I know all I'm going to get out of
this is what I'm going to learn right here

1120
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,350
from Jeff,
he Glover or dean list.

1121
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:56,620
And so I will be like paying extra special
attention. Yeah, yeah. That's good.

1122
01:18:56,870 --> 01:19:00,480
And uh, then I'll tell you,
this is something like,

1123
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:05,060
I wear knee pads when our role and I
think that they prevent some injuries from

1124
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:05,421
happening.

1125
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:10,421
And I just made a transition in my life
where I used to wear extra large pads,

1126
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:14,880
knee pads, the neoprene,
neoprene, kneepads like neoprene.

1127
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:18,680
There was raised braces though.
Nothing bracing in there,

1128
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:23,580
just like a piece of neoprene.
Yeah. But I recently like uh,

1129
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:26,600
two weeks ago I went,
I used to wear extra large,

1130
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:30,140
then I went to large cause they felt a
little bit snugger and I just got medium

1131
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:33,050
and I got some pretty big legs.
And then I got medium in there,

1132
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:36,530
like really compressing my knees and
keeping it all together and they feel

1133
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,460
really good.

1134
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:42,890
So maybe just order that exercise down to
little compression. And the same thing,

1135
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:45,880
like when I've heard elbow,
I'll put an elbow pad on. Uh,

1136
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:50,840
so wrap up whatever you can
and just keep training and

1137
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:56,420
warm up a little bit. Yeah.
You know, I didn't use to,

1138
01:19:56,450 --> 01:20:01,100
I do now I'll do a like a five minute
round where I'm not trying to kill the

1139
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:04,070
person. I'm hoping that the person's
not going to try and kill me.

1140
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,290
Although you and I had a
little incident the other day,

1141
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:08,250
we get a little excited
in that first round.

1142
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:14,150
Yes. Just to clarify, when you say
knee pads, elbow pads, they're not,

1143
01:20:14,151 --> 01:20:15,830
not like the kind soccer,
you know,

1144
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,480
they're neoprene through [inaudible]
got wet suit, like a neoprene seat.

1145
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:24,540
Aesics yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. Clif Keane
wrestling kneepads that's what they are.

1146
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:29,170
That's what they're calling. And they're
generally made a neoprene. Gotcha. Yeah.

1147
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:31,740
So a lot of this,
the trading partner thing,

1148
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:35,370
that's a big deal if you choose to
train when you're injured. Because man,

1149
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:39,270
I can't sit here and say train when
you're injured. And I might even say,

1150
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,190
don't train, just learn. Like,

1151
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:44,900
how are you saying if you want to show
up because you actually got placed it,

1152
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:48,660
man. Yeah. You know, you
can't just not show up on the
mats and you know the maths,

1153
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:51,690
even if you're not rolling, it's
like it's, that's a good place to be.

1154
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,670
Let's face it for most of us.
Um,

1155
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:57,390
and you sit in on a class or,

1156
01:20:57,391 --> 01:20:59,670
or just do the instruction
part of it and you know,

1157
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:02,370
and do the movements cause you're not
going full speed, you're not rolling.

1158
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,970
Do the movements that you can and
you can pick up a lot man. In fact,

1159
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:10,020
when you especially know how you say you
were learning from Dean Jeff and most

1160
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:11,670
of the instructors here,
they're really good.

1161
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:15,660
Even if you learn one little detail and
even if you know, I know this guard pass,

1162
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,050
you know,
he edited that one little detailed Dang,

1163
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,570
I've been training for all these years
and I just learned that one dude,

1164
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:24,790
you can always add something. Um, the
aim, I think that that's, that's a,

1165
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:28,140
that's a big deal.
Show up and be there and you will learn.

1166
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,740
It's like I was talking to Greg one
time, long time ago, he, he was like,

1167
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,370
we were talking about Hazel. If someone
asks you, how long have you been training?

1168
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:37,740
But let's say you treat,
you started training 10 years ago,

1169
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:41,130
but then you train for a year. You
took off a year and then you went back.

1170
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:42,510
But you were only training a little bit,
you know,

1171
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:45,180
so how long have you been training?
Really? How do you count it and all that.

1172
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:49,020
Anyway, so he was like, he did, we didn't
go too deep into it, but he was like,

1173
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:50,790
not man,
if you started 10 years ago,

1174
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,600
you've been training for 10 years
because if you start training for a year,

1175
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:58,260
even if you take a year off, when you
see something, you hear something, you,

1176
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:00,610
someone's talking about something,
you're picking all that up because it's,

1177
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:03,360
you have the context, you
know, you know, so your, your,

1178
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:06,300
your brain is already assimilated
into your system in your mind,

1179
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:09,060
even if you're not training. Yep,
exactly. Right. So if you're injured,

1180
01:22:09,061 --> 01:22:11,790
just keep that going.
That's a weird thing to do though.

1181
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:15,360
There's a little ego situation
if you're like, well,

1182
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:19,920
I've been trading for 13 years,
meaning I started 13 years ago,

1183
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:24,870
but I took a lot of time off.
Right. So you might catch me, right?

1184
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,170
Yes. Browse basically what they're
saying. So just tell people like,

1185
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,190
I've been training for 13 years. Yeah.
You cut that kind of got a whore.

1186
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:36,710
You know what? Let's see how good I
am. Yeah. You know, if in fact you,

1187
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:42,150
yeah, cause I think it's calming.
Get it so automatic for the person.

1188
01:22:42,151 --> 01:22:45,510
Like, like if you're at, if you ask
me how long have you been training,

1189
01:22:45,511 --> 01:22:49,470
it's so automatic for me to try to
justify my skill with my number. Oh,

1190
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,460
of how long,
you know,

1191
01:22:50,461 --> 01:22:53,820
even though the guy asking typically
is just asking for conversation.

1192
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:57,240
He's not trying to evaluate how good you
are to ask you while I'm size and their

1193
01:22:57,241 --> 01:22:59,670
shit.
But you're different.

1194
01:22:59,671 --> 01:23:04,050
How long you've been training
for what school. Right.
Everybody, you're different.

1195
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:08,170
You compete.
Well I was talking to Keenan about that.

1196
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:11,290
Like how do you do it? And they're
kind of psycho though. They'll be like,

1197
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:16,120
it's man hours. That's how you say it.
You train for 10,000 hours. You do.

1198
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,700
That's how long you've been training.
I don't know if he was serious or not,

1199
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:23,500
but that's the one we're looking at
it. But yeah, moral injury thing. Man,

1200
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:25,120
I don't feel the same way as you though.

1201
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:29,140
I think I definitely training
and I'll tell you what,

1202
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:31,960
like if I've said this before,
if my back is tight. Yeah.

1203
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:36,460
Nothing better for your back. That
Jujitsu. Yeah. Your next little sore.

1204
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:40,360
Jujitsu. Yeah. Shoulders in
that little stretch or it,

1205
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,540
no, I'm not saying go out there
and you'd be able to kill it.

1206
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:46,390
You're gonna be able to go like the
superhard crazy rounds. Not going to work.

1207
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:51,270
Yeah. Yeah. Just be careful. I
would say be careful. Yeah. Yeah.

1208
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:52,930
I am not a doctor

1209
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:59,200
in probably if people listened
to me as if I was a doctor,

1210
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:02,950
their health would be deteriorated
quickly. It'd being questioned for sure.

1211
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:07,210
From time to time. Don't sleep,
eat meat, train, injured, go.

1212
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:13,660
That's my attitude. All
right. Next question.

1213
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:17,590
How crucial is knowing
the personality type,

1214
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:23,340
introvert extrovert of your colleagues
in combat business or choosing an mos,

1215
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:26,800
which is occupation. Yeah. Um,

1216
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:28,723
okay.

1217
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:32,580
How crucial is it to know
the personalities of people?

1218
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,220
It's really crucial.

1219
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:40,950
Knowing in understanding people is
critical in every aspect of life.

1220
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,373
And

1221
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:47,440
that being said,

1222
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,990
the most important part of knowing people
is knowing that you really can't know

1223
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:53,650
people,

1224
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:58,650
not 100% and I hear people talk about
like personality types and there's these

1225
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:01,840
tests and these, these categories
and stuff like that. And honestly,

1226
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:05,650
I've never been familiar with that.
Um,

1227
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,660
but you know, you can put
people in different categories,

1228
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,010
but for me,

1229
01:25:12,011 --> 01:25:16,420
when you put person in a
category by themselves, right?

1230
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,600
That's only 50% of the situation.

1231
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,020
The other 50% is the other people
that they're working with [inaudible].

1232
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:28,620
So I want to know not just what
type of personality they have,

1233
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:34,300
because that's a, that's a, like I
said, that's half of the equation.

1234
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:39,250
The other half is how do they interact
with other people and other people's

1235
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:43,870
personalities?
How do they handle slackers?

1236
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,810
How do they handle over achievers?
How do they handle loud mouse?

1237
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:49,810
How do they handle submissive people?
How do they handle aggressive people?

1238
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:51,910
Those are all different
personality traits. I want to know.

1239
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:55,480
I want to see how people are going
to handle other personalities.

1240
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:59,050
And then I want to also know how they're
going to handle certain situations.

1241
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,990
Pressure,
conflict,

1242
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,820
a responsibility.
I mean,

1243
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:08,060
I want to know not just
what their personalities,

1244
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:12,830
but how they're gonna react because you
can get people that are a really easy

1245
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:16,940
example is people that are
super aggressive but they
fold under pressure and you

1246
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:20,990
can get people that are super passive,
that fold under pressure and vice versa.

1247
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,890
You can get someone that's super
quiet and humble and under pressure.

1248
01:26:24,891 --> 01:26:29,630
They're just strong.
So that's what I want to know.

1249
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,620
I don't care what kind of personality
you have. I mean, I do to an extent,

1250
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:38,450
but I want to know how it
interoperates with the, with the world,

1251
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,630
with the people and with the situations
that you're going to face and how do you

1252
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:42,140
do that?

1253
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,140
You do that by observing
them while they're dealing
with other people and while

1254
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:49,670
they're dealing with pressure situations
and that's just a reality. Yeah.

1255
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:54,720
And you can't, you can
have an idea, you know?

1256
01:26:54,721 --> 01:26:58,680
I won't say that. You won't be able
to predict it, but you get surprised.

1257
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:02,280
Sometimes you get surprised about a person
that you think is all tough and they

1258
01:27:02,281 --> 01:27:06,330
fold or PR person that you think
is weak and they're strong.

1259
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:09,090
So you will get fooled sometimes.
A lot of times you're, you know,

1260
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:13,380
you're probably right 60% of the
time, 70% of the time. Yeah. Yeah.

1261
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:17,610
Big One is also how,
how they react when stuff goes bad.

1262
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:21,610
Like when stuff doesn't go their way,
you know, and that's a spectrum too, but,

1263
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:25,500
and some you can meet someone
and or things are going good,

1264
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:28,620
you're hiring new people with growth
or whatever, whatever your situation.

1265
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,320
And it's like, Dang this guys,
I'm so glad I hired this guy,

1266
01:27:31,321 --> 01:27:34,050
but when something goes wrong they
self destruct or something like that,

1267
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:39,660
then yeah. That's I think a critical
component. And so I get the, you know,

1268
01:27:39,661 --> 01:27:44,010
the simple answers that there's,
there's so many different variables,

1269
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:48,900
so many different nuances that what
you want to do is you want to know your

1270
01:27:48,901 --> 01:27:50,130
people.
Yeah.

1271
01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:53,160
You want to build relationships with
your people so you know them so you

1272
01:27:53,161 --> 01:27:55,780
understand them. That's
what you want to do. Yup.

1273
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,930
The r word relationships.
Yeah.

1274
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:02,250
That's what you need.

1275
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:07,410
That's how you get to know your people
and that's how you lead them correctly.

1276
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:14,470
Next question.
In regards to subordinate leadership,

1277
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:19,540
how do you begin to change the culture
slash school of thought of an industry or

1278
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:20,374
a company?

1279
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,230
You know,

1280
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:28,710
I'm not sure if they mean in regards
to how do you change your subordinate

1281
01:28:28,711 --> 01:28:32,100
leaderships or if you are subordinate.
I'm not sure what,

1282
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:34,030
which one of those it is,
but regardless,

1283
01:28:34,031 --> 01:28:38,020
it doesn't matter because guess what I'm
going to do? I'm going to lead. You do.

1284
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:40,800
Yeah. That's what I'm going
to do. Whether I'm on,

1285
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:44,670
whether I'm the subordinate guy or the
Superior Guy [inaudible] I'm going to

1286
01:28:44,671 --> 01:28:46,530
lead [inaudible]. Oh, we're going to,

1287
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,330
I want to change things and
make them a certain way. Cool.

1288
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,940
I'm going to do those things.
I'm going to make those things happen.

1289
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:56,790
That's how you do it and if you're doing
the right things for the right reasons,

1290
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:59,970
your message is going to spread.
Yeah.

1291
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:05,190
You know how many bad seal
platoons I was in? How many? Zero.

1292
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:10,260
You know why? Because me and my
buddies, we always had a good attitude.

1293
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:13,770
We always had the right attitude and
that spread to the other people that were

1294
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:14,580
with us.

1295
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,413
Hmm.

1296
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:22,160
Now there is a red flag that
you can get for yourself.

1297
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:24,700
Yeah.

1298
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,540
And this is frustration when
you start seeing yourself,

1299
01:29:28,541 --> 01:29:31,420
which I'm not saying this necessarily,

1300
01:29:31,421 --> 01:29:35,560
but this kind of question is coming from
somebody that wants change to happen,

1301
01:29:35,561 --> 01:29:36,460
but it's not happening.

1302
01:29:36,461 --> 01:29:39,340
So they're getting frustrated and
they're thinking they are not on board.

1303
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:42,250
They don't care if they
aren't professional.

1304
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:44,740
They're not motivated like me.

1305
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:50,590
They don't have a good
attitude too. There's a lot of
blame going on right there.

1306
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:54,790
Yeah.
So this isn't about them though.

1307
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,013
It's about you.

1308
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:02,990
And it's about leading from any
level in the chain of command.

1309
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:04,530
If you're leading,

1310
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,730
if you're doing the right
things for the right reasons,

1311
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,580
that's going to spread.
So when I,

1312
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:15,840
the classic example I talk about at all
time is if you're exercising extreme

1313
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:19,110
ownership, if you're saying, you know
what, I got this, it was a mistake made,

1314
01:30:19,111 --> 01:30:22,950
it was my fault. That spreads. Yeah.

1315
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:27,510
If you're humble,
that spreads.

1316
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,630
If you have an open mind that spreads,

1317
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,530
if you're being aggressive, not, again,
not aggressive towards other people,

1318
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:39,440
but if you're being aggressive in
pursuit of your goal, that spreads,

1319
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:46,650
you know what doesn't spread
is when you're aggressive
at people [inaudible] Oh,

1320
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:49,720
I'll actually, it does spread, but it's
negative. Yeah. You don't want that.

1321
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,770
You know,
it doesn't spread.

1322
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,470
It doesn't spread when you're trying
to get people to do things because it's

1323
01:30:53,471 --> 01:30:56,310
gonna make you look good.
Yeah. That doesn't spread.

1324
01:30:57,130 --> 01:31:00,820
You can't get people to behave
better because you want to look good.

1325
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:05,230
It doesn't work. Yeah. People
see right through that, oh,

1326
01:31:05,231 --> 01:31:07,840
he wants to look good. You know
what? I'm gonna do sabotage.

1327
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:13,870
Now the other thing
I've been saying lately,

1328
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:19,150
because people are surprised or whatever,

1329
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:22,180
or not surprised,
but they're concerned,

1330
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,020
they don't see how it's gonna work
so fast. And I say, you know what?

1331
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:30,040
It's not gonna work fast. It's
gotta be, and here's the word,

1332
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:33,490
it's got to be a cam pain.
It's gotta be a campaign.

1333
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:37,190
It's not like World War II
was not one battle, right.

1334
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:41,260
World War One was not one battle.
It's a campaign to win in Europe.

1335
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:44,170
It's a campaign to win in the Pacific.

1336
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:48,220
He takes battle after battle after battle.
And guess what? You don't win them all.

1337
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:53,110
Yeah. You lose some of them. And so
you're going to, on this campaign,

1338
01:31:53,111 --> 01:31:54,640
you're going to win and
you're going to lose.

1339
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:59,910
But you got to have the persistence
and the patience and the to continue

1340
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,073
[inaudible]

1341
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:09,200
in another piece of this is
cute.

1342
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:14,320
You are best off if you go
indirect and not be like,

1343
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:19,070
Hey, you need to act like me. No,

1344
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,220
people don't like that.

1345
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,413
Hmm.

1346
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:27,210
You need to just act how you're acting.
And if you're doing it though,

1347
01:32:27,211 --> 01:32:29,340
like I said,
the right things for the right reasons,

1348
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:32,550
people are going to see you
and they're going to follow.

1349
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:33,543
Mm.

1350
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:40,630
So that's how you begin to
change the school of thought.

1351
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:42,041
Yeah.

1352
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:46,490
That genuineness like tends to show
itself or that like if you're not genuine,

1353
01:32:46,491 --> 01:32:49,270
it tends to show itself, you know,
just because of the dynamics of Vinny,

1354
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:52,660
nevermind tends to it just
straight shows itself.

1355
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,340
So when you're doing it
for the right reasons,

1356
01:32:54,341 --> 01:32:58,420
like you can't help but expose that,
you know, that will be exposed. So yeah,

1357
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:02,230
people will sign up the sign right on
and then you end up gaining like how you

1358
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:04,900
say it's a campaign. It's like
you'll gain a little bit of ground.

1359
01:33:04,901 --> 01:33:07,500
You might win this guy over
like hey wait, that's, you know,

1360
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:09,150
that's a cool way of doing it.
Or you know,

1361
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:14,080
whatever the group is and you make these
small little steps and you kind of hold

1362
01:33:14,081 --> 01:33:16,210
that ground and yet before you know it,
it's kind of like Dang,

1363
01:33:16,211 --> 01:33:20,680
the whole culture of this, I don't know,
office or whatever. It's kinda changing.

1364
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:24,880
You know? It just happens.
It's true. I've seen it happen.

1365
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:27,543
Next question.

1366
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:29,703
Yeah.

1367
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:30,683
Jocko Echo.

1368
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:35,700
How do you work with people
who overthink things?

1369
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:41,760
The classic overthinker, what does
that mean? The over the means.

1370
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:46,590
They won't pick up this pen right here
because they look in and say, hmm,

1371
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:51,360
I wonder what the weight of that pen is
and if I should pick it up right now.

1372
01:33:51,361 --> 01:33:54,510
Because I'm also thinking about saying
something and what if I dropped the pen

1373
01:33:54,511 --> 01:33:57,550
while I'm trying to say something that
makes a noise on the desk that disrupts

1374
01:33:57,551 --> 01:34:01,590
from the flow of my sentence. And then
the whole flow of my sentences disrupted,

1375
01:34:01,591 --> 01:34:03,990
which means my train of
thought will be disrupted.

1376
01:34:03,991 --> 01:34:06,840
Now I can't refinish when I was
going to say that's an overthinker.

1377
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:09,660
So that's personal training.

1378
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,560
Now you can just imagine applying that
fought pattern to an actual project that

1379
01:34:13,561 --> 01:34:16,140
you're working on, right?
Right. Not a good scenario.

1380
01:34:16,141 --> 01:34:19,410
Or you're trying to apply it to a combat
situation that you're in or you're

1381
01:34:19,411 --> 01:34:23,250
trying to apply it to a relationship that
you're in. You start overthinking, well,

1382
01:34:23,251 --> 01:34:26,370
if I see this, then she might
think bad, right? What they
mean by that, right there,

1383
01:34:26,371 --> 01:34:30,960
that little by that. Yes. Yes. Dang. Yeah,
that's true. Okay. That's an overthinker.

1384
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:34,340
So quit thinking so much.
You're overthinking it.

1385
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,540
So here's what I do. When someone's
overthinking, I got someone that's like a,

1386
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:44,150
like a chronic overthinker,
I'm going to,

1387
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:49,550
I'm going to funnel them into the right
mindset with questions and I'll give you

1388
01:34:50,131 --> 01:34:54,570
some real easy questions to ask that'll
make this happen. Things like, Hey,

1389
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:58,790
what do we mean by that? Or
like, can you explain that again?

1390
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:04,430
And you're getting them to explain it in
a simpler way. Mm. Or you say, you know,

1391
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:08,000
hey, so hold on. So what's the actual
goal? What are we trying to get done here?

1392
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,081
Because again,

1393
01:35:09,081 --> 01:35:13,460
they're putting layers upon layers of
complexity on top of things that don't

1394
01:35:13,461 --> 01:35:17,840
deserve it. So what exactly
are we trying to do? And again,

1395
01:35:17,841 --> 01:35:22,790
you're just kind of playing dumb
a little bit and asking questions.

1396
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:27,470
And then if you can't get to them, if
you can't quite get them to simplify it,

1397
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,270
then you say, oh, okay.

1398
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:34,010
So we're trying to do this
very simple statement. So,

1399
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:39,030
so that way they start subconsciously
being coached and being taught to simplify

1400
01:35:40,911 --> 01:35:45,110
things as much as they can in their head.
And you know,

1401
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:50,170
another thing I've been saying lately
when I'm out working with people is I used

1402
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:55,811
to not really understand why people
are drawn to this complexity,

1403
01:35:57,530 --> 01:36:01,730
but I actually think I understand now
and I think it has something to do with

1404
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:07,660
the fact that if I come up with a plan
and it's super complex and super crazy

1405
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:12,410
and you don't understand it, then I must
be smarter than you. Right? Yeah. Right.

1406
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:17,710
I came up with something that's so genius
and so complicated that you don't even

1407
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:22,660
understand it. I understand
it. I understand that. Yeah,
they get you don't get it.

1408
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:25,040
Right. And by the way, you know,

1409
01:36:25,041 --> 01:36:28,520
the only way you're going to understand
it if I have is if I break it down for

1410
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:30,610
you because you don't get it.
You know?

1411
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:35,420
So it's an ego trip and it's completely
wrong. Because the fact of the matter is,

1412
01:36:35,421 --> 01:36:38,360
if I'm trying to get you to do
something and you don't understand it,

1413
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:42,290
I'm a loser. I'm failing as a leader. So

1414
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:44,843
you,
you,

1415
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:50,470
you got to try and get
people to understand that
simplicity beats complexity

1416
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:55,810
every single time and overthinking things
is a failure in ability to simplify.

1417
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:00,860
So
another thing,

1418
01:37:00,861 --> 01:37:03,080
and this is more kind of about planning,

1419
01:37:03,081 --> 01:37:06,770
and this is something I used to talk
about in the seal teams and I called it 6%

1420
01:37:06,771 --> 01:37:08,360
advantage over the enemy.

1421
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,910
And what this was was let's say you have
a target building that you're going off

1422
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,050
of or going after.

1423
01:37:15,051 --> 01:37:17,810
You're going to go take down a target
building in the middle of wherever,

1424
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:18,920
the middle of the desert,

1425
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:21,860
and you basically come up with
a plan that you're going to use,

1426
01:37:21,861 --> 01:37:24,200
your standard operating procedures,
you're all going to get online,

1427
01:37:24,201 --> 01:37:28,130
or you're going to at least set up a
base in a maneuver elements. Very simple.

1428
01:37:28,131 --> 01:37:29,150
Two elements.

1429
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:32,120
One element is going to hold cover and
the other one's going to move through the

1430
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:35,480
target cover move. It's, I mean it's
as simple as it gets. That's great.

1431
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,760
So you come up with a plan,
that's your plan.

1432
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:41,300
And then as you're looking at the
imagery or you're looking at the map,

1433
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:46,301
you notice that there is
an outhouse [inaudible] 150
meters away from the house.

1434
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:51,140
So now what you do is you go,
you know what?

1435
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,530
Because there's that outhouse there you
don't want to do is I'm going to take us

1436
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,890
another team of our guys.

1437
01:37:55,891 --> 01:37:57,750
We're going to break them off
from the main assault force,

1438
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:58,800
going to put them over there,

1439
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:03,210
and that's what they're going to be in
case the guys in the outhouse, blah, blah,

1440
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:07,530
blah. So what you've done is
you've separated your units,

1441
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:09,900
you've increased your
communication problems,

1442
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:13,740
you've sacrificed your fields of fire,
you dis-aggregated your fire power,

1443
01:38:13,741 --> 01:38:16,020
you've diminished your unity of command.

1444
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,750
You've broke from your
standard operating procedures.

1445
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:23,610
You've given up your real tactical
advantage that you have for the chance.

1446
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:29,510
The chance that this guy at two o'clock
in the morning when you hit the target

1447
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:34,260
is in the outhouse and not in his home.
Is it worth that?

1448
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,490
No. So don't overthink it.
We're hitting this target.

1449
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:42,810
You know what? Cool. We'll keep
eyes on that thing. No big deal.

1450
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:47,220
But don't give up your tactical advantage
because you overthought the situation.

1451
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,770
Hmm.
Go with what you know.

1452
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,633
And

1453
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:59,040
another piece of that is a lot of times
when people get super detailed like that

1454
01:38:59,331 --> 01:39:02,120
and planning,
they're actually planning things,

1455
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:05,040
planning on things that
that can't be known.

1456
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:10,520
So why would we make a plan for
something that can't be known?

1457
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:15,380
I got a better idea. Instead of making a
plan for something that can't be known,

1458
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:17,710
make a plan that's adaptable.
[inaudible]

1459
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:22,700
you want your plan to be adaptable
and you know how you have the best

1460
01:39:22,701 --> 01:39:23,870
adaptability,
for instance,

1461
01:39:23,871 --> 01:39:26,780
on the battlefield that you have the most
control over your guys so that you can

1462
01:39:26,781 --> 01:39:29,540
move them, maneuver them
quickly. And how do you do that?

1463
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:31,640
By having good unity of command.
And how do you do that?

1464
01:39:31,641 --> 01:39:33,590
By keeping your guys for
the most part together,

1465
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:38,810
the minute you start spreading them out
all over the place and something changes,

1466
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:42,290
something unknown,
that unexpected happens.

1467
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:47,590
Now you've got a real everyone back
in and try and get them to change the

1468
01:39:47,841 --> 01:39:52,610
formation of their assault.
It becomes very, very complex.

1469
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:58,600
So if you set up your plan so that
it's adaptable to changing situations,

1470
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,240
then you're going to be good to go.

1471
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,230
Same thing in business. Do you know
what the market's going to do? No.

1472
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:13,490
We have predictors. Yes.
Do. Do we know them? No.

1473
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:17,090
Do you know what your
competitor is going to do? No.

1474
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:22,970
Do you know what your consumers are
going to do? No. Do we have intelligence?

1475
01:40:22,971 --> 01:40:26,660
Of course we do. Do we have metrics? Of
course we do, but we don't know things.

1476
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:32,230
So keep your plans adaptable so you
can make adjustments when you need to

1477
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:41,130
as opposed to overthinking things and
creating specific branch plans for a

1478
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,940
possibility of something that might
occur in the future or might not.

1479
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:51,370
Don't overthink it. People, you know,

1480
01:40:51,371 --> 01:40:56,060
sometimes people who under
think things [inaudible].

1481
01:40:57,610 --> 01:41:02,170
Sometimes they tend to say, hey, why
you overthink things when you're,

1482
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:06,350
when you're just normally thinking about
something like you're thinking about

1483
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:11,110
the whole stem. Yeah. So there's obviously
you have to think about things, right?

1484
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:13,360
Yeah. And yes, you should
be cautioned of someone,

1485
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:17,470
cautious of someone that's
just constantly saying, Mary,

1486
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:20,620
you're overthinking this.
Three minutes planning.

1487
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:26,070
Yeah. Yeah. Watch out for that guy. Yeah.

1488
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,920
That's why. Yeah. One, the word
open, one overthinking comes up.

1489
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:36,510
Kinda understand what that means.
But I feel like your example is sound

1490
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:42,870
juggle.

1491
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:47,490
What do you think of Greg Jackson that
[inaudible] famous MMA coach criticizing

1492
01:41:47,491 --> 01:41:51,570
Jon Jones on his recent power
lifting and muscle gain?

1493
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:55,350
Yeah, so if you didn't see
this, if you're into MMA at all,

1494
01:41:55,650 --> 01:42:00,650
they caught Greg Jackson on the
mic after John Jones recent fight,

1495
01:42:02,570 --> 01:42:06,390
say, and you know, basically,
hey, I told you so. He's too big.

1496
01:42:06,391 --> 01:42:08,200
He's all that power lifting.

1497
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:14,210
And I've talked about Greg Jackson
before and nothing but respect for Greg

1498
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:19,500
Jackson. Uh, not only is he an
outstanding coach and a great tactician,

1499
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:25,070
he's also just super humble guy who has
built a really cool gym and built a lot

1500
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:31,050
of champions.
So his record speaks for itself.

1501
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:34,410
So I'm not going to second guess.

1502
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:38,700
You know what he's saying about a fighter
that he's worked with since day one.

1503
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:43,850
And I think really it boils down to
this sort of definition of perfection.

1504
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:47,490
If you've ever heard this definition of
the definition of perfection is when you

1505
01:42:47,491 --> 01:42:51,810
have nothing more to add and
nothing more to take away.

1506
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:54,660
You've got it where it needs to be.

1507
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:58,020
And they use this with design,
you know,

1508
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:02,940
design of whatever,
furniture of iPhones have anything,

1509
01:43:02,941 --> 01:43:04,530
buildings.
When you've,

1510
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:08,250
when you've got everything that needs
to be there and you can't take anything

1511
01:43:08,251 --> 01:43:11,630
away, that's the, that's perfection.
They say this about writing too,

1512
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:14,460
and you look at someone
that writes really well,

1513
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,890
every sentence you look at that sentence,

1514
01:43:16,891 --> 01:43:20,790
you can't take away a word
and you can't add a word.

1515
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:22,530
And that's perfection.

1516
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:27,750
And I think that is what Greg Jackson
is trying to do with Jonny bones.

1517
01:43:27,751 --> 01:43:28,380
Jones,

1518
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:33,380
get him in that physical status where
you don't want to add anything and you

1519
01:43:35,251 --> 01:43:38,040
don't want to take anything away.
So what they may have done,

1520
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:40,890
according to Greg Jackson,

1521
01:43:40,891 --> 01:43:45,891
is they may have added a little too
much muscle because of course you got to

1522
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:50,780
have some muscle because it gives
you strength and explosiveness.

1523
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:56,360
But at the same time,
muscle requires oxygen.

1524
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:01,700
And so you can actually get too big
to where it's affecting your cardio.

1525
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:05,840
So I think that's all Greg
Jackson was talking about.

1526
01:44:05,841 --> 01:44:09,650
And I think that's the balance that I,
that's the balance I'm always looking for.

1527
01:44:09,651 --> 01:44:12,380
You know, I want to be big and strong
enough, but I want to have endurance.

1528
01:44:12,381 --> 01:44:14,780
That's what I'm trying
to do. Yeah. You know,

1529
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:19,760
and I try and find that balance by doing
bolts, strength work and endurance work.

1530
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:22,190
That's, and when I say endurance,
I mean muscular endurance.

1531
01:44:22,191 --> 01:44:25,010
I don't mean marathon running
cause I don't run marathons.

1532
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:29,810
METCON metcons baby.
So that's what I think he's talking about.

1533
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,910
And you know,
like I said,

1534
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:36,320
respect for Greg Jackson
and I'm sure that he had a,

1535
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,520
he's got a good handle
on why he's saying that.

1536
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:41,310
Yeah. Fully. And when you,

1537
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:45,560
I do know a little bit of a
little bit about this where, um,

1538
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:50,550
so if you gain some,
a bunch of muscle fast,

1539
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,230
like over short period,
period of time,

1540
01:44:52,231 --> 01:44:54,810
you can have a way harder
time dealing with, you know,

1541
01:44:54,811 --> 01:44:59,460
the drawbacks of that muscle. And that
is endurance. That's the main thing. Um,

1542
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:01,080
and at the same time,

1543
01:45:01,081 --> 01:45:03,360
this doesn't have much to do
with this particular situation,

1544
01:45:03,361 --> 01:45:06,390
but if you gain muscle real fast,
you can lose it.

1545
01:45:06,391 --> 01:45:11,010
You have the potential to
lose it real fast. But at the
same time, you vice versa,

1546
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:15,690
if you cultivate this, you know,
muscular body build, whatever,

1547
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:19,840
um, over time, like let's say you started
lifting at 15 years old and you're,

1548
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:24,030
you know, 35 years old now and
you've always been muscular,

1549
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:29,660
your body will have an easier time holding
onto that must for if you stop like

1550
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:33,570
lifting for even a year or if you stop
leaking for a long time and then you get

1551
01:45:33,571 --> 01:45:34,770
back to lifting, it'll, it'll,

1552
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:38,880
it'll jump right back up as far as
your muscle muscular muscularity.

1553
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:44,430
So in regards to endurance,
no matter what,

1554
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:49,950
bigger muscles require more oxygen, more,
more fuel. So it's harder to get that PR,

1555
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:53,160
um, endurance up when you have
big muscles just in general,

1556
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:57,300
but you're going to have the potential
to gain that endurance way more if you've

1557
01:45:57,301 --> 01:46:00,870
had muscle for a long time.
So you do these big jumps in muscle gain.

1558
01:46:01,410 --> 01:46:03,090
Man that endurance is going to suffer.

1559
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,790
It's going to be really hard to
build up that endurance really hard.

1560
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:09,150
I'm not saying impossible, but it's just
really, we're going to take time. Yeah.

1561
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:13,120
So yeah, that is a dangerous
thing. Not Dangerous, but it's,

1562
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:15,780
it's a risky thing to do when,
you know,

1563
01:46:15,781 --> 01:46:20,580
I'm going to jump back into the fighting
situation and I'm huge now. You know,

1564
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:24,930
it's like God, that insurance might stuff
around that one, you know, obviously,

1565
01:46:24,931 --> 01:46:29,820
or apparently it, uh, it
did there. I think we, uh,

1566
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:34,050
maybe do one more here. Okay. Jocko,

1567
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:39,230
do you ever feel like Sisyphus pushing
a rock up a hill only to watch it roll

1568
01:46:40,201 --> 01:46:44,010
back down again and have to do it again?

1569
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:50,460
How do you overcome that?
Do ever feel

1570
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:51,900
like Sisyphus?

1571
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,513
Yeah,

1572
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,960
of course I have. Yeah. I mean,

1573
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:05,280
I do and I'll tell you,
I've,

1574
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:10,370
I've thought about this and I've been
waiting for people to start saying like,

1575
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:15,480
oh, you put another picture of the
sweat and have a squat rack. Really?

1576
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:18,503
But

1577
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:20,890
I don't know if they understand.

1578
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:26,380
I've been getting on that squat racking,

1579
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:29,230
grinding it out for 25 years

1580
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:33,390
and I'm not bored with it yet.

1581
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:38,400
Hey,
it might seem

1582
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:42,180
like that's an unwinnable battle,

1583
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:46,300
but really to me

1584
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:50,560
it's not about winning.

1585
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:56,560
It's the battle itself.
It's the struggle.

1586
01:47:56,590 --> 01:47:59,920
It's the daily test.
That's what life's about.

1587
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:05,180
Not just physically,
but mentally

1588
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,870
getting that rock to
the top of the mountain.

1589
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,090
That's not what my goal is.

1590
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:18,650
My goal actually is pushing the rock

1591
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:23,270
because pushing the rock

1592
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:30,120
that pushes me,
that makes me tougher.

1593
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:34,320
That makes me harder
mentally and physically.

1594
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,550
He,
he,

1595
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:41,790
it gives me much more than I give it.

1596
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:46,740
I want a struggle how wanna
grind in Claude scratching.

1597
01:48:46,741 --> 01:48:51,630
I want to dig in and I want to
push and I don't want it to end.

1598
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:58,770
If I ever got the rock to the top of
the mountain, had it stayed there,

1599
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:03,440
I push it back down myself.

1600
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:11,080
I don't want to rest and I don't want to
coast and I don't want to reach a point

1601
01:49:11,081 --> 01:49:15,550
in my life where I say,
[inaudible], that's it.

1602
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:21,790
I've done enough.
I'm not gonna give any more.

1603
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:24,190
I'm not going to push anymore.

1604
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:28,203
No,

1605
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:31,270
no.

1606
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:38,650
That relentless cycle of
day to day challenges,

1607
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:42,820
they are maddening to me.
They don't frustrate me.

1608
01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:44,770
They inspire me,

1609
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:50,940
inspire me to drive and push
more and to push harder.

1610
01:49:53,610 --> 01:49:55,320
That's what that rock does to me.

1611
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,680
So why is c d g n

1612
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:05,730
and get to push it

1613
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:16,170
can I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1614
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:20,423

Or if you want some shirts,
get some shirts, man represent,
I think they're cool.

1644
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:32,480
I have made an effort to
get like the quality shirts.

1645
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:35,090
Is that why they're sold out so much?
Yeah.

1646
01:52:35,091 --> 01:52:39,110
See in the a big part in that
cleaning about you. Yeah, I know.

1647
01:52:39,111 --> 01:52:40,280
And here's the thing,

1648
01:52:40,281 --> 01:52:43,730
I can't buy 5,000 shirts because where
am I going to put them right now?

1649
01:52:43,731 --> 01:52:48,080
You know, so we uh, it's a
long story, but so yeah, sorry,

1650
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:50,840
I'm getting them. I'm getting them
and I'm going to improve on that too,

1651
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:54,530
by the way. But their quality shirts,
they are there. They're solid.

1652
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:59,360
They're not like the ballpark giveaway.
No, no. Sure. $2 shoes, shirts.

1653
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:02,330
I would wear them if they
didn't have my own head on them

1654
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,930
or if they just did victory
mme and fitness on them,
then you live. That's right.

1655
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:11,810
But anyway, yeah, I had@jockostore.com
or you can get a coffee mug.

1656
01:53:11,811 --> 01:53:14,930
They're kind of cool, I think. I think
they're kind of cool. And if you want,

1657
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,960
if you, if you kind of liked what,
uh, what we're talking about here,

1658
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:20,780
leadership life lessons,

1659
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:25,330
you can check out a little book that
myself and my brother Leif Babin road,

1660

1663
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:40,550

myself and by life as well.

1664
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:44,030
So you can check that out.
And thanks for supporting that.

And finally to everybody
out there in the world,

1666
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:55,860
living in freedom,
take advantage of it.

1667
01:53:55,861 --> 01:54:00,861
Take advantage of your freedom
and your life by driving hard.

1668
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:08,830
And by pushing that rock up that
hill with everything you've got

1669
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:14,040
man. Also. And of course,

1670
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:20,100
drive hard by getting out there

1671
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:23,430
and getting after it.

1672
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:24,373
Yeah.

1673
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:30,500
And so until next time,
this is Jocko and echo

1674
