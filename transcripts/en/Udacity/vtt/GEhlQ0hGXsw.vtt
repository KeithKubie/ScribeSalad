00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.040
Okay, we exit the loop and, well, I'll take into account, I guess,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
if there is a point or if there's not a period at the end we

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.050
might have an exception, we'll take that into account.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.890
Then the, the code brings a new line, and then-

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.410
&gt;&gt; But for, for, for the 31, 31, the commenter,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.546
are we assuming that we were going to search something here with the,

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:24.137
the use of the word assert or is that just, is that a,-

00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:28.409
Well I know it was more like a note for myself that the count is

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.537
a a blanks because that is the conditions that should be verified here,

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:37.400
I mean I might, may make that into an assert later on.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.780
&gt;&gt; Weren't you for my own edification an amazing, these one,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.740
two, three, four, Four print lines in a row,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.100
tell me what you're expecting to see coming out of each of those.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.000
&gt;&gt; I'm just expecting to see well, some white space.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.840
&gt;&gt; That's about it.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.940
So the first one will be a blank plane.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Just, you know, to kind of put some distance between the list of.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.349
&gt;&gt; Okay, then the second one will.

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:02.392
&gt;&gt; Let's just say the number of blank.

00:01:02.392 --> 00:01:03.222
&gt;&gt; Is.

00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:08.839
&gt;&gt; Is, blanks is and then print the number of blanks.

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:09.781
&gt;&gt; Should be printing to a count.

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.747
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, you're right, it should.

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:13.128
As I said, I mean, I was kind of kind of writing this in a hurry, and

00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:14.040
yeah, this should be, this should be count.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.661
&gt;&gt; And, it would be on the next line.

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.079
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; And, it would be on the next-

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.968
&gt;&gt; It won't be width contiguous with the text.

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:21.473
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:21.473 --> 00:01:23.040
&gt;&gt; Well hold up that, that's [CROSSTALK].

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.476
&gt;&gt; No, actually no.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:25.855
[INAUDIBLE] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry, print.

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:27.510
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Couldn't we just combine all these into one.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.605
[CROSSTALK].

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:30.704
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I should probably, yeah.

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:32.113
[CROSSTALK].

00:01:32.113 --> 00:01:33.910
&gt;&gt; Couldn't we just combine all four of these into one?

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.247
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:41.425
&gt;&gt; Sure, we could use, you know, slash n and then, is slash n is &gt;&gt; Slash n.

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:42.085
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:44.460
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, we could use slash n.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.090
Is that allowed in the kind of code standard that we use?

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.390
&gt;&gt; You just told me there weren't any standards and so, yeah.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.898
&gt;&gt; This is just a little amusing.

00:01:51.898 --> 00:01:53.167
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] much of, yeah.

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:53.990
Mm-hm.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.825
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this can be connected, concatenated in one line,

00:01:56.825 --> 00:02:00.051
maybe, I thought that this was going to improve readability, but

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:01.400
that's &gt;&gt; We don't have to use that.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.082
&gt;&gt; Maybe that's not, that's not the case.

00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:03.836
&gt;&gt; The other side of this, this paper.

00:02:03.836 --> 00:02:04.891
&gt;&gt; We have an extra log sheet.

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:05.733
&gt;&gt; You going to run out of room?

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.119
&gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; Okay, because,-

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.193
&gt;&gt; I anticipated ahead that we would have many defects.

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:11.209
&gt;&gt; Well, obviously, that's been the case.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.206
&gt;&gt; Maybe you're being too picky, but fine.

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:17.120
&gt;&gt; It looks like dogs barks, repetition precedes it.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.190
[LAUGH]. &gt;&gt; Well let's continue for now.
