00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.670
So I was trained as an experimental social
psychologist. I do work on human

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.580
judgment decision-making particularly
the errors and biases that people show when

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.790
they make judgments and really what
changed my research was in this hyper

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.020
partisan political environment and just
looking at that and saying well what's

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.689
going on there and what a great example
of how people's emotions are affecting

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.060
their judgment. How is it that our sort
of moral feelings and our moral visions

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.860
change the way that we view the world

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.490
The theory that we work with its called moral
foundation theory. The basic ideas are

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.940
five things that people care about. About
harming other people particularly weak people.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.790
About fairness. About loyalty to
family and things like that.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.600
Authority and tradition the way things
used to have been done and purity, so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.790
this notion that there's certain states
of being that are pure and these five

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.059
concerns across the world you see these
in all sorts of different cultures but

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.750
different groups differ in how much they
weigh each of those different kinds of

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.700
factors. Liberals essentially care about
two things,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.350
harm and fairness.  If it doesn't harm
somebody or if it isn't unfair it is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.500
morally ok but political conservatives
tend to weight all five of these things as

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.259
important so that they care about
harm and fairness but they also care about

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.820
group loyalty, about authority and
tradition and about purity. If you look

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.810
at libertarians they're low on everything.
So their world view isn't a deeply

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.729
moral world view it's more of a
pragmatic utilitarian world view and if you

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.820
apply that to different political topics
you can see where these differences come from.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.540
one of the things that my research group
has been interested in is in the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.870
psychology of libertarianism as that's
kind of grown into prominence. A chief

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.960
concern is government leaves people
alone. It sort of accepts lifes

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.580
winners and losers in an economic game.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.530
We created a website where people could
go and fill out psychological scales but

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.260
we had this huge sample of people who
claim to be libertarians.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.720
Libertarians are psychologically different. So classic
situation is your kid

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.920
goes off to school realizes they didn't bring their homework. The
libertarian version thinks they will

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.240
learn a lesson and never forget their
homework again because

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.680
they'll be very upset and if you
look at their psychology, it kind of fits

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.340
really nicely with that they tend to be
kind of self oriented.  They're lower in

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.670
empathy than both liberals and
conservatives or they just don't feel

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.330
other people's pain in the same way.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.440
You may be better able to accept life's
losers the less you suffer

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.050
vicariously with them and it's easier to
adopt that philosophy and so your moral vision tells

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.570
you what would your ideology should be and 
what the facts are and that's exactly

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.130
what we find across all these differences and
we're able to compare them on twenty or

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.890
thirty different personality types
liberals conservatives and libertarians.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.940
Which morals are most important to you?
do you think they shape how you vote?
