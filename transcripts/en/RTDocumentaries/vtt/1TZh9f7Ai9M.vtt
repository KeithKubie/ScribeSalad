00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.140
They have a saying in China

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.780
to see the country's past go to the Bejing

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.820
for present to visit Shanghai and for the future

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.440
It has to be Shenzhen.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.340
By Chinese standards Shenzhen

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.140
is a very young and futuristic metropolis

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.040
The city is positively bristles with innovation.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.940
Just 50 years ago it was nothing but a tiny fishing village

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.460
but today hundreds

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.240
of sky create dominate the skyline

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
At first site, Shenzhen

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.900
may appear to be just a another densely populated Chinese metropolis

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.720
But for entrepreneurs and programmers it's a technological Mecca

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:33.685
It's hardly surprising that

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:36.695
Shenzhen is considered to be China's Silicon Valley

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.185
The whole country is rapidly growing electronics industry

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:41.765
is centered on city.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.920
Every month, at least one international exhibition or

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.600
trade fair, is held here

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.620
either electronics, IT or automotive.

00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:02.915
New enterprises sprout like mushrooms

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.960
here in the sub-tropical climate of Shenzhen

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.760
The standard of living is among the highest in the country

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.500
meaning that many foreigners and people from other Chinese cities

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.820
aspire to live here

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.880
Li Chao is twenty-eight

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.960
He's lived in Shenzhen for ten years

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.640
But is originally from a northern town called Bauwer-Zee

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.460
It was true love that drew himself

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.440
to China's silicon valley

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.620
He really loves robots

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.840
 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.320
 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.300
 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.275
 

00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:54.975
 

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.875
 

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.295
 

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:02.615
 

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.175
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.840
 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.400
But Li Chao can't even imagine

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.420
life without robots today

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840
 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.240
The company he works for develops and produces androids

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.220
human like robots

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.700
These machines have almost everything a person has

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.060
arms, legs a torso and head

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.140
So far

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.120
The Ubtech company has built three android models  that are selling well,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.220
and not just in China, but worldwide

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.860
Li Chao's degree is in engineering

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.540
but now, his job is to promote the robots on the open market

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.420
 

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:56.885
 

00:03:57.085 --> 00:03:59.595
 

00:03:59.595 --> 00:04:01.755
 

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:05.035
 

00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:06.525
 

00:04:07.275 --> 00:04:10.515
 

00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:11.775
 

00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:15.485
 

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:18.625
 

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:21.565
 

00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:24.145
 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.520
 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.360
Today they have yet another presentation

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.680
featuring the "Alpha One" model

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.260
 

00:04:35.265 --> 00:04:38.135
 

00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:41.175
 

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:44.295
 

00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:46.825
 

00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:49.635
 

00:04:49.635 --> 00:04:52.145
 

00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:55.495
 

00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:58.875
 

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:02.165
 

00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:05.465
 

00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:07.815
 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.680
 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.060
Androids don't just look like people on the outside

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.940
Ubtech has recently released a new enhanced model called "Alpha Two"

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.080
The robot doesn't just move like a person,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.760
it communicates too.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.880
It can study, and even help people with their work.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.900
This is how a typical working day begins for Ubtech CEO, Zhou Jian.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.920
 

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.285
 

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:56.435
 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.180
 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.000
 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.900
 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.680
 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.475
 

00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:11.315
 

00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:14.085
 

00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:16.865
 

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:19.085
 

00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:21.645
 

00:06:21.645 --> 00:06:24.785
 

00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:27.515
 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.080
 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.920
Of course, not even "Alpha Two",

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.460
can fully replace a human employee.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.460
That's not what it's for.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.540
Ubtech android's are mainly used by children

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.640
A robot like this is seen a pretty cool toy,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.660
because it's seems so alive,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.320
but it can also be a great help with homework

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.680
 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.440
 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.460
 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.220
 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.335
 

00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:06.375
 

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:09.325
 

00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:11.805
 

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:14.945
 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.785
 

00:07:17.785 --> 00:07:19.280
 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.260
Many company employees were until,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.560
recently wearing holes in the back's of their trousers

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.420
in universities lecture theaters.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.640
Even then they could barley dream of a visual aid quite like this.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.180
After achieving the opportunity of doing what they loved

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.980
staff members often work long hours.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.040
Li Chao is no exception, but today he must finish early,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.740
because of he is visiting relatives.

00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:50.855
 

00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:54.365
 

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:57.405
 

00:07:57.405 --> 00:08:00.305
 

00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:03.265
 

00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:06.255
 

00:08:06.255 --> 00:08:09.325
 

00:08:09.325 --> 00:08:12.105
 

00:08:12.105 --> 00:08:13.745
 

00:08:14.315 --> 00:08:16.465
 

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:20.775
 

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.680
 

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.020
Robots can be fully fledged family members

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.680
and seem like real friends,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.640
but not just for children, but for adults too.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:35.135
 

00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:38.365
 

00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:41.545
 

00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:44.205
 

00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:46.935
 

00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:49.975
 

00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:53.205
 

00:08:53.585 --> 00:08:54.755
 

00:08:56.095 --> 00:08:57.095
 

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:01.775
 

00:09:02.805 --> 00:09:04.895
 

00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:08.755
 

00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:10.685
 

00:09:11.575 --> 00:09:12.525
 

00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:16.320
To reach his brother's house Li Chao has to cross almost the whole city

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.215
Shenzhen is divided into eight districts.

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:22.835
Ubtech's office and manufacturing facilities

00:09:22.835 --> 00:09:24.755
are in Nanshan district.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:28.505
And Li Chao's relatives live in on the other side of the city

00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:30.915
In the Pingshan residential area.

00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:32.655
 

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.115
 

00:09:35.115 --> 00:09:38.045
 

00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:40.895
 

00:09:40.895 --> 00:09:43.585
 

00:09:43.585 --> 00:09:46.175
 

00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:49.435
 

00:09:49.435 --> 00:09:52.375
 

00:09:52.445 --> 00:09:55.185
 

00:09:55.185 --> 00:09:58.035
 

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.300
The intellectual park is a complex of futuristic skyscrapers

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.480
It could be the set of a science fiction movie.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.100
Shenzhen is a skyward city.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.840
It made the top ten list of mega-cities on the planet for having the most high rise buildings.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.420
In 2011, a 600 meter one hundred floor skyscraper was built here.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.400
But unlike in many other cities,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.560
in Shenzhen, the glass and concrete giants don't create the impression of a concrete jungle

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.900
that crashes passes by

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.860
That's because the city is full of green areas.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.120
There are many well maintained parks.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.840
It's no coincidence that Shenzhen is one of the most environmentally friendly cities in China.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.760
 

00:11:06.765 --> 00:11:08.555
 

00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:11.995
 

00:11:12.295 --> 00:11:15.385
 

00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:18.425
 

00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:19.925
 

00:11:21.785 --> 00:11:23.965
 

00:11:24.405 --> 00:11:25.875
 

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.040
One hallmark of Shenzhen

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.860
apart from the skyscrapers and parks

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.180
is motorcars

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.360
Hybrid cars in particular.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.320
These are vehicles with two engines, petrol and electric.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.080
Li Chao's car was developed and produced in Shenzhen by the BYD company.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.480
And it's not just private cars.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.040
Most of the cities police, buses and fire service vehicles are hybrids too.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.160
Every Hybrid has been especially developed by BYD,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.020
and commissioned by Shenzhen city authorities.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.220
 

00:12:13.495 --> 00:12:15.705
 

00:12:16.165 --> 00:12:19.035
 

00:12:19.035 --> 00:12:21.725
 

00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:24.135
 

00:12:24.565 --> 00:12:27.225
 

00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:30.175
 

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.000
The model Li Chao drives

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.600
was named after an ancient imperial dynasty. Tang

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.900
Mai Yang is one of the leading developers of this cross-over technology.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.245
 

00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:51.235
 

00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:54.285
 

00:12:54.285 --> 00:12:55.285
 

00:12:55.445 --> 00:12:58.445
 

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:01.125
 

00:13:01.435 --> 00:13:04.385
 

00:13:04.525 --> 00:13:07.575
 

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:08.675
 

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.940
This model was launched in the market in 2015.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.300
But creating it began back in 2007.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.685
 

00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:27.420
 

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.160
 

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.900
 

00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:35.755
 

00:13:35.755 --> 00:13:38.305
 

00:13:38.305 --> 00:13:41.265
 

00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:44.235
 

00:13:44.235 --> 00:13:47.055
 

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:50.235
 

00:13:50.235 --> 00:13:51.415
 

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:55.205
 

00:13:55.205 --> 00:13:58.155
 

00:13:58.155 --> 00:14:00.915
 

00:14:00.915 --> 00:14:02.005
 

00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:05.205
 

00:14:05.205 --> 00:14:08.255
 

00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:10.965
 

00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:11.965
 

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.560
To solve problems like that,

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.880
a whole separate laboratory has been built a BYD.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.020
Where new materials are studied and synthesized.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.160
For an example, scientist here have created a special type of silicon carbide,

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.120
that conserves cold air for the electric engines cooling system.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.460
BYD's factory is in Dapeng,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.720
Shenzhen's most remote district.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.520
The company is like a city in itself.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.540
As well the administrative and manufacturing facilities,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.420
The complex also include employees residential halls,

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.180
and a lab complex.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.340
There's even a testing facility.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.400
They don't just test new models here,

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.740
But old ones too.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.920
Random cars from every batch

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.720
are given compulsory test drive under various road conditions.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:40.120
Company employees use a dedicated light rail system to move around the companies sprawling grounds.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.100
BYD has started laying out a similar light rail system in the city itself.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.560
Pan Lina has only worked at the BYD plant for a year.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.920
She moved to Shenzhen from the north of China to join a technical institute.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.540
She dreams of becoming a programmer,

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.640
and manages to reconcile her work with her studies.

00:16:18.425 --> 00:16:21.245
In the factory Pan Lina is a quality controller,

00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:23.155
on electric engine production.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.660
Electric engines and power cells are BYD's main signature products.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:37.700
On average one charge is enough for an electric car to travel through all of Shenzhen form west to east.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.540
That's about eighty kilometers.

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:42.585
There are many charging points on the company's ground

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.555
so that the people don't have to search for on in the city.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.840
Every staff member is entitled to a discount on a BYD car.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.560
Pan Lina hopes that one day she'll buy one too.

00:16:56.095 --> 00:16:58.255
 

00:16:58.925 --> 00:17:01.315
 

00:17:02.235 --> 00:17:05.095
 

00:17:05.095 --> 00:17:08.045
 

00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:09.045
 

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:16.660
Power for the recharging points are generated by the most environmentally friendly way possible.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.280
Solar Energy

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.415
The cars are most literally charged by the Shenzhen sun,

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.240
Which shines here for almost 365 days a year.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.040
Almost every roof in BYD's huge production complex

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.260
is covered with solar panels.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.775
 

00:17:37.775 --> 00:17:38.775
 

00:17:39.185 --> 00:17:42.635
 

00:17:43.275 --> 00:17:46.255
 

00:17:46.675 --> 00:17:47.905
 

00:17:48.915 --> 00:17:51.985
 

00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:54.725
 

00:17:55.415 --> 00:17:56.415
 

00:17:56.725 --> 00:17:58.765
 

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.840
By 2018 Shenzhen

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.580
will boasts more the 10,00 electric car charging points.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.880
All powered by solar energy.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.500
The city is a perfect example of how life has changed

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.660
as a result of market reform.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.960
It's thanks to Deng Xiaoping the architect of those economic reforms

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.240
that this mega-city was created.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.860
Futuristic Shenzhen is very close to the Hong Kong border,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.400
and today the city's living standards have risen even higher than its neighbor.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.600
As recently as the early 90's

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.440
Shenzhen population was barely half a million.

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:53.425
But today it's thirty times more.

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:54.860
Nearly fifteen million

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.120
Almost every plot of land is taken up by offices

00:18:58.125 --> 00:18:59.845
or residential buildings.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.180
Parking for the cities' numerous cars

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.880
has become a major issue.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.020
But Shenzhen authorities has an innovative approach to solving the problem.

00:19:13.045 --> 00:19:15.945
Just a stone's throw from Li Chao's relative house

00:19:15.945 --> 00:19:17.875
is a multi-story car park.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.320
It was developed here at the chinese IT innovation hub.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.320
The Yeefung company is quite old by Shenzhen standards

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.180
It use to make fans and industrial furnaces,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.240
but now has been developing new generation car parks for more than ten years

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.165
 

00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:56.445
 

00:19:56.725 --> 00:19:59.675
 

00:19:59.675 --> 00:20:02.505
 

00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:05.565
 

00:20:05.565 --> 00:20:06.565
 

00:20:06.965 --> 00:20:08.045
 

00:20:08.465 --> 00:20:09.465
 

00:20:10.065 --> 00:20:13.285
 

00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:16.165
 

00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:19.155
 

00:20:19.205 --> 00:20:22.085
 

00:20:22.085 --> 00:20:23.685
 

00:20:24.145 --> 00:20:27.385
 

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.240
There are now Yeefung multi-level car parks in

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.380
many large office buildings, hospitals, and

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.620
close to the most popular metro stations and parks.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.740
With a multi-level car structure,

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.255
one car takes up a third of the space needed

00:20:46.255 --> 00:20:47.915
in a regular car park.

00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:51.575
For a facility that could of accommodated a hundred cars

00:20:51.575 --> 00:20:53.345
that's a big difference.

00:20:54.245 --> 00:20:56.865
Land is in short supply in Shenzhen.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.920
This system allows it to be used much more efficeintly

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.620
Car parks like this are no big surprise.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.960
There are already several systems like it in the USA.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.540
But Yeefung's unique development

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.400
is its third generation car parks are robotic.

00:21:22.175 --> 00:21:25.105
 

00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:28.625
 

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:31.925
 

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:34.255
 

00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:37.885
 

00:21:37.895 --> 00:21:40.715
 

00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:44.115
 

00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:47.805
 

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:49.015
 

00:21:49.495 --> 00:21:52.535
 

00:21:52.535 --> 00:21:53.385
 

00:21:53.385 --> 00:21:55.075
 

00:22:05.545 --> 00:22:08.645
 

00:22:08.645 --> 00:22:11.705
 

00:22:12.335 --> 00:22:13.735
 

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:17.625
 

00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:20.505
 

00:22:21.585 --> 00:22:24.935
 

00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:27.635
 

00:22:27.635 --> 00:22:30.835
 

00:22:30.835 --> 00:22:34.095
 

00:22:34.365 --> 00:22:36.815
 

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:40.315
 

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:43.375
 

00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:46.385
 

00:22:46.385 --> 00:22:49.235
 

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:52.235
 

00:22:52.235 --> 00:22:55.095
 

00:22:55.115 --> 00:22:57.985
 

00:22:57.985 --> 00:23:00.995
 

00:23:00.995 --> 00:23:04.015
 

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:06.375
 

00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:08.305
 

00:23:08.305 --> 00:23:10.935
 

00:23:10.935 --> 00:23:13.895
 

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.760
 

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.780
At last Li Chao is with his family.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.800
His little nephew is in for a high tech surprise

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:53.165
Shenzhen style

00:23:55.335 --> 00:23:58.815
 

00:23:59.185 --> 00:24:01.465
 

00:24:02.115 --> 00:24:03.115
 

00:24:03.265 --> 00:24:06.345
 

00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:09.635
 

00:24:10.085 --> 00:24:12.195
 

00:24:13.215 --> 00:24:14.215
 

00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:16.455
 

00:24:18.595 --> 00:24:19.595
 

00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:21.575
 

00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:25.505
 

00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:26.505
 

00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:29.965
 

00:24:30.225 --> 00:24:33.265
 

00:24:35.405 --> 00:24:36.405
 

00:24:37.265 --> 00:24:39.005
 

00:24:39.825 --> 00:24:41.225
 

00:25:04.615 --> 00:25:07.745
 

00:25:07.765 --> 00:25:10.625
 

00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:12.055
 

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.360
Shenzhen is a skyward city of high technology

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.120
Where everyone inspires to be a builder of the future

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.400
And not just people, but robots too.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.380
This mega-city might truly be called

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.080
the "Eighth Wonder of the World"

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.000
It always surprises its residence.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.380
Just as one amazing robot born in China's silicon valley

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.360
brought joy to a little boy.
