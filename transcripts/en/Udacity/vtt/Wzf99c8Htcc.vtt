00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.300
Suppose I know something about the
motion, the, the geometry of the points.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.410
For example,
let's suppose that I'm on some plane.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.620
All my points are on a plane.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.960
Here's my equation of a plane.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.390
So, all my points, X, Y,
and Z sa satisfy this.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.624
Remember, we showed this before when
were mapping everything on a plane and

00:00:17.624 --> 00:00:19.000
saying how it would've moved.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.636
We ended up with a 3 by 3 matrix,
but it was a homogeneous system, so

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:24.820
we could scale it any way we wanted.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.520
So if we wanted to, we could set
one of those elements to a 1,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.640
and then we only had to solve for
the other eight.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.290
There were eight unknowns, so therefore
we needed how many points, Megan?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.840
How many points?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.630
How many point?

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.880
Four points.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.220
Here is the, the equation,
using just the X Y values,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.301
and you'll see, a1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:48.450
8, eight point, eight unknowns, four
points needed, so when it's on a plane.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.080
Now, if it, plane is very,
very far away, what does that mean?

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.490
Well, what it means is if the difference
in the distance on the plane is small,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.850
compared to the distance from
the plane to the camera.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.130
You can show that this is
the simplified model, right?

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.250
It's just six unknowns,
otherwise know as an affine transform.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.090
This is one of the reasons that
affine transforms are used so much.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.190
When things are on a plane,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.180
on a wall, on the floor, even on maybe,
front of a body, for awhile.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.900
Mine used to be more
planar than it is now.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.080
For small amounts of motion,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.210
you can think of this being as
a plane that's relatively far away.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.650
And what that means is that this,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.280
that that plane will undergo
an affine transformation.
