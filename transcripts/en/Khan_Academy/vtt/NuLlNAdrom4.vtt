00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:02.538
Voiceover: Let's look a
little bit at the market

00:00:02.538 --> 00:00:04.603
for hamburgers.

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:08.328
This is the supply and the
demand curve for the price

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:11.659
and the quantity of
hamburgers sold per day.

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.939
If we have a completely unfettered market,

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.671
no intervention, no
taxes, nothing like that,

00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:18.671
then we see we have an equilibrium price

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:20.081
and an equilibrium quantity.

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:25.408
The equilibrium price
looks like it's about $3.75

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.828
per hamburger.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.575
The equilibrium quantity looks like it's

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:32.605
about a little bit more ...

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:34.269
Maybe if I draw that line
a little bit differently,

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.482
the equilibrium quantity
looks like it's about $3 -

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:42.731
Sorry, it's about 3.5
million hamburgers per day.

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:44.609
Just to review what we've
talked about before,

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.895
up here, below the demand
curve and above the price.

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:55.995
The price equals $3.75
line, right over here.

00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:59.078
This is how much value,
this is how much benefit

00:00:59.078 --> 00:01:01.193
the consumers are getting above and beyond

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.661
what they have to pay.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:05.960
That is the consumer surplus.

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:12.744
Then, between this price equals $3.75 line

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:16.993
and the supply curve, you
have your producer surplus.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:20.193
This is how much more
the producers are getting

00:01:20.193 --> 00:01:22.928
for each hamburger, relative to what

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:24.661
their opportunity cost of producing

00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:27.260
that incremental hamburger was.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.461
This right over here is
the producer surplus.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.126
Now, let's say ...

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:36.858
Actually these numbers
are quasi-realistic.

00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:39.329
I have a 3.5 million hamburgers per day.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.526
I actually looked it up before this video.

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:41.994
It looks like McDonalds, at least based

00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:44.660
on the information I
got, sells a little bit

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.661
over 4 million hamburgers
per day in the United States.

00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:49.411
I didn't clarify whether
this is just hamburgers

00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:51.326
from one vendor or multiple vendors,

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:53.326
but it's not a crazy number
of hamburgers to sell

00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:54.858
in a fairly large country.

00:01:54.858 --> 00:01:56.259
For the sake of this, it's not necessarily

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.594
McDonalds hamburgers,
we're just talking about

00:01:57.594 --> 00:02:00.330
this is the total market
for hamburgers in a country.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.059
We're making the simplifying assumption

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.391
that all hamburgers are created equal,

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.825
which we know is not true.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:09.993
Now, the government in this
hypothetical civilization

00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:14.792
says, "Wow, a lot of
hamburgers are being sold.

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:18.374
"We need more revenue for the government

00:02:18.374 --> 00:02:21.724
"to do other things," or
maybe to pay off their debt

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:23.207
or whatever they need to do.

00:02:23.207 --> 00:02:26.057
So they decide to tax hamburgers.

00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:28.458
They want to tax hamburgers.

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:29.594
They're going to make it very simple.

00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:30.658
They're not even going to do a percentage.

00:02:30.658 --> 00:02:33.592
Most sales taxes tend to be
a percentage of the price,

00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:35.991
but instead they're just
going to do a tax of $1

00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.173
per hamburger.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:46.666
Let's think about what
this does to the surplus,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.957
to the price at which
transactions will go on

00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:50.124
and what people will have to pay

00:02:50.124 --> 00:02:52.124
versus what they will have to get.

00:02:52.124 --> 00:02:56.123
At any given point, if we
look at the supply curve

00:02:56.123 --> 00:02:58.209
right over here, in order
to get someone to produce

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.624
that very first hamburger,
they have to get at least $2

00:03:01.624 --> 00:03:03.541
for it, because that's
their opportunity cost.

00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:05.957
They could use those exact
same resources, that land,

00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:08.958
the labor, whatever else,
to produce something else

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.457
that has $2 of value, so you
have pay them at least $2

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.624
in order for them to produce hamburgers.

00:03:13.624 --> 00:03:15.791
The more hamburgers you want
the suppliers to produce

00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.126
you have to pay them more and more

00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:18.391
for those incremental hamburgers,

00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:20.207
because they're going
to start using resources

00:03:20.207 --> 00:03:23.124
that might have better
used for other things

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:26.540
and that are not as efficiently
used for hamburgers.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.124
You have to pay them
more and more and more.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.041
This is what the supply
curve that I originally drew

00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:34.124
in magenta is what the
suppliers need to see

00:03:34.124 --> 00:03:35.659
in order to produce a certain quantity.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.058
If you want them to produce
3 million hamburgers,

00:03:38.058 --> 00:03:43.325
you have to be willing
to pay $3 per hamburger,

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:44.925
because that's their opportunity cost

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:48.041
of those incremental hamburgers up here.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.958
Now, let's think about
what happens when you add

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.059
the tax.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.058
This is what the
suppliers are going to get

00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:55.326
or the producers are going to get,

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:57.124
but when you put a tax,
the consumers are going

00:03:57.124 --> 00:03:58.958
to have to pay a dollar more.

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.392
Over here, in order to produce this much,

00:04:01.392 --> 00:04:05.326
the suppliers are going to
have to get $3 per hamburger,

00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:06.538
but then the consumers are going to have

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.278
to pay a dollar more,
so they're going to have

00:04:08.278 --> 00:04:11.108
to pay $1 more.

00:04:11.108 --> 00:04:12.597
In order to get the suppliers to produce

00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:14.532
2 million hamburgers, you're
going to have to pay them

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:15.853
this much, you're going
to have to pay them

00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:18.017
about $2.50, but then
the consumers are going

00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:19.794
to have to pay a dollar more than that.

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:21.352
They're going to have to pay that much.

00:04:21.352 --> 00:04:23.100
In order to get them to produce it all,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.129
you're going to have to pay at least $2,

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.268
but then if the suppliers
or producers are getting $2,

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.268
the consumers are going to
have to pay a dollar more

00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:33.482
for the tax.

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:36.119
One way to think about
it is the supply curve,

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:39.150
from the consumer's point of
view, is going to be shifted

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.590
a dollar more than the supply
curve from the producer's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.650
point of view.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.732
It's going to be shifted up
$1, so it's going to look

00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:48.522
something ... I can do
a better job than that.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:52.403
It's going to look something like that.

00:04:52.403 --> 00:04:54.315
At every point, because
this is a fixed dollar,

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:56.650
it's not a percentage, at
every point, this distance

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.116
right over here is going to be $1.

00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:02.182
What happens there?

00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:06.782
From the consumer's point
of view, what we have

00:05:06.782 --> 00:05:10.402
is now a new price that
they're willing to consume at,

00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:14.650
because now this reality
is not possible anymore.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.316
There's no way for the
consumers to pay $3.50

00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:21.582
and for the producers
to see $3.50, as well.

00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:25.653
So we get to a new equilibrium price

00:05:25.653 --> 00:05:28.315
and equilibrium quantity now, because now,

00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:30.581
since this is from the
consumer's point of view,

00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:33.248
the point at which they
intersect is right over there,

00:05:33.248 --> 00:05:36.734
which is about a little
bit over $4 per burger

00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:38.582
and it's a slightly lower quantity.

00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:41.316
It's about, let's just say
just for round numbers,

00:05:41.316 --> 00:05:44.847
that's about 3 million burgers per day.

00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:47.381
What happened there?

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.183
Before this whole area
was a total surplus.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.566
Below this green line
was the producer surplus,

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:54.984
above the green line and
below this curve right here

00:05:54.984 --> 00:05:56.583
was the consumer surplus.

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.448
Now we've lost part of it.

00:05:58.448 --> 00:06:02.248
We've lost this part right over here,

00:06:02.248 --> 00:06:03.662
so this is our dead weight loss.

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:06.080
This is no longer part
of the total consumer

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.662
and producer surplus.

00:06:07.662 --> 00:06:09.456
That is dead weight loss.

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:13.662
The taxation got us from
an efficient situation,

00:06:13.662 --> 00:06:16.664
where we had that maximum consumer

00:06:16.664 --> 00:06:19.381
and producer surplus.

00:06:19.662 --> 00:06:21.994
This is our dead weight loss over here.

00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:25.412
How much revenue is the
government going to get now?

00:06:25.412 --> 00:06:27.456
Well, if we assume that this is 3 million,

00:06:27.456 --> 00:06:31.048
they're going to have 3 million burgers.

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:32.623
This is 3 million right over here.

00:06:32.623 --> 00:06:34.205
They're going to have 3 million burgers

00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:37.291
times a dollar per burger.

00:06:37.291 --> 00:06:38.714
Let me do it this way.

00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:41.706
This length right over here is going to be

00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:44.518
the area of this rectangle
that I'm doing in orange.

00:06:44.518 --> 00:06:47.316
This length right over here is 3.

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:49.314
That length right over there is 3 million

00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:52.581
and then height is that dollar.

00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:54.316
Let me shade it in.

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:58.014
The height is that
dollar right over there.

00:06:58.248 --> 00:06:59.982
This is going to be $1 height.

00:06:59.982 --> 00:07:02.914
The tax revenue that the
government is going to get

00:07:02.914 --> 00:07:04.784
is 3 million times $1.

00:07:04.784 --> 00:07:07.534
3 million burgers times
$1, which is going to be

00:07:07.534 --> 00:07:11.915
$3 million per day, which is interesting,

00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:13.647
because maybe the
government officials thought

00:07:13.647 --> 00:07:14.982
they were going to get
more, because they look

00:07:14.982 --> 00:07:16.535
at the projections and they say, "Wait.

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:19.382
"There's going to be 3.5
million burgers sold per day,

00:07:19.382 --> 00:07:21.450
"so I'm going to get $3.5 million."

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.849
What they didn't realize
is that they're making

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:25.383
the burgers more
expensive, so there's going

00:07:25.383 --> 00:07:29.952
to be a lower quantity demanded.

00:07:29.952 --> 00:07:31.715
The actual clearing quantity

00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:34.286
or the actual equilibrium
quantity now is only going

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.701
to be 3 million.

00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:38.582
The way we see it, it
removed this surplus here,

00:07:38.582 --> 00:07:40.204
from both the consumer surplus

00:07:40.204 --> 00:07:43.534
and the producer surplus
and no one's getting that,

00:07:43.534 --> 00:07:45.518
not even the government's getting that.

00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:47.618
No one's getting that
white part right over there

00:07:47.618 --> 00:07:49.648
and this orange part
right over here is eating

00:07:49.648 --> 00:07:55.095
into the consumer surplus,
so now they're paying more

00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:56.390
than ...

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.429
Another way to think about
it is the difference between

00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:01.927
the benefit they're getting
and what they're paying

00:08:01.927 --> 00:08:04.857
at any given point, for any
given incremental consumer,

00:08:04.857 --> 00:08:09.126
is now less and the
producer surplus is less.

00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:12.458
The excess of what they're
getting for each hamburger

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:15.427
versus their opportunity cost is now less.

00:08:15.427 --> 00:08:18.393
The producer surplus has
now been shrunken back

00:08:18.393 --> 00:08:21.260
to this area right over here
and these are curves here,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.525
so we can't just do simple
geometry to figure out

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:24.602
the area of triangles.

00:08:24.602 --> 00:08:25.799
We would actually have
to do a little calculus

00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:27.732
to figure out the area of these curves.

00:08:27.732 --> 00:08:30.818
Then the consumer surplus
has been pushed back

00:08:30.818 --> 00:08:34.149
to this area above the
orange right over here.

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:36.566
You see, governments, for the most part,

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:39.399
have to do some type of
taxation in order to get revenue

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:42.085
and it could be income tax
or it could be a sales tax,

00:08:42.085 --> 00:08:45.149
like this right over
here, but when they do it,

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:47.596
it gets us into a non-efficient state

00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:51.654
and it does cause some,
depending on how these curves

00:08:51.654 --> 00:08:54.985
are shaped, it does cause
some dead weight loss.

00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:58.117
Some benefit in excess
of what had to be paid,

00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:01.016
some of that disappears,
but it allows, at least,

00:09:01.016 --> 00:09:02.851
the government to get
revenue, depending on whether

00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:05.416
you think that's a good thing or not.
