basic core vocabulary of one language to
 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.249
basic core vocabulary of one language to
another when we look at vocabulary items

another when we look at vocabulary items
 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.859
another when we look at vocabulary items
which are just single words what we'll

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869
which are just single words what we'll
 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.929
which are just single words what we'll
find is that when two languages are

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939
find is that when two languages are
 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.359
find is that when two languages are
related they'll share a resemblance a

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369
related they'll share a resemblance a
 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.359
related they'll share a resemblance a
common root so the two vocabulary items

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369
common root so the two vocabulary items
 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.219
common root so the two vocabulary items
will ultimately derive from the same

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229
will ultimately derive from the same
 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.730
will ultimately derive from the same
common source we used the word common to

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740
common source we used the word common to
 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.859
common source we used the word common to
mean that at one time they were the same

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869
mean that at one time they were the same
 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.559
mean that at one time they were the same
but they diverged over time in different

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569
but they diverged over time in different
 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.020
but they diverged over time in different
areas in different speech communities

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030
areas in different speech communities
 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.510

into distinct words in two different

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520
into distinct words in two different
 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.120
into distinct words in two different
languages but suffice it to say that

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130
languages but suffice it to say that
 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.609
languages but suffice it to say that
cognate is just a term for saying that

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619
cognate is just a term for saying that
 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.069
cognate is just a term for saying that
these two are related words that come

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079
these two are related words that come
 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.429
these two are related words that come
from some common ancestor that's what

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439
from some common ancestor that's what
 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.959
from some common ancestor that's what
we're looking for to establish a

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969
we're looking for to establish a
 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.330
we're looking for to establish a
relationship but that's not the only

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
relationship but that's not the only
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.760
relationship but that's not the only
reason that two words would look similar

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770
reason that two words would look similar
 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.580
reason that two words would look similar
to words might also look similar to each

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590
to words might also look similar to each
 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.749
to words might also look similar to each
other due to chance

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759
other due to chance
 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.149
other due to chance
in other words randomly over time

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159
in other words randomly over time
 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.919
in other words randomly over time
especially with small words and

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929
especially with small words and
 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.230
especially with small words and
languages will find that similar words

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240
languages will find that similar words
 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.960
languages will find that similar words
similar sounding words will stand for

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970
similar sounding words will stand for
 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.510
similar sounding words will stand for
similar concepts so we might find that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
similar concepts so we might find that
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.009
similar concepts so we might find that
the word for water in one language

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019
the word for water in one language
 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.080
the word for water in one language
resembles the word in a completely

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090
resembles the word in a completely
 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.449
resembles the word in a completely
unrelated language and the two words may

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459
unrelated language and the two words may
 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.720
unrelated language and the two words may
not

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
not
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.449
not
be related at all when one language

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459
be related at all when one language
 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.820
be related at all when one language
comes into contact with another language

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830
comes into contact with another language
 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.740
comes into contact with another language
it often borrows words from that other

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750
it often borrows words from that other
 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.500
it often borrows words from that other
language it takes words especially for

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510
language it takes words especially for
 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.089
language it takes words especially for
concepts that it doesn't already have

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099
concepts that it doesn't already have
 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.000
concepts that it doesn't already have
for example in English we borrow the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
for example in English we borrow the
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.390
for example in English we borrow the
word cafe from French cafe the two words

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400
word cafe from French cafe the two words
 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.670
word cafe from French cafe the two words
aren't genuine cognates that developed

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680
aren't genuine cognates that developed
 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.380
aren't genuine cognates that developed
independently in English and French

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390
independently in English and French
 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.990

rather English speakers at some point

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000

borrowed the word cafe from French the
 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.420
borrowed the word cafe from French the
same analysis helps us when we look at

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
same analysis helps us when we look at
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.250
same analysis helps us when we look at
the basic core vocabulary list of

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260
the basic core vocabulary list of
 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.280
the basic core vocabulary list of
English we have a word person the word

English we have a word person the word
 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.369

person is a fairly basic word yet it was
 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.800

actually borrowed it's not a native

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810
actually borrowed it's not a native
 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.050
actually borrowed it's not a native
dramatic word in English well it's a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060
dramatic word in English well it's a
 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.210
dramatic word in English well it's a
native word now but it was at some point

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220
native word now but it was at some point
 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.630
native word now but it was at some point
borrowed into English so when we find

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640
borrowed into English so when we find
 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.150
borrowed into English so when we find
languages like Spanish Italian and

we'll be able to move on and compare

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799
we'll be able to move on and compare

we'll be able to move on and compare
individual languages and start to look
