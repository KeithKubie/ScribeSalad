00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.300
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.140
In the video today, we're looking at why it
is that certain radio signals travel farther

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.800
at night than during the day.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.610
Let's get started.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.510
To begin with, not all radio waves travel
farther at night than during the day, but

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.980
some, short and medium wave, which AM radio
signals fall under, definitely can given the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.080
right conditions.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.750
The main reason this is the case has to do
with the signal interacting with a particular

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.310
layer of the atmosphere known as the ionosphere,
and how this interaction changes from the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.320
nighttime to the daytime.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.469
The ionosphere is a layer of the upper atmosphere
about 50 to 600 miles above sea level.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.899
It gets its name because it is ionized consistently
by solar and cosmic radiation.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.429
In very simple terms, X-ray, ultraviolet,
and shorter wavelengths of radiation given

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.460
off by the Sun (and from other cosmic sources)
release electrons in this layer of the atmosphere

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.940
when these particular photons are absorbed
by molecules.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.440
Because the density of molecules and atoms
is quite low in the ionosphere (particularly

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.100
in the upper layers), it allows free electrons
to exist in this way for a short period of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.199
time before ultimately recombining.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.780
Lower in the atmosphere, where the density
of molecules is greater, this recombination

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.100
happens much faster.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.940
What does this have to do with radio waves?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.880
Without interference, radio waves travel in
a straight line from the broadcast source,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.720
ultimately hitting the ionosphere.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.900
What happens after is dependent on a variety
of factors, notable among them being the frequency

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.030
of the waves and the density of the free electrons.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.720
For AM waves, given the right conditions,
they will essentially bounce back and forth

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.770
between the ground and the ionosphere, propagating
the signal farther and farther.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.830
So clearly the ionosphere can potentially
play an important part in the terrestrial

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.050
radio process.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.210
But it is the constantly shifting nature of
the ionosphere that makes things really interesting.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.730
And for that, we’ll have to get a little
more technical, though we’ll at the least

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.820
spare you the math, and we’ll leave out
a little of the complexity in an effort to

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.170
not go full textbook on you.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.191
The ionosphere’s composition changes most
drastically at night, primarily because, of

00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:55.430
course, the Sun goes missing for a bit.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.930
Without as abundant a source of ionizing rays,
the D and E levels of the ionosphere cease

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.340
to be very ionized, but the F region (particularly
F2) still remains quite ionized.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.709
Further, because the atmosphere is significantly
less dense here then the E and D regions,

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.090
it results in more free electrons (the density
of which is key here).

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.689
When these electrons encounter a strong AM
radio wave, they can potentially oscillate

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.510
at the frequency of the wave, taking some
of the energy from the radio wave in the process.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.620
With enough of them, as can happen in the
F layer, (when the density of encountered

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.159
electrons is sufficient relative to the specific
signal frequency), and assuming they don’t

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.170
just recombine with some ion (which is much
more likely in the E and D layers in the daytime),

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.889
this can very effectively refract the signal
back down to Earth at sufficient strength

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.110
to be picked up on your radio.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.209
Depending on conditions, this process can
potentially repeat several times with the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.640
signal bouncing down to the ground and back
up.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.150
Thus, using this skywave, rather than just
the normal daytime groundwave, AM radio signals

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.230
can be propagated even thousands of miles.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.840
Of course, this can become a major problem
given that there are only a little over 100

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.680
allowed AM radio frequencies (restricted to
keep signals interfering too much with one

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.599
another), but around 5,000 AM radio stations
in the United States alone.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.359
Given that at night, the signals from these
stations can travel vast distances, this is

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.150
just a recipe for stations interfering with
one another.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.669
As a result, at night, AM stations in the
United States typically reduce their power,

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.590
go off the air completely until sunrise the
next day, and/or possibly are required to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.599
use directional antennas, so their specific
signal doesn’t interfere with other stations

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.059
on the same frequency.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.299
On the other hand, FM stations don’t have
to do any of this as the ionosphere doesn’t

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.139
greatly affect their signals, which has the
side benefit (or disadvantage, depending on

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.079
your point of view) of severely limiting the
range of the FM signals, which rely on groundwave

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.079
propagation.
