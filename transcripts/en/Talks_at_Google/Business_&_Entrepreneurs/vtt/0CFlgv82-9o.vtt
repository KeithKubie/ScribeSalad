00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:07.080
CHARLES MCJILTON: Well, welcome.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.290
Thank you very much
for coming today.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.660
My name is Charles McJilton.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.420
I am a social
entrepreneur, meaning

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.250
that I use business
principles and social market

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.100
issues, market issues to
deal with social issues.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.980
I have represented four
different organizations here.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.480
The one that you
might know the best

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.750
is the Rice Man, here,
Second Harvest Japan.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.230
And so today I'm going to talk
to you about how to motivate,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.920
how we use a concept here
called starting with why.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.759
And basically there are three
parts to this presentation.

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:40.050
Right now, I'll tell you a
little bit more about myself

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.765
and what we do at
Second Harvest.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.760
I'm going to show you the
whole video from Simon Sinek.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.520
Has anybody seen his video?

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.060
You have.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.220
OK, good, well, I hope you're
not bored to see it again.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.000
And then I'm going to
show you how we apply it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.160
at our organization.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.990
Because we found it
to be very important.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.073
So let's just get started.

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:03.780
I want to show you a
quick video of what we do.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.265

[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:17.690
CHARLES MCJILTON: So I
love this picture here,

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.554
because it illustrates
clearly what we do.

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:22.970
All that food, and all the
food you just saw in that video

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.240
there, would've been food that
would've been thrown away.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.760
It's a cost to the
donor to throw it away.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.610
And no company or person
wants to throw away food,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.580
but they don't know
where to get it to.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.460
We come in.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.010
This is my staff,
my former staff,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.420
pick it up and get
it out to people.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.580
For them, it now has value.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.040
But in that process
of picking it up,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.160
what used to be a problem, a
cost, to that donor company,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.270
is now of value.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.610
They can say they're doing CSR.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.920
They can say they're
engaged in the community.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.974
And their staff feel
better about the company,

00:03:57.974 --> 00:03:59.640
feel better about
their product, knowing

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.120
that it goes back into the
community to be used that day.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.950
On the recipient side
of it, obviously they

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.575
can use the food to
nourish themselves.

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:09.160
But food is also a
tool for communication,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.280
particularly in single
mother households,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.710
where quite often, the mothers
are buying separate bentos

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.420
to feed the children.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.399
Now with food, they
can cook together,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.579
and it's a way to communicate.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.250
So this really kind
of encapsulates

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.050
what we're trying
to do, make food

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.640
available to anybody in need.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.420
But to kind of
understand our philosophy

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.180
and where it comes from,
and who we are today,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.700
we need to go back 20 years ago.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.910
So I've been now in
Japan for over 26 years.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.980
And lived in a poor
section of Tokyo,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.600
made a self-help center there.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.730
But by the end of
1996, I had questions

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.070
about the viability of that.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.070
And so I chose to go live
along the Sumida River.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.010
And only intended to be
there for three months.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.520
It's good to see you again.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.490
And I ended up staying
there 15 months.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.530
And it completely
changed my world view.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.290
It's one thing to
think about poverty,

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.560
to think about hunger in the
comfort of one's own home,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.060
or in academia.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.590
It's quite different
than when you

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.590
have people living to the
left and right of you,

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.090
no more than two or three
meters away that struggle

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.450
with that issue each and
every day, and asking yourself

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.460
what should I do, what can I do,
what is my responsibility here.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.400
And so, while I knew
these people many years

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.050
before I went to
go live down there,

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.091
it was quite a new experience
to come down there,

00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:33.540
as we say, live in the gemba,
to live side by side together.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.160
And it completely
changed my mind.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.030
One day, I was looking over
the river just like this,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.620
contemplating,
thinking about the men,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.920
thinking about how people
thought about the men.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.990
And some people think
that they're [JAPANESE],,

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.180
some people think that
they're [JAPANESE],,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.613
why are they down there.

00:05:51.613 --> 00:05:54.470
And I thought about my
own life, here in Japan,

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.220
up to that point.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.860
And some people had
welcome me, some people

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.740
had not welcomed me.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.400
I'd been discriminated against.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.280
I thought about a
child in Calcutta.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.010
A street child in Calcutta
who was hungry, and thought

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.630
about their situation,
how I felt when

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.030
I saw that child in Calcutta.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.910
And I thought about
other social issues

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.510
in the world, climate change,
landmines in Afghanistan,

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.860
a number of these things.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.559
And I came back to this phrase,
back, over and over again.

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:23.100
You may be familiar
with this phrase.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.380
If you're not a part
of the solution,

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.610
you're part of the problem.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.590
If you're not a part
of the solution,

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.880
you're part of the problem.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.879
Over and over in my head
I'm thinking about this

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.324
as I'm looking at these men.

00:06:34.324 --> 00:06:35.490
And I thought about the men.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.870
They didn't feel that way.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.669
They didn't feel anybody else
was responsible for them.

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.460
I thought about the
discrimination I faced.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.059
And I didn't want anybody
to fight my own battles.

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:45.850
And I thought about
that child in Calcutta,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.361
and I said, you know, I didn't
make that child poor, or any

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:50.235
of the social issues.

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:54.620
And I had an experience
that radically

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.720
changed my whole worldview.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.030
And the insight that
I had was quite often

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.610
Westerner's sense of guilt
about the world's problems

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.780
is deeply rooted in
the exaggerated sense

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.760
of responsibility.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.340
That people feel an over
sense of responsibility

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.450
for the world's problems.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.050
And I shifted from feeling
responsible for the world's

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.110
problems to choosing to respond.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.160
And I'll give you one
quick story here to clarify

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.750
how that plays out in my life.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.520
Several years later,
I was in Seattle

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.270
with my brother, who is five
years younger, but probably two

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.300
times bigger than I am.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.030
He's fairly muscular.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.152
And a panhandler, a
guy begging for money,

00:07:39.152 --> 00:07:40.860
had the courage to
come up to both of us,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.900
and say, can you spare $5.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.130
Typical response,
typical thing, right?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.320
And without thinking,
without even pausing,

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.500
I turned to him with
no sarcasm in my voice.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.130
I said, I'll pass
on that opportunity.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.880
My brother-- he walked
away, looked at me

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.290
like this-- and my
brother looked at me like,

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.110
what the heck?

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.135
You'll pass on the opportunity?

00:08:00.135 --> 00:08:01.760
I said, well, he gave
me an opportunity

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.240
to do something good, and I
just chose not to do that.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.580
Now, if I had not had that
opportunity, that experience,

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.490
along the river, my
most likely response

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.584
would have been, well,
if I give him the money,

00:08:13.584 --> 00:08:15.000
he's going to use
it for drinking,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.920
or he doesn't look
like he needs it,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.460
or some reason why I didn't
need to give them food.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.700
But what I was really kind of
responding to there was I'm

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.930
not responsible for him.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.790
Whereas, now, my
world view is I choose

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.230
to respond to what we do.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.760
And we'll get into
that in a minute

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.940
here, when we talk about Second
Harvest, what our core why is.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.580
That perspective that I had,
and that experience, and we

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.690
talked about it the other day,
at [INAUDIBLE],, is not unique.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.270
Meaning that all of us have
these opportunities each

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.490
and every day, to step back
and reflect on our life.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.360
What do day to day
experiences mean to us?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.506
How do they reflect our
values, our worldview?

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:02.380
You don't need to live
along the Sumida River

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.390
to have an insight like that.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.880
And I want to share
one more to you

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.110
that I stumbled across in 2013.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.270
I was teaching at Sophia
University, NGO management,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.390
and I stumbled
across this video.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.320
I'm a leader.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.820
So this really spoke
directly to me.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.130
I said well, let me look at it.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.580
And I said, oh my
god, this guy, we're

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:31.010
doing what he says we're
doing, what great companies do.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.460
And since that time, we've
used it to refocus who we are,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.710
how we approach things.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.990
We saw this in last
year's campaign, almost

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.030
played out just exactly.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.220
If you look at these two
different candidates, three

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.710
different candidates, we clearly
knew what Clinton wanted.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.870
She won the presidency.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.410
She had a campaign to do that,
talked badly about Trump, how

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.450
bad, how crazy he is.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.530
Trump and Sanders, clearly,
we knew what their why was.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.660
You can debate what
that exactly was.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.880
But there's no doubt
among their supporters.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.454
You knew exactly
what their why was.

00:10:07.454 --> 00:10:09.620
And how they connected with
them was different ways,

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.990
Sanders very grassroots.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.670
Trump, big rallies.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.530
And the what, the idea
of becoming president

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.470
was almost an afterthought
for both of them.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.350
You can look at online articles
and people consistently say,

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.050
we don't know why Clinton ran.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.010
We know she wanted
to be the president.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.050
But what was her why.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.110
But these two people,
there's clearly--

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.690
and just as he was
talking about the airplane

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:38.620
inventors, the Wright brothers
and Samuel Pierpont Langley,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.620
where is Clinton today?

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.827
If she was truly about her
why of changing the country,

00:10:43.827 --> 00:10:45.910
it wouldn't matter if she
was a politician or not.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:53.740
In our sense, in who we are as
an organization, our core why,

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.347
we don't define what we
do as helping people.

00:10:58.347 --> 00:10:59.430
I'll say it one more time.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.020
We do not define what
we do as helping people.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.290
We just love food banking.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.570
We just love giving away food.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.430
Let me pause for
a second and ask

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.740
you, how many people were
surprised by that statement,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.741
coming from a nonprofit.

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:16.240
How many?

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.500
Would you raise your hand?

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.830
Yeah, you're surprised, right?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.820
But how many of you,
when you heard me say,

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.250
we just love food banking,
you felt some energy.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.370
You felt, oh, yeah.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.990
Because almost every
single time when

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.870
I have one on one discussion
with people and I say this,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.040
I can see the
people's face change.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.770
And it's not because they agree
with me about giving away food.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.230
We'll talk about
that in a second.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.950
But they can clearly identify
and connect with my core why.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.650
You could see the
energy in my face.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.840
That came from 20
years ago living along

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.610
the river, of choosing not to be
responsible, but to responding.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.140
And one of my response
is to give away food.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.180
How do we do that?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.760
Trust and equality.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.930
Trust and equality.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:12.060
70% of Japanese distrust
nonprofits, 70%.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.060
Less than 30% say that they
would trust a nonprofit here

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.680
in Japan.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.920
We interface everyday with
the food industry, which

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.260
is probably the
strictest standards

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.640
in the world for food, and
the least risk adverse--

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.350
or the most risk risk adverse.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.280
I think I always
get that mistaken.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.150
2014, United
States, 3,400 people

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.000
died from food poisoning
or foodborne illnesses

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.230
in the United States.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.030
320 million people, that's
not a lot of people.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.030
Within the last five weeks
that number of people

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.154
have died from gunshot
wounds in the United States,

00:12:47.154 --> 00:12:49.200
so we're not talking
about a lot of people.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.900
But that same year,
2014, in Japan,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.720
just three people,
just three people

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.640
died from foodborne illnesses.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.680
Population of 120
million, consuming

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.120
nearly 89 million tons of food
or importing and using it.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.749
That is not a lot.

00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:08.040
To get that level, you have
to have NASA-like standards

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.623
for your food.

00:13:08.623 --> 00:13:11.347
You do not trust anybody.

00:13:11.347 --> 00:13:12.930
We say in Japan, if
the product, isn't

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.180
perfect, pristine
and presentable,

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.890
it doesn't get purchased.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.350
That's the environment
we were operating in.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.980
So we needed to create trust.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.440
And here are the results.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.680
10 years ago, we only
had 15 companies.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.820
Now we have over 1,300.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.720
Here's the interesting thing.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.750
We don't do any solicitation.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.510
We don't go around company
to company asking for food.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.380
All 1,300 of those
companies approached us,

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.260
and sat down with us, and
offered us an agreement.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.590
And all 1,300
companies, we have what

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.460
we call an equal
relationship with them.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.950
Why is this so important for us?

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.960
It's not a matter of pride.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.720
It's a matter of our approach.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.140
If we go around company
to company and say

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.910
[SPEAKING JAPANESE],,
it unintentionally

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.490
puts the company above here.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.440
It puts us down here.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.160
So that when we pass out our
food, the people are down here

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.050
and we're up here.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.740
We see food as a tool.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.780
Companies have pumps and
patches, people over here

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.730
have bikes with flat tires.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.959
If we can make that
lateral transfer,

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:24.000
that's all we want to be.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.620
That's all we want to do.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.205
That equality part is important.

00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:30.580
What I will tell a company
that sits down in front of me,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.510
I'll say we are not
interested in your food.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.280
We want a trusting
relationship with you.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.410
And we will match you pace
for pace to achieve that.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.300
And now I'll go on
to give two examples.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.470
Nichirei Foods in 2005
signed an agreement with us

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.810
after just three short weeks.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.880
But Nichirei Foods is
traditionally a very, very

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.170
conservative company.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.150
A different company,
which we never name,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:00.370
but it's an actual fact, took
us five years, five years.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.584
See, I don't want
the food from them,

00:15:02.584 --> 00:15:04.750
what I want is for them to
get so excited about what

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.677
we do, they tell two
or three other people,

00:15:08.677 --> 00:15:09.760
and here it is right here.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.050
The what we do.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.390
You could find that on our
home page or annual report.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.970
Obviously, we provide
food to people

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.440
in a lot of different ways.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.980
This is the end
result of what we do.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.810
But when we talk about and
think about us, we go from why,

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.287
how, what in our discussions.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.050
We used this this week
to work through a problem

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.674
that we've had for
many, many years.

00:15:44.674 --> 00:15:46.340
And the problem focused
around the issue

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.110
of food loss and food waste.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.810
Big topic in the media.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.780
People talk about it all
the time, one third of food

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.070
is thrown away, 25% of
food is thrown away,

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.990
there's people hungry,
and stuff like this.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.500
But we all, being in the field,
being experts in this area,

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.210
knew that a lot of
what was being said

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.350
was uninformed, uneducated,
and unsupported.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:17.250
And so we would always criticize
these different activities,

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.460
the Zero Yen Kitchen,
[SPEAKING JAPANESE],, food loss,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.230
all these.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.260
And so my staff came to me and
says what are we going to do?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.790
We can't run away
from this issue.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.384
People are always
talking about it.

00:16:29.384 --> 00:16:31.050
We've got to be part
of the conversation

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.160
even if we don't
believe in the movement.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.180
In other words, there are 155
definitions for food loss.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.280
Even countries that have
a single definition,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.490
there's no way to measure
how much food loss is.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.670
If you can't measure it, you
can't manage it, correct?

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.590
In the United
States, my country,

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:55.310
the government reports anywhere
from $33 million to $66 million

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.050
depending on what
definition they use.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.520
So how are we going
to square this?

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.770
Well, we had good discussion.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.230
And what we realized is
that we were focusing on

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.190
from the what side.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:13.599
And so we came back said what is
our why, what is our core why.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.890
We just love to give away food.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.270
And so my staff and I each
shared a story that we own had.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.020
He went to India at one time.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.460
And so a child was
begging for food.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.740
And instead of just
given the child money,

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.460
he said well, come,
and I'll feed you.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.730
And he ended up feeding
10 of his family members

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.140
at a restaurant.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.590
I shared my mind as a child
not having enough food,

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.230
not having lunches, and
what that meant to me.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.439
And now having an opportunity
to give away food.

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:45.980
And then we thought
about, well, wait

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.790
a minute, these
people over here,

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.910
what's going on at
their core, their why.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.340
Well, food is life.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.650
Our fondest and deepest memories
are usually connected to food,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:05.070
whether it be a wedding,
holidays, when we feel bad,

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.410
we get good food, maybe
our mothers might have

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.030
made us food that comforted us.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.680
But food is such
an integral part

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.670
of us, and to see
it thrown away--

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.740
I love the Japanese
phrase of [JAPANESE]..

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.670
But we said, hey, you know what,
how about we focus on it here,

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:28.730
and then we talk about how we
can use that food as life--

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.140
this is the intersectionality--
and avoid all this.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.490
And suddenly, we went
from being confrontational

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.090
each time about their
what to refocusing

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.510
on what is important
to us, and how can we

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.700
talk about food
loss and food waste

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.920
in a way that
reflects our values,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.441
in a way that doesn't
alienate other people.

00:18:53.441 --> 00:18:55.690
The last one, and it's
important with this discussion,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.010
is that I can go
down and tell you

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.290
all the things that are wrong
with numbers, and facts,

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.670
and figures.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.070
But that's all that is,
is facts and figures.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.960
But I tell you a
story about myself

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.880
of not having enough
know food for breakfast,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.460
or not being able to have lunch,
or my colleague can tell you

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.170
about him sharing dinner.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:19.989
That's a memory.

00:19:19.989 --> 00:19:21.780
That's an experience
that you can remember.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.130
And that can motivate us.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.540
How can we share more food?

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.650
Our vision is by
2020, that we want

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.650
to make food available
to 100,000 people.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.230
Currently, there are
about 2.2 million people

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.370
that lack food security.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.810
The vast majority of
these people are elderly.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:53.060
The national population for
homeless is only around 6,200.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.690
In Tokyo, it's less than 2,000.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.310
The vast majority
of people in need

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.780
are not living on the streets.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.780
They're living in
houses and apartments.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.580
To get access to food, this
week, in New York City,

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.970
there are 1,100 different
locations to pick up food.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.420
Even nearby Hong Kong has 160.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.060
Tokyo, maybe six.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.630
And I'm not referring to
church groups or other faith

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.317
based groups that provide
[JAPANESE] in the park.

00:20:19.317 --> 00:20:21.400
I'm talking where you can
pick up a basket of food

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.570
to feed your family
for three or four days.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.480
So we think of it like climbing
a mountain in some ways.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.800
Our first step up that mountain
by 2020, is to reach 100,000.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.530
Our big goal, the big
one, that we really

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.770
hope to get there some day is
that everybody has enough food.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.560
And we want to think of
it like a public service,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.216
a public asset.

00:20:44.216 --> 00:20:45.840
I live way out in
the countryside.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.020
It takes me about almost two
hours to get home every day.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.685
I almost never use
the public library.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.730
But if I felt the public
library wasn't there,

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.340
I would feel a public
asset was gone.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.900
It's valuable to me.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.649
I'm happy to pay taxes to
make sure that library's open.

00:21:04.649 --> 00:21:06.940
Because it's not just a place
for people to read books,

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.160
but it's a place for
people to get knowledge,

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.630
for people to experience
a different world,

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.410
a place for people
to share information.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.730
It's valuable to us.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.420
And that's how we want to
see what a safety net is.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.670
Is that even if you
don't use it today,

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.510
somebody in the community
might be able to use it.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.580
And even that you may never
experienced food insecurity,

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.950
you know what it's like to
have everybody at the table.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.760
And if I were to ask you to
take a step, just for a second,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.720
and imagine that every
single child in Tokyo by 2020

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.750
could go to school on a full
stomach, how would that feel?

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.490
For me, personally,
makes me feel good.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.010
Even though I don't
know all those children.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.950
We have plenty of food.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.790
So this is where your
opportunity to respond.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.310
You know to partner with
us, use your talents

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.660
to help us to get food.

00:22:06.286 --> 00:22:07.910
There's different
ways you can interact

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.070
with us to make that happen.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.972
I know some of you are coming
out tomorrow, that's great.

00:22:13.972 --> 00:22:15.680
And then also financially,
if you've ever

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.096
donated to us
financially, you may

00:22:17.096 --> 00:22:18.920
want to know, what
impact does that have.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.380
For every 1,000 yen you donate
to us, we can deliver 40 meals.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.410
We arrive at that number
by taking our total costs,

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.639
overhead, everything,
and dividing it

00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:32.180
by the number of meals that we
are able to deliver last year.

00:22:38.072 --> 00:22:39.780
Let me give you the
last two quotes here.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.070
I love these, one
by Martin Luther,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.410
He plays on Hillel the
Elder, "If not us, then who?

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.660
If not now, then when?"

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.760
We reflect on that internally.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.017
We don't want to assign
this work to other people,

00:22:54.017 --> 00:22:55.850
or wait for other people
to take the action,

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.470
but we want to do something.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.350
And we want to do whatever
we can do today, and not

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.050
wait until we retire,
or wait until something

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.460
changes in our life.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.790
Even a small action today
could have a big impact.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.130
The second one though
speaks more deeply to us

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.430
as an organization,
how we see the world.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.812
It comes from Robert Kennedy.

00:23:13.812 --> 00:23:15.770
"There are those who look
at the things the way

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:16.970
they are, and ask why.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.110
I dream of things that
never were and ask why not?"

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.640
Instead of focusing on
why is there all this food

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.340
waste, why doesn't the
government do something.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.930
We want to say,
what would it look

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.120
like if you and I partnered?

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.870
What would it look like if you
and I put our heads together?

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.940
What would that
banquet table look

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.530
like if we took some action
today to make something happen?

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.990
Focus on what the
possibilities are.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.840
There's a lot more information
on our web site here.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.010
It's bilingual.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.530
And you can download
some information.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.350
Thank you much for
your time today.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.600
Thank you.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.950
[APPLAUSE]
