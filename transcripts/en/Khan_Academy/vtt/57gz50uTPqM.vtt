00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.390
In the last series of
examples, we go into month two

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.024
with $100 in cash.

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:06.440
And the way we set
up the example,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.959
we spend $200 in month two.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.000
And what we've been doing
so far is we're saying,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.260
oh, that gets us to a cash
balance of negative $100

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.797
at the end of month two.

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:17.130
And that's a little unrealistic.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.629
I kept it simple
here, and I allowed

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:21.570
us to have a negative cash
balance just for simplicity.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.114
But usually you will not
see a negative cash balance.

00:00:24.114 --> 00:00:26.030
The fact that you have
a negative cash balance

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.220
and you're allowed to
operate, it essentially

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.800
means that someone
is lending you money.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.110
So to make this example a
little bit more realistic,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.440
let's imagine a situation.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.769
So in month two,
you only have $100.

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.810
The person that you're
catering for-- that you're

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.900
buying these $200 of
supply for-- they're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.450
not going to pay you
until next month.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.330
So you tell the people that
you need to buy stuff from,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.350
look, I only have $100.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.440
I have this customer.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.350
I'm doing the catering
for them this month.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.980
Can I pay $100 to
you this month,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.310
and then maybe pay another
$100 to you next month?

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.020
And let's say that
they agree to that.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.680
So in month two,
on a cash basis,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.830
instead of spending
$200, you're actually

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.349
spending-- I'll
just write over it--

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.510
you're actually spending $100.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.730
And then in month three,
you'll also spend $100.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.750
Now, this will change your
cash accounting numbers.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.284
This will now be negative 100
and this would now be $500.

00:01:21.284 --> 00:01:22.700
But the more
important thing is, I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.533
want to show you how
this could be accounted

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.280
for in accounts payables.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.250
The fact that you essentially
told your vendors,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.270
even though you gave
me $200 worth of stuff,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.370
I'm only going to
give you $100 now,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.010
and I'm going to give
you $100 later-- that

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.300
means that you've increased
your accounts payable by $100.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.530
You've increased this
liability that you owe things

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.900
to other people.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.760
So let me add accounts
payables over here.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.550
So I will add it-- I'll add
it in a row-- I'll do it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.507
on both of these diagrams-- So
I'll just call it accounts--

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:54.090
I'll just do A period,
so I don't have

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.850
to write the whole
thing-- accounts payable.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.210
And going into the
period, you didn't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.501
have any accounts payable.

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.000
And then now that
you're essentially

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.810
borrowing $100
from your vendors--

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.440
you're allowing to push
back when you pay them--

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.485
You now have an accounts
payable of $100.

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:12.985
And I'm not going
to work through it

00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:14.210
on all of this stuff over here.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.100
But let's see how that would
have affected the income

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.490
statement and the
balance sheets.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.906
So over here, all
of a sudden, you

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.890
had another liability--
accounts payable

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.810
is a liability-- You
have an accounts payable

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.980
liability of $100.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.060
So at this point, we had no
accounts payable liability.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.560
And then after the
end of the month,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.160
we have an accounts
payable liability of $100.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.700
We owe $100 to our vendors,
and our cash is now at 0.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.520
So notice it still does
not change our equity.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.780
We essentially
added $100 to cash,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.630
and then we added
a $100 liability.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.350
They cancel out.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.350
If you take now this part
right here, all of the assets

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.850
are 400.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.410
400 400 minus 100
in liabilities still

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.220
gets you to 300 in equity.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.700
But now the reconciliation is to
go from $100 in cash to 0 cash.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.990
We're not allowing
ourselves to go negative.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.210
And the reason why we can
do that is we actually

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.650
have a source of cash.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.650
So let me erase
that, and then let's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.650
add a line right
down-- Let me see

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.990
if I can add a line
right over here.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.220
So we could say accounts
payable increase,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.724
and now this is
a source of cash.

00:03:30.724 --> 00:03:31.890
And it might not be obvious.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.590
We're increasing a liability.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.080
But it's a source
of cash because we

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.660
don't have to use our own cash.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.690
By increasing the
accounts payable,

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.140
it's allowing us to not
use all of our cash.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.570
So we have an accounts
payable increase of 100.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.980
So this is a source of cash.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.990
So now the cash
from operations--

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.450
200 net income,
minus 400 plus 100.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.550
This whole thing is now minus
100 cash from operations.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.250
So you start with
$100, you use 100.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.260
Our ending cash is now
0, and it all works out.
