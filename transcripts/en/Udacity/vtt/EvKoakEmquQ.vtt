00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.990
So why do we want to measure the traffic

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.260
on the network? One reason might be billing. So

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.400
for example, we might want to charge a customer

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.256
based on how much traffic they've sent on a network.

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:14.240
In order to do so, we need to passively

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.690
measure how much traffic that customer is sending. Here's

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.200
an example of measurements of inbound and outbound traffic

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.030
volumes. On a link on the Georgia Tech campus network.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.000
The Y axis is shown in bits per second, and the X axis is the time of

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.360
day. Now, a user might be billed based on how much traffic they send on the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.930
network. A common mode of billing is called

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.560
95th percentile billing, where a customer pays for

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.320
what's called a committed information rate, or CIR,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.870
and throughput is measured every five minutes. The customer,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.220
then, may be billed on the 95th percentile,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.190
of these five minute samples. So if we were

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.130
to bill on the 95th percentile of inbound traffic,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.230
we might approximate that 95th percentile by the orange

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.970
line I've drawn on here. And the customer

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.570
might be billed at this rate, even though they're

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.030
allowed to sometimes burst at higher rates. Another common

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.610
reason to measure is security. For example, network operators

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.790
may want to know the type of traffic that's

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.525
being sent on the network so they can detect

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:24.870
rogue behaviour, and network operator may want to measure

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.190
traffic on the network to detect compromised hosts or

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.006
the presence of Botnets or Denial of Sevice attacks,

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.250
two phenomena that we'll talk about later on in

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.820
the course. For the rest of this lesson, since

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.630
we focused a lot on performance measurement already, I will

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.010
mainly focus on passive traffic data measurement.
