00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.230
If real, irrational, rational, whole and complex
numbers are the only numbers you’re familiar

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.000
with...boy have I got news for you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.259
Some special kinds of numbers, like quaternions
and octonions, describe more than our three

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.259
dimensions.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.360
Just let that sink in a little bit.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.750
Can you even picture the kind of math involved
for a reality that exists in more than 3D?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.540
How would we even think about those shapes?

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.770
Let’s take it back to like, middle school
for a sec.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.960
If you want to travel in one dimension, you
add and subtract real numbers.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.910
Here you are, the dot, on your little line,
and you want to move 7 units to the right?

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.570
Great, that’s plus seven.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.890
Let’s take it into two dimensions.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.670
To make moves like this you can use what’s
called an imaginary number These can be combined

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.860
with real numbers to make what are called
complex numbers.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.010
Real numbers and complex numbers are the first
two of four number systems in pure mathematics

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.100
that we call the normed division algebras
over the real numbers.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.790
We can think of complex numbers as two-dimensional
numbers...because they help you move things

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.790
in 2D.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.430
But something kinda funny happens when you
use these division algebras to manipulate

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.530
an object in 3-dimensions.Say you’ve got
a cube, and you need to be able to rotate

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.710
it around to see all its sides.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.220
What kind of math are we looking at?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.180
After the 1D real numbers and the 2D complex
numbers… comes a division algebra with 4-dimensions,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.130
not 3, like you’d expect!

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.320
And this 4-dimensional number system is known
as the quaternions!

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.750
And they are awesome and SUPER crazy, so we
got in touch with Cohl Furey, a postdoctoral

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.470
researcher at Cambridge who lives and breathes
this stuff.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.790
She helped us get a lot of this straight,
and if you’re a math PhD, you can go watch

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.850
her series on quaternions and get real nitty-gritty.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.439
But for the rest of us--quaternions are the
number system we use to describe 3D shapes

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.780
in 4D space.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.290
That sounds a little trippy, but that fourth
dimension doesn’t necessarily represent

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.259
a spatial dimension, like up and down.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.900
Sometimes we use extra dimensions to represent
a different concept, like time.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.840
So in your quaternion, you have a real number,
nested inside your complex number, and two

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.330
new terms, j and k, which represent your two
other dimensions--four components, hence the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.870
‘quat’ in quaternion.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.900
What makes quaternions extra hard to work
with is that they’re noncommutative.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.840
Stick with me here--that means the order of
the calculations matters in a way it doesn’t

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840
with real and complex numbers.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.010
Think about it: If we go back to our 2D axis,
it doesn’t matter if you rotate in the plane

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.580
by 10 degrees first, and then by 20 degrees,
or 20 degrees first and then 10 degrees--either

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.879
way you end up in the same place.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:53.230
But in 3D space, if we have our cube, it can
matter which move you do first, partly because

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.879
you have more options.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.130
And while they may sound insane, quaternions
are super useful--they come in handy when

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.740
calculating the launch trajectory of an aerospace
vehicle.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.459
Your phone can use them to calculate your
device’s position and orientation in space.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.849
We use them all the time in generating computer
graphics and for programming robots, which

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.310
move around in 3D space.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.440
They are also especially important because
a version of quaternions underpin Einstein’s

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.960
theory of special relativity--allowing us
to calculate the movement of an object in

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.150
3 physical dimensions, plus the extra dimension,
which can be defined as time.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.030
But strap in--’cause here come the octonions.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.940
That’s the next step up.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.599
Now, because of some complex mathematical
rules, these kinds of numbers come only in

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:47.050
dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8, so after quaternions,
we make the jump to octonions--numbers that

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.099
help us navigate eight-dimensions.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.220
That’s the quaternion, which contains complex
numbers, which contain real numbers, plus

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.900
4 new units.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.330
E1, e2, and e4 are one way that i, j, and
k from the quaternions are represented in

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.159
the octonion system.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.049
These eight ‘dimensions’ again, don’t
have to be spatial--they can represent characteristics

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.580
of particle behavior, like how certain particles
behave under the strong force, making octonions

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.329
really useful for quantum calculations.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.650
And there we have our nice neat set of the
four normed division algebras [over the reals]

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.301
[over the real numbers]
The thing is, with each next level, the math

00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:29.569
of these division algebras gets even more
tangled.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.469
Quaternions are noncommutative, and octonions
are too.

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:39.289
But they’re also nonassociative--which means
not only does order matter, but it also matters

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.110
how you group the multiplication of octonions.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.870
But the very structure that makes the math
so difficult is one reason that the octonions

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.749
can be so useful in describing fundamental
physics.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:56.330
One recent paper revealed that octonion mathematics
allows for the existence of sterile neutrinos--a

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.770
particle that scientists are actively looking
for experimentally because...it might be dark

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.770
matter.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.339
That’s just one of a whole host of applications--many
of our models of particle physics are still

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:12.749
incomplete, but in the words of Dr. Furey
“...there have been a number of very tantalizing

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:18.520
hints that the octonions might somehow underlie
certain aspects of the structure of elementary

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.009
particle physics.”

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.439
So they’re famously difficult to work with.

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:28.259
But incredibly useful and underpin the forefront
of mathematical exploration happening today!

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:34.270
They’re so crazy physicists even disagree
on how to approach them, but researchers hope

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.399
octonions will help them peel back the layers
of reality to explain why the universe behaves

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:41.089
the way we observe it to.

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:42.089
Wow.

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:43.089
We made it through that, pretty exciting.

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.919
Now we know more about extra-dimensional math!

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.490

universe, check out this video here.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.669
A huge thanks again to Dr. Cohl Furey for
helping us make sure this was all correct,

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.830
and let us know in the comments if you have
any questions or any other in-depth mathematics

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.830
that you’d like us to explore.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.399
Thanks for watching!
