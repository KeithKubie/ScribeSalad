00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.900
Good news, scientists discovered a virus that
makes you dumber.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.200
Wait, that’s bad news!

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.570
I screwed up, don’t roll the intro…

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.599
Hey Guys, I’m Joe guest hosting for DNews.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.560
Scientists from the University of Nebraska
working in conjunction with scientists from

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.849
Johns Hopkins Medical School were getting
their science on while studying the wonderful

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.960
world of throat microbes, when they accidently
stumbled upon a microorganism that they believe

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.619
literally makes people, to put it delicately…
stupid.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.600
The virus is known as chlorovirus ATCV-1 and
they discovered it inside the throats of 40

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.339
out of 92 volunteers, but before this study,
science only found the stuff lurking in green

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.370
algae kicking it in freshwater lakes.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.949
Now, researchers have yet to figure out how
chlorovirus ATCV-1 migrates from our lakes

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.820
and streams to the moist safe-haven of human
throats, if it migrates at all, they are not

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.829
sure how it gets inside, but once it is, the
microorganism is like that kid down the street

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.190
that your parents didn’t want you playing
with because he had an affinity for the sound

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.039
of breaking glass and fire and was a straight
up bad influence that made you more dumberer…

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.220
After infiltrating and swabbing the throats
of the 92 participants the researchers proceeded

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.920
to subject the volunteers to a number of cognitive
tests, measuring attention span as well as

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.140
speed and accuracy in visual processing.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.909
And low and behold, the 44% carrying chloroviurs
ATCV-1 scored an average of 7-9 points lower,

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.640
totally disappointing their overbearing parents
in the process.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.899
I’m not dumb, dad!

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.579
My body is just home to a brain-altering microorganism
that ravages my intelligence.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.579
Jeez!

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.579
I’m outta here.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.189
I’m gonna go hang out with Ryan Jacobi.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.200
We’re gonna throw rocks at windows and light
a tree stump on fire.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.740
To double-check the findings, the scientists
did what scientists tend to do, and experimented

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.340
on unsuspecting mice, injecting a bunch of
Stewert Little’s with ATCV-1 and placed

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.070
them in a mouse maze, and they got dumb.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.420
The stupid juice seeped into the hippocampus
and scrambled memory formation and learning

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.610
pathways, making it increasingly difficult
for the mice to navigate the labyrinth and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.270
get accepted into mouse Harvard.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.490
Now, this is super interesting for a number
of reasons, but here’s the thing, our bodies

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.179
are slathered, inside and out, with all sorts
of microorganisms, and most are innocuous,

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.170
but this study showcases that even though
our immune systems may not be affected by

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.760
a tiny intruder, our cognitive functions may
still fall victim to their exploits.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.810
So, the body stays strong while the mind secretly
withers away.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.810
Dr. Robert Yolken, co-author of the study
said, “On average, people with the virus

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.710
had perhaps a 5–10 percent decrease in the
domains [of brain function] we measured.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:43.140
That’s probably not noticeable in day-to-day
conversation or activity, but is significant.”

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.340
Taking things a step further, science will
try to understand the subtle effects of all

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.370
the tiny hitch-hikers on our bodies and will
most certainly try to discover ways to alter

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.450
the microorganism make up inside us to make
us not just healthier, but smarter as well.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.450
Cool.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.300
So do you think you have the stupid virus
or know someone who does?
