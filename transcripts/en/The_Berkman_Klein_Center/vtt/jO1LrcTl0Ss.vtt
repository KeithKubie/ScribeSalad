00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.549
I'm Pritha I'm a fellow this year at the
Berkman Klein Center and I'm also a

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.510
research associate at the Harvard School
of Public Health in the Department of

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.750
Social and Behavioral Sciences. I am
looking at how population health can be

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.300
improved with the use of technology, and
in particular in low and middle income

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.420
countries, or the sort of "disadvantaged"
populations in high-income countries and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.120
in this I am looking especially at
maternal health outcomes. So if I talk

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.640
about recent events, we have this universal identification system in

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.250
India called Aadhaar which is being
linked to track people and that has

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.390
potentially a lot of use in public
health. So for example our TB program

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.620
tuberculosis program, the financial
assistance that is provided is being

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940
linked through that. The privacy
implications of this are really huge so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.020
I guess, what technology can do
we should also be wary of those

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.240
very same things at the same time so
that balance is I don't know how we

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.890
are going to find it, I'm working on it
myself.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.390
So the potential is huge, but if you say
like in a country like India, if you say

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.409
that you're not going to provide the
services if a person does not have that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.020
ID yet that is because you have to
understand implementation is a huge

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.900
challenge. So that is a problem and secondly the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.170
privacy part of it really scares me,
because you're linking all sorts of data

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.750
through this one ID, and the government
has access to all of it. I don't

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.420
think enough is being done to address
that, or even research on that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.799
of how to mitigate those concerns. Like
how can you use the technology for the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.560
good, but also reassure citizens. There should be a mechanism to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.229
protect the privacy of citizens and I
don't think enough is being done

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.860
on that front yet.
