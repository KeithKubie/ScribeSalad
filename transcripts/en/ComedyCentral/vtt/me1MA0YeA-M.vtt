&gt;&gt; WHY DOES KEVIN DILLON'S FACE
LOOK LIKE A V FOR VENDETTA MASK?

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:16.537
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT THIS NOT AT ALL
EXPLOITED ACTOR?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.209
WAS SHE ASKED TO BRING GRAVITAS
TO THE ROLE OF THE SUSHI GIRL

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.077

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.358
THAT SHE GOT THE PART OF SUSHI

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.728
&gt;&gt; DOES SHE HAVE AN AGENT OR A
RUSSIAN MOB BOYFRIEND?

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:17.831

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:50.597
"FOR A BEACH SCENE?"

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:50.697
