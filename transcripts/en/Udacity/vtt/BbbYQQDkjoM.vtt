00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.560
How about this parabola? What do you think would be the vertex for it? And try

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.528
and create its graph. Remember, identifying the vertex is only one part of this

00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:12.213
problem. The graph is just as important, and it's up to you to make sure you

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:15.722
get it correct. Take your time on this one, and be sure to check over your

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:20.008
work. This one's a little bit harder. When you think you're ready to compare

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.810
your graph, type in your vertex here and check out the solution video.
