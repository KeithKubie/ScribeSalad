00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.460
JASON TITUS: Hello and welcome.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.890
My name is Jason Titus, and I
lead Google's developer product

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.450
group.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.790
Our mission is to make your
lives easier as developers

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.270
when you build on
Google technologies.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.800
And we are so excited
to be down here.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.330
One of the reasons that our team
came down, beyond this event,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.360
was actually to get a chance
to talk to developers here

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.450
in India.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.830
And we've already got some
great feedback and insights

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.030
from teams like Snapdeal,
Grofers, Inshorts.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.950
And then today, we've
had a great chance

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.670
to talk some developers here.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.170
In fact, I believe we talked
to probably the youngest

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.460
developer in the room here,
Rashid, who has done 10 Android

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.590
apps as a 16-year-old.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.810
And he snuck out of school today
to come and learn a little bit.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.580
So that kind of passion and
excitement around development

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.050
and building apps is the
reason we do what we do.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.290
So I want to talk a bit
about a transformation that's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.560
happening, that India is
really in the center of.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.460
Right now this year, we will
hit 2 billion mobile devices.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.570
And by 2020 it's projected
to hit 3 billion.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.200
And 50% of that growth will
come from India and China.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.540
At the same time as the
number of users is growing,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.750
the number of developers
is growing as well.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.055
And in fact here in India,
we have the highest rate

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:37.190
of developer growth
in the world.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.760
It's projected
that in 2017, India

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.070
will surpass the United States
in the number of developers.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.090
So if you take these two things
combined and you pull back

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.910
a little bit, it
seems clear that many

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.940
of the people who are
in this room tonight

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.020
will be defining what
the experience is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.260
for the next billion
users as they come online.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.100
The opportunity is immense.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.730
Whether you're building apps to
improve health care, education,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.509
or enabling commerce, or
building next generation

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.350
entertainment
experiences, at Google

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.294
we're committed to build
the tools that you'll

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:15.210
need to be successful.

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:19.590
So we're going to talk
about three things

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.830
tonight-- programs
that we're investing in

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.250
to help you be
successful, products

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.270
that help you build your
apps and your business,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.660
and information to help
you execute successfully

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.410
in this market.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.850
First on the program
side, this morning Sundar

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.950
announced Google's commitment
to train 2 million students

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.952
in Android across India
over the next three years.

00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:48.460
And this builds on a partnership
we've had with Udacity

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.580
to create an Android
Nanodegree program.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.450
The Android Nanodegree
program helps

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.140
students go from being
beginners to building

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.380
their first step to
advanced development,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.850
over the course of a few months.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.940
And beyond our
formal curriculum,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.490
we also have our Google
Developer Groups and our Google

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.520
Developer Experts.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.830
I think there's a number of
you in this room tonight that

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.560
are a part of this.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.830
And actually here in India,
we have the largest number

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.705
of Google Developer Group
members of any country.

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:25.690
You guys really raised the
bar for the rest of the world.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.590
So if you're interested
in meeting an in person

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.140
network of other
developers, I encourage

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.480
you to attend one of the
events for the Google Developer

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.520
Group near you.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.890
We've already had 3,000 events
in the last six months alone.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.480
Another important
group of developers

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.220
are developer agencies.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.970
And that's why I'm excited to
announce our Developer Agency

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.920
program.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.085
These agencies build
many of our top apps.

00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:57.710
And so we're putting
together a program

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.530
to give them specialized
training and events,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.580
early access to product,
premium developer support,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.740
as well as increased
opportunities for exposure

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.365
and visibility.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.690
So the goal of this program is
to allow development agencies

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.230
to create top quality apps
and give them the opportunity

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.104
to build on top of
new technologies

00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:28.270
as soon as they're released.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.530
So in addition to
Android training,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.210
things we're doing to build
the developer ecosystem,

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.550
and the work we have with
development agencies,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.600
we want to ensure that the
next generation of startups

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.840
is as successful as it can be.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.810
So I'm very excited to announce
our new Launchpad Accelerator

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.450
program.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.840
We're going to be giving select
startups in India, Indonesia,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.480
and Brazil grant seed funding
as well as close mentorship

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.490
from Google, from
Google Developers,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.370
and Google engineers,
and product managers,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.780
as well as some of the best
mentors from around the world.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.150
We will fly these teams
to Google headquarters

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.930
in California in Silicon Valley,
for them to start a six month

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.620
training program.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.470
We have already selected
our first class,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.650
and we're now looking to see
who our next batch of startups

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.940
will be.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.380
So if you have a great team and
a killer idea, please apply.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.310
So these are just
some of the programs

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.241
that we at Google have to
help you be successful.

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:42.990
Now I'm going to bring
on Francis Ma who's

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.240
going to talk about some of
things on the product side

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.040
to help you build your
apps and your business.
