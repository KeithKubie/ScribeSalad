00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.500
JAMES GRIME: Right.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.400
We're going to talk about
numbers in the news, because

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.890
just recently, the number
17 was in the news.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.240
This is one for Sudoku fans,
because it's just been

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.480
recently proved by a man called
Gary McGuire, he's a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.610
mathematician at University
College in Dublin, has proven

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:25.800
that a Sudoku needs at least
17 clues to solve it.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.960
So, Sudoku, if you don't
know what they are,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.150
they come from Japan.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.450
They were big in the 1980s, but
then, so were many things.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.390
But here is a Sudoku.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.050
It's a 9x9 grid, and the idea is
you fill every row with the

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.240
numbers 1 to 9 without
repeats.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.090
You fill every column
with the numbers 1

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.610
to 9 without repeats.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
And then for extra difficulty,
you fill these little squares,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.670
these 3x3 squares with
the numbers 1

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.530
to 9 without repeats.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.540
And the idea with Sudoku is
they'll give you some clues.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.770
They'll clear most
of this away.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.570
It will look something
like this.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.980
They'll give you some clues,
and they'll ask you to

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.620
complete the Sudoku grid, and
the idea is there should only

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.320
be one way to compete
the Sudoku grid.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.410
If you see them in the
newspapers, the newspapers

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.810
give you about 25 clues to
solve the grid, but what

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.910
Sudoku fans were interested in
was what is the fewest number

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.090
of clues that you need
to solve that grid?

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.160
And the Sudoku fans
tried to find the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.600
fewest numbers you needed.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.930
They found puzzles that had 17
numbers, but they couldn't

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.140
find any puzzles with
16 numbers.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140
If you tried to find puzzles
with 16 numbers, the answer

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.720
you got wasn't unique.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.790
You could get one or two answers
from that puzzle.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.560
So they thought,
maybe 17 is the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.760
smallest number you needed.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.820
And so just at the beginning of
this month, this was proved

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.190
by Gary McGuire, who did a
method which was partly

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.380
mathematics, and partly
using computer power.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.290
Let's talk about how many
Sudokus there are.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.060
Right, if I want to fill a
Sudoku grid like this, the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.980
number of possible Sudoku grids
is, let me write this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.100
down for you.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.350
Let's see, number of grids.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.190
Let's put and S on
the end of that.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.718
Number of Sudoku grids is,
well, in words it's 6,700

00:02:27.718 --> 00:02:28.968
million million million.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.040
Mathematicians write
it like this.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.980
6.7 times 10 to the 21.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.530
So this is the number of Sudoku
grids that there are.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.650
Now, importantly, what they
were saying is they're not

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.060
saying that every Sudoku grid
can be solved with 17 clues.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.620
They are saying that there are
no Sudoku grids that can be

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.900
solved with 16 or fewer clues.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.470
Not uniquely, anyway.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.290
So one way to solve this puzzle
is to take all the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.440
possible Sudoku grids and check
all of them for 16 clue

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.040
starting positions.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.790
And to check if they give
you a unique answer.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.730
That's one way to do it.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.890
It's a brute force
way to do it.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.060
How many ways are there
to pick 16 clues

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.600
from my Sudoku grid?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.300
That number, 16 clues,
I can't spell.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.240
16 clues is around about
33 million billion.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.641
Around about 33 times
10 to the 16.

00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:40.410
Think I've got that.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.320
3.3 times 10 to 16.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.840
Now, this is a massive number.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.450
The problem was the guy you
wrote this out, Gary McGuire.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.150
He estimated that if he used
the method that he already

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.180
had, it would take a computer
around about 300,000 years to

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.595
check every possible Sudoku
grid for every possible 16

00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:02.480
clue starting position.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.230
So he had to make the problem
more simple than that.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.290
This is what he did.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.830
You see, Sudokus--

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.880
what you can do is if I took the
first two rows and swapped

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.579
them over, it would still
be a valid Sudoku grid.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.829
That's allowed, right?

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.200
It's the same, if I took any of
those first three rows and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.440
swapped them over, you would
get a valid Sudoku grid.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.710
The same is true for the
next three rows.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.270
You swap them over, you
get a valid grid.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.340
And the last three rows.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.110
You swap them over, you
get a valid grid.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.170
And these bands as well.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.940
If you take these as bands and
swap the bands over, you get a

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.810
valid grid.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.720
So if you had a valid 16 clue
starting position, it would

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.770
still be a valid 16 clue
starting position when you

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.335
start to swap the rows.

00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:51.900
And what you get is a whole
family of Sudokus.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.020
It's the same for the columns.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.990
It's the same if I rotate the
grid, and it's the same if I

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.980
start to swap the numbers.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.460
If I took all the 3s and swapped
them with all the 5s,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.670
you still get a valid grid.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.170
You get a whole family.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.980
So all you need is one
representative from each

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.920
family of Sudoku grids.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.600
Now, how many of those
are there?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.770
All they need to
do is check one

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.330
representative from each family.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.650
Now, we could also reduce the
number of 16 clues that they

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.380
had to check.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.380
This number.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.230
What you can do, here's
my Sudoku grid again.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.950
Take a look at this.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.980
You see this 7 and 9?

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.220
And down here I've got another
7 and 9 in the same columns.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.480
Now, if I swap the 7s and 9s
over, I get another valid

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.150
Sudoku grid.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.770
Now, I don't want to get
two possible answers

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.480
for my Sudoku puzzle.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.700
So if I want a unique solution,
one of my clues has

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.130
to be one of these
four numbers.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.490
These are unavoidable squares.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.940
So at least one of your clues
has to be from those squares.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.020
So if you can find the
unavoidable squares, that

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.890
reduces the number of 16 clues
you have to check.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.040
That's what they did.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.640
So they were looking for an
unavoidable squares, checking

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.050
for these representatives from
families of Sudoku grid, then

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.590
they started to, by
brute force with a

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.460
computer, analyze them.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.590
It took them seven million
computer hours to do it.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.000
They started in January, 2011.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.300
They finished the project in
December, 2011, and they

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.065
proved that nothing they
checked, you couldn't get a 16

00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:40.520
clue puzzle from all
these Sudoku grids.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.580
We know 17 puzzles exist.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.900
17 clue puzzles exist, so
therefore, they proved it.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.900
17 is the smallest amounts of
squares. it's the fewest clues

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.960
you need to solve a Sudoku
grid uniquely.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.920
And that's the most
important part.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.680
MALE SPEAKER: Scientists and
mathematicians get asked this

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.970
all the time, but if there's
ever an appropriate time to

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.050
ask this, this seems like it.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.620
Surely there are better things
to do with your time.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.020
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.630
Right.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.640
Completely understand.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.300
Completely understand.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.860
Well, for a start we're talking
about it because it's

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.960
a bit of fun, right?

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.360
And people know what Sudoku are,
so they can understand

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.960
the puzzle that I'm trying to
solve here, the problem.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.090
By doing this, the method--

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.080
It's a hard problem.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.860
It's a hard problem.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.840
The methods that they had to
develop to solve this problem

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.610
can be used in other, perhaps
more serious applications.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.210
In other problems
in mathematics.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.560
In other problems in
combinatorics.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.840
And so although it seems like
it's a trivial thing, it

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.450
actually pushes the boundaries
of our knowledge.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.810
So it turns out not to be so.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.090
Do you w hear my Gary
McGuire joke?

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.730
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.120
JAMES GRIME: So this is
my Gary McGuire joke.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.870
Gary McGuire is the guy who
solved this puzzle, right?

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.100
And here's my Gary
McGuire joke.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.510
What did this the Sudoku
say to Gary McGuire?

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.520
You complete me.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.230
That's a reference to
film Jerry Maguire.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.060
Yeah.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.810
It's like a joke.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.070
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.730
JAMES GRIME: It's not much like
one, I'll give you that.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.090
I have to be honest, Sudoku
for me are not my favorite

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.370
type of puzzles because it
is a game of pure logic.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.610
Now, people think mathematicians
are just logic

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.440
machines, like we're robots.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.700
But that isn't what mathematics
is about.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.000
I'm very keen to stress
that this isn't what

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.140
mathematics is about.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.480
It's a much more creative
thing than that.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.400
And so for me, because this is
a game of pure logic that I

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.780
know a computer can do, I
have no interest in it.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.190
But this is very popular with
people, and crosswords

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.010
enthusiasts and Sudoku
enthusiasts, these are very

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.260
popular kinds of puzzles.
