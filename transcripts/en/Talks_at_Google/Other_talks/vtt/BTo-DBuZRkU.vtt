00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
&gt;&gt; Thanks, everyone, for coming.
I'm really excited to introduce our speaker

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.000
this afternoon, Lauren Weber, author of,
"In Cheap We Trust: The story of a misunderstood

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.080
American virtue.”
It seems like this book couldn't have come

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.880
at a better time, as the recession has caused
Americans to reconsider their tendency to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.590
consume rather than save -- to enlarge their
debts instead of tightening the belt.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.330
Lauren begins her book talking about a different
kind of American -- her father -- who kept

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.310
their Connecticut home at 50 degrees during
winters, used hand signals instead of turn

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.080
signals on their car, and taught his children
how to ration toilet paper, although this

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.670
last idea didn't really work out.
Lauren writes that she resented this at first,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.210
but came to understand the virtues her father
had passed down to her.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.480
Last month, she told the New York Times, "I
like the word 'cheap'. I embrace it.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.380
To me, it really means self-determination
and freedom."

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.120
Lauren was a staff reporter at Reuters and
Newsday, and has written for the New York

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.220
Times and the Los Angeles Times.
She currently lives in New York City.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.540
And I got to say, she really practices what
she preaches.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.860
Despite not being a local, Lauren used BART
and Caltrain to get here from the East Bay.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.280
So, no fancy car for her.
After Lauren talks and reads from the book

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.600
a little bit, please feel free to come up
to the mic -- there's one mic I believe -- and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.871
ask her questions.
So please give a warm welcome to Lauren Weber.

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:23.871
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:31.750
Lauren Weber: Thank you. And thanks Katie
for introducing me and for inviting me.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.040
I was telling her when my publicist sent along
the e-mail inviting me to come to Google,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.420
I was like, "Oh, my God, I feel like I've
made it.”

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.730
So, some of you probably do too for being
able to work here and eat that food every

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.940
day.
When I told friends I was coming, they all

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.830
said, "Can you eat in the cafeteria?”
And I will report back that I did.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.200
So, thanks again for having me.
I sense from the composition of the audience

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.660
that cheapness is a topic that resonates more
for men than for women maybe.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:10.890
[laughter] And I was also telling Katie that,
after some of the media stuff that I've done,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.000
including the New York Times -- the interview
with the Frugal Traveler Blog of the New York

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.250
Times -- I have gotten a few, very random
e-mails from men proposing to me.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.820
[laughter] And usually they say -- there have
been three marriage proposals I think -- and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.910
usually they say, "Women keep breaking up
with me, because they call me too cheap.”

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.710
So, they seem to hope that I could, you know,
embrace that part of them.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.260
So I'm always happy to report, to tell them
that I actually do have a boyfriend, and he's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.780
even cheaper than me.
He can't pass a dumpster without climbing

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.770
into it.
So, yeah. I met him when I interviewed him

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.560
for the book.
You know, we're pretty well-matched.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.800
Katie mentioned my dad -- and this is actually
the first audience that I've spoken to that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.060
didn't include at least one person who knew
my father -- and my dad did in fact, keep

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.420
the heat at 50 degrees when I was growing
up in Connecticut.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.880
He is an economist.
He taught economics for 40 years at the Coast

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.730
Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut.
And so, he's an economist in every sense of

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.470
the word -- professionally, and then, in the
fact that he economizes on everything.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.940
He did keep the heat at 50 degrees, and I
would do my homework at the kitchen table

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.599
wearing hats and scarves and with my hands
on the stove after dinner to try to keep warm.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.489
He tried to ration our family's toilet paper,
which fortunately, he couldn't figure out

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.260
a way to monitor it.
So this was long before webcams.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.000
[laughter] And so, he fortunately gave up
on that one.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.710
He does, in fact, use hand signals out the
window of the car rather than using his turning

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.860
signal, because I think he thinks this way,
he preserves the bulb in the light on the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.069
car.
He also insisted on washing all of our dishes

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.260
by hand and he didn't use soap.
He used cold water and no soap.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.180
And eventually we figured this out and realized
this was why the knives and forks were usually

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.040
encrusted with food.
You know, my dad is -- you could call him

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.900
'compulsively cheap'.
So I grew up my whole life trying to figure

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.299
him out.
And, like Katie said, I also complained bitterly

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.009
about it.
My mother did too.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.540
In fact, while I was working on the book,
I interviewed both my parents, and I asked

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.120
my mom, "How did you manage to coexist for
so long with Dad?”

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.270
They're still married 44 years later.
And she said, "I should have divorced him

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.020
a long time ago.”
And it turned out they had had an argument

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.240
about something else that morning.
So that's partly why there was a lot of acrimony

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.999
there.
But she said, "Don't tell that story.

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:45.370
Tell the story of how I once packed all three
of you up," -- I have a brother and a sister

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.449
 -- "and threatened to take you all to a motel,
because the house was so cold.”

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.979
And apparently, she did get us all to get
our homework into our bags and packed some

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.139
clothes for school the next day.
And I think my dad at that point realized

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.289
that the hotel would be more expensive; and
so, the heat went up.

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.469
I did complain about this much of my childhood.
And then, when I got older -- and especially

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:14.889
as I started to support myself -- I realized
that A, I had kind of involuntarily turned

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.259
into my father.
When I moved to Seattle, I moved in with my

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.490
boyfriend there, and I wouldn't let him turn
the heat above sixty degrees.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.930
So I was not quite as extreme, but I was still
a bit of a fascist about the heat.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.589
And I also found myself, you know, walking
30 blocks to save two dollars on the subway

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:37.449
when I moved to New York.
And doing all kinds of weird things to save

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.369
money.
I realized I had kind of turned into my father.

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:44.949
And I also strangely realized that I appreciated
what he had taught me.

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.999
He had given me some important lessons on
how to live within my means and on the value

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.659
of doing that.
And when I was able to sort of take a step

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.379
back from it, I also was able to appreciate
the fact that he is one of the most generous

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:02.030
people I have ever known.
He gives a lot of money to charity as well

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.749
as time.
He's always volunteering for a lot of different

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:08.081
organizations he believes in.
So, he gives money to anybody who needs it.

00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:11.649
I think he has a real sense of his own good
fortune in life.

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:17.520
And he also sent three kids to very expensive,
private universities and never uttered a word

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.439
of complaint.
And, you know, what I came to realize over

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.909
time was that my dad wasn't just cheap in
a crazy way.

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:29.210
He actually really had his priorities in order
and knew what was important to him.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.499
And that he may have like gotten crazy if
you were in the shower for more than three

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.279
minutes.
There would always be a knock on the door.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:40.080
But, you know, he really knew what his values
were.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.550
And I started to really respect that about
him.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.920
And also feel grateful that he taught me how
to live within my means.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.909
So that's kind of the personal angle to the
story.

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:57.309
And then the other angle is that I'm a business
reporter by training -- and I worked for Reuters

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:02.069
for a few years and then for Newsday, the
paper for Long Island -- and I was really

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.800
interested in the macroeconomics of these
issues of spending and saving.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.649
I wanted to understand what it meant that
Americans had such a low savings rate, which

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:12.990
in the last decade or so has been around two
percent.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.289
In 2005, it actually dipped into negative
territory for the first time since the Great

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:20.469
Depression, which means Americans were spending
more than we were earning.

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:25.789
So I wanted to understand what that meant,
what it meant that Americans had so much debt.

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:30.429
We lived in what another historian has called,
"The age of leverage."

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:33.740
And, you know, what the implications of all
that were.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.479
So I kind of brought both the personal side
and my professional interest to writing the

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:41.969
book.
So that's kind of like the background for

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:47.469
why it resonated so much for me.
And then, the moment when the idea for the

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:51.629
book actually came to me, I was sitting on
the subway underneath Brooklyn.

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:55.189
I live in Queens. So I was on the G Train.
Anybody here who's a New Yorker knows -- it

00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:59.969
goes between Brooklyn and Queens.
And I was reading another book.

00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:02.779
It's called "The Progress Paradox," by Gregg
Easterbrook.

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:06.770
It's not a well-known book, but I had seen
it and was interested, because it basically

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12.270
asks a question, "Why if America is the most
affluent nation that's ever existed, Why are

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.860
there such high levels of depression and anxiety
and unhappiness here?”

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.949
And there wasn't anything in particular in
the book that sparked this question, but I

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:24.679
suddenly looked up and thought to myself,
"What happened to thrift in America?”

00:08:24.679 --> 00:08:30.110
It seemed to me that maybe was some connection
between this hypermaterialistic culture that

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:36.620
we live in and these very high rates of unhappiness
and depression.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.020
So that became kind of the animating question
of the book was, "What happened to thrift

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.570
in America?”
You know, it used to be an important American

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.160
value.
And it's a part of our national mythology

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.131
of who we are and who we were.
Ben Franklin and all that.

00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:56.560
-- Did this just go off? Is it still on?
Can everybody still hear me? Okay.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.041
Yeah something just happened to the sound.
Is it back on? Okay. I think it's back on.

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:08.900
-- So yeah. This was once an important American
value and it seemed that it was no longer

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.180
a part of our sense of who we are today.
So the book has a lot of history in it and

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.260
about two-thirds of it is history.
And it sort of follows this question of, "What

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.490
happened to thrift in America?”
And I kind of came up with two different and

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.300
almost contradictory answers.
One part of that is, On some level we actually

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:34.200
were never a thrifty nation to begin with.
It's a myth that we've sustained about ourselves

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.590
for a long time.
For most of our history, Americans were frugal

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.900
because they had to be.
It was a question of necessity much more than

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:48.120
choice.
You know, the economy was terribly unregulated.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.630
It's all based on booms and busts for much
of the 1700s and 1800s.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.950
And so, people had no choice but to live extremely
cheaply.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.610
And this was a time also when any dress you
wore was something that you had stayed up

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.810
until 11 o'clock stitching by candlelight,
or any quart of firewood that you burned was

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.530
wood that you yourself had gone out and cut
down.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:15.250
So people also had a really great appreciation
for the value of the things in their lives.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.610
Now, we live in a world where we sit on chairs.
We have no idea where they came from, or who

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.860
made them.
Most of us eat food that we have no idea where

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.520
it came from.
Maybe not here at Google but.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.380
And you know, so back in those days, people
were deeply connected to the resources that

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.240
they used, and they had no money.
So as a result, they were probably what we

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.380
would consider 'frugal' today, very resourceful,
very

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.380
-- oh, it just went off again I think. There
it is. --

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.710
-- very resourceful, very prudent and cautious
about spending.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:52.620
But, if you look at it in history, any time
Americans had more, that their incomes went

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:58.520
up, or had more access to credit -- and that
was often really the key to it -- they spent.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.980
So, you know, I often say, "Thrift was a virtue
Americans couldn't wait to relinquish.”

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.820
Whether it was installment plans in the 1850's
to buy a sewing machine, or the first credit

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.290
cards in the 1950's.
As soon as Americans had greater access to

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:18.830
cheap money, they took advantage of it.
And you know, as much as we like to think

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.510
of ourselves as having been frugal back then,
often again, it was economic necessity and

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.590
sometimes political necessity.
So like, during the American Revolution, there

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:32.930
were a lot of boycots of British products.
And you know, this is where we get the tea

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.670
party from -- the Boston tea party.
And there was, what I would call, "conspicuous

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.030
frugality" going on back then.
Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.340
all those guys were trying to get Americans
to stop buying imported goods.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.990
And, you know, townspeople would get up together
and sign petitions saying that they would

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.410
never drink British tea.
They called it "poison.”

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.029
They would say that they would only wear homespun
 -- which was coarse textiles made in America

00:11:57.029 --> 00:12:00.690
 -- rather than silks and linens from Britain
and all that.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:06.110
As soon as the Revolution ended, all of that
well-meaning frugality sort of went out the

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:11.100
window, and suddenly everybody wanted Rococo
furniture from France and these British ideals

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.770
of gentility where flirting was practiced
as an art and everybody wanted to have a parlor

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:22.350
with a piano and a tea set -- were very popular.
So thrift has been a virtue Americans have

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:27.320
sort of taken on when it's convenient and
jettisoned when it was no longer necessary.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.110
So that was one of my answers was, We were
never a particularly thrifty nation.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.970
You know, that it was not necessarily -- it
was often more of a virtue that Americans

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.920
admired than aspired to.
And then, the other answer -- which may seem

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:47.520
a little bit contradictory -- is that, we
were kind of frugal in the sense that thrift

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.490
was something that we admired, but then around
the middle of the 20th century, we really

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.730
developed into a consumer society and this
was not just something that happened accidentally.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.950
It was practically an orchestrated effort
after World War II.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:08.050
World War II -- along with being a military
effort -- was also a gigantic stimulus plan.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:13.230
And after the Depression, it was the war that
put people back to work and created a lot

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:18.930
of need for factories and for production and
manufacturing and stuff like that.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:24.320
And even before the war ended, there were
a lot of economists and politicians who were

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.500
very concerned that, once the war was over,
there would be no engine for the economy.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.360
They were really worried that we would plunge
back into a Depression -- which was a very

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.320
reasonable concern.
It was a traumatic event for many Americans.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:45.680
So, in the early 40's, you start to sort of
get this groundswell of public propaganda

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.860
about how, "Once the war's over, we got to
start buying.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.260
Now, we're using all of our metal for shrapnel
 -- for bullets and stuff -- after the war

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.220
is over, it's going to be for a dishwashers.”
And advertisers used that kind of language

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.810
too.
In fact, I think it's not a coincidence that

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:08.760
Scrooge McDuck -- who is Donald Duck's miserly
uncle -- appears in 1947.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:14.010
And I sort of date that as around the time
that frugality went from being a virtue and

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:18.540
something that we looked up to and championed
to being sort of a punch line.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.900
It now became funny when people saved money.
They were miserly rather than frugal.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:30.170
It was no longer a virtue, it was an insult
 -- a punch line, an eccentricity, or a quirk.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:35.350
And, you know, it was all over the culture.
Brides Magazine did a story in -- I think

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.900
it was the late 40's -- saying that newlyweds
should outfit their homes with brand name

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.520
goods, not only because it would make their
houses look better, but because it would keep

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.190
Americans at work.
This idea that it was patriotic to spend and

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.770
that it was your civic duty to be a consumer
became very widespread.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.220
And it's something that I think Americans
have really, deeply internalized.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.990
And when I was a reporter at Newsday, I covered
retail for a few years, so I was always like

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.700
ambushing shoppers in the middle of their
Christmas shopping and like jumping out from

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.910
behind racks of clothes to ask them like,
what they were buying and why.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.540
And I can't even count the number of times
that people would sort of sheepishly laugh

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.760
and tell me they were doing their part to
help the American economy.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.760
It's just an idea that we've now taken in
deeply.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.630
So it was interesting to me to sort of track
the history of that.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:35.130
I'm going to read a couple of -- and one thing
I also want to add is that -- when I started

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.220
working on the book, a friend of mine said
that I should call it, "Thrift: A short history

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.290
of a dying virtue.”
And the more that I talked to people, the

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.650
more convinced I was that it wasn't dying
at all.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.480
In fact, it was alive and well.
And there are still thousands -- and probably

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.580
millions -- of people living frugally by choice.
And you know, because everybody I talked to

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.279
would say, "Oh, you've got to interview my
mother.”

00:15:56.279 --> 00:16:03.430
Or "my brother", or "my boss".
Or "my daughter". Or "my husband", often.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:08.270
And, you know, it was clear that there are
lots and lots of people living this way.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.110
So my feeling is that thrift is alive and
well, it just kind of went underground at

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.600
a certain point.
Like I said, I sort of date that to that postwar

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.360
period when we started getting the message
that we needed to keep shopping, otherwise

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.570
we weren't good Americans.
And of course, September 11th was sort of

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:30.060
the apogee of that idea when both Rudy Guiliani
and George Bush and countless others got up

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.480
and told Americans to go out and spend.
It was the exact opposite message that Americans

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.090
received in World War II, where the whole
idea was to sacrifice.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:44.130
So, I'm going to read a little bit from one
of my historical chapters, and then read a

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.300
little bit from one of the later chapters.
This chapter was one of my favorites to write.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.930
It's called "Cheap Jews and Thrifty Chinese.”
It's all about the ethnic stereotypes of cheapness.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.100
And my family's Jewish, and I always felt
that part of the way that people looked at

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:02.970
my father -- as kind of an eccentric and a
nut and totally cheap -- had something to

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:08.579
do with him being Jewish.
That there was a particular way of combining

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.689
those two qualities in him -- the cheapness
and the Jewishness.

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:18.699
So this was a really fun chapter to research
and then put together.

00:17:18.699 --> 00:17:22.959
And so I'll just read the first couple of
pages of it.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:28.749
[reading] In 1885, a theater group in New
York debuted a new comic play by Frank Eugene

00:17:28.749 --> 00:17:32.950
Chase called, 'A Ready-Made Suit.' The play
revolved around a woman who's charged with

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.440
polygamy after marrying nine men in quick
succession.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.499
During her trial, two Jews described as 'eminent
jobbers in secondhand clothes', appear in

00:17:41.499 --> 00:17:44.970
court to testify.
As one of them explains to the jury, they

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.249
both married the defendant on the same day,
because quote, [in a thick accent] "He thinks

00:17:48.249 --> 00:17:53.340
if we can get one wife between us, that will
be less expensive.”

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.070
The crowd no doubt roared in appreciation
of the joke.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:00.539
They certainly would have understood the subtext.
By this time, the image of the stingy, grasping

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:05.220
Jewish merchant or pawnbroker was a familiar
one in American popular culture -- a staple

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.240
of dime novels, variety shows, humor magazines,
and newspaper editorials.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.399
It's one that remains with us today, hardly
dulled by age or political correctness.

00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:18.200
For instance, there's the popular joke about
how Moses received the Ten Commandments from

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.499
God.
One day God appears to a Babylonian and says,

00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:23.639
"I have a commandment.
I'd like to give it to you.”

00:18:23.639 --> 00:18:27.320
The Babylonian says, "What is it?”
And God says, "Thou shalt not steal.”

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.850
The Babylonian says, "No, thanks.”
So God goes over to an Egyptian and offers

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.899
him the same deal.
When the Egyptian hears what the commandment

00:18:34.899 --> 00:18:38.951
is, he also turns it down.
Then God meets Moses and says, "I have a commandment

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:42.220
for you.”
Moses says, "How much is it going to cost

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.350
me?”
"Nothing," says God.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.090
"Fine" says Moses, "I'll take ten.”
[laughter] It's funny.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.720
There are countless variations on the theme.
Why did the Jews wander in the desert for

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.799
40 years?
Because one of them dropped a nickel.

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:59.259
What's a Jewish dilemma? Free pork.
I think they're funny.

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:05.299
Jews aren't the only ethnic group to have
been branded with the Scarlet Letter, C.

00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:09.159
Go back in history and you'll find a glut
of accusations -- often muffled in humor,

00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:13.369
sometimes loosed with open contempt -- by
one group that its neighbors or adversaries

00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:17.200
are cheap or miserly or obsessed with money
and accumulation.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.299
The English viewed the Scots as hopeless cheapskates,
while the Irish were written off as drunks

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:24.509
and spendthrifts.
The Dutch have a long reputation for being

00:19:24.509 --> 00:19:27.889
tight with cash.
Ben Franklin himself popularized the rhyme,

00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:32.360
"The thrifty maxim of the wary Dutch is to
save all the money they can touch.”

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.210
In America, Yankees -- members of old families
of New England -- were both admired and reviled

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:41.019
for their legendary thrift.
Scandinavians, Germans, and Japanese were

00:19:41.019 --> 00:19:45.360
tagged as parsimonious by American writers.
And Westerners used up a great deal of ink

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.919
describing the frugal ways of Chinese living
in China and abroad.

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:54.929
Why have so many ethnic and national groups
been cast in the role of the world's tightwads?

00:19:54.929 --> 00:19:59.490
The late Harvard psychologist, Gordon Allport
once said that "Stereotypes are projection

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.840
screens for modern man's anxieties," and this
one is no different.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.179
The stereotypes of cheap Jews and thrifty
Chinese -- two of the most enduring examples,

00:20:08.179 --> 00:20:12.179
and the ones I explore in this chapter -- reveal
more about the people broadcasting them than

00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:15.730
they do about the real lives and practices
of Jews and Chinese people.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:20.220
They tell us about the social, political and
economic worries that vexed Americans as they

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:25.059
commiserated over a lost job with friends
or headed off to the mines for work, or spent

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:29.470
their week's earnings at the grocery store.
And they tell us about the complicated emotions

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.549
that hovered under the surface in a free market
economy of winners and losers.

00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:39.710
Emotions like envy, resentment, admiration,
fear, and -- perhaps most of all -- ambivalence.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.619
Ambivalence about the promises of equality
and opportunity and meritocracy that were

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:48.639
advertised as the American dream.
These emotions bobbed up and fixed themselves

00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:53.799
to the waves of immigrants who came to the
United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:58.020
Native-born Americans watched Jews and Chinese
gain a fragile, economic foothold in their

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.679
adopted country and interpreted that success
as a threat to their own property and job

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:06.960
opportunities.
And then, I kind of go on to detail where

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:13.830
both of those two stereotypes kind of originated
from -- which for Jews, it had a lot to do

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:22.150
with being closed out of other fields, like
glass-blowing and metalwork in the Middle

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:27.389
Ages, and being forced into jobs like being
bankers and lenders, because Christians were

00:21:27.389 --> 00:21:30.169
forbidden to do that.
And so, that was sort of the origins of the

00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:33.789
Shylock stereotype.
And then, I kind of traced Shylock as he comes

00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:37.899
to America and gets expressed in a variety
of ways here.

00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:41.830
And then, with the Chinese -- the thrifty
Chinese -- a lot of it had to do with the

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:49.789
Gold Rush, and the waves of immigrants that
came from China to America and had no families

00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:55.450
here to support and often could live on lower
incomes than a lot of the white and native-born

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.590
workers.
So there are a lot of -- there is an amazing

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:04.739
amount of propaganda out there in the 1800s
about how Chinese people eat rats and mice

00:22:04.739 --> 00:22:09.370
and live on rice.
Americans couldn't get the whole like -- that

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.970
there was no giant slab of meat and potatoes
and stuff like that.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:18.830
So there was a lot of talk about Chinese people
eating rats and dogs and stuff like that,

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:24.250
and basically like, living on lower incomes
or living on less -- sort of 'cheap Chinese

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.090
labor' idea.
But these stereotypes are incredibly potent,

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.200
and like I said, I think they stay with us
today.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:35.530
Now, I have never quite been able to square
the historical development of the stereotypes

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:40.489
with the relatives of mine who embody them
so perfectly.

00:22:40.489 --> 00:22:46.179
Like my 90-year-old aunt who can't leave a
restaurant without her bag being full of bread

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:50.419
or bread sticks or something like that.
I'm going to try not to do that.

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:57.330
I'm, of course, tempted to put a lot of your
food into my bag, but I'm not going to.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:03.200
So the first two-thirds of the book or so
is historical and some of it is really chronological

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.690
and some of it is more thematic, like that
chapter I just read from.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:13.440
And then, the last third of the book looks
more at the contemporary issues of cheapness,

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.580
you could say.
One of them really goes into the economics.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.780
Like I said, I was really interested in what
it means that we have such a low savings rate

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.810
in this country, and you know, what the effects
from that are.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:29.100
And I think we're now seeing the effects of
that -- so many people over-leveraged themselves

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.999
in the last few years, partly because the
money was free or it was cheap and easy.

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:41.909
And partly because we just happen -- there
are many reasons to explain our low savings

00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:45.429
rate.
And in fact, in one interview, a TV interviewer

00:23:45.429 --> 00:23:48.480
said to me, "Aren't Americans just fat and
lazy?”

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.600
I actually don't buy that idea.
Yes, I think probably many people could benefit

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.549
from a little more restraint and self-discipline.
But there is a whole context for why Americans

00:23:58.549 --> 00:24:03.049
got into so much trouble, and part of that
had to do with the fact that politicians deregulated

00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:05.940
the financial services industry in the 80's
and 90's.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:11.749
That allowed banks to go through these massive
mergers and take on more risk and develop

00:24:11.749 --> 00:24:16.861
these, you know, exotic new products like
securetizing mortgages and stuff like that.

00:24:16.861 --> 00:24:21.279
Anyway, it all led to just a complete bubble
of cheap credit being out there.

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:27.559
Meanwhile, we had a political administration
that refused to provide any meaningful oversight

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:31.869
of this system.
And two Fed chairmen who ignored any signs

00:24:31.869 --> 00:24:34.929
that we were in the midst of a historical
bubble.

00:24:34.929 --> 00:24:39.139
And so, that's partly how we end up in the
situation that we find ourselves in today.

00:24:39.139 --> 00:24:42.909
It's not just about Americans buying too many
flat screen TVs and lattes.

00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:45.889
You know, I think there's a greater context
for it.

00:24:45.889 --> 00:24:50.489
And in many ways, ordinary people were just
taking their cues from bankers and politicians

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:57.020
who didn't want the party to end.
So I do not think Americans are lazy, profligate

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.200
pigs.
Even though some people -- this particular

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.649
interviewer -- seemed to think that.
I have another chapter on the synthesis between

00:25:05.649 --> 00:25:10.019
cheapness and the environment.
And sort of, using fewer resources and why

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:13.670
people like my dad were green before it became
popular to be green.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:20.539
Although, he now sheepishly says that he had
no idea that there was any other benefit besides

00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:26.129
saving money to all of his compulsive turning
off of lights and stuff.

00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:28.210
Another chapter goes into the psychology of
cheapness.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:33.109
People seem to really like that one, because
I think we all are trying to understand ourselves

00:25:33.109 --> 00:25:37.850
and the people around us.
And the origin of that chapter came when I

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.580
asked my great aunt -- my father's aunt -- who's
a psychologist.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.409
I said to her one day, "Why is Dad so cheap?”
And she said, "Well, Freud would say it has

00:25:46.409 --> 00:25:49.450
something to do with unresolved potty training
issues." [laughter]

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.970
And I said, "That's ridiculous.”
And she said, "Well, it's all about what you

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.210
hold onto and what you let go of." [laughter]
And I was like, "That makes sense.” You

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.440
know?
So that kind of became the basis for that

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.429
chapter.
And then, I looked at, not only what Freud

00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:08.809
and other psychologists said, but also behavioral
economists, who had some really interesting

00:26:08.809 --> 00:26:13.179
 -- one of my favorites was somebody told
me that, "For cheap people, the future just

00:26:13.179 --> 00:26:17.899
feels closer.
Whereas for people who are more 'spendy' they

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:20.710
feel that the future is further away.”
And that made a lot of sense to me.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:25.590
And I think it explains part of the way I
think, you know, when you're cheap, a lot

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.730
of it is an anxiety about what might happen
next.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:33.269
And there's sort of planning for catastrophes.
And so, I think saving money has a lot to

00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:38.660
do with creating some form of security in
the form of a nest egg or something like that.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:43.200
But the chapter I'm going to read from is
called, "Living cheap in the age of mass consumption.”

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.880
Like I said, when I talked about the topic
with strangers, I'd have so many people saying,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.879
"Oh, you know, you've got to talk to so and
so.”

00:26:48.879 --> 00:26:52.080
Or "Interview me.”
And it became clear that lots of people were

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:58.029
living cheaply.
And so, I wanted, in this chapter, to investigate

00:26:58.029 --> 00:27:03.489
some of the ways that people are living frugally
in today's America in the age of mass consumption.

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:07.409
And so, I followed two groups, and then, one
individual person.

00:27:07.409 --> 00:27:12.580
The two groups were -- one was "The Compacters".
I don't know how many people here are familiar

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.299
with The Compact.
It was kind of a movement that started in

00:27:15.299 --> 00:27:20.840
San Francisco in 2005 with eight friends who
just decided for a year they weren't going

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.509
to buy anything new.
They would buy food, they would buy medicine,

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:28.999
but they wouldn't buy clothes or cars or anything
that was new.

00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:32.470
They could shop at thrift stores.
And it led to like, a lot of sharing of stuff,

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.179
you know, borrowing tools from each other.
And it became kind of a big, community-building

00:27:36.179 --> 00:27:39.509
exercise.
And some of them have continued on -- you

00:27:39.509 --> 00:27:44.900
know, four years later -- living this way.
But, when they started out, a reporter from

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.309
the San Francisco Chronical wrote a story
about them.

00:27:47.309 --> 00:27:54.249
And they got hundreds of e-mails and calls
from people who wanted to join their movement,

00:27:54.249 --> 00:27:56.409
you know?
And there was no movement; it was just eight

00:27:56.409 --> 00:28:01.159
friends who decided to do this.
And it showed them that, like I said, there

00:28:01.159 --> 00:28:05.409
are so many people who either were already
living this way or were craving an opportunity

00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:13.590
to find an alternative to a consumer society
that seemed to be sort of going off the rails.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.190
So, I did sort of an in-depth interview with
one of their founders and wrote about that.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:21.080
And then, I also spent a lot of time in New
York with freegans.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.169
Are people here familiar with freegans?
I don't know if you kind of use the same word

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:29.769
out here, but they're basically a band of
anticapitalist, anarchist, dumpster divers.

00:28:29.769 --> 00:28:33.330
And they're people who try to live outside
of the money economy, they say.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:39.570
They dumpster dive for their food; they squat
rather than pay rent or, you know, own homes.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.740
They walk or bike everywhere rather than pay
for transportation.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.660
They generally don't have jobs, although some
of them do.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:51.720
There are varying degrees of it.
But I went out on a lot of trash tours, which

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.479
is how they introduce new people to freegan
ideology -- basically dumpster diving through

00:28:56.479 --> 00:28:59.129
New York City.
There are no dumpsters in New York -- very

00:28:59.129 --> 00:29:02.080
few.
So it basically means like sidewalk, trashpiles

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.200
of supermarkets.
You know, I thought I had been thinking about

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.950
waste and excess and cheapness for a long
time.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:15.710
So I thought I was prepared for what I saw.
But I was shocked by how much perfectly good

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:21.239
stuff we cavalierly throw away in this culture.
We would open supermarket garbage bags and

00:29:21.239 --> 00:29:25.669
find sealed bags of potato chips that hadn't
reached their sell-by date or anything like

00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:30.479
that -- along with a lot of spoiled produce
and stuff like that.

00:29:30.479 --> 00:29:34.070
You have to be pretty selective.
This is why many of them are also vegan, so

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.440
that you don't end up eating dairy or meat
or something that could actually be dangerous

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.649
for you.
So, you know, that was really shocking and

00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:46.390
appalling to me.
And it changed the way I thought about what

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:53.129
we throw out in this culture and how much
of a disposable society this is.

00:29:53.129 --> 00:29:56.340
And then, so there were the freegans.
Those were kind of the two movements I looked

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.029
at.
But then, I was really interested in people

00:29:58.029 --> 00:30:02.749
who are just living this way on their own.
And so, the last person that I wrote about

00:30:02.749 --> 00:30:06.580
 -- and this is the section I'm going to read
 -- is one of those people.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:11.519
[reading] For every person who identifies
with a political or communal form of anticonsumerrism,

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:16.509
there are dozens more who are solo operators.
A common thread runs through the stories of

00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:21.970
these underspenders.
There are people who -- in the time vs. money

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.229
equation into which so much modern life can
be distilled -- choose time.

00:30:26.229 --> 00:30:30.820
Helena Show dropped out of a well-remunerated
career in San Francisco in the mid 1990's.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.570
Her work as a software analyst was making
her sick.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:38.359
She was skinny and depressed, beset by headaches.
She arranged to take a sabbatical and travel

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:41.100
around Europe.
When her three months were up, she stopped

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.049
by her parent's house, sat them down and said,
"I don't want to alarm you, but I'm never

00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:49.220
going to have a career again.”
Helena landed in New Orleans, a good place

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.500
for marginal living.
"I liked being here, where people talk about

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.590
everything except shopping and what they do
for a living," she said.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.210
And I got the general knowledge that there
was a large population of people living on

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.649
the cheap.
From them and from trial and error, she learned

00:31:02.649 --> 00:31:06.369
how to get by on less and less.
She found a job taking tickets at a movie

00:31:06.369 --> 00:31:10.340
theater, and late at night, wove through the
city streets with a garbage bag full of leftover

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.809
popcorn balanced on her handle bars.
That became dinner on some nights.

00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:18.429
Later on, she moved into an old school bus
that sat in a friend's backyard in the Lower

00:31:18.429 --> 00:31:22.029
Ninth Ward.
She slept there for a year, paying about $60

00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:26.049
a month and sharing the bathroom, kitchen,
and living room in the main house.

00:31:26.049 --> 00:31:30.289
She made her own food, listened to music at
bars with no cover charge, and splurged on

00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:34.350
a beer when she wanted to.
Now, she lives in a row of five houses whose

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.479
occupants have an informal, cooperative living
arrangement.

00:31:37.479 --> 00:31:40.820
It's called "the chuck farm.”
They share an enormous backyard where many

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:44.620
of them raise food, and there's a communal
washing machine and dryer to which they all

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.690
contribute money.
"There is an art to this set of skills," Helena

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:52.169
said of cheap living.
We don't often think of it that way.

00:31:52.169 --> 00:31:56.450
We're more apt to view choices like the ones
Helena has made as quirks or eccentricities.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.340
But she's right.
It takes planning, thoughtfulness, and working

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.909
knowledge to live cheaply.
We learn a lot of those skills from the people

00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:05.850
around us.
Helena picked up some of her values when she

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.970
decamped for France after high school and
lived with a single woman and her three children.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:14.029
The woman worked in a grocery store and brought
home all of the shop's bruised vegetables

00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:19.830
from which she cocted amazing meals.
From her, Helena saw the possibilities for

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.080
converting refuse into gold and gleaned the
value of a freezer.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.019
Now, she freezes the excess butter and milk
she buys when they're on sale, and makes stocks

00:32:27.019 --> 00:32:31.389
and pasta sauces in bulk when the ingredients
are cheap.

00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:35.089
All of these activities take time.
It's what economists call 'household production'

00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:38.909
 -- the idea that we can spend time rather
than money to meet our needs.

00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:42.059
Thrifty people are inclined to prefer the
former when they can.

00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:46.649
And in exchange for her labor and her assiduous
attention to resources, someone like Helena

00:32:46.649 --> 00:32:50.779
has more autonomy in her life than most people.
She now works a couple of days a week at a

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:54.850
store in the French Quarter, sometimes fills
in, in an art gallery, and does some gardening

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:58.470
work for her landlord.
But aside from those paying gigs, her time

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.690
is her own.
"I wanted to not be a prisoner of my own existence,"

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.269
she said.
"I realized pretty early on that, Any day

00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:08.309
I was out in the street in the daytime and
not in a job, was a reason to be joyous.”

00:33:08.309 --> 00:33:12.940
In the end, what do all of these disparate
experiments add up to?

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.580
They don't represent a unified challenge to
our consumer-driven society.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.739
They won't topple capitalism, or perhaps even
make a dent in global warming.

00:33:20.739 --> 00:33:25.429
What they suggest though, are new possibilities
of collective sustenance and autonomy.

00:33:25.429 --> 00:33:29.899
In the words of Jeff Ferrell, a sociologist
who wrote a book about his own year-long experiment

00:33:29.899 --> 00:33:34.760
in trash-picking and low-cost living.
Freegans, Compactors, and independent devotees

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.590
of cheap survival are all thinking deeply
about issues like community, sustainability,

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.340
self-determination in the contours of a meaningful
life.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:47.279
They are creating alternatives to a culture
that thrives on store-bought pleasures and

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:50.690
disposable dreams.
They're building worlds based on imagination

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.389
and durability.
So.

00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:56.570
I'll just stop reading there and take questions
if anybody has any.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.830
Thanks.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.100
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:07.710
Q So I have two questions.
The first one's easier.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:12.600
What you think of advertising and its effect
on reducing frugality, because it's in the

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.320
advertiser's interest to make you buy?
And the second one, which is based on when

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:24.510
you said that the psychology of cheapness
is that, Stressed people are more likely to

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.159
save.
And I think it's the opposite.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.900
People who are stressed are more likely to
buy to kind of relieve their stress.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.700
But people who are content have nothing to
buy, you know?

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.100
They're just happy to laze about, read a book
whatever, you know?

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.659
Lauren Weber: Right.
There are many forms of anxiety.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.630
And I think, maybe the cheap people have like
one particular form.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.650
I'm not sure exactly how I would describe
it or explain it.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.650
I think a lot of it is just a sort of fear
of the unknown or fear of the future drives

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:55.090
frugal people -- cheap people -- and it is
that sort of fear that there's a catastrophe

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:57.900
around the corner and you have to be prepared
for it.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.560
In fact, thrift is sort of indirectly related
to hording.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.070
You know, there are some famous examples of
horders whose homes got so filled with crap

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:11.190
that they actually died from it.
There's a famous brother -- the Collyer brothers

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:16.080
in Harlem in New York City in the 1940's -- there
was two brothers living.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:23.080
By the time their house was excavated, the
police found like, 25 old pianos.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:28.930
They found the chassis of a car in the basement.
It was just, anything that they found on the

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:32.170
street they would bring home.
And one of them was finally killed when a

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:35.650
bunch of stuff toppled on him, and he had
been taking care of his brother who then died

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:40.110
of neglect.
And hording.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:43.660
Psychologists have studied a lot on hording.
Very few people -- very few researchers have

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:49.370
studied cheapness, thrift, you know, frugality.
It's not that interesting to consumer researchers,

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.210
but it should be.
A lot of people have studied why we buy.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:58.010
Very few people have studied why we don't
buy.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.660
There's a lot of studies on hording.
And a lot of it is based on this idea that

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.290
you save every piece of string because you
might need it some day.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:07.130
It's just in case.
There's that kind of 'just in case' anxiety,

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.480
which I think is related to frugal people,
cheap people.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.620
And then, the other question on advertising.
You know, I think there's too much of it.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:22.710
But I also think like, human beings are -- we're
not dopes and we're not dupes.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:28.670
I think, just because you see an advertisement
doesn't mean that we're sort of programmed

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:38.100
to immediately go out and buy that thing.
I do think we should be trained to be better

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:42.040
consumers of advertising and consumers of
stuff.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.600
And we are susceptible.
I mean, I'm susceptible too -- although I

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.950
would be hard pressed to think about what.
You know, I mean, we like brand names.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:53.430
My sister and I are always calling each other,
bragging about what we found at the Salvation

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:57.680
Army.
So, you know, on the one hand, I do think

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.250
that stuff works and it's effective in a way
that I don't like.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:04.440
On the other hand, I think human beings -- we're
not robots, you know.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:11.660
We are able to resist those messages.
I wish there was more education about resisting

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.120
those messages, though.
And I hope my book is a part of that -- sort

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.730
of being able to question the imperatives
of living in a consumer society.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:25.220
Q Thanks very much for being here.
In this audience, I am prepared to admit that

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.310
I am really a cheap person.
But, I think ordinarily, I kind of keep it

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:34.120
to myself.
If I talk to myself about it, I would say,

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.830
"I'm proud of being cheap.
I'm proud of having the value of wanting to

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:42.200
get value out of things.”
But on the other hand, I noticed that I don't

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.330
talk to my friends much about it.
So I'm sort of curious to know what you discovered

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:48.680
about the people that you interviewed -- how
they perceived themselves.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.460
Are they proud of who they are?
Or are they proud of who they are, but they

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.130
keep it to themselves?
Any thoughts along those lines?

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.501
Lauren Weber: Right. Yeah.
I mean, all different reactions to that.

00:37:57.501 --> 00:38:02.420
In fact, I'll just briefly read my -- the
first paragraph of the book is about that.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:08.240
It says, Cheap suit, cheap date, cheap shot
 -- it's a dirty word rife with negative associations.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.340
We hear the word 'cheap', and we think "miser,
whore, Wal-Mart, made in China, something

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.330
that's going to fall apart.”
It's an insult almost any way you look at

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.520
it.
An 84-year-old man heard about my interest

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.620
in cheapness and got so excited that he offered
himself up for an interview about his frugal

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.740
ways.
At the end of our conversation, he said sheepishly,

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.840
"Please don't use my name.
I don't want people to think I'm cheap.”

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.620
[laughter]
You know, and I did get that a lot from people

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.060
I interviewed who were uncomfortable with
the word "cheap.”

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.290
You know, they prefer "frugal" or "thrifty.”
Which is fine.

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:42.720
I'm probably -- before I started writing this
book would have said a similar thing, but

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.000
in the course of writing it, I started to
embrace it.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.020
And I felt like the word itself captured some
of that ambivalence and conflict we have about

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.720
spending and saving.
I think people often use the word 'cheap'

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.570
to project.
Like my dad -- a lot of the things he does,

00:38:55.570 --> 00:39:00.710
you could just call frugal, or whatever.
So what if he likes to buy gas at the cheapest

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.070
gas station.
But he's always been called 'cheap', and I

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:09.820
think people use it as an insult partly to
project to him their own discomfort with their

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:16.010
spending or saving habits, you know?
His brother has like no money to his name

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:20.240
and could learn a thing or two from my father,
and yet is always calling my dad a cheap bastard.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:26.650
Yet, I think it has as much to do with comforting
himself to insult my father than about anything

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.750
my dad does.
So, you know, I kind of wanted to reclaim

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:30.750
the word 'cheap'.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:31.750
Q I like that.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.740
Lauren Weber: Sure.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.750
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:44.610
Q Hi. I have a really simple question.
Is there a point where when you were doing

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:48.730
the book that you went, "This cheapness is
really destructive rather than a virtue?”

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.680
Lauren Weber: Yeah. Well, many points.
I mean, in my own life.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:56.180
I had a terrible habit for a long time of
like, not eating lunch if I had forgotten

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.380
to make myself lunch.
And then, at the end of the day, I'd have

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.590
headaches.
You know, it was because I was agonizing about

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.050
the idea of what -- spending five dollars
on a sandwich.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.130
That's not really doing me any good.
Finally a friend of mine said, "Do you think

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:11.160
you don't deserve to eat?”
And I got a little bit better about it there.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.570
So it can become very compulsive, not wanting
to spend money.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:18.750
But there's one moment that I wrote about
in the book.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:24.270
While I was writing -- I've always been very
frugal, but living on a writer's income, I

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:28.860
had an advance, but it wasn't particularly
large at all and I went through it fairly

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.950
quickly.
And then, I was living on my savings.

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:33.291
And so, I found all kinds of new ways to save
money.

00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:38.620
I started making my own laundry detergent
and, you know, friends would want to go out

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.330
and eat and I'd say, "Why don't I make a picnic?”
You know?

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.910
Because it was just cheaper to make food and
bring it for both of us.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:49.860
But there was a moment where I was trying
to save money by eating some of the old food

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:55.640
I had in my pantry and I had this can of clams
that I'd had for like five or six years or

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.910
something.
And I decided to make like a clam sauce. So

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:02.440
I opened them.
I had the garlic simmering on the stove and

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:08.940
I opened the clams and they were kind of greenish
blue and they smelled funny, but they smelled

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.230
like cockry.
They didn't smell like foul.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.420
And I ended up -- I went back and forth -- and
I ended up making the clam sauce.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.370
And I was sitting there eating it while I
had my laptop open.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:22.020
And I was looking up the symptoms of botulism.
[laughter] And I thought, "This is ridiculous.”

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:27.760
And so, I eventually did throw out the clam
sauce, but only after eating it.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.450
-- This just went off again. Oh, now it's
on.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:35.320
-- Okay so, you know, that's not good.
You know, if you don't go to the doctor because

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.010
you don't want to spend the money, that's
not good.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:40.800
And then, we probably all have the friend
who never pays their fair share at dinner.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.950
That's not the kind of cheap I like.
I like my dad's version of cheapness which

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:53.060
is really, personal austerity and public generosity.
He's very generous to anybody who needs it

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.600
or needs his help, but with himself, he's
monk like.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:02.640
Q Hi. My whole family's three quarters of
the way through your book.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:08.430
I read a couple chapters and then, when I'm
not looking, my wife steals it and reads it.

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:12.560
It's great so far.
I have a question around the connection between

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:16.910
the delay in gratification and the lack of
being cheap.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:21.530
My sort of theory is that people -- if they
have 20 bucks in their pocket and they're

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:25.260
kind of hungry, then they're going to spend
it, because they can't delay the gratification.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:30.930
And like, I know Richard Bach, I think, talks
about the "latte factor" -- that this little

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:35.270
thing you spend a couple bucks on lattes a
couple times a day, that adds up to thousands

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:39.030
of dollars by the end of the year.
So I was just wondering if you saw that threatening

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:43.660
your research about just people back in the
olden days took a long time to knit a coat

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.760
or to walk into town to even buy the coat.
So they wouldn't do it.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.650
But now, you can hop on Google and buy things
instantaneously.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.970
So this lack of delay of gratification.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.830
Lauren Weber: Yeah, that's true.
I mean, there are so many opportunities for

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.960
instant gratification everywhere.
And I think there's a lot of research now

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:06.610
being done on self-control as like a childhood
quality, or just a quality that can help lead

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.190
to success.
And that stuff is really interesting, because

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:16.290
what do you do when we live in a society where
everything is so accessible to us?

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:22.550
You know, whether it's alcohol or spending
 -- This just went off again -- alcohol or

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.730
spending or pornography or whatever.
It's all right there.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:32.530
And there's a famous experiment from the 1960s
that a psychologist at Stanford did.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:37.350
It's called the Marshmallow Experiment.
You know about it, yeah.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:42.620
And it's in the book, where he gave a bunch
of two-year-olds, I think, a marshmallow and

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:47.060
said that if they could hold off 20 minutes,
they would get a second marshmallow.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.480
And some of the kids just ate their marshmallow
immediately and couldn't hold off.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.340
And some of them actually did wait and received
their second marshmallow.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.650
It's really funny.
They waited by like singing themselves songs

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.820
or like trying to take a nap.
Very cute to me to think about these two-year-olds

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.700
trying to distract themselves from the marshmallow.
And then, they followed these kids.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:10.770
And it turned out that the kids who were able
to exercise self-control did much better in

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:13.050
life.
They had higher SAT scores, they were much

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:20.670
better adjusted and stuff.
So, you know, it's interesting that many of

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:26.590
the kinds of addictions -- we as a society
can generally agree to look down on them -- drug

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:30.760
abuse, drug addiction, alcoholism, whatever.
We can mostly agree that those are bad things.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.220
Shopping is one of the ones that we can't
agree is a bad thing.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:39.140
We -- actually many people think that's a
 -- there are a lot of interests who have

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:43.460
something at stake in believing that having
self-control when it comes to spending money

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:50.030
is not necessarily good for us as a society.
So I think that's one of those areas again,

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:54.640
where we have a lot of ambivalence and conflicted
feelings and stuff. Yeah.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:00.280
But, you know, I got the message from my father
that he judged a person's character by how

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.380
well they could deny themselves what they
wanted.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.700
Which is partly why my sister and I, who are
very similar, are close to my dad.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.230
And my brother, who is much more of a spendthrift
 -- he and my father have a difficult relationship.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.710
Because my dad just, you know, doesn't have
as much respect for somebody who gratifies

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.770
themselves instantly. Hi.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:24.610
Q Hi. Glad to have you here.
Do you have any estimates about like, what

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:30.870
percentage of the population by any definition
would cheap people consist?

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:38.970
And would it make sense actually for like
big marketing firms to sort of target products

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.930
for them?
Or is this like just a fringe group?

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.610
Lauren Weber: Right well.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.370
Q Just not significant?

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:50.670
Lauren Weber: It's definitely not fringy.
There's, as I said, very few studies on people

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:53.400
who don't buy.
But one of the few that there is, is called

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.510
the Tightwad Spendthrift Scale.
And it was developed by three behavioral economists

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:03.100
at Carnegie Mellon.
And they surveyed 13,000 people and found

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.840
that about 24 percent were tightwads, you
know, cheap.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:12.590
And 15 percent were spendthrifts.
Now, it's not a great sample, because almost

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:17.870
everybody responded to a survey that was on
the New York Times website.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:21.800
And there are correllations between levels
of education and frugality.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.210
You know, the better educated you are, the
more frugal you are likely to be.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:30.620
When they did the same experiment at a shopping
mall, they kind of had the opposite numbers.

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:36.340
So, you know, it's hard to get a read on exactly
how many 'cheap' people are out there -- self-described

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:42.700
or otherwise.
But there have been stories occasionally on

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:47.131
companies that try to target cheap people.
And, you know, there's a lot of them out there.

00:46:47.131 --> 00:46:51.350
Right now, Sax Fifth Avenue -- I don't know
if you have Sax out on the West Coast, but

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:56.840
they have this whole like, ad campaign going
on right now about 'value' and how Sax offers

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.750
value.
You know, a couple years ago, their ads were

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.300
for $5,000 handbags.
Now, it's saying like, "You need that perfect

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:07.990
little black suit, and it's a good deal if
it's good quality." and all that.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:13.590
And in Germany -- where are you from? Okay.
In Germany, I have a friend who's German who

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:17.390
told me about an ad campaign for a retailer
there.

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:23.540
And the ad campaign was called Guisaskiel,
which means 'cheap is cool.' So some retailers

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.820
have tried to sort of co-opt this idea.
I'm not a big fan of that approach.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:32.330
I'd rather cheap people stayed -- I'm not
uncorrupted.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:34.330
The boots that I'm wearing right now cost
$350.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:42.020
But, you know, I would like to not see cheapness
be co-opted and exploited as a marketing opportunity.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:46.980
So.
Any other questions?

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:53.480
Q I don't really know where the question is
in here, but I might find it.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.760
But, you were talking about delayed gratification
and this gentleman was as well.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:02.570
It seems like there's a real joy in delayed
gratification when you get the gratification

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:07.290
which is much bigger than the joy that you
might get by getting something instantly.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:11.190
And it really resonated with me when you talked
about you and your sister bragging in the

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:17.020
phone about the brand name stuff that you
got at the Goodwill. Do you find that that's

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:25.490
sort of a common thread in people who do delay
gratification -- that the joy of finally getting

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:29.490
it, or getting it after having waited an appropriate
amount of time is bigger than just going out

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:30.490
and buying it?

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:32.410
Lauren Weber: Yeah. Well, I find that for
myself for sure.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:39.620
I mean, a lot of the interviews I did, didn't
get into like the real, sort of, psychological

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.770
workings and stuff.
And people often have a hard time articulating

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:45.290
that stuff anyway.
But, you know, my sister said -- she's like

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:49.930
me, and she's a professor.
And when she has something she needs to do

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:54.000
that she's dreading, she'll usually like say,
"I'll treat myself to a cookie when I'm done

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.760
writing my syllabus.” Or whatever.
And it's just -- you know, a lot of people

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.940
would just go out and get themselves a cookie
if they want it.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.170
But to her, it's like she just thinks about
like, What kind of cookie?

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:05.240
And What bakery? And everything.
And I feel that way too.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:10.770
I mean, I love great food, and I like to go
out to a nice restaurant, now and then, and

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.450
spend a lot of money.
But, you know, if I did that three nights

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:17.520
a week, I don't think I'd enjoy it nearly
as much as doing it twice a year.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:23.360
So, I think that is a part of like, savoring
and experience -- when you become inured to

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.200
it if you treat yourself in those ways too
often.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.860
That's my take.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:39.960
Q I have a two-part question.
One is, Do you think the trend is going to

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.460
shift now, because, you know, of the recessionary
times?

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:47.030
And two, What do you think about government
spending?

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:51.740
Like, do you apply these same sort of values
to politicians, government, right?

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.870
Countries, what have you.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:55.880
Lauren Weber: Well, government spending.
That question comes up, because, you know,

00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:01.760
we now are more in debt than we've ever been.
I think it's a very different thing.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.880
The government -- I am a Keynesian at heart.
You know, I believe that the government should

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.630
prime the pump when necessary.
The government has many more levers to deal

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:13.680
with debt than individuals do.
The government can go into debt, but then

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.990
it can use interest rates, or tax policy,
or trade policy to mitigate the effects of

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:22.300
that.
When individuals go into debt, they have very

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:27.950
few options besides paying it off somehow,
by hook and by crook, or you know, declaring

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:32.050
bankruptcy.
So, I'd rather see the government spend -- you

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:35.980
know, I think the answer to our current problems
is not to tell ordinary people to go out and

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:41.050
charge up their credit cards -- I'd rather
see the government take on debt than individuals.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:42.790
And then, the other question -- oh.
Where is it going? Yeah.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:47.030
I mean, a lot of people are cutting back now.
It's both anecdotal and aggregate.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.040
You hear about people canceling their cable
subscriptions or gym memberships.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.830
You know, it's not anything like it was during
the Great Depression.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:58.230
We're not at that point yet.
And it's also an aggregate evidence.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:01.750
The savings rate has gone up a lot in the
last few months or so.

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:04.800
I think it's temporary.
You know, if you look -- there are a lot of

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.720
economists who are out there saying, "This
is a seismic shift in the American consumer.”

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.370
You know, "This is going to be permanent -- a
long-term thing.”

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:18.510
But if you look at the history, any time there's
been a crisis, human beings are very adaptable

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.740
and resilient.
We know how to cut back when we need to.

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:26.290
And then, usually as soon as the crisis passes,
consumer spending goes right back up to where

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.610
it was.
And actually goes higher.

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:30.860
You know, we reset our appetites a notch or
two higher than what it was.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.700
You know, I mean, in 2001, after 9/11 and
everything, in a recession, there was a lot

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.580
of talk about, you know, "the new earnestness.”
And irony was how.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.570
And people were going to spend less and be
more family-centered.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:48.380
Well, you know, a few years later, it was
like, Hummers on the road and all that stuff.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.540
So, yeah.
I think we'll go back to the way it was before.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.180
The one thing that I think is different this
time around is the environment.

00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:00.010
I think that is making people rethink the
way we consume in a different way.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:03.590
So that could lead to more permanent changes
on an individual basis.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:08.110
[pause] All done?

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:17.809
&gt;&gt; If there are no more questions, let's give
Lauren a big round of applause.

00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:18.260
&gt;&gt; [clapping]
