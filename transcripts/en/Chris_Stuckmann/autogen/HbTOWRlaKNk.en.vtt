one of those films that as I watched it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
one of those films that as I watched it
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.520
one of those films that as I watched it
I kept seeing what it could have been

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
I kept seeing what it could have been
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.789
I kept seeing what it could have been
and they just didn't care to take it to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
and they just didn't care to take it to
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.310
and they just didn't care to take it to
that level there are so many scenes

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
that level there are so many scenes
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.890
that level there are so many scenes
where someone looks through a hall weep

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
where someone looks through a hall weep
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020
where someone looks through a hall weep
and to the hall what do you think's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
and to the hall what do you think's
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.520
and to the hall what do you think's
gonna happen when we pan back to them of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
gonna happen when we pan back to them of
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920
gonna happen when we pan back to them of
course like it's just a bunch of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
course like it's just a bunch of
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230
course like it's just a bunch of
sequences like that there are no

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
sequences like that there are no
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.260
sequences like that there are no
frightening jump scares there's tons of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
frightening jump scares there's tons of
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.480
frightening jump scares there's tons of
them but you can see them coming from a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
them but you can see them coming from a
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.090
them but you can see them coming from a
mile away

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100
 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.859
beyond that I think the worst offense

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
beyond that I think the worst offense
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289
beyond that I think the worst offense
that the nun has to it is that it feels

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
that the nun has to it is that it feels
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.709
that the nun has to it is that it feels
almost story less yes we have these

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719
almost story less yes we have these
 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.020
almost story less yes we have these
characters going to investigate some

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
characters going to investigate some
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.179
characters going to investigate some
evil stuff that's happening there's a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
evil stuff that's happening there's a
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.419
evil stuff that's happening there's a
pretty cool opening scene but the film

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429
pretty cool opening scene but the film
 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.849
pretty cool opening scene but the film
feels so narrative lease light that I

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859
feels so narrative lease light that I
 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.770
feels so narrative lease light that I
just couldn't get invested in the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
just couldn't get invested in the
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.099
just couldn't get invested in the
characters and since the nun is why most

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109
characters and since the nun is why most
 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.370
characters and since the nun is why most
of us are there to see this this demon

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380
of us are there to see this this demon
 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.779
of us are there to see this this demon
she's actually not in the film that much

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
she's actually not in the film that much
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.819
she's actually not in the film that much
and so that was also very disappointing

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829
and so that was also very disappointing
 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.550
and so that was also very disappointing
her appearances were highlights but

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
her appearances were highlights but
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860
her appearances were highlights but
they're so few and far between that I'm

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
they're so few and far between that I'm
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.140
they're so few and far between that I'm
just waiting for random things to pop

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
just waiting for random things to pop
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.690
just waiting for random things to pop
out because that's all this film really

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
out because that's all this film really
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.600
out because that's all this film really
does there are so many scare scenes that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610
does there are so many scare scenes that
 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.940
does there are so many scare scenes that
are entirely about the demon messing

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
are entirely about the demon messing
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.190
are entirely about the demon messing
with the main characters she locks the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
with the main characters she locks the
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.000
with the main characters she locks the
priest underground somehow in a coffin

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
priest underground somehow in a coffin
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.710
priest underground somehow in a coffin
and he's trapped there for a while until

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
and he's trapped there for a while until
 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.710
and he's trapped there for a while until
he has the means to communicate to the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720
he has the means to communicate to the
 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.900
he has the means to communicate to the
other woman and she comes in and she's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
other woman and she comes in and she's
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.910
other woman and she comes in and she's
like oh my god you're underground if

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
like oh my god you're underground if
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.309
like oh my god you're underground if
what is the goal here like why is the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
what is the goal here like why is the
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.629
what is the goal here like why is the
demon locking him in a coffin

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639
demon locking him in a coffin
 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.160
demon locking him in a coffin
underground so we can have like this

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
underground so we can have like this
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.960
underground so we can have like this
claustrophobic sequence or is she

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
claustrophobic sequence or is she
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.280
claustrophobic sequence or is she
actually trying to kill the guy because

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
actually trying to kill the guy because
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.930
actually trying to kill the guy because
if she was trying to kill him then the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
if she was trying to kill him then the
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.059
if she was trying to kill him then the
demon would find a way to remove the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069
demon would find a way to remove the
 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.890
demon would find a way to remove the
Bell that he's pulling on a string

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
Bell that he's pulling on a string
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.240
Bell that he's pulling on a string
that's in the coffin that lets people

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
that's in the coffin that lets people
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.699
that's in the coffin that lets people
know he's buried down there there are so

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
know he's buried down there there are so
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.460
know he's buried down there there are so
many scenes that are just the demon

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470
many scenes that are just the demon
 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.800
many scenes that are just the demon
pulling really elaborate pranks and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
pulling really elaborate pranks and
 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.170
pulling really elaborate pranks and
that's what it comes off as as you watch

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
that's what it comes off as as you watch
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.789
that's what it comes off as as you watch
the film because they don't lead to

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799
the film because they don't lead to
 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.979
the film because they don't lead to
anything story-wise of course there's

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989
anything story-wise of course there's
 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.509
anything story-wise of course there's
the backstory that someone reads about

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519
the backstory that someone reads about
 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.039
the backstory that someone reads about
in a book in which we learned the

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049
in a book in which we learned the
 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.659
in a book in which we learned the
demon's name even though if we had seen

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669
demon's name even though if we had seen
 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.339
demon's name even though if we had seen
the other conjuring films we would have

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349
the other conjuring films we would have
 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.009
the other conjuring films we would have
heard it a few times before and it's

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019
heard it a few times before and it's
 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.170
heard it a few times before and it's
just it follows all of those cliches

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
just it follows all of those cliches
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.449
just it follows all of those cliches
we've seen a thousand times in these

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
we've seen a thousand times in these
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.190
we've seen a thousand times in these
films and it just it boggles my mind

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200
films and it just it boggles my mind
 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.620
films and it just it boggles my mind
that a film that could come from

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
that a film that could come from
 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.170
that a film that could come from
something as good as the conjuring films

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
something as good as the conjuring films
 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.970
something as good as the conjuring films
it's just this rote throwaway movie with
