story in the blank decade it is getting
 

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.970 align:start position:0%
story in the blank decade it is getting
a<00:19:24.299><c> little</c><00:19:24.450><c> old</c><00:19:24.809><c> like</c><00:19:25.140><c> you</c><00:19:25.289><c> really</c><00:19:25.559><c> really</c><00:19:25.860><c> have</c>

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
a little old like you really really have
 

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
a little old like you really really have
to<00:19:26.220><c> put</c><00:19:26.429><c> a</c><00:19:26.460><c> different</c><00:19:26.669><c> spin</c><00:19:26.909><c> on</c><00:19:27.120><c> it</c><00:19:27.890><c> which</c><00:19:28.890><c> I</c>

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.010 align:start position:0%
to put a different spin on it which I
 

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
to put a different spin on it which I
think<00:19:29.070><c> people</c><00:19:29.429><c> can</c><00:19:29.549><c> do</c><00:19:29.730><c> and</c><00:19:29.940><c> are</c><00:19:30.210><c> doing</c><00:19:30.240><c> but</c>

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:30.690 align:start position:0%
think people can do and are doing but
 

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.350 align:start position:0%
think people can do and are doing but
we're<00:19:30.840><c> seeing</c><00:19:31.020><c> a</c><00:19:31.230><c> lot</c><00:19:31.409><c> of</c><00:19:31.760><c> kind</c><00:19:32.760><c> of</c><00:19:32.850><c> just</c><00:19:33.030><c> ooh</c>

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a lot of kind of just ooh
 

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
