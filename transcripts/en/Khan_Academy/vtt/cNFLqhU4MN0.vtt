00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.760
After one of the previous
banking videos, I got a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.530
comment: "If everyone puts gold
in the banks, what can

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.330
they used to transact, or to
buy food, or to pay for

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.670
services, et cetera?" And that
is an excellent segue into the

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.510
notion of a bank note.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.030
You've probably heard the word
before, maybe in some you

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.620
Charles Dickens novel or
something, but we're going to

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.220
find out in this video it's
actually a much more familiar

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.670
concept than you ever realized,
and you probably

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.530
have some of these bank notes
in your wallet as we speak.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.880
Let's go back to our example.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.990
I have the Bank of Sal.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.360
I use 100 gold pieces.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.030
That's my equity.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.280
Let me draw that.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.420
And I use that to build
a building.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.190
So the 100 gold pieces actually
go to the builders

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.980
and they're from out of town,
so they're not going to

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.410
deposit it back with me.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.760
So that's my building.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.410
I don't know if you
can see that.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.710
It's a little picture
of a building.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.390
And all of the villagers in my
city, they come and deposit

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.150
their gold with me, because
my building looks

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.920
very solid and safe.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.450
It's safer than their
mattresses, so they then

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.830
deposit 1,000 gold
pieces with me.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.150
For the liability side of my
balance sheet, I could say

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.360
1,000 gold pieces.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.610
And on my asset side, I actually
get the gold pieces.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.860
I should have done
that in yellow.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.360
So it's actually sitting
in my vaults.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.180
Now the question was, if all
of the villagers put all of

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.610
their gold into my vaults,
what can they use to

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.660
transact every day?

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.610
The way I do it right now--
this side is my assets and

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.990
these are my liabilities,
right?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.620
I owe them 1,000 gold pieces
that they can come and get at

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.470
any moment.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.480
And this could kind of be viewed
as a checking deposit.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.530
I'll go into that in a second.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.420
I'll probably go into that
in the next video.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.010
But if all of their 1,000 gold
pieces are sitting right here

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.080
on the asset side, or at least
in my vault, what can they use

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.450
to transact?

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.030
Well, the solution is, I say,
hey, instead of taking some of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.530
your gold out and using that
as essentially money, why

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.700
don't I give you a note, a
note that says you put X

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.950
amount of gold into my vault.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:52.180
So, for example, for each
one gold piece, I will

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.070
issue a bank note.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.915
So let's say I'll say one gold
piece bank note outstanding.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.770
And then I hand you a slip of
paper, and that slip of

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.340
paper-- and this might start to
look a little familiar to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.640
you-- says it looks
about this shape.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.890
It has a nice picture of Sal
in the middle, because it's

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.950
the Bank of Sal, and it is
denominated as one gold piece.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.390
And now you gave me that gold
piece and you get this green

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.370
piece of paper that only I can
print and no one else has the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.810
sophistication to do something
this fancy.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.670
Maybe I use some colors here and
I sign it Sal and I do all

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.790
sorts of stuff that makes it
really hard to forge so that

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.800
no one else can-- I put
some holograms on it.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.780
Who knows what I do to it, but
no one else can forge it.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.550
So this is essentially a piece
of paper that I hand you that

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.670
says, you know what?

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.690
Anyone who holds this piece of
paper can go back to the Bank

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.410
of Sal and get back
a gold piece.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.390
Then since everyone in the
village, they trust that the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.580
Bank of Sal will always be
willing to exchange one of

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.519
these slips of paper for a gold
piece, instead of using a

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.420
gold piece to buy something,
why don't you just use this

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.850
slip of paper?

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.390
And even more, for one gold
piece, you don't want to just

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.260
have a stack of one gold piece
pieces of paper around.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.740
Maybe if you gave me five gold
pieces-- I'll do that in

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:41.460
another color-- that rectangle
is much larger than it should

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.920
be relative to 1,000, but I
think you get the point-- then

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.560
I'll have a liability here that
says five gold pieces

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.220
bank note outstanding.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.660
I'll call it b-note
outstanding.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.690
And I'll issue a-- I think
you have guessed it.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.150
Maybe I'll do it in different
colors to show you that these

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.730
bank notes can come in different
colors, but once

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.490
again, I'll put a famous person
there maybe, and I'll

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.430
make it really hard to forge,
and I'll put holograms on it,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.070
but it'll be denominated as a
five gold-piece bank note.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.775
And now, if you were one of
the villagers, you gave me

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:23.460
your gold pieces, now not only
is your gold safe, you have

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.800
these pieces of paper that are
very hard to forge, and that's

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.010
a key issue there, because if
they were easy to forge, then

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.330
someone maybe completely
unaffiliated with this

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.520
trustworthy bank, completely
unaffiliated with Sal, could

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.350
go out and print these things.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.480
So you don't want
that to happen.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.680
So we're assuming that you
can't forge this thing.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.570
And now not only is your gold
safe, but you have something

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.400
that you can transact with
that's frankly a

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.610
lot easier than gold.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.390
I mean, I could even have a
denomination that's-- it could

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.140
be a 500 gold piece.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.880
So if someone gave me 500 gold
pieces, I could give a 500

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.280
gold-piece bank note out.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.060
That'd be my liability, right?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.570
Because I know that at some
point, someone might give me

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.900
back that 500 gold-piece bank
note, and I'll have to give

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.270
them 500 pieces of gold, so
that's why it's a liability.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.440
And maybe that piece of
currency is orange.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.510
And now this is super useful.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.360
Now my bank-- we've done all of
the other things, how the

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.350
bank increases the money
supply, and fractional

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.910
lending, and how the money
supply adjusts for the total

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.260
production and wealth creation
in the economy, but now we've

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.070
found another useful thing that
a bank can do, is that

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.350
besides securing your gold, it's
actually providing a unit

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.390
of exchange that's frankly
a lot easier to

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.130
deal with than gold.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.350
I mean, could you imagine
lugging around and counting

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.870
and verifying 500 gold
pieces every time you

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.960
had to spend it?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.180
Or everyone would have to
have scales, et cetera.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.890
Now people can just count there,
and as you see, this is

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.200
money or this is cash.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.700
You might be experiencing some
form of dissonance in your

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.880
head because right when I drew
that, you were like, wait,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.180
Sal, that looks a lot
like a dollar bill.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.420
And that's true because a
dollar bill is a Federal

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.190
Reserve bank note.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.820
It is a bank notes from the U.S.
that-- there was a time,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.160
and this was a time before
central banks and especially

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.200
if you think about colonial
times, you had banks all over

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.720
the colonies, and they would
actually issue their own bank

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.240
note, so you didn't have
one uniform currency.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.955
So one bank note might
look like that and

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:38.110
have Bank of Sal.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.080
Another bank note might have
Bank of-- I don't know-- Bank

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.120
of George Bush or something, and
people would kind of have

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.560
to have exchanges between them
to realize which banks are

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.940
good for what.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.000
Now we're not as familiar with
the term bank note because we

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.070
only see one type, or at least
one type per country.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.470
We only see bank notes from one
bank, or at least one bank

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.890
has the right to issue them
within the United States and

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.140
that's the Federal
Reserve Bank.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.570
And it's not backed by gold.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.560
It's actually backed by U.S.
Treasuries, and I'll go into

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.110
that a little later on.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.910
Actually, that's a whole
fascinating realm of thought.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.510
But I just wanted to get this
point home, that all you

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.520
have-- that this bank actually
has this other service of

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.650
issuing these bank notes that
are different than the

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.970
checking deposits, which I will
cover in the next video.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:32.450
And then I will use both of
those concepts to redo that

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.690
lending that we did with the
irrigation ditches and the

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.820
factory to show you that the
gold actually never even has

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.000
to leave the bank.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.280
The gold just sits in the bank
the whole time and the bank

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.780
can just use its bank notes and
checks to actually conduct

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.040
all of the transactions.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.920
See you in the next video.
