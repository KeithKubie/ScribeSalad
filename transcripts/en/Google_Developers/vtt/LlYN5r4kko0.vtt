   &gt;&gt; CHRISTOPHER PATNOE:  Hi 
there.  Thanks for joining us 

00:29:17.098 --> 00:29:21.453
today on a discussion on AR and 
VR.  Today we want to provide 

00:29:21.454 --> 00:29:24.523
some background for those people
who aren't familiar and then 

00:29:24.524 --> 00:29:28.221
we'll share and principles and 
guidelines and then finally 

00:29:30.058 --> 00:29:31.685
review with you different 
disabilities and how to make 

00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:33.304
your 
applications and experiences 

00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:36.161
more inclusive.  My name is 
Christopher Patnoe.

00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:41.756
I'm work here on Google's 
central 

00:29:41.757 --> 00:29:43.757
disability team.

00:29:47.246 --> 00:29:49.246
I've spent many, many years 
working at Apple, 

00:29:51.136 --> 00:29:53.136
making games, even at Disney 
mobile.

00:29:55.714 --> 00:29:58.174
I've worked on Google Pay 
music and even Daydream, our AR 

00:29:58.175 --> 00:30:00.175
and VR platform.  I've spent 20 

00:30:04.302 --> 00:30:06.302
plus years working in accessible
and for 

00:30:09.188 --> 00:30:11.188
the past year I've made 
my passion my day job.

00:30:14.502 --> 00:30:15.971
&gt;&gt; RAN TAO:  Hi, I joined 
daydream last year summer after 

00:30:15.972 --> 00:30:17.972
I 

00:30:19.501 --> 00:30:20.707
graduated from UC San Diego 
where I studied computer 

00:30:20.708 --> 00:30:22.708
graphics 
and computer vision.

00:30:24.596 --> 00:30:26.596
I've been using a wheelchair 
full-time now 

00:30:29.842 --> 00:30:30.791
for two years and I'm passionate
about promoting accessibility 

00:30:33.807 --> 00:30:35.807
and daydream

00:30:41.395 --> 00:30:43.395
...

00:31:12.655 --> 00:31:14.655
There's so many head sets out 
there right now.

00:31:16.681 --> 00:31:18.681
We've  partnered with Lenovo to 
make the mirage solo.

00:31:24.068 --> 00:31:26.068
These three  headsets have 
distinctions.

00:31:27.546 --> 00:31:31.627
The experience is kind of like a
movie projected on a sphere  

00:31:31.628 --> 00:31:35.974
around you.  And you're in the 
center of that sphere so you can

00:31:35.975 --> 00:31:39.024
look around but you can't really
lean in closer to any objects.

00:31:42.088 --> 00:31:43.718
Then we have the mirage solo 
with world sense which allows 

00:31:43.719 --> 00:31:47.409
for  six degrees of freedom 
tracking.  That means not only 

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.493
can you  look around but 
forward, back, up, down, left, 

00:31:50.494 --> 00:31:52.494
right.

00:31:53.971 --> 00:31:55.971
This  allows for a much more 
natural 

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.492
interaction where you can duck  
when a snowball is thrown at 

00:31:59.493 --> 00:32:01.493
you.

00:32:07.073 --> 00:32:11.401
My personal favorite is street 
view.  Where I can go anywhere  

00:32:11.402 --> 00:32:13.402
in the world.

00:32:15.936 --> 00:32:18.790
They even have 360 photos.  And 
there's also  artistic apps like

00:32:23.627 --> 00:32:25.627
Tiltbrush and experiences for

00:32:27.168 --> 00:32:28.992
meditation,  training, and so 
much more.

00:32:28.993 --> 00:32:31.240
Let's move to AR where we can 
bring things to you.

00:32:35.335 --> 00:32:37.335
This  allows you to create these

00:32:40.217 --> 00:32:42.217
experiences in Android, unity, 
and  real engine.

00:32:43.902 --> 00:32:45.902
You can also do fun things like 
adding 

00:32:51.634 --> 00:32:54.113
sticker  like this storm trooper
here

00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:59.027
Many people ask, what is 
inclusive design?  To me, it 

00:32:59.028 --> 00:33:01.496
means  being mindful in your 
choices so you don't exclude 

00:33:01.497 --> 00:33:06.803
someone  accidentally by a lack 
of thought.  The way I got 

00:33:06.804 --> 00:33:10.550
involved here  in accessibility 
is when I was on Google Play 

00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:12.387
music a tester  came up and 
brought her device and a 

00:33:12.388 --> 00:33:16.081
speaker, plugged them in.   I 
heard button, button, button.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.807
I see people smile here because 
you know what this means, but I 

00:33:20.808 --> 00:33:23.053
didn't at that time.  This means
the application was not 

00:33:23.054 --> 00:33:26.323
accessible.  So I asked, what is
this?   She said, well, this is 

00:33:26.324 --> 00:33:32.123
your application.  I said, 
that's  stupid.  How does 

00:33:32.124 --> 00:33:36.407
someone use it?  She said, 
that's why I'm  here.  It was at

00:33:36.408 --> 00:33:38.408
that moment I realized it takes 
zero effort to  make your 

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.384
application not inclusive.  It 
only takes a little bit  to make

00:33:41.385 --> 00:33:43.822
it inclusive.
So that's what we're here to 

00:33:43.823 --> 00:33:48.328
talk about.  And accessibility  
is one of the key lenses, one of

00:33:48.329 --> 00:33:51.163
the most tangible lenses for  
inclusive design.

00:34:20.432 --> 00:34:21.918
And I think that's important to 
remember is accessibility is  a 

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:23.919
spectrum.

00:34:25.334 --> 00:34:28.642
It's not a binary on/off thing. 
Many common  ailments you may 

00:34:28.643 --> 00:34:30.643
not 

00:34:33.156 --> 00:34:33.977
recognize to having a 
disability, like   arthritis or 

00:34:33.978 --> 00:34:35.978
even a bad back.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.320
There is still lots of nuances  
within these groupings of 

00:34:38.321 --> 00:34:40.570
disabilities.  It's more like 
cups  inside of buckets.

00:34:43.616 --> 00:34:46.253
Because as they're individual 
people and  people have 

00:34:46.254 --> 00:34:48.254
different abilities and didn't 
kinds of disabilities  and 

00:34:49.116 --> 00:34:51.600
they're very subtle.  
Unfortunately you are 

00:34:51.601 --> 00:34:54.490
fortunately, the  things that 
help those different groups 

00:34:55.933 --> 00:34:57.933
bring those both up  together 
all the time.

00:35:01.005 --> 00:35:03.005
You also want to think about 
situational 

00:35:04.085 --> 00:35:06.085
and temporary  impairments like 
a broken 

00:35:07.364 --> 00:35:09.019
leg or carrying a bag of 
groceries,  and all these 

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.898
situational impairments.
Finally, different people learn 

00:35:11.899 --> 00:35:13.899
at different speeds.

00:35:16.385 --> 00:35:18.385
Either by disability or by 
simply stress.

00:35:19.663 --> 00:35:21.892
So the core thing I want you to 
come away with is don't  design 

00:35:21.893 --> 00:35:26.156
for yourself.  Design for the 
broadest possible markets.   And

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:29.611
you'd be surprised who you're 
supporting.  How do you do  

00:35:29.612 --> 00:35:32.936
this, you ask?  I'm glad you 
asked.  One of the ways I talk  

00:35:32.937 --> 00:35:36.994
about this is a thing called the
curb cut.  A curb cut is that  

00:35:36.995 --> 00:35:39.659
part of the sidewalk that is 
dipped down usually in the 

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.660
corner  of a block.

00:35:43.335 --> 00:35:44.953
This is designed to allow people
with wheelchairs  to be able to 

00:35:44.954 --> 00:35:47.206
get up onto the sidewalk.  
That's really  profoundly 

00:35:47.207 --> 00:35:49.250
important but it's also useful 
for people with  

00:35:55.972 --> 00:35:57.972
suitcases or babies with 
strollers or 

00:35:58.983 --> 00:36:04.432
bike bikes.  So it can help  
many people, but profoundly 

00:36:04.433 --> 00:36:06.667
people with disabilities.
If you address the needs of 

00:36:06.668 --> 00:36:10.759
people who are hard of hearing, 
you are also helping people who 

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.760
forgot their ear buds.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
For  example, the captions are 
helping 

00:36:17.066 --> 00:36:19.066
people who forgot their ear  
buds or on 

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:21.987
a noisy train or conversely in a
quiet room where you  don't want

00:36:21.988 --> 00:36:23.988
to make a lot 

00:36:25.278 --> 00:36:27.545
of noise, or even nonnative 
speakers.   This one 

00:36:27.546 --> 00:36:30.186
accommodation can help lots of 
people, more people than  you 

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:32.187
might realize at the beginning.

00:36:35.696 --> 00:36:37.331
Another example, close to my 
heart, if you're stuck in an  

00:36:37.332 --> 00:36:42.239
airplane seat, some of you may 
have been on an airplane quite  

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.916
recently, you put on a headset 
but something happened behind 

00:36:44.917 --> 00:36:47.354
you  but you're strapped and you
can't get around.  What do you 

00:36:47.355 --> 00:36:49.355
do?

00:36:53.452 --> 00:36:54.661
The Google Earth team did one 
curb cut where they rotate the  

00:36:54.662 --> 00:36:57.353
world around you, so you can see
what's happening 

00:37:00.422 --> 00:37:02.422
behind you be  moved to the 
front.

00:37:03.893 --> 00:37:06.161
YouTube VR also solved the same 
problem by rotating the  world 

00:37:06.162 --> 00:37:08.162
around you.

00:37:10.252 --> 00:37:12.252
You've improved the world for 
people in 

00:37:14.738 --> 00:37:16.738
wheelchairs,  airplane seats or 
even your comfy bed.

00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:21.868
There are few standards around 
VR or AR.  In fact, there  are 

00:37:21.869 --> 00:37:26.758
none.  So this is an opportunity
to do something really  

00:37:26.759 --> 00:37:30.645
astounding that really impacts 
people's lives.  Even before AR,

00:37:30.646 --> 00:37:35.066
people were using devices to 
help improve their lives.  

00:37:35.067 --> 00:37:37.293
People  were using their cameras
on their cell phones to magnify 

00:37:37.294 --> 00:37:39.556
something.  This is actually an 
assistive device 

00:37:43.066 --> 00:37:45.066
called an  magnifier.

00:37:47.307 --> 00:37:48.637
But people were just using this 
to magnify something  to make 

00:37:48.638 --> 00:37:50.638
their life better.  That's the 
whole idea.

00:37:54.149 --> 00:37:56.008
But with modern AR and VR now, 
you can fly anywhere in the  

00:37:56.009 --> 00:37:59.689
world.  Someone stuck in bed can
visit the international space  

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.690
station, or you can 

00:38:02.775 --> 00:38:04.186
measure the couch in your room, 
or if the  game is designed as 

00:38:04.187 --> 00:38:08.331
such you can see when someone is
shooting  from behind you, or 

00:38:08.332 --> 00:38:11.390
how about when you're stressed 
you can have  the most important

00:38:11.391 --> 00:38:13.391
piece of information highlighted
or have  everything else be 

00:38:14.082 --> 00:38:16.082
ignored for you.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.599
This is pretty useful for 
everybody.  And fortunately, 

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.281
each  of these things are also 
profoundly impactful for people 

00:38:23.907 --> 00:38:25.907
with  different kind of 
disabilities.

00:38:26.355 --> 00:38:28.622
There's lots of ways that AR and
VR can help people,  perhaps in 

00:38:28.623 --> 00:38:30.672
ways you don't expect.

00:38:39.306 --> 00:38:40.565
&gt;&gt; Throughout my career I've had
the opportunity to deal with  

00:38:40.566 --> 00:38:42.566
people with cancer and seeing 
the anxieties they develop.

00:38:45.473 --> 00:38:46.893
When  I watch them put on the 
headsets you can see immediately

00:38:46.894 --> 00:38:48.894
the  change in 

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.410
their body language and their 
facial expressions.

00:38:54.271 --> 00:38:56.534
&gt;&gt; My husband tied Tiltbrush.
&gt;&gt; That was a great deal of fun.

00:39:01.229 --> 00:39:02.658
&gt;&gt; Subsequently, he went and 
bought art supplies and took  

00:39:02.659 --> 00:39:04.659
classes.

00:39:07.171 --> 00:39:08.388
&gt;&gt; It took my mind away from 
passively experiencing  

00:39:08.389 --> 00:39:09.822
something.
&gt;&gt; CHRISTOPHER PATNOE:  Research

00:39:09.823 --> 00:39:11.823
is 

00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:15.612
being done today showing  that 
VR can help people feel less 

00:39:15.613 --> 00:39:19.718
pain and it can change  people's
lives and introduce a new skill 

00:39:19.719 --> 00:39:21.719
or talent they never  knew they 
had.

00:39:24.838 --> 00:39:25.042
A wise man once said with great 
power comes  great 

00:39:25.043 --> 00:39:27.935
responsibility.
How do you start?  One place to 

00:39:27.936 --> 00:39:29.936
start is with trusted  experts.

00:39:31.626 --> 00:39:34.269
For over a decade, able gamers 
have helped countless  gamers 

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.270
with 

00:39:37.772 --> 00:39:39.772
disabilities either return to 
game after 

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.860
injury or  start playing games 
despite a disability.

00:39:46.596 --> 00:39:48.596
They worked with  Sony and 
Microsoft 

00:39:49.877 --> 00:39:51.877
to add disability platforms to 
their  applications.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:57.790
Many of the ideas from this talk
come 

00:39:58.805 --> 00:40:00.805
from this

00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:04.801
includification concept.
&gt;&gt; RAN TAO:  Let's talk about 

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.802
what works today.

00:40:09.098 --> 00:40:10.925
You see the  new Android 
accessibility options and what 

00:40:10.926 --> 00:40:14.400
it looks like.  Many  work right
out of the box.  Don't worry 

00:40:14.401 --> 00:40:16.401
about trying to read it.   It's 
kind of small.

00:40:21.132 --> 00:40:23.401
There's color and contrast 
adjustments, color corrections  

00:40:23.402 --> 00:40:25.402
for different color 
deficiencies.

00:40:30.606 --> 00:40:32.542
My little brother has a hard  
time differentiating between red

00:40:32.543 --> 00:40:36.158
and green.  So he turns on this 
color correction mode and it 

00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:38.159
helps him a lot.

00:40:40.873 --> 00:40:42.873
Turning on these settings 
automatically 

00:40:44.168 --> 00:40:46.168
applies it to VR  and AR apps.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.334
We can mix right and left 
channels into a single channel  

00:40:49.335 --> 00:40:53.882
and puts those both in a single 
ear bud.  You can watch videos  

00:40:53.883 --> 00:40:55.883
with a single ear bud.

00:40:57.145 --> 00:40:59.145
This also works with in AR and 
VR.

00:40:59.855 --> 00:41:01.504
We have magnification where you 
triple tap on the screen to  

00:41:01.505 --> 00:41:03.958
zoom in.  This works really well
in AR.

00:41:06.415 --> 00:41:08.415
We have switch access and talk 
back, which I'll get into.

00:41:09.473 --> 00:41:11.912
So designing for accessibility, 
things that you can do  today, 

00:41:11.913 --> 00:41:13.913
well, switch 

00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:17.668
access and talk back requires 
the app to  support Android 

00:41:17.669 --> 00:41:19.669
accessibility API's.  This is 
where you come in.

00:41:21.756 --> 00:41:23.756
The API's are in Java so you can

00:41:25.412 --> 00:41:27.520
integrate them into your  Java 
or C++ apps.  The switch access 

00:41:27.521 --> 00:41:29.521
makes it possible 

00:41:30.638 --> 00:41:32.900
for  people with dexterity 
impairments to use your app with

00:41:32.901 --> 00:41:34.945
one or  more switches.  These 
switches can take the form of 

00:41:36.749 --> 00:41:38.749
buttons like  the volume buttons
on the 

00:41:40.659 --> 00:41:42.659
side of the phone, or special 
sensors  

00:41:47.039 --> 00:41:49.712
like special sensors Hawking had
that detected cheek muscle  

00:41:49.713 --> 00:41:51.713
switches.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.711
So when you get to the one you 
want, you push a second  button 

00:41:55.712 --> 00:41:57.712
to select it.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.274
Then we have talk back, which is
another way you can  interact 

00:42:01.275 --> 00:42:03.275
with your phone.

00:42:07.009 --> 00:42:09.009
I'll let my friend Victor 
demonstrate  it.

00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:12.553
&gt;&gt; I'm a technical program 
manager on the Android  

00:42:12.554 --> 00:42:15.232
accessibility services team.  
Among other products we work on 

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:20.136
talk back.  Talk back is a 
screen reader for people who are

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:22.137
blind or vision impaired.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.430
The way you use Talk Back is via
a  special touch gestures.

00:42:31.378 --> 00:42:34.879
The algorithm, the feedback is 
provided  by speech.  There are 

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.928
two ways you can navigate the 
screen with  talk back.

00:42:42.276 --> 00:42:44.312
If first is linear road 
integration.  It's performed  by

00:42:44.313 --> 00:42:46.313
a single finger.

00:42:50.671 --> 00:42:51.499
The user double taps to 
activate?

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.500
&gt;&gt; AUTOMATED VOICE:  Next empty 
space, 

00:42:56.992 --> 00:42:58.992
button, row, turn,  placed the 
bottom right.

00:42:59.972 --> 00:43:01.368
&gt;&gt; Another method is touch 
exploration.  You drag the 

00:43:01.369 --> 00:43:06.080
finger  across the element on 
the screen, towards the element 

00:43:06.081 --> 00:43:08.147
of  interest is located, and you
tap on it to activate.

00:43:08.748 --> 00:43:10.748
&gt;&gt; AUTOMATED VOICE:  Next placed
in center left.

00:43:12.431 --> 00:43:16.927
Next wins.
&gt;&gt; RAN TAO:  Awesome.  I'm glad 

00:43:16.928 --> 00:43:18.928
he won.

00:43:22.885 --> 00:43:24.885
That tic-tac-toe app  uses open 
GL and 

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.800
C++ and allowed Android to 
interact with them.

00:43:30.866 --> 00:43:34.950
It's GitHub.com /resort.
Accessibility should be not an 

00:43:34.951 --> 00:43:36.951
afterthought.

00:43:38.201 --> 00:43:39.859
This is taken  from a recent 
trip to Japan.  In Japan they 

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.148
have a lot of older  houses and 
businesses where the 

00:43:45.407 --> 00:43:46.614
retrofitted with ramps to make  
it more accessible.  This ramp 

00:43:46.615 --> 00:43:48.615
here, I don't know if you 

00:43:51.275 --> 00:43:55.064
can  tell or not, is like a 
45-degree angle.  So I would 

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:58.773
just tip  forward if I tried to 
go forward.  My girlfriend who 

00:43:58.774 --> 00:44:01.439
took this  picture as she was 
trying to get back up that 

00:44:05.711 --> 00:44:08.196
ramp she just kept  slipping and
couldn't get back up.  Not sure 

00:44:08.197 --> 00:44:11.108
what was happening  there.
This is another one.  I still 

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:13.391
don't understand what those  are
for.

00:44:20.728 --> 00:44:22.728
So start thinking about it 
today.

00:44:23.973 --> 00:44:26.065
Start testing,  talking, and 
listening.  Your users have a 

00:44:26.066 --> 00:44:28.066
lot to say.

00:44:30.156 --> 00:44:32.989
Test with bright sunlight or a 
noisy environment or holding  a 

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:34.990
cup of coffee in one hand.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.183
Understand your users' needs by 
reaching out to the  community. 

00:44:40.184 --> 00:44:42.057
Reach out to friend or friends 
of friends, people  with 

00:44:42.058 --> 00:44:45.550
different accessibility needs, 
and listen to what they have  to

00:44:45.551 --> 00:44:48.402
say with an open mind.  They 
have valuable perspectives to  

00:44:49.034 --> 00:44:51.059
share.
And how should you test your 

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.060
apps?

00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:56.151
We think that inclusive  design 

00:44:58.482 --> 00:45:00.462
shouldn't just be the Java, the 
single accessibility  engineer 

00:45:00.463 --> 00:45:01.502
or a team of engineers.  It 
should be considered all  phases

00:45:01.503 --> 00:45:06.858
of development, from idea to 
design to develop all the  way 

00:45:06.859 --> 00:45:09.702
to launch.
So we've created this mnemonic 

00:45:09.703 --> 00:45:11.755
to make it easy to promote  
inclusive design 

00:45:14.798 --> 00:45:17.229
process to all of on your 
developers.  And this   mnemonic

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.105
is this Saturday morning test.  
So imagine for a second  you 

00:45:20.106 --> 00:45:22.106
woke up 

00:45:24.435 --> 00:45:26.470
on a Saturday morning, you're 
groggy, you forgot  your glasses

00:45:26.471 --> 00:45:28.471
and your headphones and you just
want to sit down 

00:45:31.778 --> 00:45:33.778
in a comfy chair and play some 
VR.

00:45:34.423 --> 00:45:36.465
Well, this situation simulates a
significant portion of  

00:45:36.466 --> 00:45:38.466
different accessibility needs.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.262
And if you have perfect vision, 
borrow someone's glasses, try 

00:45:43.263 --> 00:45:47.377
those on.  Make sure of these 
four  things: That controls are 

00:45:47.378 --> 00:45:49.378
simple, the text is 

00:45:50.437 --> 00:45:52.437
readable, the  items are 
reachable, and 

00:45:53.512 --> 00:45:55.512
the audio is optional.

00:46:00.463 --> 00:46:01.493
So again, accessibility is an 
important lens of inclusive  

00:46:01.494 --> 00:46:03.509
design.
Let's dive into the specifics of

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.510
how you 

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.400
can apply  inclusive design to 
your immersive applications.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.319
There's many opportunities for 
actions and we can break  these 

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.320
down into four 

00:46:15.999 --> 00:46:17.999
big categories of accessibility 
needs:  

00:46:19.212 --> 00:46:21.212
Mobility, and dexterity

00:46:24.166 --> 00:46:26.166
, visual, audio,

00:46:28.122 --> 00:46:30.122
and cognitive.

00:46:34.639 --> 00:46:36.639
We'll first cover mobility and

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:42.250
dexterity needs.

00:46:43.338 --> 00:46:46.022
We have people with one hand 
available, or you're just  

00:46:46.023 --> 00:46:48.023
holding a cup of coffee.

00:46:50.567 --> 00:46:52.590
People with shaky hands or you 
drank  too much coffee.  You 

00:46:52.591 --> 00:46:54.591
have people with limited finger 

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.110
dexterity  with problems 
grasping or pressing buttons, or

00:46:59.111 --> 00:47:03.237
people just  wearing gloves.
You have people having a hard 

00:47:03.238 --> 00:47:05.764
time bending down and getting  
things off the 

00:47:09.641 --> 00:47:12.545
floor or up high off shelves, or
of different  heights, or 

00:47:12.546 --> 00:47:15.175
difficulty laying down or 
sitting down or turning  around,

00:47:18.046 --> 00:47:20.046
or perhaps they're in an 
airplane seat.

00:47:22.521 --> 00:47:25.365
Ever since I started using a 
wheelchair, honestly, VR has  

00:47:25.366 --> 00:47:28.320
been a lot harder.  Tripping 
over the cord has been an issue.

00:47:30.752 --> 00:47:32.752
It's a lot harder to step offer 
the cord in a wheelchair.

00:47:35.279 --> 00:47:37.279
I  also, if I'm trying to hold 
two 

00:47:38.753 --> 00:47:39.774
controllers, and trying to push 
my chair, it's not really 

00:47:39.775 --> 00:47:41.775
happening.

00:47:42.831 --> 00:47:44.831
Some of the muscles in my hand 
also 

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:48.334
don't work, so finger  
dexterity, so I have trouble 

00:47:48.335 --> 00:47:50.335
pushing some buttons.

00:47:51.989 --> 00:47:54.959
So in a  game, the enemies are 
chasing after me, and I can't 

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.608
press that  sprint button.  I'm 
just casually walking away.

00:47:58.635 --> 00:48:00.635
(Laughter)
Didn't end well there.

00:48:02.575 --> 00:48:04.575
I also have trouble looking 
behind me 

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.870
when things are all  the way 
back there.

00:48:08.116 --> 00:48:09.547
This is a good opportunity for 
us to do a real exercise  

00:48:09.548 --> 00:48:12.214
together.  If I can get your 
participation, please.

00:48:16.428 --> 00:48:18.428
Just  indulge me for a second.

00:48:22.519 --> 00:48:24.519
Pretend your Luke sky walker, 
holding  

00:48:27.032 --> 00:48:29.032
a light sabre in front of you.

00:48:30.779 --> 00:48:32.222
You must defend yourself.
Try to note as you do this 

00:48:32.223 --> 00:48:35.753
experiment.  The drone is in  
front of you.  You're blocking 

00:48:35.754 --> 00:48:37.754
these shots in front of you.  
Now  the drone is to your right.

00:48:38.814 --> 00:48:43.347
Turn to your right.  Block those
shots.  Don't feel shy about 

00:48:43.348 --> 00:48:46.400
your neighbors.  The drone is  
behind you.  Turn all the way 

00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:48.638
behind you.  And then now the  
drone is to your left.

00:48:51.824 --> 00:48:53.824
So turn 270 degrees to my left. 
All  right?

00:48:54.268 --> 00:48:56.268
Now the drone is back in front 
of you.

00:48:57.147 --> 00:48:59.147
So how did you do?

00:49:00.395 --> 00:49:03.640
There are some good insights we 
can  pull out of this.  Although

00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:05.641
it's possible to turn around and
block all of these shots, it's 

00:49:05.677 --> 00:49:09.596
difficult.  If you're under a  
time constraint it makes it 

00:49:09.597 --> 00:49:11.597
impossible to use this 
application.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.121
And you want to really test 
these situations yourself.   

00:49:14.122 --> 00:49:18.807
Don't feel silly.  These are 
very valuable insights.  Not 

00:49:18.808 --> 00:49:21.062
only  does this apply to me; it 
applies to you sitting in these 

00:49:21.701 --> 00:49:24.160
conference chairs.  You don't 
want to whack your neighbors 

00:49:28.521 --> 00:49:33.044
or  the person behind you with 
these light sabers.  And you 

00:49:33.045 --> 00:49:35.045
don't  want to look silly in 
this public situations.

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:39.032
Make sure these are useful to 
your app in these  experiments.

00:49:39.033 --> 00:49:41.711
So how to make your app more 
accessible.

00:49:44.573 --> 00:49:46.402
As you saw with Google Earth VR 
allowing you to rotate the  

00:49:46.403 --> 00:49:48.403
space around you using the 
controller.

00:49:50.072 --> 00:49:52.072
There's also the tunnel vision 
effect 

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:55.404
that blurs out the  surroundings
that creates this grid that 

00:49:55.405 --> 00:49:57.405
matches your 

00:49:58.502 --> 00:50:00.502
real-world  coordinates so you 
don't get motion sickness.

00:50:02.571 --> 00:50:05.279
VR allows you to move places 
with the controller.  This is  

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.782
valuable for someone who wants 
to move around without actually 

00:50:09.414 --> 00:50:11.414
having the space or sitting in a
chair.

00:50:13.083 --> 00:50:15.956
It's also valuable to give users
the control to have  incremental

00:50:15.957 --> 00:50:17.957
versus smooth rotations and 
movements.

00:50:21.849 --> 00:50:23.849
That means  versus smoothly 
going 

00:50:25.596 --> 00:50:27.596
around or jumping forward versus
smoothly  gliding forward.

00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:30.973
This provides users a choice of 
comfort versus finer grain  

00:50:30.974 --> 00:50:33.222
control.
And then let's talk about 

00:50:33.223 --> 00:50:38.589
height.  There's users of  
different heights.  It's super 

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.590
common in VR, especially 

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.911
with  little kids these days 
getting real excited about this 

00:50:43.912 --> 00:50:45.912
technology.

00:50:48.409 --> 00:50:50.409
My little sister loves job 
simulation.

00:50:51.706 --> 00:50:54.388
She couldn't reach  the items 
off the shelves.  She's a 

00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:56.389
13-year-old girl about this  
tall.

00:50:59.075 --> 00:51:01.747
They added a new shorter human 
mode.  You turn it on and  the 

00:51:01.748 --> 00:51:03.748
world shrinks 

00:51:06.244 --> 00:51:08.244
into a doll house, like you're a
10-foot  giant.

00:51:09.551 --> 00:51:11.551
And she's logged 50 something 
hours on this game now.

00:51:13.249 --> 00:51:14.877
Generally, you should design to 
minimize for reaching down  low 

00:51:14.878 --> 00:51:16.878
or up high.

00:51:18.588 --> 00:51:19.602
Perhaps using a magnetic hand to
grab things  would be one way to

00:51:19.603 --> 00:51:22.307
solve this.
Interestingly enough, with three

00:51:22.308 --> 00:51:24.308
degrees 

00:51:26.989 --> 00:51:28.989
of freedom  controllers like on 
the 

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:32.536
Daydream view and Mirage solo, 
there's  more accessible 

00:51:32.537 --> 00:51:34.383
experiences in the hardware.  
There's no need to  reach up or 

00:51:34.384 --> 00:51:36.384
down.

00:51:40.603 --> 00:51:42.603
And custom controls, allowing 
users to 

00:51:43.877 --> 00:51:46.725
choose what works  best for me. 
For me remapping that button 

00:51:46.726 --> 00:51:50.367
allows me to be able  to use 
that game again and I can now 

00:51:50.368 --> 00:51:53.231
run away from the enemies.
And giving assistive controls is

00:51:53.232 --> 00:51:55.232
another way to help.

00:51:57.987 --> 00:52:00.237
Some  buttons are too small or 
not obvious they're 

00:52:00.238 --> 00:52:02.238
interactable.

00:52:04.111 --> 00:52:06.755
Using this bendy laser is one 
way to solve that problem.  And 

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:09.436
shaky hands from your morning 
coffee wouldn't be a problem  

00:52:09.437 --> 00:52:11.437
anymore, either.

00:52:15.577 --> 00:52:17.825
A lot of these come about from 
gaming, that are already in  

00:52:17.826 --> 00:52:19.826
console games.

00:52:21.709 --> 00:52:23.709
And will be super valuable in 
other apps, as  well.

00:52:25.451 --> 00:52:27.451
Like the joy stick, rotations, 
et 

00:52:31.098 --> 00:52:33.098
cetera, allows users to  choose 
between finer grain control 

00:52:34.698 --> 00:52:37.345
versus faster movement.
Let's talk about mobile AR 

00:52:37.346 --> 00:52:39.346
interactions.

00:52:40.403 --> 00:52:42.403
Mobile AR borrows  from mobile 
itself.

00:52:45.134 --> 00:52:47.134
It's designed for 2DUI but for 
3DUI 

00:52:48.762 --> 00:52:50.841
you  want to have adjustable 
size.

00:52:53.347 --> 00:52:55.347
It allows people to use your app
in 

00:52:57.462 --> 00:52:59.285
small spaces but  profoundly 
impacts those using your app 

00:52:59.286 --> 00:53:01.286
stuck in a chair.

00:53:02.335 --> 00:53:03.771
For me, I can't really see up 
high or reach very far, so I  

00:53:03.772 --> 00:53:06.020
can move the objects to places 
that works best for me.

00:53:08.698 --> 00:53:10.698
And having large tap targets.

00:53:13.213 --> 00:53:15.213
It forces for simpler user  

00:53:18.115 --> 00:53:20.115
interfaces, friendlier UI, and 
more readable.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.570
Generally, you want the text to 
at least be finger size.

00:53:23.635 --> 00:53:26.106
And finally, having alternative 
gestures, an alternative to  

00:53:26.107 --> 00:53:28.107
swiping or 

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.793
shaking the phone, having an 
extra tap target to do  these 

00:53:30.794 --> 00:53:32.794
interactions would be useful.

00:53:35.318 --> 00:53:37.375
Now, onto visual impairments.
&gt;&gt; CHRISTOPHER PATNOE:  Has you 

00:53:37.376 --> 00:53:40.642
look towards visual  
impairments, the groups of 

00:53:40.643 --> 00:53:42.642
people you'll be supporting are 
people without glasses, people 

00:53:42.643 --> 00:53:44.643
with 

00:53:46.658 --> 00:53:48.733
glasses, people with high  
contrast need, non-stereoscopic 

00:53:48.734 --> 00:53:50.734
vision, people visually impaired
or blind.

00:53:53.053 --> 00:53:54.076
It covers a lot of on different 
people throughout  different 

00:53:54.077 --> 00:53:56.077
phases of life.

00:53:57.555 --> 00:53:59.555
One of the most important things
you'll 

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:03.771
do is have

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.460
multimodel

00:54:09.459 --> 00:54:12.328
affordianses.
Have narrative written down, as 

00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:14.329
well.

00:54:17.024 --> 00:54:18.252
And next, support large text and
large fonts, that's so  much 

00:54:18.253 --> 00:54:21.176
easy to see.
The next one is a contrary, good

00:54:24.454 --> 00:54:26.516
contrast, in terms of your  UI. 
You probably can't read all the 

00:54:29.005 --> 00:54:30.826
letters there because I  
intentionally made the contrast 

00:54:30.827 --> 00:54:33.297
bad to reproduce the situation. 
If the contrast is bad, it don't

00:54:35.456 --> 00:54:37.526
matter.  People can't see it.
If you want to support people 

00:54:37.527 --> 00:54:41.949
with color blindness, don't  use
only color to support things 

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:43.950
like health or progress.

00:54:46.653 --> 00:54:48.319
Please use dedicated icons or 
textures in addition to color, 

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.320
so  they can tell the 
difference.

00:54:54.631 --> 00:54:56.631
And also always try to use a 
color blind safe palet.

00:54:57.493 --> 00:54:59.493
I do work in accessibility and 
AR and VR.

00:55:01.785 --> 00:55:04.032
People ask,  well, how do blind 
people use AR or VR.  I say 

00:55:04.033 --> 00:55:05.869
right now it's  really hard.  
This is hopefully something we 

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:09.185
can work on  together.  At this 
time, there's no support in 

00:55:12.662 --> 00:55:14.662
the major game  engines for 
accessibility services.

00:55:18.822 --> 00:55:20.661
The UI in 3D   space are just 
hanging out there with a  script

00:55:20.662 --> 00:55:23.499
attached.  There's no VR check 
box or text box.

00:55:27.191 --> 00:55:29.191
It's  just a floating texture 
that has 

00:55:31.051 --> 00:55:33.051
a script that allows it to work 
like a text box.

00:55:35.523 --> 00:55:37.563
There's no window manager or a 
way to  understand how to 

00:55:37.564 --> 00:55:39.802
navigate what these things are.
There's work to be done.

00:55:43.276 --> 00:55:45.276
This is actually true within all
3D games as well.

00:55:52.217 --> 00:55:56.222
To that  end, please don't 
forgot GitHub.com /zork.

00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:01.194
If you do want  this, please 
reach out to the game 

00:56:01.195 --> 00:56:03.195
developers.

00:56:04.851 --> 00:56:07.489
It's not just  the unholy duo.  
Reach out and ask for it so they

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:10.390
can do it.
Moving on towards hearing 

00:56:10.391 --> 00:56:12.391
impairments.  Here, you're  
helping people with 

00:56:16.962 --> 00:56:18.962
impairments, hearing 
impairments, but 

00:56:20.018 --> 00:56:21.858
also  the noisy environment or 
the quieter environments or 

00:56:21.859 --> 00:56:23.859
people  without their 
headphones.

00:56:26.572 --> 00:56:28.572
There's the multimodel 
affordances, again.

00:56:32.723 --> 00:56:33.741
Captions, narrations, it's the 
same idea but different  

00:56:33.742 --> 00:56:35.742
instances.
Captions are normally video.

00:56:38.466 --> 00:56:40.466
Narrations are cut scenes of the
game.

00:56:43.878 --> 00:56:44.506
Please include the captions or 
narration in these things so  

00:56:44.507 --> 00:56:46.507
everyone can enjoy the story 
you're building.

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.488
Often, if you have avatars in VR
or AR, we find captions  are 

00:56:51.489 --> 00:56:54.551
often connected to a word or 
thought bubble.  That's pretty  

00:56:54.552 --> 00:56:56.552
useful as long as people know 
where to look.

00:56:58.656 --> 00:57:01.105
So be careful with  that.
In terms of captions, this is 

00:57:01.106 --> 00:57:03.106
really important.

00:57:04.403 --> 00:57:06.661
Unfortunately, not all platforms
support closed captioning in  

00:57:06.662 --> 00:57:11.582
VR.  YouTube VR has always 
supported captions.  And the way

00:57:11.583 --> 00:57:13.583
YouTube VR does it is called 
head locked.

00:57:16.304 --> 00:57:18.304
It's this little  black box with
white letters.

00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:22.868
As you turn your head, it spins 
around with you.  There's no way

00:57:22.869 --> 00:57:24.869
for us to tell where for it to  
go, but at least it's there.

00:57:29.015 --> 00:57:31.852
But again, not all VR platforms 
support this.  If you have  

00:57:31.853 --> 00:57:33.708
video or are using video in an 
application, please burn it into

00:57:33.709 --> 00:57:36.761
the video.  It's not the best 
solution.  The best solution is 

00:57:36.762 --> 00:57:41.263
to  support captions, but if you
can't, please at least do this. 

00:57:41.264 --> 00:57:43.921
And when you're doing this, 
there's sort of two standards 

00:57:43.922 --> 00:57:48.623
most  common.  One is a 
three-up, like you see here.  

00:57:48.624 --> 00:57:50.624
It's 12, 4, and  7.

00:57:51.678 --> 00:57:53.724
The idea here is to make sure 
there's always some bit of  the 

00:57:53.725 --> 00:57:55.725
captions 

00:57:57.387 --> 00:57:58.452
available in the peripheral 
vision so you know  something is

00:57:58.453 --> 00:58:00.718
happening.
But what's becoming more common 

00:58:00.719 --> 00:58:02.719
is 

00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:07.520
north, south, east,  west, or 
all the same side of the cube.  

00:58:07.521 --> 00:58:08.749
Put your captions in  these 
places and everyone should be 

00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:10.750
able to find them.

00:58:12.411 --> 00:58:14.411
There's a new format called VR 
180 which 

00:58:18.437 --> 00:58:20.098
we just announced  with Lenovo 
mirage.  When you go into 

00:58:20.099 --> 00:58:22.099
YouTube, put 

00:58:23.579 --> 00:58:24.392
everything in  a 16 by 9 crop 
and everything should be visible

00:58:24.393 --> 00:58:27.078
there and that  works just fine.

00:58:30.413 --> 00:58:32.413
Moving on to what's cognitive 
impairments.

00:58:33.669 --> 00:58:36.327
The people that  you help here 
are distracted users, like 

00:58:36.328 --> 00:58:39.981
parents, people with  difficulty
remembering or understanding 

00:58:39.982 --> 00:58:45.686
language, like parents.   Or 
foreign language speakers.  And 

00:58:45.687 --> 00:58:48.136
what you do here, you want to  
make your UI simple and easy to 

00:58:48.137 --> 00:58:50.137
use.

00:58:53.302 --> 00:58:55.302
This is simplify,  simplify, 
simplify.

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:59.647
Think about the uses of your 
video or use of UI, how to  

00:58:59.648 --> 00:59:02.707
guide someone from one idea to 
the next.  Make it intuitive, 

00:59:02.708 --> 00:59:04.354
not  just beautiful.
If you're talking about 

00:59:04.355 --> 00:59:06.179
situations where you have 
levels,  there's three things 

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:10.523
that are useful.  One is have a 
sandbox  level for people who 

00:59:10.524 --> 00:59:11.755
have a hard time learning or 
hard time  manipulating 

00:59:11.756 --> 00:59:16.269
controls.  Give them a place 
where they can mess  around and 

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:18.117
learn how to use your game or 
your experience without  having 

00:59:18.118 --> 00:59:21.179
it impact their ability to 
actually play the game moving  

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.031
forward.
If you can't do that, make sure 

00:59:24.032 --> 00:59:27.531
you have a good training.   So 
give people a safe place, an 

00:59:28.968 --> 00:59:31.819
opportunity to learn how to  
build and play your game, how to

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.820
use your interaction.

00:59:36.723 --> 00:59:39.182
Finally, have different 
difficulty modes.  It's the  

00:59:39.183 --> 00:59:42.877
standard easy, medium, and hard,
but you don't want to be mean.  

00:59:42.878 --> 00:59:45.981
You don't want to tell anybody 
you're going easy to them.  I  

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:47.608
like the story balance and 
challenge that some games have 

00:59:47.609 --> 00:59:49.609
talked  about.

00:59:52.367 --> 00:59:54.367
It's a lot nicer, but it gets 
the same idea.

00:59:55.086 --> 00:59:57.191
If you want someone to hear your
story, don't stop them.   Let 

00:59:57.192 --> 00:59:59.859
them play to their ability.
Finally, sometimes people just 

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.971
can't get through the level.   
So why should they be stopped in

01:00:02.972 --> 01:00:07.128
the process of getting through  
your story?  In this case, come 

01:00:07.129 --> 01:00:09.129
up with an auto pass.

01:00:10.981 --> 01:00:13.444
Say, if  you can't get past it 
in ten times, ask, "Do you want 

01:00:13.445 --> 01:00:15.486
to move on  to the next level?" 
So they can see what your story 

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.487
is.

01:00:18.774 --> 01:00:21.453
Sometimes they'll say yes; 
sometimes no.  But why prevent  

01:00:21.454 --> 01:00:23.454
them from having the choice?

01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:26.566
Auto pass is a nice way to help 
people understand and finish the

01:00:26.567 --> 01:00:28.567
work that you've done.

01:00:31.053 --> 01:00:33.053
Now taking the step up from sort
of the game environment.

01:00:35.171 --> 01:00:36.794
About an hour ago my team in 
central disability has just  

01:00:36.795 --> 01:00:42.383
announced an application called 
Lookout.  It's an AR application

01:00:42.384 --> 01:00:44.384
that uses the 

01:00:45.451 --> 01:00:47.082
camera and visual detection of 
the world around  you and 

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:49.083
provides an audio description of
the world around you.

01:00:53.081 --> 01:00:55.081
In an image here, on the left, 
we have a picture of  lavender.

01:00:58.026 --> 01:01:00.026
It's a captioner that says 
lavender.

01:01:02.345 --> 01:01:03.548
You would hear  "lavender at 
12:00 o'clock" on the right-hand

01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:05.549
side we have a  series of 
contexts.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.497
The important thing, there's 
three things I want to talk  

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.498
about here that are important.

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:14.674
That context menu is actually  
surprisingly important because 

01:01:14.675 --> 01:01:16.675
until we know your context, we  
don't know what 

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.960
to say or more importantly we 
don't know what  not to say.

01:01:23.052 --> 01:01:24.081
If we don't know what you care 
about, we'll read everything  to

01:01:24.082 --> 01:01:29.365
you.  If I had this right here, 
I'd say person, person,  person,

01:01:29.366 --> 01:01:31.801
person, person, person.  And 
it's all correct, but it  

01:01:31.802 --> 01:01:34.473
doesn't matter.  So providing 
the context gives you an  

01:01:36.107 --> 01:01:38.548
opportunity to not just say the 
things that matter in real-time.

01:01:40.562 --> 01:01:42.241
The second thing is a blind user
uses the camera very  

01:01:42.242 --> 01:01:44.507
differently than you expect.  
It's really true.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:50.172
When testing all our engineers, 
because 

01:01:52.244 --> 01:01:54.244
they're sighted,  would 
generally 

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.621
localize the camera on certain 
things.

01:02:03.717 --> 01:02:05.930
But when  we tested it, boy, 
they were localizing on 

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.931
different things.

01:02:09.584 --> 01:02:11.584
So we had to go to a very, very 
large 

01:02:13.958 --> 01:02:15.970
imagine and resolve  it, and 
then finally we got to what 

01:02:15.971 --> 01:02:17.971
we're looking for.

01:02:19.011 --> 01:02:20.831
And then finally, spatialness.  
If there's lavender in  front of

01:02:20.832 --> 01:02:22.832
you, 

01:02:24.917 --> 01:02:26.154
it makes it different than 12:00
o'clock,  2:00 o'clock, or 1:00 

01:02:26.155 --> 01:02:30.196
o'clock.  So that sense of space
of where  things are is really 

01:02:30.197 --> 01:02:32.054
important in terms of 
understanding the  world around 

01:02:32.055 --> 01:02:34.055
you.

01:02:37.341 --> 01:02:39.812
So in conclusion, y'all can wake
up now.  Please don't  forget 

01:02:39.813 --> 01:02:42.902
these key points.  One, don't 
design for yourself or your  

01:02:42.903 --> 01:02:48.025
situation.
Two, test, talk, and listen.  

01:02:48.026 --> 01:02:50.495
Sit down and take the  Saturday 
morning test.  Check that 

01:02:50.496 --> 01:02:54.560
controls are simple.  Text is  
readable, items are reachable.  

01:02:54.561 --> 01:02:56.561
Audio is optional.  And think  
about the different types 

01:02:59.117 --> 01:03:01.171
of needs from mobility, visual, 
auditory, and cognitive.

01:03:02.399 --> 01:03:04.992
&gt;&gt; CHRISTOPHER PATNOE:  What are
your curb cuts?  What is  

01:03:04.993 --> 01:03:07.164
something that you can do to 
helps everybody but has a 

01:03:07.165 --> 01:03:10.535
profound  impact on someone with
disabilities?  And if you 

01:03:10.536 --> 01:03:12.536
remembered  nothing else, 

01:03:19.911 --> 01:03:22.584

01:29:08.541 --> 01:29:11.493
&gt;&gt; All right.  Good afternoon, 
everyone.

01:29:14.965 --> 01:29:17.654
I want to give a  special shout 
out to all the people around the

01:29:17.655 --> 01:29:21.776
world right now  watching us on 
the live stream.  My name is 

01:29:21.777 --> 01:29:23.777
Larry Yang.

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.040
I'm a  product manager on the 
Google play billing platform.

01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:32.387
I'm joined  by Angela and Niko 
today.  Say hi, everyone.

01:29:32.596 --> 01:29:34.596
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

01:29:37.284 --> 01:29:38.922
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Let's kick 
things off with a quick show of 

01:29:38.923 --> 01:29:42.883
hands.  Who here is already 
running a subscriptions business

01:29:42.884 --> 01:29:46.334
on  Google Play?  Wow, that's 
over half the room.  That's 

01:29:46.335 --> 01:29:49.009
awesome.
All right.  Who here is looking 

01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:51.248
to get started on running a  
subscriptions business on Play? 

01:29:51.249 --> 01:29:53.249
All right.  That's about a  
third of the room.

01:29:54.182 --> 01:29:56.220
That's awesome.
Well, I have good news for all 

01:29:56.221 --> 01:29:59.914
of you.  Today, we're going  to 
run through a whole bunch of 

01:29:59.915 --> 01:30:02.555
features and capabilities that  
you can use right now to start a

01:30:05.003 --> 01:30:06.514
subscriptions business, whether 
you're already -- already have 

01:30:06.515 --> 01:30:10.189
an existing business and you're 
looking to optimize your growth 

01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:12.190
or if you're just looking to get
something started.

01:30:14.272 --> 01:30:16.153
But before we jump in, let's 
take a quick look at why we're  

01:30:16.154 --> 01:30:18.777
even all here talking about 
subscriptions.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.189
Subscriptions is one of the 
fastest growing businesses on  

01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:30.482
mobile today.  It's no surprise 
users have been telling us that 

01:30:30.483 --> 01:30:33.334
they love subscriptions.  They 
love the value that 

01:30:33.335 --> 01:30:36.180
subscriptions  provide and they 
love the access to 

01:30:41.303 --> 01:30:43.787
continuous fresh content  that 
get via a subscription service. 

01:30:43.788 --> 01:30:46.258
Users have demonstrated  this 
love by making a subscriptions a

01:30:46.259 --> 01:30:48.259
part of their daily lives.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:52.836
In fact, 62% of paid Android 
subscribers use their 

01:30:52.837 --> 01:30:55.314
subscription  app at least once 
every single day.

01:30:58.172 --> 01:31:00.003
And because users love 
subscriptions, developers love 

01:31:00.004 --> 01:31:02.641
them,  too.
Let's watch a short video 

01:31:02.642 --> 01:31:04.715
highlighting some of the great  
success that you 

01:31:09.188 --> 01:31:11.188
developers have had on 
subscriptions on Google  Play.

01:31:23.226 --> 01:31:25.226
(Music)

01:32:47.578 --> 01:32:52.153
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  All right.  
Let's pretty cool, huh?  So this

01:32:52.154 --> 01:32:53.980
is a real testament to all the 
great work that you developers  

01:32:53.981 --> 01:32:56.223
have done on subscriptions on 
Google Play.

01:33:00.099 --> 01:33:02.099
But together, we can do so much 
more.

01:33:05.368 --> 01:33:08.289
So today -- first, we'll recap 
some of the features 

01:33:11.763 --> 01:33:13.600
we rolled  out recently and some
of the developers that we've 

01:33:13.601 --> 01:33:15.601
seen with  those features.

01:33:18.767 --> 01:33:20.767
Next we'll roll out a dozen new 
features 

01:33:22.436 --> 01:33:24.298
that you can put  to work right 
away to help roll out your 

01:33:24.299 --> 01:33:26.299
business.

01:33:27.818 --> 01:33:29.854
Finally, we'll give a sneak peek
to what's around the  corner but

01:33:29.855 --> 01:33:33.535
more importantly what you can do
today to be ready  when those 

01:33:33.536 --> 01:33:36.393
features are available.
Niko, why don't you come up on 

01:33:36.394 --> 01:33:39.693
and get us started and tell  us 
about successes that developers 

01:33:39.694 --> 01:33:43.381
have having today.
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  Thanks, Larry.

01:33:45.432 --> 01:33:46.657
The past 12 months have  been 
truly exciting for subscriptions

01:33:46.658 --> 01:33:48.658
on Google Play.

01:33:50.158 --> 01:33:51.199
We as a  team have worked hard 
to address the biggest 

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200
challenges you are  facing as 
developers.

01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:58.777
For example, minimizing churn.
Quickly, I want to run through 

01:33:58.778 --> 01:34:01.011
three features we have seen  
successful 

01:34:04.077 --> 01:34:06.077
developers use to do just that.

01:34:07.539 --> 01:34:09.539
Number one is  real-time 
developer notifications.

01:34:14.705 --> 01:34:16.705
Real-time developer  
notifications 

01:34:17.784 --> 01:34:19.442
give you immediate notifications
when the  subscriber state 

01:34:19.443 --> 01:34:21.443
changes like they renew or 
cancel.

01:34:25.811 --> 01:34:26.419
Essentially, it changes the way 
you operate your  subscription 

01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:29.251
business on Google Play, 
especially in regards to  

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.700
minimizing subscriber churn.

01:34:35.762 --> 01:34:37.762
Let me quote two top developers 
on this feature.

01:34:41.516 --> 01:34:43.516
One says  reality notificationed
have 

01:34:45.414 --> 01:34:48.259
helped them identify the exact  
moment a user cancels so they 

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:50.260
can remind them of 

01:34:51.314 --> 01:34:53.314
the benefits of  subscription 
and entice 

01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:56.990
them to resubscribe.
They like real-time developer 

01:34:58.474 --> 01:35:00.474
notifications because it lets  
them 

01:35:02.361 --> 01:35:04.239
predict subscriber churn in 
reality and quickly win back  

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.240
users with offers.

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:10.141
The bottom line is, for 
developers serious about 

01:35:10.142 --> 01:35:13.003
retention,  real-time developer 
notifications have become a 

01:35:13.004 --> 01:35:15.004
must.

01:35:17.099 --> 01:35:19.099
Secondly, we invested quite a 
bit in 

01:35:20.789 --> 01:35:21.877
helping you combat  involuntary 
churn because it's just so 

01:35:21.878 --> 01:35:23.915
painful.  You spend all  this 
time building a 

01:35:28.391 --> 01:35:30.633
great product or service, and 
then you  convince users to 

01:35:30.634 --> 01:35:33.280
become subscribers to your 
product, just so  they may 

01:35:33.281 --> 01:35:35.281
churn, 

01:35:36.346 --> 01:35:39.019
because, for example, they 
forgot to update  their form of 

01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:41.883
payment.
That's why we've seen such great

01:35:41.884 --> 01:35:43.884
success 

01:35:45.556 --> 01:35:47.556
with a grace  period which 
allows us to 

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:53.691
retry to charge subscribers 
whose  payment has failed for a 

01:35:53.692 --> 01:35:55.692
defined period of time, 

01:35:57.392 --> 01:35:59.259
an account hold  which lets you 
put subscribers in a suspended 

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:01.260
state until they  update their 
form of payment.

01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:06.009
As you can see here in the 
example 

01:36:08.126 --> 01:36:10.840
provided by our partner  music 
match that's notifying the user 

01:36:10.841 --> 01:36:12.841
about a payment that has  
failed.

01:36:13.504 --> 01:36:15.752
Lastly, we have heard really 
great feedback on the Play  

01:36:15.753 --> 01:36:17.753
subscription 

01:36:19.237 --> 01:36:20.873
reports we launched at I/O last 
year on this stage.   Actually, 

01:36:20.874 --> 01:36:24.933
over there.
And now it provides many ways to

01:36:24.934 --> 01:36:26.934
analyze 

01:36:28.611 --> 01:36:30.611
your business and  find 
optimization potential.

01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:33.711
Developers have made it the 
primary destination for  

01:36:33.712 --> 01:36:35.608
business intelligence for 
anybody working on subscriptions

01:36:35.609 --> 01:36:38.048
in  their company.

01:36:44.569 --> 01:36:46.396
So to quickly summarize, our 
most successful  developers show

01:36:46.397 --> 01:36:51.093
us how these features help them 
build great  subscription 

01:36:51.094 --> 01:36:55.374
services today, so we recommend 
all of you to check  them out if

01:36:55.375 --> 01:36:55.804
you're not already using them 
anyways.

01:36:55.805 --> 01:36:59.881
Okay.  Enough of features you 
already know.  I want to  

01:36:59.882 --> 01:37:01.882
welcome Angela to tell you all 
about the new things we're  

01:37:03.557 --> 01:37:06.009
announcing.
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  Thanks, Niko.

01:37:08.039 --> 01:37:10.489
(Applause)
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  We've talked 

01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:14.999
about how much users love  
subscriptions.  We strongly 

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
believe that by building a 

01:37:19.022 --> 01:37:21.309
great  user experience, we are 
also building a high quality 

01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:23.337
subscriber  base.
But we know that the user 

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:25.338
experience is not always 
perfect.

01:37:29.719 --> 01:37:31.341
So just taking a quick straw 
poll out there, how many of you 

01:37:31.342 --> 01:37:35.238
have hesitated to sign up for a 
subscription service because you

01:37:35.239 --> 01:37:38.108
thought it would be too annoying
to cancel or it would just be a 

01:37:38.711 --> 01:37:40.711
hassle to remember?  I know I 
have.

01:37:42.794 --> 01:37:46.485
I see a bunch of you guys  have,
as well.  And this is what we 

01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:48.486
found on your user research.

01:37:49.736 --> 01:37:52.173
Users told us while they can 
derive a lot of value out of 

01:37:52.174 --> 01:37:54.174
their  subscriptions 

01:37:56.297 --> 01:37:58.140
once they've signed up, they 
feel like they'll be  trapped 

01:37:58.141 --> 01:38:00.141
within the subscription without 
the ability to cancel.

01:38:01.998 --> 01:38:03.639
Since the majority of our users 
have multiple subscriptions  to 

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.327
manage, they're worried they'll 
lose track of how much  they're 

01:38:07.328 --> 01:38:09.328
spending.

01:38:10.803 --> 01:38:12.471
These fears create a barrier for
users signing up for your  

01:38:12.472 --> 01:38:14.472
subscription apps and we want to
address that fear.

01:38:15.907 --> 01:38:17.907
So we're really excited to 
announce that 

01:38:18.961 --> 01:38:20.961
we're launching a  new 
subscription center.

01:38:22.612 --> 01:38:23.443
This is a one-stop-shop for 
users to  manage their 

01:38:23.444 --> 01:38:25.444
subscriptions in Google Play.

01:38:27.051 --> 01:38:28.489
We've done a complete U.S. 
overhaul of our old  

01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:31.144
subscriptions page to make it 
easier for users to get more  

01:38:32.975 --> 01:38:35.195
information about their 
subscription, easily fix their 

01:38:35.196 --> 01:38:37.240
payment  issues, and do other 
actions such as restore their 

01:38:37.429 --> 01:38:41.919
subscription.
Rather than talk about it, let 

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.920
me show you how it works.

01:38:46.596 --> 01:38:49.040
Niko has graciously volunteered 
to be my demo person.

01:38:49.258 --> 01:38:51.899
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  Yes.
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  Can I get two 

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.770
forward on the slides, please?

01:38:58.247 --> 01:39:02.559
Okay.  We're just going to do 
this.  (Laughter)

01:39:03.388 --> 01:39:05.024
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  You want to go
to the demo?

01:39:05.025 --> 01:39:08.891
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  Yeah.  Let's go
to demo A.  Yeah.   (Laughter).

01:39:12.774 --> 01:39:15.221
Niko, can you open the Play 
Store and open the hamburger  

01:39:15.222 --> 01:39:17.222
menu?
Okay.

01:39:23.633 --> 01:39:25.633
So we're looking at Vincent 
Verily's account.

01:39:28.006 --> 01:39:29.979
We can  see the subscriptions is
now really prominently placed on

01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:35.316
the  hamburger menu.  Let's see 
what happens when we go to the  

01:39:35.317 --> 01:39:37.348
subscription.
Vincent doesn't have any 

01:39:37.349 --> 01:39:42.443
subscriptions but there's a "get
started" link.  Let's see what 

01:39:42.444 --> 01:39:45.542
happens when we tap it.  We see 
there's a whole new selection of

01:39:45.543 --> 01:39:47.543
different subscription apps  
that the users can explore.

01:39:49.634 --> 01:39:51.911
And keep in mind this is not the
vinyl version.  This is  

01:39:51.912 --> 01:39:54.156
something that our amazing 
merchandising team is working on

01:39:54.157 --> 01:39:56.813
making a better experience day 
after day.

01:39:59.265 --> 01:40:00.898
So let's actually see what the 
subscription center looks  when 

01:40:00.899 --> 01:40:02.899
the user has some subscriptions.

01:40:06.019 --> 01:40:08.019
Can you switch to Wendy's  
account, please?

01:40:12.593 --> 01:40:15.653
?
Okay.  We can see that Wendy 

01:40:15.654 --> 01:40:20.759
actually has three subscriptions
in her account.  One of them has

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.760
a payment decline which needs  
to be addressed but in 

01:40:25.272 --> 01:40:27.096
general we can see that she has 
all this  information about her 

01:40:27.097 --> 01:40:29.332
subscription, including SKU name
which is  something we didn't 

01:40:29.333 --> 01:40:31.800
have before.
In order to go in and manage a 

01:40:31.801 --> 01:40:33.801
specific 

01:40:34.858 --> 01:40:36.858
subscription, we  just have to 
tap somewhere.

01:40:41.519 --> 01:40:43.519
Niko, let's tap on

01:40:45.066 --> 01:40:47.066
Pearl and Straw  to manage that 
subscription.

01:40:47.515 --> 01:40:49.515
Let's say she wants to update 
that payment method.

01:40:52.434 --> 01:40:54.434
So Niko, let's tap update under 
"primary payment method.  "

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.942
So now we can see all the 
payment methods that Wendy has 

01:40:56.943 --> 01:40:58.943
in  her account.  Let's go ahead
and switch that to the 

01:41:03.635 --> 01:41:05.635
new -- to  the new credit card.

01:41:12.338 --> 01:41:14.338
So we've actually launched a 
cool new feature

01:41:21.563 --> 01:41:23.563
(Music being played over audio 
to captioner)

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:26.870
This is also a new feature that 
we have already launched and  is

01:41:26.871 --> 01:41:28.871
available.

01:41:29.959 --> 01:41:32.008
Let's go ahead and get that old 
credit as a  backup.

01:41:37.103 --> 01:41:39.103
(Music still playing over 
speaking in 

01:41:40.619 --> 01:41:42.619
audio to captioner.

01:41:43.823 --> 01:41:45.823
)

01:41:52.922 --> 01:41:55.614
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  Okay.  With the
launch in the subscription  

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.729
center, we're also launching new
seedlings specifically designed 

01:42:00.730 --> 01:42:02.773
for development.

01:42:30.484 --> 01:42:32.484
...

01:42:34.555 --> 01:42:36.381
Oh, man, I wanted to access that
premium article about Yak  but 

01:42:36.382 --> 01:42:38.382
all I see is a dead Yak.

01:42:42.128 --> 01:42:44.128
So I guess let's see what 
happens.

01:42:47.471 --> 01:42:50.351
Okay.  Now I'm in the manage 
subscription 

01:42:53.591 --> 01:42:55.418
page for the Yak app.
There's a problem with my 

01:42:55.419 --> 01:42:57.419
account.

01:42:59.977 --> 01:43:01.977
There's also a CTA for  me to 
fix this problem.

01:43:04.050 --> 01:43:06.050
Let's go ahead and fix that 
problem.

01:43:22.312 --> 01:43:24.312
(Audio problem

01:43:32.844 --> 01:43:34.844
&gt;&gt; Nice.

01:43:37.819 --> 01:43:39.819
Payment is fixed and we're back 
to the premium  experience.

01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:42.870
Let's cut back to the slides, 
please.

01:43:48.241 --> 01:43:51.726
This is a feature that many, 
many of you have asked for.

01:43:54.015 --> 01:43:56.015
And you can access the survey 
answers 

01:43:58.716 --> 01:44:01.200
through our server  site API 
today.  Eventually, you'll also 

01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:03.201
be able to see the  answers in 
console reporting.

01:44:05.059 --> 01:44:07.059
We're still rolling out the user
face changes.

01:44:08.554 --> 01:44:09.363
If you query it today, you'll 
see a small percentage of the  

01:44:09.364 --> 01:44:11.364
answers that users have already 
input.

01:44:13.249 --> 01:44:16.033
Let's get back to the demo to 
see how this works.

01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:21.100
So Niko let's go to the Play 
Store and 

01:44:22.554 --> 01:44:24.554
to Wendy's account  again.

01:44:28.497 --> 01:44:30.941
So Wendy is not only a big fan 
of Yak, she also loves  

01:44:30.942 --> 01:44:32.942
Narwhals, but she's 

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:37.690
gotten kind of tired of the 
Narwhal monthly  newsletter.  So

01:44:37.691 --> 01:44:39.123
let's cancel that subscription 
for her.  Let's  go into 

01:44:39.124 --> 01:44:42.431
Narwhal.  It's easy.  We just 
tap cancel subscription.

01:44:46.288 --> 01:44:48.333
Now, what we see is a quick user
-- is a quick survey for  the 

01:44:48.334 --> 01:44:51.195
user to give the developer some 
feedback as to why they're  

01:44:51.196 --> 01:44:53.221
canceling.
There are already a few 

01:44:53.222 --> 01:44:58.368
pre-written answers but Wendy 
has a  pretty specific reason, 

01:44:58.369 --> 01:45:00.369
and can select "other" to type 
in that  reason.

01:45:03.911 --> 01:45:05.770
Niko, she told you what that 
reason was, right?

01:45:05.771 --> 01:45:07.771
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  She did, 
indeed.

01:45:09.631 --> 01:45:11.631
She said there are not  enough 
Narwhals.

01:45:12.057 --> 01:45:14.301
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  I mean, I guess
they are an endangered  species,

01:45:14.302 --> 01:45:18.132
so that makes sense.
Let's finish canceling that 

01:45:18.133 --> 01:45:20.779
subscription.  Cool.
The nice thing is, even if 

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:26.299
tomorrow Wendy wakes up and she 
realized she made a huge 

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:29.175
mistake, she can actually go 
back and  restore her 

01:45:29.176 --> 01:45:31.176
subscription in the subscription
center.

01:45:34.623 --> 01:45:36.294
Let's go ahead and restore that 
subscription.

01:45:36.295 --> 01:45:39.146
Awesome.
So now Wendy can continue to 

01:45:39.147 --> 01:45:41.598
enjoy her Narwhal subscription  
even next month.

01:45:43.429 --> 01:45:45.429
And that's it for the demo.

01:45:46.908 --> 01:45:49.766
Let's go back to the 
presentation.

01:45:52.956 --> 01:45:57.102
(Applause)
at Google, we always believed in

01:45:57.103 --> 01:45:59.103
you 

01:46:00.483 --> 01:46:02.309
focus on the user, all  else 
will follow.  Because of this 

01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:05.412
new user first experience to  
easily manage subscriptions, 

01:46:05.413 --> 01:46:08.258
users will trust our store and  
engage more with your apps.

01:46:10.295 --> 01:46:12.319
With the subscription center 
we'll also be able to deliver  

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.320
more capabilities to you, the 
developer.

01:46:19.092 --> 01:46:21.767
The deep link and cancel survey 
are just to samples of the  

01:46:21.768 --> 01:46:23.768
abilities.

01:46:24.834 --> 01:46:27.682
Let's go back to Larry and Niko 
to talk about the other new  

01:46:27.683 --> 01:46:30.785
developments we're coming out 
with.

01:46:31.597 --> 01:46:33.431
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Thank you, 
Angela.

01:46:33.432 --> 01:46:35.432
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  Thank you, 
Angela.

01:46:40.964 --> 01:46:42.193
Can we get applause for  
flawless demo execution?

01:46:42.194 --> 01:46:44.257
(Applause)
So I'm part of the Google Play 

01:46:44.855 --> 01:46:46.855
development team.

01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:50.414
The Google  Play business 
development team works directly 

01:46:50.415 --> 01:46:52.415
with subscription  developers 
with all kinds of backgrounds 

01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:57.762
around the world.   Naturally, 
we hear a lot of feedback and 

01:46:57.763 --> 01:46:59.763
ideas for features  which we 
then 

01:47:01.870 --> 01:47:04.538
take to our PM teams, such as 
Larry or Angela, to  see how we 

01:47:04.539 --> 01:47:06.539
can solve these things we hear 
about.

01:47:09.648 --> 01:47:12.090
So one of the requests is that 
you developers told us you  want

01:47:12.091 --> 01:47:14.091
more 

01:47:15.606 --> 01:47:17.606
flexibility in issuing refunds 
to your users.

01:47:19.909 --> 01:47:21.766
Currently, under service-side 
API, you can only refund the  

01:47:21.767 --> 01:47:24.829
latest subscription order using 
the purchase token.

01:47:28.089 --> 01:47:30.777
You cannot  issue a refund using
the order ID, issue a refund for

01:47:30.778 --> 01:47:33.618
previous  subscription orders, 
or partial refunds.

01:47:38.258 --> 01:47:39.992
That's really not  ideal when 
dealing with subscribers.

01:47:39.993 --> 01:47:42.247
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Well, I have 
great news for you, Niko, and  

01:47:42.248 --> 01:47:44.285
everyone here.  We've now closed
these gaps.

01:47:51.213 --> 01:47:53.640
We're supporting  refunds using 
order ID's.  You think refund a 

01:47:53.641 --> 01:47:55.641
subscription  renewal, not just 
the latest one.

01:47:58.784 --> 01:48:00.415
And starting today you can  also
issue partial refunds, on the 

01:48:00.416 --> 01:48:04.737
Play Console.  You can go to  
our sandbox afterwards and see a

01:48:04.738 --> 01:48:07.381
demo of that in action.  This  
feature will also be available 

01:48:10.852 --> 01:48:12.464
on our server-side API next 
week.

01:48:12.465 --> 01:48:14.483
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  I'm sure that 
will make a lot of developers  

01:48:14.484 --> 01:48:16.484
really happy.

01:48:18.130 --> 01:48:20.784
Another request we've heard a 
lot, it's maybe the longest  

01:48:20.785 --> 01:48:22.785
standing feature 

01:48:23.844 --> 01:48:25.844
request that I personally know 
of, is price  changes.

01:48:30.998 --> 01:48:33.034
At the moment, you cannot change
the price of an SKU once  it's 

01:48:33.035 --> 01:48:37.336
been created.  Obviously, that's
very limiting for  businesses, 

01:48:37.337 --> 01:48:39.337
especially for businesses whose 
costs have gone up.

01:48:41.064 --> 01:48:43.064
So currently, the only way to do
this is 

01:48:45.435 --> 01:48:47.435
to create a new  SKU and get 
users to upgrade.

01:48:48.556 --> 01:48:50.185
That also means that you, the 
developers, have to do all  the 

01:48:50.186 --> 01:48:52.186
heavy 

01:48:54.085 --> 01:48:56.324
lifting, like messaging users or
cancels users who  don't 

01:48:56.325 --> 01:48:58.668
upgrade.
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  So we've heard 

01:48:58.669 --> 01:49:03.549
so much about this feature  from
Niko and other business 

01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:06.201
development partners we figured 
the  easiest way to make them 

01:49:06.202 --> 01:49:08.202
happy was to just build the 
feature.

01:49:11.925 --> 01:49:12.736
I'm pleased to announce we now 
support mandatory price changes 

01:49:12.737 --> 01:49:15.805
on existing SKUs.
(Applause)

01:49:15.806 --> 01:49:19.685
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  All right.  
Yeah, see?  You made everyone  

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:21.686
happy now.
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  I told you.

01:49:21.712 --> 01:49:24.584
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Let's say you 
need to roll out a price change 

01:49:24.585 --> 01:49:29.104
to all your users.  Maybe your 
cost of content has gone up or  

01:49:29.105 --> 01:49:30.730
the tax structure has changed in
one of the countries you do  

01:49:30.731 --> 01:49:32.731
business in.

01:49:34.612 --> 01:49:35.836
So now all you need to do is go 
to the Play Console, choose  the

01:49:35.837 --> 01:49:37.888
country or countries where you 
need to change the 

01:49:41.428 --> 01:49:42.645
price,  enter the new price, and
click "save" and you're done.

01:49:46.754 --> 01:49:48.754
30 days before the user's 
renewal date, 

01:49:50.091 --> 01:49:51.922
we, Play, start  sending emails 
and push notifications asking 

01:49:51.923 --> 01:49:54.153
the user to agree  to that price
change.

01:49:58.862 --> 01:50:00.905
We also give you the developer a
seven-day head start so  you can

01:50:00.906 --> 01:50:05.016
also message the user in-app.
If that renewal date comes and 

01:50:05.017 --> 01:50:07.017
the user has not agreed to  the 
price change, we 

01:50:09.912 --> 01:50:11.912
will take care of canceling that
user.

01:50:12.168 --> 01:50:14.846
This feature is currently in 
early access.  If you're  

01:50:14.847 --> 01:50:17.098
interested in trying it out, and
joining our early access  

01:50:18.512 --> 01:50:21.381
program, please visit the link 
that you see on the screen here.

01:50:23.231 --> 01:50:25.231
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  I think it's 
so 

01:50:27.106 --> 01:50:29.387
awesome that we finally let  
developers do that, give you 

01:50:29.388 --> 01:50:31.388
that flexibility to actually run
your business.

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.118
I'm sure developers will love 
this flexibility in building  

01:50:35.119 --> 01:50:37.119
their subscription business on 
Play.

01:50:39.428 --> 01:50:41.428
Which actually brings me so 
another ask.

01:50:43.762 --> 01:50:44.770
I mentioned early earlier how 
much developers love 

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:47.415
subscription reports and that  
retention is the key topic.

01:50:52.956 --> 01:50:55.599
So what we've heard quite a bit 
is  that you developers ask for 

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.630
reports that provide even more  
details especially on 

01:51:01.162 --> 01:51:03.162
the topics of retentions and  
cancellations.

01:51:03.804 --> 01:51:06.056
I know we have a lot to share 
here.  You want to jump right  

01:51:06.057 --> 01:51:09.093
in?
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Yep.  We have a 

01:51:09.094 --> 01:51:11.094
lot of great news in this  area,
as well.

01:51:14.572 --> 01:51:14.984
In I/O last year we announced a 
brand new  subscriptions 

01:51:14.985 --> 01:51:16.985
dashboard.

01:51:18.857 --> 01:51:20.288
A lot of developers told us they
love  the reports and many use 

01:51:20.289 --> 01:51:24.813
them every day to get insights 
into  your business.  But you 

01:51:24.814 --> 01:51:26.814
all asked for more 

01:51:28.095 --> 01:51:30.095
capabilities, which  is why we 
extended 

01:51:32.587 --> 01:51:34.836
two new capabilities in our 
extensions  report.  Let's take 

01:51:34.837 --> 01:51:37.934
a quick look at what they are.
First, we're creating a new 

01:51:37.935 --> 01:51:40.222
retention report.  Now, it's  
super easy to go in and 

01:51:44.124 --> 01:51:46.124
look at specific cohorts, say by
SKU or  dates or by country.

01:51:48.022 --> 01:51:49.456
Now, you can also drill into 
your free-trial conversion,  and

01:51:49.457 --> 01:51:52.316
other interesting metrics in 
this report.

01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.477
And you can also look 
specifically at how many renewal

01:51:58.478 --> 01:52:00.938
periods various users in the 
cohorts have advanced through.

01:52:00.939 --> 01:52:02.939
After all, that's the name of 
the game 

01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:08.460
when you're running  a 
subscriptions business.

01:52:08.469 --> 01:52:10.469
So the second change we're 
making is 

01:52:12.489 --> 01:52:14.489
we're making  improvements to 
the cancellation report.

01:52:15.526 --> 01:52:17.761
Here is where you will see the 
data from the cancellations  

01:52:17.762 --> 01:52:19.762
survey that Angela and Niko 
showed you earlier.

01:52:23.076 --> 01:52:25.103
And we'll also give you details 
on how your win-back and  

01:52:25.104 --> 01:52:27.104
retention features 

01:52:29.633 --> 01:52:31.633
are performing, such as account 
hold and  grace period.

01:52:35.346 --> 01:52:37.346
All in all, this feature will be
rolling 

01:52:40.018 --> 01:52:42.702
out over the next  few weeks and
will help people like you 

01:52:42.703 --> 01:52:44.703
optimize your entire  life 
cycle.

01:52:45.742 --> 01:52:47.742
You can get detailed on the new 

01:52:49.203 --> 01:52:51.863
reporting capabilities in  
tomorrow's session on analyzing 

01:52:51.864 --> 01:52:54.724
and bunch marking over on stage 
3 at 9:30 tomorrow morning.

01:52:55.535 --> 01:52:57.001
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  Are you done 
now?

01:52:57.002 --> 01:52:58.621
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  I have a few 
more things I have to squeeze  

01:52:58.622 --> 01:53:00.622
in.

01:53:01.932 --> 01:53:03.762
Our engineers have so much 
stuff.  Give me a few more  

01:53:03.763 --> 01:53:07.636
seconds.  I wish we had more 
time.  They told us they'd cut 

01:53:07.637 --> 01:53:12.995
us  off at the end of this 
session.  Real quick here.  I 

01:53:12.996 --> 01:53:15.241
want to  share with you all, you
all have asked for the ability 

01:53:15.242 --> 01:53:19.510
to do  quicker renewals on your 
test subscriptions so we rolled 

01:53:19.511 --> 01:53:21.543
that  capability out.  For 
example, a monthly test 

01:53:23.395 --> 01:53:25.395
subscription will  now renew in 
just five minutes.

01:53:27.061 --> 01:53:27.875
You also wanted the ability to 
create an intro price period  

01:53:27.876 --> 01:53:29.876
that's different from your 
regular reoccurrence period.

01:53:32.818 --> 01:53:35.262
So we've now rolled out that 
capability, so you could say,  

01:53:35.263 --> 01:53:37.705
for example, offer a dollar for 
90 days and then kick into 

01:53:41.983 --> 01:53:43.878
$10 a  month on y subscription.
Finally, we have the capability 

01:53:43.879 --> 01:53:45.879
for you 

01:53:47.959 --> 01:53:49.959
to offer an upgrade  but keep 
the user's 

01:53:51.879 --> 01:53:53.879
renewal date and charge an 
incremental  prorated price.

01:53:59.472 --> 01:54:01.310
This is only available with the 
Play billing  library.  Which 

01:54:01.311 --> 01:54:04.014
you'll hear more about later.
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  Thanks.  Let's 

01:54:04.015 --> 01:54:07.309
recap.  We launched 12 new  
features in total, both for 

01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:09.751
users and developers.  On the 
user  side we created a better 

01:54:11.977 --> 01:54:13.813
user experience with the new  
subscription center, including 

01:54:13.814 --> 01:54:15.814
app 

01:54:17.092 --> 01:54:18.328
discovery, backup payment  
method, new deep linking, and a 

01:54:18.329 --> 01:54:21.187
cancel survey.
For the developer, we're giving 

01:54:21.188 --> 01:54:23.221
you a ton more flexibility,  
including 

01:54:27.167 --> 01:54:29.167
improved refunds, ability to 
change SKU 

01:54:31.488 --> 01:54:33.328
prices, and  band supporting, 
and more.

01:54:33.329 --> 01:54:35.329
We've bolded the features that 
are available now.

01:54:37.984 --> 01:54:39.984
So go  check them out as soon as
you can.

01:54:39.987 --> 01:54:42.220
All these other features we're 
working on rolling out in  the 

01:54:42.221 --> 01:54:44.054
next couple of weeks.
So these are the features that 

01:54:44.055 --> 01:54:47.194
we've been working on this  past
year.

01:54:49.633 --> 01:54:50.850
But what are we going to do next
year and the year after  that?

01:54:50.851 --> 01:54:53.455
Larry, you want to tell them 
more?

01:54:56.665 --> 01:54:58.665
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Yes.

01:55:00.511 --> 01:55:01.493
So these features we just shared
are  things you can use right 

01:55:01.494 --> 01:55:03.494
now to grow your business, but 
we're  not done.

01:55:06.173 --> 01:55:08.031
Our engineers are hard at work 
coming up with new features  

01:55:08.032 --> 01:55:10.032
that will help you 

01:55:11.078 --> 01:55:13.078
acquire and retain your 
subscribers.

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:17.233
For example, imagine if your 
users could sign up outside of  

01:55:17.234 --> 01:55:19.054
your app, say from the Play 
Store or anywhere else on the 

01:55:19.055 --> 01:55:21.514
web.
Or what if your users could pay 

01:55:21.515 --> 01:55:23.515
with cash?

01:55:26.075 --> 01:55:28.075
What if we offered the option 
for users 

01:55:29.284 --> 01:55:31.284
to temporary

01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:35.229
ily pause  their subscription 
instead of 

01:55:37.654 --> 01:55:39.654
outright canceling them,

01:55:43.455 --> 01:55:45.495
or we  could help you win back 
your subscribers long after they

01:55:45.496 --> 01:55:47.519
cancel  subscription?
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  That sounds 

01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:51.608
exciting, but does that mean  
every time we come up with a new

01:55:51.609 --> 01:55:54.254
feature the developers have to  
rewrite the code?

01:55:56.719 --> 01:55:59.176
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Our goal is to 
build these features in a way  

01:55:59.177 --> 01:56:03.258
that you have to do as little 
work as possible.  Our goal is 

01:56:03.259 --> 01:56:05.957
as  close as possible to zero 
integration.  We want that to 

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:07.958
happen  on both the client said 
with your app as well as on 

01:56:11.045 --> 01:56:12.867
your  server-side integration.
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  That sounds 

01:56:12.868 --> 01:56:15.945
great but how are you going to  
do that?

01:56:16.974 --> 01:56:19.213
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Just relax.  
Give me a few minutes I'll talk 

01:56:20.868 --> 01:56:22.868
through how we're going to make 
this happen.  All right?

01:56:24.565 --> 01:56:26.208
First, let's talk about what you
need to do on your client  side.

01:56:26.209 --> 01:56:28.267
Last fall at Play time we 
announced 

01:56:31.281 --> 01:56:33.281
version 1.0 of the Play  billing
library.

01:56:36.606 --> 01:56:38.606
It's an abstraction label on 
top...

01:56:39.850 --> 01:56:41.703
when you  update your build 
dependency file and the next 

01:56:41.704 --> 01:56:43.704
time you exile  your app.

01:56:45.173 --> 01:56:47.018
Now, there's no for searching 
reference code and sample  code 

01:56:47.019 --> 01:56:49.057
and copying it and hoping you 
got the right version and all  

01:56:49.058 --> 01:56:51.058
that.

01:56:52.126 --> 01:56:54.126
It's all taken care of 
automatically.

01:56:54.970 --> 01:56:57.597
Today, we're announcing 1.1 
version of the Play billing  

01:56:57.598 --> 01:57:00.857
library.  This includes the 
feature I mentioned earlier 

01:57:00.858 --> 01:57:02.858
where  you can upgrade and keep 
the ex pirration date.

01:57:04.965 --> 01:57:06.965
When we roll out the price 
changes, that 

01:57:08.037 --> 01:57:10.037
will also be  available only via
the Play billing library.

01:57:11.095 --> 01:57:13.142
Using the Play Billing Library 
is very, very simple.   There's 

01:57:13.143 --> 01:57:17.000
three easy steps.  Now, since no
I/O presentation is  complete 

01:57:17.001 --> 01:57:19.869
without showing some code, I'm 
going to go and show a  few code

01:57:21.127 --> 01:57:23.561
examples for this.
You're probably thinking, oh, 

01:57:23.562 --> 01:57:26.845
no, we're near the end of the  
session and now you're going to 

01:57:26.846 --> 01:57:29.482
show me a bunch of code.  Don't 
worry.  The whole point of 

01:57:29.483 --> 01:57:34.586
showing this code is to show you
really how little code it takes 

01:57:34.587 --> 01:57:36.587
to use the Billing Library.

01:57:38.493 --> 01:57:40.935
First, all you need to do is add
this one line to your  

01:57:40.936 --> 01:57:42.936
dependency file.

01:57:44.197 --> 01:57:46.197
Second, you need to create the 
billing client instance.

01:57:46.247 --> 01:57:48.247
To do that, set up the listener.

01:57:49.337 --> 01:57:51.337
And connect to Google  Play.

01:57:54.035 --> 01:57:56.035
Of course, don't forget to build
your 

01:57:57.717 --> 01:57:59.717
own retry policy in  case your 
client loses connection.

01:58:00.182 --> 01:58:03.040
The third and final step is, of 
course, to call the proper  

01:58:03.041 --> 01:58:06.352
method as you go through your 
purchase life cycle, just like 

01:58:06.353 --> 01:58:08.353
you  do today.
That's it.

01:58:09.013 --> 01:58:11.921
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  Okay.  I'm 
convinced.  It's so  

01:58:11.922 --> 01:58:13.961
straightforward that even I get 
it.

01:58:16.812 --> 01:58:18.459
It's actually very close to zero
integration.

01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:20.902
But still, it's late afternoon. 
And I think we've had  enough 

01:58:20.903 --> 01:58:22.903
slides with code.

01:58:26.267 --> 01:58:28.300
So at the end of the day what 
really  matters is how 

01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:31.783
developers actually like it.
My favorite quote is from Joe 

01:58:31.784 --> 01:58:33.784
Birch.

01:58:35.468 --> 01:58:37.468
He's a Google  developer expert 
who 

01:58:41.813 --> 01:58:42.628
called Google Play Billing 
Library a "dream  come true."

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:47.930
We're making this dream come 
true for thousands of developers

01:58:47.931 --> 01:58:50.571
today already.
So if you, like me, did not 

01:58:50.572 --> 01:58:53.261
memorize the code on those  
slides, note on this link 

01:58:56.912 --> 01:58:58.960
here, on the slide, to learn 
more.

01:59:02.211 --> 01:59:03.427
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  So remember, 
with the Play Billing Library,  

01:59:03.428 --> 01:59:07.093
one, integration is much, much 
simpler.  A lot less code to  

01:59:07.094 --> 01:59:09.403
manage.
New features will be rolling out

01:59:09.404 --> 01:59:11.404
in the 

01:59:12.894 --> 01:59:13.088
future will only be  available 
using the Play Billing Library.

01:59:17.879 --> 01:59:19.879
Currently, it's only available

01:59:22.702 --> 01:59:24.331
for Java and Kotland  developers
but a C++ version is coming 

01:59:24.332 --> 01:59:26.577
soon.
So that's on the client side.

01:59:29.668 --> 01:59:31.668
Here is what you need to do  on 
is server side.

01:59:33.514 --> 01:59:36.447
Earlier we talked about 
real-time developer 

01:59:33.514 --> 01:59:36.805
notifications.   Let me talk 
about what it is and how you can

01:59:36.806 --> 01:59:38.806
use it today and  how it will 
prepare you for the future.

01:59:40.472 --> 01:59:42.472
So with real-time developer 

01:59:45.966 --> 01:59:47.966
notifications, you set up a  
Google 

01:59:49.026 --> 01:59:51.026
Cloud integration and we send 
you 

01:59:52.724 --> 01:59:53.335
real-time messages when  
important events happen like, 

01:59:53.336 --> 01:59:55.336
for example, when you have a new
user that signings up or 

01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:00.460
an existing user that renews and
it  sends up a message and now 

02:00:00.461 --> 02:00:02.461
you need to 

02:00:03.473 --> 02:00:04.925
grant a new entitlement  or 
continue to grant entitlement to

02:00:04.926 --> 02:00:07.584
that user.
If today you integrated and 

02:00:07.585 --> 02:00:09.585
implemented 

02:00:10.649 --> 02:00:12.649
account hold, and  by the way in
case 

02:00:13.695 --> 02:00:15.113
you weren't looking in that 
video, you  really, really 

02:00:15.114 --> 02:00:17.114
should integrate with 

02:00:18.825 --> 02:00:20.825
account hold, we send you a  
real-time 

02:00:22.298 --> 02:00:24.958
developer notifications when the
user as a payment  issue and 

02:00:24.959 --> 02:00:27.396
goes on hold or recovers their 
payment issue and goes  off 

02:00:27.397 --> 02:00:29.397
hold.

02:00:30.652 --> 02:00:33.130
Now immediately you'll know when
to with hold or grant  

02:00:33.131 --> 02:00:35.131
entitlement to that user.

02:00:37.015 --> 02:00:37.625
This is super important if you 
have a service that operates  

02:00:37.626 --> 02:00:39.626
cross-platform.

02:00:41.138 --> 02:00:43.138
Say you have users that sign up 
on 

02:00:44.203 --> 02:00:46.203
Android or  might consume on web
or other mobile platforms.

02:00:46.438 --> 02:00:49.089
Real-time developer 
notifications also tell you 

02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:51.090
about  voluntary canceltion, 

02:00:53.185 --> 02:00:55.004
where the user chooses to 
cancel.

02:00:55.005 --> 02:00:56.690
In this situation, when you get 
that message, right away  you 

02:00:56.691 --> 02:01:00.970
should start trying to win back 
that user, maybe remind the  

02:01:00.971 --> 02:01:02.802
user about some new content 
that's coming up or tell them 

02:01:02.803 --> 02:01:05.465
about  some features they 
noticed you haven't used in your

02:01:05.466 --> 02:01:08.109
app.
And using the deep link Angela 

02:01:08.110 --> 02:01:11.448
told you about earlier, you  
then drive the user back to the 

02:01:11.449 --> 02:01:13.449
subscription center where 

02:01:16.398 --> 02:01:19.034
they  click on the "restore" 
button and with one tap they 

02:01:19.035 --> 02:01:20.679
become an  active subscriber 
again.

02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:23.536
These are some of the things you
can do today, right now,  with 

02:01:23.537 --> 02:01:25.537
real-time developer 
notifications.

02:01:25.801 --> 02:01:27.655
But in the future, if you 
integrate now, you'll be ready  

02:01:27.656 --> 02:01:29.656
for some of the new 

02:01:31.323 --> 02:01:33.323
things that we'll be rolling 
out, like 

02:01:35.201 --> 02:01:36.643
say  your user temporarily 
pauses their subscription.  

02:01:36.644 --> 02:01:38.309
We'll send you  a real-time 
developer notifications so 

02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:40.310
you'll know that  happened.

02:01:41.974 --> 02:01:44.206
Or if you got a user to 
reactivate their subscription 

02:01:44.207 --> 02:01:46.207
after  it expired.  You'll get a
real-time developer 

02:01:47.506 --> 02:01:49.506
notifications and  you now know 
to grant entitlement back.

02:01:51.009 --> 02:01:53.476
Remember, with real-time 
developer notifications, the  

02:01:53.477 --> 02:01:56.832
notification is only telling you
the subscription state changed.

02:01:59.894 --> 02:02:02.131
You still need to call and query
the full state of the  

02:02:02.132 --> 02:02:04.132
subscription and know exactly 
what action you need to take 

02:02:09.405 --> 02:02:11.916
with  that subscri.
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  Real-time 

02:02:11.917 --> 02:02:14.186
developer notifications has  
become an essential 

02:02:17.464 --> 02:02:19.730
part of our top developer 
subscription  setup.  Check out 

02:02:19.731 --> 02:02:21.731
the details of how to set 

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:26.510
this up under this  link which 
takes you to the developer page 

02:02:26.511 --> 02:02:29.558
with all the details.
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Remember, if you

02:02:29.559 --> 02:02:32.239
want to future proof your  
integration, be sure 

02:02:38.363 --> 02:02:40.992
to use both the Play Billing 
Library and  the real-time 

02:02:40.993 --> 02:02:43.847
developer notifications.
Whew, that was a lot of stuff.  

02:02:43.848 --> 02:02:46.083
Give us a lot of stuff.   We'll 
real quick recap all the stuff 

02:02:50.407 --> 02:02:52.407
we introduced and told you  
about.

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:55.951
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  We started off
talking about how much users  

02:02:55.952 --> 02:03:00.029
love subscriptions thanks to the
great work you've done and the  

02:03:00.030 --> 02:03:02.030
great products and subscription 

02:03:03.304 --> 02:03:05.304
services you've launched and are
operating.

02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:08.418
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  We shared with 
you 12 new features,  including 

02:03:08.419 --> 02:03:10.419
many built 

02:03:12.121 --> 02:03:13.548
around the new subscription 
center.

02:03:13.549 --> 02:03:15.577
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  Finally, you can
integrate with real-time  

02:03:15.578 --> 02:03:17.578
developer notifications so 
you're ready with new 

02:03:21.692 --> 02:03:22.719
features, and  we talked about 
Play Billing Library.

02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:26.109
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  Obviously, 
this is only day one of I/O.   

02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:27.890
There are great sessions to 
check out.  We recommend the  

02:03:27.891 --> 02:03:30.943
6:00 p.m. session on games today
which will also talk about  

02:03:30.944 --> 02:03:33.806
subscriptions and games.  
Tomorrow at 9:30, you can learn 

02:03:33.807 --> 02:03:37.879
much  more about all the great 
reports we only touched on 

02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.103
today.
&gt;&gt; ANGELA YING:  You can also 

02:03:40.104 --> 02:03:43.375
check out demos of a lot of  
features we've announced in the 

02:03:43.376 --> 02:03:45.376
sandbox, which is over there.

02:03:47.448 --> 02:03:49.448
And we also have an office hours
specifically for Google Play  

02:03:52.827 --> 02:03:54.056
subscriptions tomorrow at 2:30 
p.m.

02:03:54.057 --> 02:03:56.057
&gt;&gt; LARRY YANG:  If you have more

02:03:57.996 --> 02:03:59.061
questions, join us in the  
Android play conversation area 

02:03:59.062 --> 02:04:01.937
just on the other side of the  
wooden deck to your right as you

02:04:03.366 --> 02:04:05.366
walk out, right after this  
session.

02:04:05.398 --> 02:04:07.398
Lastly, we would love to get 
your feedback.

02:04:09.035 --> 02:04:11.259
After all, how  is Niko going to
get better at his jokes if we 

02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:15.130
don't give him  feedback?
Okay.  That's it, everyone.  

02:04:15.131 --> 02:04:17.131
Thank you very much and enjoy  
the 

02:04:18.195 --> 02:04:20.229
rest of your I/O.
&gt;&gt; NIKO SCHROER:  Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Hello.  Welcome to our talk. 
My name is Jonathan Chung.   I'm

02:29:13.503 --> 02:29:17.836
a U.S. lead to Material Design 
team.

02:29:19.465 --> 02:29:21.465
&gt;&gt; NICK BUTCHER:  I'm Nick 
Butcher and a 

02:29:24.184 --> 02:29:26.416
design engineer on  the team.

02:29:29.628 --> 02:29:32.774
&gt;&gt; WILL LARCHE:  And I'm Will.  
I'm an engineer with Material  

02:29:32.775 --> 02:29:33.591
Design.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN CHUNG:  Today we're 

02:29:33.592 --> 02:29:35.592
excited 

02:29:36.671 --> 02:29:37.468
to talk about how to  build 
Material Design product across 

02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:42.365
platform.  Again, what is  
Material Design, given all the 

02:29:42.366 --> 02:29:44.806
new announcements we just made, 
how has it evolved from what we 

02:29:44.807 --> 02:29:46.807
knew before?

02:29:49.705 --> 02:29:51.705
Material Design is an adaptable 
design 

02:29:52.763 --> 02:29:55.209
system, backed by  open-source 
code that helps teams easily 

02:29:55.210 --> 02:29:57.210
build high quality  digital 
experiences.

02:29:59.149 --> 02:30:00.763
In other words, it helps you 
build beautiful and usable  

02:30:00.764 --> 02:30:02.764
products really fast.

02:30:04.855 --> 02:30:06.884
In 2014, when we first launched,
we had zero customers.

02:30:10.767 --> 02:30:13.449
Now,  we have over 1.5 million 
apps using Material Design.

02:30:14.450 --> 02:30:16.521
That is incredible.  And based 
on this huge number of  

02:30:18.761 --> 02:30:20.761
customers, we've really listened
and 

02:30:22.256 --> 02:30:24.256
continued to improve our  
system.

02:30:27.810 --> 02:30:29.810
So today, we launched material 
theming, 

02:30:31.679 --> 02:30:33.925
our end-to-end  product 
capability that makes it easy to

02:30:33.926 --> 02:30:36.210
make Material Design  yours.
Now, I'm sure some of you are 

02:30:36.211 --> 02:30:39.877
very eager to learn more, but  
maybe some of you are still 

02:30:39.878 --> 02:30:41.514
wondering if Material Design is 
appropriate for you, and for 

02:30:41.515 --> 02:30:43.549
your company.

02:30:47.018 --> 02:30:49.018
So I'm going to start off by 
walking 

02:30:54.721 --> 02:30:56.721
through the newly  designed 
Material.iO site.

02:31:00.704 --> 02:31:02.704
And then Nick will talk about 
Material 

02:31:05.143 --> 02:31:05.795
Design tools that will  make 
customization really effortless.

02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:12.100
And then Will will talk about a 
library 

02:31:13.383 --> 02:31:15.383
of open-source code  that can be
used across all platforms.

02:31:16.418 --> 02:31:18.467
Let me give you three reasons 
why you should really consider  

02:31:18.468 --> 02:31:20.896
using Material Design.
First, Material Design is also 

02:31:20.897 --> 02:31:24.963
for developers.
You've given us a lot of 

02:31:24.964 --> 02:31:29.890
feedback that it has not been 
easy  for you to apply and build

02:31:29.891 --> 02:31:31.891
apps using Material Design.

02:31:33.957 --> 02:31:35.957
Now, with Material theming and 
all the 

02:31:38.657 --> 02:31:39.671
tools we built to  support this 
new capability, we're now 

02:31:39.672 --> 02:31:44.168
imparting designers to  create 
with an eye towards the code 

02:31:44.169 --> 02:31:46.169
that you will be developing.

02:31:47.852 --> 02:31:49.852
Material Design is a truly 

02:31:50.906 --> 02:31:53.744
cross-platform framework.  We  
understand how critical it is to

02:31:55.777 --> 02:31:56.989
build a consistent user  
experience that works across 

02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:59.507
platforms.
Using Material Design will 

02:31:59.508 --> 02:32:01.508
benefit your 

02:32:02.626 --> 02:32:05.523
users using multiple  devices.
We also understand that building

02:32:05.524 --> 02:32:07.990
high quality products takes  a 
long time.

02:32:12.125 --> 02:32:13.781
So not only we're encouraging 
cross-platform consistency, but 

02:32:13.782 --> 02:32:15.782
also 

02:32:16.865 --> 02:32:18.865
providing the code to start 
developing 

02:32:25.686 --> 02:32:27.686
on Android, iOS,  Web, and 
Flutter.

02:32:29.383 --> 02:32:31.383
Now we're going to put that to 
the test.

02:32:31.453 --> 02:32:33.477
Imagine building a screen like 
this.  In my experience,  

02:32:33.478 --> 02:32:36.536
building a screen like this and 
doing it right will likely take 

02:32:36.537 --> 02:32:38.357
some time.
With the power of Material 

02:32:38.358 --> 02:32:42.642
Design, we're now making it 
easier  than ever to design and 

02:32:42.643 --> 02:32:44.890
build screens like this across  
platforms.

02:32:48.547 --> 02:32:50.805
All that magic starts right here
with the redesigned site.

02:32:54.484 --> 02:32:56.484
The new site is now broken into 
design, develop, and tools.

02:32:57.758 --> 02:32:59.803
And in each of those sections, 
you'll find all of the great  

02:32:59.804 --> 02:33:02.230
resources that our team has 
created for you.

02:33:05.710 --> 02:33:07.710
Design guidelines, tools, 
research 

02:33:10.547 --> 02:33:13.247
insights, open open-source  
code, you name it, it's all 

02:33:13.248 --> 02:33:15.248
there.

02:33:16.313 --> 02:33:18.313
We're going to check out the 
site in greater detail now.

02:33:19.838 --> 02:33:21.253
The design section still has 
everything that you loved about 

02:33:21.254 --> 02:33:23.510
Material Design.  It's all 
there.  Nothing is gone.

02:33:26.889 --> 02:33:29.149
In addition, we're now featuring
some of the most-read  articles 

02:33:29.150 --> 02:33:31.150
on the top of 

02:33:33.213 --> 02:33:35.213
the page to help you find 
content faster.

02:33:36.076 --> 02:33:38.076
We're still very much focused on
helping 

02:33:39.946 --> 02:33:41.568
you design products  that are 
beautiful, with our background 

02:33:41.569 --> 02:33:43.628
and design.
Here you can see the articles we

02:33:45.868 --> 02:33:47.868
provided for you and learn  
about system 

02:33:49.544 --> 02:33:51.544
icons, generate your own 
custom-color 

02:33:54.238 --> 02:33:56.238
palette, pick  a typeface that 
works for 

02:33:57.506 --> 02:33:59.125
your brand and really harness 
the  power of shapes in your UI.

02:33:59.126 --> 02:34:04.488
The last section talks about 
material studies, which we  

02:34:04.489 --> 02:34:08.238
showcase all the flexibility of 
Material Design, regardless if  

02:34:08.239 --> 02:34:11.106
you're building for retail, for 
communications, or even  

02:34:14.369 --> 02:34:16.369
something as complex as a travel
app.

02:34:17.208 --> 02:34:19.208
It's all there and we've tested 
it, and 

02:34:20.258 --> 02:34:22.258
it's all there for  you to check
out.

02:34:26.554 --> 02:34:28.385
The Material Design guidance has
also been expanded and  enhanced

02:34:28.386 --> 02:34:30.386
into 

02:34:33.078 --> 02:34:33.679
Material system, Material 
foundation and Material  

02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:35.680
guidelines.

02:34:37.184 --> 02:34:39.233
Starting with the Material 
system section we're giving you 

02:34:39.234 --> 02:34:41.234
the general overview of Material
metaphors.

02:34:43.934 --> 02:34:45.934
Then the foundation dives into 
the 

02:34:47.864 --> 02:34:49.864
foundational UI practices,  so 
mentions 

02:34:50.936 --> 02:34:52.150
structural things like color, 
iconography, shape,  layout, and

02:34:52.151 --> 02:34:54.417
more.
Now, the guidelines section 

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:56.418
gives 

02:34:57.764 --> 02:34:59.764
tactical guidance on how to  
create a material product.

02:34:59.795 --> 02:35:01.795
And the best thing about this is
that 

02:35:02.876 --> 02:35:04.876
all of these great  design 
guidelines 

02:35:06.326 --> 02:35:08.326
are closely linked with 
engineering.

02:35:09.836 --> 02:35:11.884
Now, let's take a look at some 
of the other features on the  

02:35:11.885 --> 02:35:14.544
site that's going to be helpful 
for you when you're building  

02:35:14.545 --> 02:35:16.545
your product.

02:35:19.222 --> 02:35:22.060
We know how having a detailed 
spec makes the engineering  

02:35:22.061 --> 02:35:23.925
process ten times faster.  
That's why we're providing this 

02:35:23.926 --> 02:35:26.192
view  called spec viewer in the 
articles.

02:35:28.678 --> 02:35:30.935
In this spec viewer, we're now 
exposing all of the useful  

02:35:30.936 --> 02:35:35.504
information about this image.
Clicking through the menu on the

02:35:35.505 --> 02:35:37.505
right, 

02:35:38.766 --> 02:35:40.766
you'll have access to  all of 
the 

02:35:42.052 --> 02:35:44.948
different types of layers about 
this image.  You can  just read 

02:35:44.949 --> 02:35:46.776
the image only, see the 
measurements, text, color,  

02:35:46.777 --> 02:35:48.777
shape and elevation, see the 
different 

02:35:51.466 --> 02:35:53.919
components used in this  UI, or 
even additional notes we might 

02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:55.982
have added.
Let's take a look at this text 

02:35:58.061 --> 02:36:00.061
annotation.

02:36:01.348 --> 02:36:04.232
So in this annotation you will 
not only see the font name,  

02:36:04.233 --> 02:36:06.233
size, and color, but 

02:36:07.696 --> 02:36:09.762
also link to a Google font site 
that our  team has built.

02:36:11.403 --> 02:36:13.888
We wanted to serve these useful 
resources to you in the  context

02:36:13.889 --> 02:36:17.584
of your work flow so everything 
you need is right there.

02:36:20.866 --> 02:36:21.878
Now, when you navigate to the 
Google font sites, you will be  

02:36:21.879 --> 02:36:23.879
able to 

02:36:24.957 --> 02:36:26.957
download and use any of the 
fonts used 

02:36:28.221 --> 02:36:30.221
in our moths.

02:36:33.131 --> 02:36:35.561
We also conducted research on 
the most effective ways to  

02:36:35.562 --> 02:36:38.836
deliver the guidelines and we 
found interactive content  

02:36:38.837 --> 02:36:41.281
increased the level of 
understanding for our readers.

02:36:41.282 --> 02:36:44.538
We're starting to introduce 
content that is interactive in  

02:36:44.539 --> 02:36:46.539
our articles.

02:36:51.247 --> 02:36:52.673
Here is an example of a Material
palet generator placed  online 

02:36:52.674 --> 02:36:54.911
with the article.
Through this tool you'll be able

02:36:54.912 --> 02:36:56.912
to 

02:36:58.846 --> 02:37:00.846
learn about the improved  color 
system.

02:37:01.085 --> 02:37:03.112
.
So those are some new features 

02:37:03.113 --> 02:37:06.369
we're adding to the design  
section, but how do you build 

02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:08.370
all this?  That's what you're 
here  for, right?

02:37:11.479 --> 02:37:13.479
The develop section now features
and has 

02:37:14.753 --> 02:37:16.753
access to all of the  
open-source code 

02:37:20.715 --> 02:37:22.715
for Android, iOS, Web, and 
Flutter.

02:37:25.472 --> 02:37:27.121
So while respecting the platform
conventions, we wanted to  make 

02:37:27.122 --> 02:37:29.122
sure it 

02:37:30.434 --> 02:37:32.434
works across platforms and not 
just on Android.

02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:35.715
And you'll be able to play with 
these components in our  

02:37:35.716 --> 02:37:38.590
catalogs.
If you scroll down, you can see 

02:37:38.591 --> 02:37:41.858
the section called developer  
resources.  So similar to the 

02:37:41.859 --> 02:37:43.859
design section, we 

02:37:45.352 --> 02:37:46.585
wanted to  provide the resources
that you can use to build your 

02:37:46.586 --> 02:37:48.225
product.
Let's say you're not as familiar

02:37:48.226 --> 02:37:53.134
with any of this.  Scroll to  
the bottom even more.  And 

02:37:53.135 --> 02:37:55.565
you'll find tutorials to get 
started  on this.

02:37:58.445 --> 02:38:00.890
Switching gears to the tools 
section.  So the tools section  

02:38:00.891 --> 02:38:03.362
has links to all of the great 
resources we built for you.

02:38:06.423 --> 02:38:08.262
Starting with gallery, which is 
a part that I love and have  

02:38:08.263 --> 02:38:10.263
been using to 

02:38:11.996 --> 02:38:13.996
share designs with my team, I 
love this product,  gallery.

02:38:20.219 --> 02:38:22.219
Gallery makes collaboration so 
easy and so seamless.

02:38:23.286 --> 02:38:25.286
Nick will give you more details 
about gallery in a minute.

02:38:26.574 --> 02:38:28.610
On the right you will have 
access to the five full sets of 

02:38:28.611 --> 02:38:30.611
stylized icons 

02:38:31.961 --> 02:38:33.961
available in a range of formats,
sizes, and  densities.

02:38:36.848 --> 02:38:39.316
In the bottom, you will see the 
material theme editor or  

02:38:39.317 --> 02:38:43.013
sketch.  What is a theme editor?
If you haven't heard from  other

02:38:43.014 --> 02:38:45.014
talks 

02:38:48.395 --> 02:38:51.071
already, the theme editor is a 
plug-in that lets you  express 

02:38:51.072 --> 02:38:53.072
your brand 

02:38:56.419 --> 02:38:58.419
through color, iconography, 
typography, and  shape.

02:38:58.874 --> 02:39:00.874
Through the theme editor you'll 
be able 

02:39:03.382 --> 02:39:05.644
to pick the themes we  provided 
for you and customize it to make

02:39:05.645 --> 02:39:07.645
it yourself.

02:39:09.891 --> 02:39:11.993
These sets of components,can be 
used in your designs right  

02:39:11.994 --> 02:39:13.994
away.

02:39:15.254 --> 02:39:17.911
What's great about the theme 
editor is all our guidances  

02:39:17.912 --> 02:39:19.912
mentioned in our 

02:39:22.383 --> 02:39:24.383
guidelines is directly integrate
into .

02:39:25.563 --> 02:39:27.563
What if you want to change 
something later on?  No problem.

02:39:28.666 --> 02:39:30.666
Here is an example of choosing a

02:39:32.742 --> 02:39:34.742
color from the material color  
pallet 

02:39:38.904 --> 02:39:41.795
and applying it to the entire 
library of components.  I  find 

02:39:41.796 --> 02:39:43.796
this so useful and makes it to 
easy.

02:39:46.757 --> 02:39:47.978
Now I'll hand it off to my 
colleague Nick to talk about the

02:39:47.979 --> 02:39:52.263
editor.
&gt;&gt; NICK BUTCHER:  Thanks, 

02:39:52.264 --> 02:39:54.264
Jonathan.

02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:58.018
So we've seen how the materials 
system and guidelines makes  it 

02:39:58.019 --> 02:40:00.019
easy to bring your unique brand 
into your apps.

02:40:02.313 --> 02:40:05.172
I'll walk you through an example
how you do this to  demonstrate 

02:40:05.173 --> 02:40:07.173
how easy it is 

02:40:08.848 --> 02:40:11.136
to do and show you how the 
material  tooling makes this 

02:40:11.137 --> 02:40:13.204
process from design through 
development much  faster.

02:40:17.744 --> 02:40:19.744
I was part of an awesome team 
that 

02:40:23.478 --> 02:40:25.104
designed and build the  Google 
I/O app.  Maybe some of you have

02:40:25.105 --> 02:40:27.105
used it.  There are some  new 
components in here.

02:40:32.036 --> 02:40:34.036
But we didn't want to use all 
the new  

02:40:35.129 --> 02:40:37.129
Material capabilities because we
didn't 

02:40:38.246 --> 02:40:40.246
want to spoil the fun  today.

02:40:41.327 --> 02:40:43.997
So I'm going to talk about how 
to bring this brand much  deeper

02:40:43.998 --> 02:40:45.998
into application.

02:40:47.069 --> 02:40:49.069
We like to think of this as a 
developer festival, almost.

02:40:51.629 --> 02:40:54.316
There's a lot of playfulness in 
this brand.  I like the motion  

02:40:54.317 --> 02:40:56.317
style.

02:40:58.849 --> 02:41:00.509
It's also expressed through the 
color pallet, which you  

02:41:00.510 --> 02:41:02.510
hopefully see all around you.

02:41:04.606 --> 02:41:06.606
It also picks up on things likes
layering and stats.

02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:10.880
We use  that as the illustration
style 

02:41:11.945 --> 02:41:14.414
as a kind of mark of the brand.
How can we apply these elements 

02:41:14.415 --> 02:41:16.671
into the app design?
Here I am in sketch.

02:41:19.773 --> 02:41:21.773
This is my design file generated
by 

02:41:22.833 --> 02:41:24.833
the  theme editor that Johnny 
just showed you.

02:41:28.158 --> 02:41:30.158
You see it's generated a bunch 
of stuff 

02:41:32.486 --> 02:41:35.338
for us, a bunch of  components, 
typography, scale, elevation 

02:41:35.339 --> 02:41:38.631
settings, so on and so  forth.
If I switch to the components 

02:41:38.632 --> 02:41:40.632
view here, 

02:41:43.951 --> 02:41:45.972
you can see there's  basically a
one-to-one for all the 

02:41:45.973 --> 02:41:47.973
components and 

02:41:49.050 --> 02:41:51.050
guidelines  generated for me, 
ready to use in my designs.

02:41:53.527 --> 02:41:55.970
Everything from back drops, from
fabs, to cards, you name it;  

02:41:55.971 --> 02:41:58.015
it's in here.
The best thing about these 

02:41:58.016 --> 02:42:00.016
components 

02:42:01.088 --> 02:42:03.088
and they're aware of  the 
Material theming system.

02:42:03.526 --> 02:42:05.549
Let me show you what I mean by 
that.  I switch back to the  

02:42:05.550 --> 02:42:07.550
theme, and open 

02:42:09.054 --> 02:42:11.054
up the theme editor from the 
sketch plug-ins  menu.

02:42:14.619 --> 02:42:16.619
This theme is set up using the 
I/O 

02:42:18.912 --> 02:42:20.912
indigo primary and  kind of teal
accent color.

02:42:22.391 --> 02:42:24.391
If I go to the color settings, 
and I 

02:42:26.062 --> 02:42:28.301
were to change this  primary 
color either by dragging around 

02:42:28.302 --> 02:42:31.869
or putting it directly,  it will
have a number of effects.  I'll 

02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:33.870
walk you through them.

02:42:35.557 --> 02:42:37.841
You notice this tonal palate.  
It's generated 10 different  

02:42:37.842 --> 02:42:40.759
tones of color from this one 
color I chose.  This is pretty  

02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:43.468
cool.  I'm going to geek out on 
this a little bit.

02:42:49.514 --> 02:42:51.508
It's not just being naive and 
taking the hue I selected and  

02:42:51.509 --> 02:42:53.509
doing the brightness and 
selecting the color that way.

02:42:55.765 --> 02:42:58.232
It's  trying to imitate how 
designers pick colors and it's 

02:42:58.233 --> 02:43:01.949
using that,  which hopefully 
will work great throughout your 

02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:04.842
application.
By selecting that, you can see 

02:43:04.843 --> 02:43:07.523
the entire color palate here  
has been updated.

02:43:10.439 --> 02:43:12.272
If I switch back to the 
components, the sticky sheet, 

02:43:12.273 --> 02:43:14.092
they're  all aware of that 
change in the theme color and 

02:43:14.093 --> 02:43:18.798
the change is  rippled out 
throughout all the elements.  

02:43:18.799 --> 02:43:20.660
There's a darker tone  for the 
status bar and so forth, which 

02:43:20.661 --> 02:43:24.095
is pretty powerful.
So how do we use this library we

02:43:25.326 --> 02:43:27.801
generated?
So switching over into my app 

02:43:27.802 --> 02:43:31.869
design file, this is some  
screens from the I/O app which I

02:43:31.870 --> 02:43:33.870
designed using those 

02:43:35.966 --> 02:43:37.966
components  in the library that 
theme 

02:43:39.844 --> 02:43:42.709
editor  editor generated for me.
If you haven't used the sketch's

02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:45.628
library feature it's pretty  
cool.  It's a way to share 

02:43:45.629 --> 02:43:47.629
components between different 
design  files or amongst your 

02:43:47.672 --> 02:43:52.171
team.  It's very powerful.
You access the library, and you 

02:43:52.172 --> 02:43:56.316
scroll down to this library I  
generated.  You see right here 

02:43:56.317 --> 02:43:58.963
all the components I just saw in
the sticky sheets nicely 

02:44:01.579 --> 02:44:04.467
arranged in this kind of tree  
structure.  We can choose the 

02:44:04.468 --> 02:44:06.958
component we want, the different
variance of the component, even 

02:44:06.959 --> 02:44:08.959
down to the different states the
component can be in.

02:44:12.476 --> 02:44:14.349
If I want to add a fab to my 
design, I can grab one from the 

02:44:14.350 --> 02:44:17.411
menu and drop it in.
You can see overrides allowing 

02:44:17.412 --> 02:44:19.412
you to 

02:44:22.527 --> 02:44:24.527
change the icon and so  on and 
so forth.

02:44:27.699 --> 02:44:28.923
So through theme editor you have
a huge array of components  you 

02:44:28.924 --> 02:44:30.557
can use.
So we understand the library how

02:44:30.558 --> 02:44:32.558
it's 

02:44:34.638 --> 02:44:36.638
generated and that, but  let's 
start customizing.

02:44:37.511 --> 02:44:39.511
I open up my editor.

02:44:42.047 --> 02:44:42.862
One of the first premise that 
might be  interesting from the 

02:44:42.863 --> 02:44:44.863
I/O brand is shape.

02:44:46.568 --> 02:44:48.568
You have this I and  prominent 
slash in between.

02:44:49.647 --> 02:44:51.759
I think it could be interesting 
to do the surface shape  

02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:53.760
treatment.

02:44:54.819 --> 02:44:56.819
We have this rounded corner 
surface shape.

02:44:57.694 --> 02:44:59.694
I'm going to switch to the 
angled 

02:45:01.842 --> 02:45:03.280
setting instead, and crank  up 
the corner radius on the top 

02:45:03.281 --> 02:45:05.281
left.

02:45:07.622 --> 02:45:09.622
I want to deeply embed  that 
into my product.

02:45:10.073 --> 02:45:12.722
I hit save in the library and 
switch over to my design file,  

02:45:12.723 --> 02:45:16.620
sketch pops this little purple 
bar in the corner letting me 

02:45:16.621 --> 02:45:19.361
know  the underlying library has
been updated.  If I click on 

02:45:19.362 --> 02:45:23.265
this,  it's going to give me a 
-- these are all the components 

02:45:23.266 --> 02:45:26.523
that are  going to be affected 
by these changes.  I can choose 

02:45:26.524 --> 02:45:28.988
whether to  select them or not. 
I'm going to take all these 

02:45:28.989 --> 02:45:31.433
changes.
So now any component which is 

02:45:31.434 --> 02:45:33.434
aware of the shape system is  
going to be updated.

02:45:35.739 --> 02:45:37.606
So if I zoom in on this bottom 
sheet here, for example, you  

02:45:37.607 --> 02:45:41.290
can see it picked up on that cut
corner.  Likewise, on this  

02:45:41.291 --> 02:45:43.337
raise button down here, it's 
shaped.

02:45:45.982 --> 02:45:47.982
Some of the components in the 
system 

02:45:49.234 --> 02:45:51.280
offer a different  variance 
which can or cannot pick up on 

02:45:51.281 --> 02:45:53.281
the parameter system.

02:45:55.797 --> 02:45:56.410
For example, here is a fab using
the standard circular  

02:45:56.411 --> 02:45:58.411
presentation.

02:45:59.708 --> 02:46:01.790
If I go into the symbol settings
I can select a different  

02:46:01.791 --> 02:46:04.655
alternative, if I want it to be 
aware of the pattern or not.

02:46:12.432 --> 02:46:14.274
I can pick up on the diamond 
shapes, or the circular, if I  

02:46:14.275 --> 02:46:16.275
want to.

02:46:17.538 --> 02:46:19.767
Seeking of variations, we 
introduced variance on text 

02:46:19.768 --> 02:46:21.815
fields  which seem to be 
performing really well.

02:46:24.870 --> 02:46:26.340
So I can go into my design and 
select the underlying text  

02:46:26.341 --> 02:46:28.341
field and switch it 

02:46:29.648 --> 02:46:31.289
out to a different variant from 
those  available in my sticky 

02:46:31.290 --> 02:46:33.290
sheet.

02:46:34.356 --> 02:46:36.394
So we have a different variance 
using this outline which is  

02:46:36.395 --> 02:46:38.395
much more unobvious.

02:46:40.075 --> 02:46:42.075
The next parameter I want to 
look at is typography.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.644
Currently the I/O app is using 
Google Sans which is their  

02:46:46.645 --> 02:46:49.504
brand type face.
I think we may be able to take 

02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:55.180
inspiration from a developer  
event and 

02:46:57.054 --> 02:46:58.475
take inspiration from developer 
environments and try a  

02:46:58.476 --> 02:47:00.476
mono-space font and see how it 
works.

02:47:02.638 --> 02:47:04.638
If I go to the typography 
settings from 

02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:08.120
the theme editor, it  has a 
scale here 

02:47:10.250 --> 02:47:11.527
that's been generated for me 
giving me semantic  stars I can 

02:47:11.528 --> 02:47:13.528
apply throughout my design.

02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:17.223
If I search for mono-space, I'm 
going to use Robotow one of  my 

02:47:17.224 --> 02:47:19.224
favorites.

02:47:20.484 --> 02:47:21.710
It's going to swap that out 
everywhere the font  was used.

02:47:24.776 --> 02:47:26.776
I can go in and manually change 
it, also.

02:47:27.245 --> 02:47:29.245
It's going to do something 
interesting.

02:47:31.151 --> 02:47:32.583
While it's set to Google Sans, 
it had a particular weight  and 

02:47:32.584 --> 02:47:34.584
font.

02:47:39.059 --> 02:47:41.938
When I switched it, the font 
size, tracking, and  weight, 

02:47:41.939 --> 02:47:44.882
changed as well.
So this looks at the font's 

02:47:46.507 --> 02:47:48.154
characteristics and corrects for
them to create an harmonious 

02:47:48.155 --> 02:47:50.155
scale.

02:47:51.447 --> 02:47:53.447
That means if your font you're 
choosing 

02:47:55.537 --> 02:47:57.537
as a different X  height or 
something 

02:47:59.089 --> 02:48:01.118
like that, it will adjust for 
that, for the  different types 

02:48:01.119 --> 02:48:03.119
of scale, to 

02:48:04.599 --> 02:48:06.599
produce this harmonious scale 
for  you.

02:48:08.119 --> 02:48:09.760
By selecting this font, it 
selecting the scale for me, 

02:48:09.761 --> 02:48:12.603
which  is pretty amazing.
Again, this notifies me the 

02:48:12.604 --> 02:48:17.290
library has been updated.  I can
take all those changes.  

02:48:17.291 --> 02:48:19.559
Everywhere I was using the other
font  family before in my 

02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:21.560
design, you can see 

02:48:28.207 --> 02:48:30.254
it's been updated to my  new 
typeface.

02:48:33.270 --> 02:48:36.031
(Applause)
Go theme editor.

02:48:38.078 --> 02:48:40.139
So these changes are looking 
pretty good to me.  I want to  

02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:42.140
share them with the rest of the 
team.

02:48:46.084 --> 02:48:48.084
You cannot only get really tight

02:48:49.566 --> 02:48:51.566
integration with theme  editor 
but also 

02:48:52.991 --> 02:48:55.151
with Gallery.
I can set the product or 

02:48:55.152 --> 02:48:58.644
subcollection in which to put 
this  and upload it straight 

02:48:58.645 --> 02:49:01.550
away.
So once that's uploaded, it's 

02:49:01.551 --> 02:49:03.551
ready to 

02:49:05.838 --> 02:49:07.838
be share we'd the  shared with 
the  

02:49:09.307 --> 02:49:11.307
team, so I get a unique URL I 
can share with the team.

02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:15.610
So in Gallery I get an overview 
of my 

02:49:18.093 --> 02:49:20.765
design work and update  new 
iterations.  I can see how it 

02:49:20.766 --> 02:49:22.766
evolved and I can comment and  
have a discussion about 

02:49:23.426 --> 02:49:25.426
different design features.

02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:28.572
I want to show you a favorite 
feature which is in spec mode.

02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:32.438
This makes it easy to hand off 
to developers and for  

02:49:32.439 --> 02:49:35.137
developers to get all the 
information we need out of a 

02:49:35.550 --> 02:49:37.806
design.
I get this inspection on the 

02:49:37.807 --> 02:49:39.807
right.

02:49:41.273 --> 02:49:43.273
When I hover over any  item, it 
will 

02:49:44.948 --> 02:49:47.397
red-line it for me 
automatically, gives me size,  

02:49:47.398 --> 02:49:49.398
position information, and 

02:49:50.691 --> 02:49:52.691
gives me the copy and all the 
typeface  information.

02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:56.150
And it will also pick up on any 
icons 

02:49:58.469 --> 02:50:00.339
you use from the  material 
theme, any material icons will 

02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:02.374
link out to the material  site. 
You can grab whatever you need, 

02:50:04.036 --> 02:50:06.036
straight away from there.

02:50:07.513 --> 02:50:08.950
Best of all, Gallery understands
the components that the  theme 

02:50:08.951 --> 02:50:10.951
editor creates.

02:50:12.016 --> 02:50:14.016
If I select this fab here, it's 
not 

02:50:15.084 --> 02:50:17.547
just  going to say, hey, this is
a blue circle.  It's going to 

02:50:17.548 --> 02:50:19.548
say,  hey, I recognize that's a 
fab.

02:50:20.854 --> 02:50:22.854
You can see it picks up it's a 
fab.

02:50:24.531 --> 02:50:26.773
Best of all, it offers  per 
platform reference to 

02:50:26.774 --> 02:50:28.401
documentation so developers can 
go  directly to the component 

02:50:28.402 --> 02:50:30.402
they 

02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:32.895
need to implement and they'll be
given any parameter changes 

02:50:32.896 --> 02:50:34.896
you've changed on the component,
as  well.

02:50:37.033 --> 02:50:39.033
I can't emphasize this enough.  
You're no longer handing over  a

02:50:41.315 --> 02:50:43.159
picture and saying, hey, I 
really hope you can implement 

02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:47.299
this.   Between theme editor and
Material design components, 

02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:50.189
they're the  same components.  
Which means you're saying use 

02:50:50.190 --> 02:50:53.043
this component  with these 
parameter changes to it.

02:50:56.366 --> 02:50:58.190
No longer is it a guessing  
game.

02:50:58.191 --> 02:51:00.191
So these changes look good to 
me.

02:51:04.811 --> 02:51:06.811
I'm going to open up the  
comment 

02:51:07.943 --> 02:51:09.943
feature and at Will and let him 
know 

02:51:12.915 --> 02:51:15.585
these changes have  been 
uploaded to Gallery and ready 

02:51:15.586 --> 02:51:18.039
for implementation.  Over to  
you, Will.

02:51:19.253 --> 02:51:20.071
&gt;&gt; WILL LARCHE:  Thanks, Nick.  
Isn't it great?

02:51:20.072 --> 02:51:22.072
(Applause)

02:51:23.117 --> 02:51:25.579
So I'm an engineer and Nick has 
just shared with me this  

02:51:25.580 --> 02:51:27.580
gallery project.  I got the 
link.

02:51:30.076 --> 02:51:32.076
I click on it and I get to  come
in 

02:51:34.413 --> 02:51:34.612
here and it will send me to the 
Material components  

02:51:34.613 --> 02:51:36.613
documentation.

02:51:40.062 --> 02:51:42.062
Now, what is Material 
components?

02:51:44.616 --> 02:51:46.616
Material components are an 
open-source 

02:51:48.918 --> 02:51:50.918
framework for  implementing 
Material Design.

02:51:52.438 --> 02:51:54.438
It's the same code Google uses 
in its apps.

02:51:56.520 --> 02:51:58.757
Each has dozens of components, 
and they can all do the cool  

02:51:58.758 --> 02:52:00.758
things Nick was talking about 
earlier.

02:52:03.266 --> 02:52:04.498
And since they're open-source 
there's no mystery.  They're  

02:52:04.499 --> 02:52:08.392
not magic boxes.  Everything is 
available to you to look at or  

02:52:08.393 --> 02:52:10.393
customize.

02:52:12.918 --> 02:52:14.918
And we invite you to please 
contribute code.

02:52:18.010 --> 02:52:18.809
So let's look at these new text 
fields in Material  components.

02:52:18.810 --> 02:52:20.810
How do I get them?

02:52:22.896 --> 02:52:24.896
Adding MDC to your code base is 
pretty  easy.

02:52:26.144 --> 02:52:28.402
If you're on Android you'll 
access the design support 

02:52:28.403 --> 02:52:30.403
library  through maven 

02:52:31.467 --> 02:52:33.467
using the standard support 
library setup.

02:52:36.208 --> 02:52:38.208
On Web you install a node 
module.

02:52:38.283 --> 02:52:40.283
On Flutter, you're done.

02:52:42.139 --> 02:52:44.139
Material components come built 
into  flutter.

02:52:49.639 --> 02:52:51.639
On iOS, you can use CoCo pods.

02:52:56.106 --> 02:52:58.106
Every text field has two parts: 
An input and controller.

02:53:01.474 --> 02:53:01.882
We're going to add MDC text 
field and controller to our app.

02:53:06.174 --> 02:53:08.174
We can lay it out using 
intrinsic content size.

02:53:11.087 --> 02:53:13.087
And maybe set the UI text field 
delegate.

02:53:16.207 --> 02:53:18.207
And the place holder will float 
across the border.

02:53:21.092 --> 02:53:22.515
If you're already using MDC, 
upgrading is pretty easy to get 

02:53:22.516 --> 02:53:24.516
these new designs.

02:53:29.276 --> 02:53:30.287
If you're using CoCo pods you 
just run pod update material  

02:53:30.288 --> 02:53:32.557
components.
Then you change from the old 

02:53:32.558 --> 02:53:34.558
class to 

02:53:36.237 --> 02:53:38.237
one of the new fancy  ones, like
Outlined, and you're done.

02:53:40.595 --> 02:53:43.258
By the way, these text fields 
are much better and much more  

02:53:43.259 --> 02:53:45.259
performance than the previous 
designs.

02:53:47.744 --> 02:53:49.797
We did a huge amount of research
in order to come up with  these 

02:53:49.798 --> 02:53:53.480
optimized designs.  A lot of 
research.  (Laughter)

02:53:58.175 --> 02:54:00.649
And it turns out that in long 
form, your users are much more  

02:54:00.650 --> 02:54:03.955
likely to see and interact with 
these text fields than the  

02:54:03.956 --> 02:54:06.814
previous design.
If you want to learn more about 

02:54:06.815 --> 02:54:08.815
the new text fields or  material
research, you 

02:54:11.731 --> 02:54:13.773
can watch the talk "measuring 
material"  Thursday at 12:30.

02:54:18.304 --> 02:54:20.304
So doing this on iOS is a 
breeze.  What about Android?

02:54:24.226 --> 02:54:26.226
Well,  you set the outline box 
style in our layout.

02:54:29.547 --> 02:54:31.382
On Web you replace an element 
with class MDC line ripple with 

02:54:31.383 --> 02:54:33.383
an element with 

02:54:35.532 --> 02:54:37.532
class MDC notched outline, with 
an SBG 

02:54:40.428 --> 02:54:42.428
with a  path of class MDC...

02:54:46.127 --> 02:54:48.127
and don't forgot the modifier 
class MDX  

02:54:50.611 --> 02:54:52.839
outlines (speaking quickly 
purposefully).  It couldn't be  

02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:54.840
simpler!

02:54:57.135 --> 02:54:59.382
Now, I'm a little bias because I
work on MDC Flutter, but I  

02:54:59.383 --> 02:55:01.383
think Flutter is the 

02:55:02.825 --> 02:55:03.940
perfect way to implement 
Material Design  across 

02:55:03.941 --> 02:55:06.790
platforms.  You do it once and 
you get both iOS and  Android.

02:55:06.791 --> 02:55:10.279
And MDC is baked right in.

02:55:13.746 --> 02:55:15.800
It is the default framework for 
Flutter.  Whenever you create  a

02:55:15.801 --> 02:55:17.801
new project, it's already 
linked.  I love it!

02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:23.175
So now you know that the 
material text fields can be 

02:55:23.176 --> 02:55:25.176
added to  your code, but there's
a lot more.

02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:30.558
You can find almost all of the 
Material guidelines components  

02:55:30.559 --> 02:55:32.559
in Material components.

02:55:34.247 --> 02:55:36.247
That's buttons, carts, chips,  

02:55:38.571 --> 02:55:39.800
dialogues, navigation tabs, ink 
ripples, there are dozens of  

02:55:39.801 --> 02:55:41.801
them now.

02:55:45.098 --> 02:55:47.772
They're all available to you now
at material material.io/develop.

02:55:47.773 --> 02:55:51.522
Since design is never done, more
are added all the time.

02:55:54.176 --> 02:55:56.176
So today, we've shown you the 
design 

02:55:57.442 --> 02:55:59.442
resources available to  you 
today on material.

02:56:01.966 --> 02:56:03.966
io, how theme editor, gallery, 
and the  

02:56:05.678 --> 02:56:07.937
material tools suite help you 
customize your designs for your 

02:56:07.938 --> 02:56:10.792
brand, and how material 
components make it easy to 

02:56:11.616 --> 02:56:13.616
implement  those designs across 
four 

02:56:16.855 --> 02:56:18.855
platforms, with precision and 
ease.

02:56:23.687 --> 02:56:28.640
What else can you do?  Go to our
design dome where you can  get 

02:56:28.641 --> 02:56:30.641
design reviews and demos and 
listen to your box talks.

02:56:35.443 --> 02:56:37.443
And  you can also go see the 
talk Code 

02:56:40.973 --> 02:56:42.973
Beautiful UI with Flutter and  
Material Design.

02:56:45.528 --> 02:56:47.528
And on Wednesday at 2:30 there's
a 

02:56:48.741 --> 02:56:50.741
session:

02:56:52.572 --> 02:56:54.572
Ask Flutter,  where you can come
to us 

02:56:55.666 --> 02:56:58.125
and ask how you can implement 
Material  Design into your 

02:56:58.126 --> 02:57:00.579
Flutter apps.
Thank you.

02:57:01.803 --> 02:57:03.803
(Applause)
&gt;&gt; WILL LARCHE:  All right.

&gt;&gt; Hi.

03:29:04.391 --> 03:29:06.391
I'm Jonathan Cheung

03:29:07.441 --> 03:29:09.441
, tech lead of the Google Play  
Console.

03:29:13.808 --> 03:29:15.808
And I'm here with Ignacio and 
David.

03:29:18.095 --> 03:29:20.179
We're excited to  talk to you 
about what Play console tools 

03:29:20.180 --> 03:29:23.690
you can take advantage  of in 
building and managing your 

03:29:23.691 --> 03:29:25.691
games.

03:29:27.585 --> 03:29:30.236
Fact, in the last few  years, 
the number of Android players 

03:29:30.237 --> 03:29:32.491
who have installed the game  has
more than doubled.

03:29:35.807 --> 03:29:38.454
Players from all around the 
world and  all different 

03:29:38.455 --> 03:29:41.341
backgrounds are enjoying an 
unprecedented amount  of new 

03:29:41.342 --> 03:29:43.342
game play experiences of 
Android.

03:29:45.678 --> 03:29:47.678
As game developers, this is your
chance.

03:29:49.558 --> 03:29:51.993
Your chance to  build new 
experiences, to connect to more 

03:29:51.994 --> 03:29:54.842
players, and to find  success in
the market.

03:29:56.884 --> 03:29:58.884
Whether you're a new developer 
building 

03:29:59.946 --> 03:30:01.838
your first game or  seasoned 
veteran of the industry, the 

03:30:01.839 --> 03:30:03.839
opportunity is yours to  grasp.

03:30:06.708 --> 03:30:08.708
That being said, with 
opportunity comes 

03:30:11.474 --> 03:30:13.474
a degree of risk.   Games 
development on mobile is an 

03:30:15.497 --> 03:30:18.972
ever-changing landscape and  
player expectations for mobile 

03:30:18.973 --> 03:30:21.273
games has never been higher.
There's more competition than 

03:30:21.274 --> 03:30:23.539
ever before in the marketplace.

03:30:27.603 --> 03:30:29.603
There are already 1 million 
games live 

03:30:30.707 --> 03:30:31.504
on the Play Store and  new games
are launching all the time on 

03:30:31.505 --> 03:30:34.363
Google Play.
Development costs are increasing

03:30:34.364 --> 03:30:36.364
due to 

03:30:37.821 --> 03:30:39.882
the demands of higher  fidelity 
on mobile games, and consumers 

03:30:39.883 --> 03:30:41.883
are 

03:30:43.140 --> 03:30:45.140
expecting more  feature-rich 
experiences on mobile.

03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:49.745
Finally, marketing games is 
getting increasingly more  

03:30:49.746 --> 03:30:51.746
difficult.  User acquisition 
spending is 

03:30:55.305 --> 03:30:57.416
increasing as  developers are 
more towards fewer larger 

03:30:57.417 --> 03:31:01.121
launches in a single  year.
As Google Play, we understand 

03:31:01.122 --> 03:31:06.025
these problems and want to help 
you where we can to bring as 

03:31:06.026 --> 03:31:08.128
much success as possible to your
games.

03:31:11.805 --> 03:31:14.481
We are committed to building 
tools to help you plan and  

03:31:14.482 --> 03:31:17.165
de-risk your launches, and to 
help you maintain and 

03:31:20.476 --> 03:31:22.476
support your  games after 
successful launch.

03:31:26.001 --> 03:31:27.216
Let us take you on a journey 
from pre- to post-launch which  

03:31:27.217 --> 03:31:31.314
will hopefully provide insights 
into some of the exciting tools 

03:31:31.315 --> 03:31:34.173
we have available for you.
We will be covering some 

03:31:34.174 --> 03:31:36.174
existing tools, 

03:31:40.324 --> 03:31:42.477
share some  interesting 
anecdotes and best practices, 

03:31:42.478 --> 03:31:44.478
and show off some new  tools 
which we feel will help you on 

03:31:44.711 --> 03:31:46.711
your road to success.

03:31:49.354 --> 03:31:51.354
First, prelaunch.

03:31:56.868 --> 03:31:59.141
This phase is critical for 
delivering to  your players, 

03:31:59.142 --> 03:32:00.970
whether that be the game 
experience yourself, the  

03:32:00.971 --> 03:32:04.444
stability and performance of 
your game, or in the content 

03:32:04.445 --> 03:32:06.271
road  map you have planned.
We're going to be going through 

03:32:06.272 --> 03:32:10.775
some areas of focus during  
prelaunch and also walk through 

03:32:10.776 --> 03:32:13.650
some of these tools we feel are 
helpful at this stage.

03:32:18.029 --> 03:32:21.121
First, and perhaps the most 
importantly, testing.  It is  

03:32:21.122 --> 03:32:23.174
crucial to get your testing 
strategy right when launching a 

03:32:23.175 --> 03:32:25.175
new  game.

03:32:26.913 --> 03:32:28.751
As you know, launching and 
maintaining games is an  

03:32:28.752 --> 03:32:31.203
expensive proposition.
It is critical to make sure that

03:32:31.204 --> 03:32:33.204
when 

03:32:34.447 --> 03:32:36.447
you launch your product  it will
be 

03:32:38.486 --> 03:32:40.486
stable and bug-free,

03:32:41.594 --> 03:32:43.594
resonate with your players from 
a game 

03:32:45.064 --> 03:32:47.742
play perspective, and have a 
sustainable road map to keep  

03:32:47.743 --> 03:32:49.804
players invested in your game.

03:32:54.306 --> 03:32:56.306
Internal testing allows you to 
publish 

03:32:57.839 --> 03:32:59.839
your APK in seconds  instead of 
hours.

03:33:00.940 --> 03:33:02.940
It also features integrations of
our 

03:33:05.220 --> 03:33:07.220
API and  other third-party 
plug-ins.

03:33:07.705 --> 03:33:09.705
Finally, it benefits from all 
the Google 

03:33:10.804 --> 03:33:13.062
Play products you've  come to 
love, such as in-app product 

03:33:13.063 --> 03:33:15.732
support, country targeting,  
LDL, and of course the newly 

03:33:18.733 --> 03:33:21.332
announced Android app bundle.

03:33:24.995 --> 03:33:26.995
Developers are using this new 
track to 

03:33:28.050 --> 03:33:29.480
do rapid iterative  testing, for
launching new games as well as 

03:33:29.481 --> 03:33:31.481
adding features to  existing 
games.

03:33:35.816 --> 03:33:36.826
For instance, using it to push 
daily builds to QA in order to  

03:33:36.827 --> 03:33:38.827
make sure 

03:33:39.843 --> 03:33:41.843
releases

03:33:45.023 --> 03:33:45.833
meets their quality, or using it
for  experimental builds for 

03:33:45.834 --> 03:33:47.834
friends and 

03:33:48.848 --> 03:33:50.848
colleagues

03:33:54.094 --> 03:33:55.720
in order to play  test new 
mechanics.

03:33:55.721 --> 03:33:57.783
Here is something to think 
about.  It's great to focus on  

03:33:57.784 --> 03:33:59.784
stability and 

03:34:01.876 --> 03:34:02.889
bugs, in order to judge every 
release against your  bar for 

03:34:02.890 --> 03:34:05.553
quality.
It can also be useful to start 

03:34:05.554 --> 03:34:07.554
testing 

03:34:09.605 --> 03:34:11.605
on a wide variety of  devices, 
so when 

03:34:12.702 --> 03:34:14.782
you decide to roll out to more 
players, you can  be certain 

03:34:14.783 --> 03:34:16.819
they receive the quality game 
play experience you  would want 

03:34:16.820 --> 03:34:18.820
them to receive.

03:34:21.106 --> 03:34:22.324
One of our most used feature for
game developers is closed  

03:34:22.325 --> 03:34:24.325
testing.

03:34:25.803 --> 03:34:27.803
Closed testing is a great 
opportunity 

03:34:30.278 --> 03:34:32.390
to build a  tight-knit 
opportunity of testers who can 

03:34:32.391 --> 03:34:34.391
provide you valuable  

03:34:36.079 --> 03:34:38.079
feedback before and after 
launch.

03:34:38.923 --> 03:34:40.923
Users can be invited directly 
from the 

03:34:42.401 --> 03:34:44.401
Play console using  email lists 
or Google groups.

03:34:46.662 --> 03:34:48.662
They can then opt in via web app
as shown in this picture.

03:34:52.223 --> 03:34:53.070
Once opted in they can install 
the game directly from the  Play

03:34:53.071 --> 03:34:55.071
Store.

03:34:57.976 --> 03:34:59.976
Over 60% of game developers on 
Play 

03:35:01.231 --> 03:35:01.847
already use this feature  and 
have found great success with 

03:35:01.848 --> 03:35:03.883
it.
Let's look at a case study.

03:35:08.133 --> 03:35:12.512
Brav aco really took to heart  
building a strong user comment 

03:35:12.513 --> 03:35:14.513
for their closed tests.

03:35:17.651 --> 03:35:19.651
They focused on the recruiting 
the right 

03:35:21.335 --> 03:35:22.756
sort of players,  reaching 
beyond the usual communities, to

03:35:22.757 --> 03:35:27.639
find the player they  felt would
be the theme of their game, 

03:35:27.640 --> 03:35:29.640
which is a military  shooter 
game.

03:35:32.159 --> 03:35:34.159
They went to this Air Soft event
and 

03:35:35.479 --> 03:35:37.479
recruited players  on-site to 
play their game.

03:35:43.248 --> 03:35:45.248
During the testing period, 
Bravoco made 

03:35:46.569 --> 03:35:48.569
sure they were able  24/7.

03:35:50.244 --> 03:35:52.503
They allowed them very specific 
valuable feedback but  also to 

03:35:52.504 --> 03:35:55.799
build connections with 
individual testers of their 

03:35:55.800 --> 03:35:58.253
game.
This dedication to building a 

03:35:58.254 --> 03:36:00.254
strong 

03:36:01.995 --> 03:36:03.995
test community paid off  
dividends, both 

03:36:05.472 --> 03:36:07.472
during testing and even after 
launch in 

03:36:08.544 --> 03:36:11.183
early  access where Forces of 
Freedom has now attracted more 

03:36:11.184 --> 03:36:13.184
than  10 million players and 
counting.

03:36:15.528 --> 03:36:17.590
In conclusion, here are some 
things to think about when using

03:36:17.591 --> 03:36:22.306
closed testing.  Create a strong
and diverse test community.   

03:36:22.307 --> 03:36:24.321
Remember, these players will be 
critical in shaping the initial 

03:36:26.410 --> 03:36:29.294
direction of your game.
Experiment with new game play 

03:36:29.295 --> 03:36:33.586
mechanics and content.  Don't  
be afraid of negative feedback. 

03:36:33.587 --> 03:36:35.424
Remember, your ratings and  
reviews are still not live at 

03:36:35.425 --> 03:36:38.326
this point.
And finally, think about 

03:36:38.327 --> 03:36:40.327
reaching out to 

03:36:42.375 --> 03:36:45.337
your testing  community to 
gather very specific feedback.  

03:36:45.338 --> 03:36:47.338
This is your chance  to ask them
what 

03:36:48.789 --> 03:36:50.789
works, what didn't work, and how
do we improve.

03:36:52.060 --> 03:36:56.986
Next, open testing.  Once a game
is technically solid and  your 

03:36:56.987 --> 03:36:58.624
main game play hooks are built 
in, it's time to think about  

03:36:58.625 --> 03:37:02.946
expanding your test to more 
players in preparation for your 

03:37:02.947 --> 03:37:04.947
big  launch.

03:37:06.214 --> 03:37:07.840
Open testing allows your game to
be discoverable and  installable

03:37:07.841 --> 03:37:09.841
on the 

03:37:12.981 --> 03:37:14.981
Play Store and for players, up 
to a 

03:37:16.027 --> 03:37:18.027
developer  defined cap, to opt 
in and install your game.

03:37:19.299 --> 03:37:21.299
Players won't be able to leave 
ratings 

03:37:22.404 --> 03:37:24.221
into it fully launches  but can 
provide anonymous feedback to 

03:37:24.222 --> 03:37:26.222
the developer at any time.

03:37:27.687 --> 03:37:29.124
Open testing comes in two 
flavors depending on the state 

03:37:29.125 --> 03:37:31.125
of  your game.

03:37:32.995 --> 03:37:35.637
If you don't have a production 
release already,  you're in the 

03:37:35.638 --> 03:37:37.638
same country 

03:37:38.699 --> 03:37:40.136
you're running the test in, 
users can  install your game 

03:37:40.137 --> 03:37:43.186
directly from the Play Store 
without needing  to opt in.  We 

03:37:43.187 --> 03:37:46.022
call this "early access."
Your game will be tagged as 

03:37:46.023 --> 03:37:48.023
unreleased, as shown in this  
image.

03:37:51.569 --> 03:37:53.408
If you have a production release
already, for instance, you  may 

03:37:53.409 --> 03:37:57.301
have soft launched in the same 
country, you can still  continue

03:37:57.302 --> 03:37:59.937
to use open testing.  Existing 
users will continue to  get 

03:38:02.809 --> 03:38:04.809
updates on the test track and 
new users 

03:38:06.326 --> 03:38:08.763
can opt in via a  console 
provided web link or a card 

03:38:08.764 --> 03:38:10.764
shown on the screen here, 

03:38:12.424 --> 03:38:14.424
at  the bottom of the game's 
details page.

03:38:17.812 --> 03:38:20.630
Players opted into an  open test
in this state will see the tags.

03:38:20.631 --> 03:38:25.589
So bringing together these forms
of testing, internal test  and 

03:38:25.590 --> 03:38:27.590
closed test, 

03:38:29.077 --> 03:38:30.491
you as the developers have 
control over who can  install 

03:38:30.492 --> 03:38:32.492
and play your game.

03:38:34.152 --> 03:38:35.403
Early access tests can be 
installed and discovered 

03:38:35.404 --> 03:38:37.648
directly  from the Play Store 
and they're a great way to 

03:38:37.649 --> 03:38:41.533
expand your  tester base, as 
well as building height around 

03:38:41.534 --> 03:38:43.366
your big launch.
Finally, open tests can be used 

03:38:43.367 --> 03:38:48.484
to continue testing with a  wide
audience even after your 

03:38:48.485 --> 03:38:50.485
production release.

03:38:51.739 --> 03:38:53.900
Utilize these testers to try out
new features and tweaks to  your

03:38:53.901 --> 03:38:56.676
game before rolling out to all 
your players.

03:39:00.554 --> 03:39:02.554
Moving on, prelaunch reports can
also 

03:39:05.037 --> 03:39:07.037
help developers iron  out 
quality and 

03:39:08.508 --> 03:39:10.508
performance issues prior to 
launch.

03:39:12.992 --> 03:39:13.796
Whenever  test ABK is uploaded a
non-deterministic bot will call 

03:39:13.797 --> 03:39:18.102
your name  while it's running on
a real physical device in one of

03:39:18.103 --> 03:39:19.945
our test  labs.
Game developers have found a lot

03:39:19.946 --> 03:39:24.064
of value in the prelaunch  
report.  90% of developers don't

03:39:24.065 --> 03:39:26.065
push to 

03:39:27.548 --> 03:39:29.548
production if the  report shows 
issues.

03:39:31.685 --> 03:39:33.685
Demo loops goes even further for
game developers.

03:39:35.767 --> 03:39:38.207
Records  and upload the game 
demo loop using 5 test lab and 

03:39:38.208 --> 03:39:43.104
receive a  report on craft and 
performance metrics including 

03:39:43.105 --> 03:39:45.105
the all  important frames per 
second.

03:39:46.992 --> 03:39:48.992
This allows you to discover 
rendering 

03:39:51.274 --> 03:39:53.274
issues even faster and  launch 
with greater confidence.

03:39:58.789 --> 03:40:01.766
The developers of titles such as
fruit ninja have found great  

03:40:01.767 --> 03:40:03.767
value in demo loops.

03:40:04.817 --> 03:40:06.817
They've developed a process 
around 

03:40:08.270 --> 03:40:10.330
demo  loops as it allows them to
check for visual glitches and 

03:40:10.331 --> 03:40:12.331
crashes  and performance and 
many other things.

03:40:15.027 --> 03:40:17.497
They rely on the fact that PLR 
will automatically run on a  

03:40:17.498 --> 03:40:20.476
wide range of devices and device
specs for every test release.

03:40:23.535 --> 03:40:25.535
How did they do this?

03:40:28.699 --> 03:40:30.699
Their new game, Endless Runner 
has a  

03:40:33.823 --> 03:40:36.684
built in replay functionality 
used to record game runs.

03:40:39.552 --> 03:40:41.383
They can instrument PLR game 
loops to run on these recorded  

03:40:41.384 --> 03:40:46.105
sessions.  Whereas before, it 
was a very manual process to 

03:40:46.106 --> 03:40:48.967
pick  up their benchmarking.  
Now, with PLR demo loops, it's 

03:40:50.633 --> 03:40:52.633
automated  for them for every 
test release.

03:40:53.952 --> 03:40:55.815
They can look at these metrics 
and compare them to every  

03:40:55.816 --> 03:40:57.816
previous release 

03:40:59.275 --> 03:41:00.291
to make sure their game has no 
regressions in  terms of 

03:41:00.292 --> 03:41:03.152
performance.
Before we move on to launching, 

03:41:03.153 --> 03:41:05.153
another 

03:41:06.758 --> 03:41:09.270
important aspect of  prelaunch 
is to plan your strategy around 

03:41:09.271 --> 03:41:11.271
content.

03:41:12.580 --> 03:41:14.580
As such,  don't be afraid to 
test longer and earlier.

03:41:17.659 --> 03:41:19.659
Consider using longer-term 
metrics like 

03:41:20.711 --> 03:41:22.711
D14 and D30 in order  to predict
future success.

03:41:23.978 --> 03:41:25.600
Measure the rate of content 
consumption during your testing 

03:41:25.601 --> 03:41:29.759
phase.  This can be useful for 
planning ahead, so that you have

03:41:29.760 --> 03:41:31.760
enough content for 

03:41:32.857 --> 03:41:33.859
your players when you launch 
until your first  big update.

03:41:37.982 --> 03:41:40.698
Also, this phase is a great 
opportunity to test what sort of

03:41:40.699 --> 03:41:44.572
live-up events will resonate 
with your player base so that 

03:41:44.573 --> 03:41:46.573
you  can create the content that

03:41:48.287 --> 03:41:50.287
your players will want to 
receive.

03:41:50.952 --> 03:41:52.992
It is also important to consider
how different forms of  testing 

03:41:52.993 --> 03:41:54.993
can be used 

03:41:56.285 --> 03:41:58.753
to achieve different purposes.
All testing tracks can be used 

03:41:58.754 --> 03:42:02.643
in unison with each other,  
allowing you to target different

03:42:02.644 --> 03:42:04.644
experiences to different groups 
of testers.

03:42:06.312 --> 03:42:08.312
For instance, you may want to 
consider 

03:42:10.856 --> 03:42:12.856
to run your daily bill  past 
your 

03:42:14.529 --> 03:42:16.172
internal test users to track for
regressions at the  same time 

03:42:16.173 --> 03:42:18.173
you're 

03:42:20.077 --> 03:42:22.077
running large open scale test 
for open access.

03:42:23.755 --> 03:42:26.419
Closed testing can also be used 
for specific game play  

03:42:26.420 --> 03:42:28.420
mechanics to select 

03:42:29.899 --> 03:42:31.899
users before running out to 
production  users.

03:42:33.561 --> 03:42:35.214
Finally, you should always keep 
in mind that mobile games  

03:42:35.215 --> 03:42:38.281
development is ever-changing 
landscape.  New technologies are

03:42:38.282 --> 03:42:40.282
opening up new 

03:42:42.835 --> 03:42:45.472
ways to play, and player 
expectations of mobile  are 

03:42:45.473 --> 03:42:47.485
ever-changing.  Remember to 
continue to evaluate your  

03:42:49.080 --> 03:42:51.149
processes around development and
testing, see what works, what  

03:42:51.150 --> 03:42:55.228
doesn't work, and most 
importantly do not be afraid of 

03:42:55.229 --> 03:42:58.088
change.
With that, I would like to hand 

03:42:58.089 --> 03:43:02.411
over to Ignacio who is going  to
talk to you about launching 

03:43:02.412 --> 03:43:04.412
games on Google Play.

03:43:07.416 --> 03:43:10.072
(Applause)
&gt;&gt; IGNACIO MONEREO:  Thanks, 

03:43:10.073 --> 03:43:12.073
Jonathan.  Hi, everyone.

03:43:14.849 --> 03:43:17.507
I'm  Ignacio, part of the Play 
team based in London.  I have 

03:43:17.508 --> 03:43:19.747
the  privilege and honor to work
with many game developers like 

03:43:19.748 --> 03:43:23.016
you.   Let's talk about 
launching your game.  I'm pretty

03:43:23.017 --> 03:43:25.017
sure by now  you have tested and
tested your game.

03:43:29.568 --> 03:43:31.612
And you are 100%  confident or 
let's say at least 95% confident

03:43:31.613 --> 03:43:36.991
that your game is  ready both 
from the back end and front end 

03:43:36.992 --> 03:43:41.494
to receive a lot of  users, that
as well your customer teams are 

03:43:41.495 --> 03:43:44.366
ready to manage the  community, 
create new live events, or deal 

03:43:44.367 --> 03:43:47.845
with the feedback,  but above 
all that your game is lots of 

03:43:47.846 --> 03:43:49.846
fun.

03:43:51.875 --> 03:43:53.992
And soAnd it's still scary, 
right?

03:43:59.410 --> 03:44:01.410
in the Play Console we hopefully
have 

03:44:03.720 --> 03:44:05.720
some tools to help you  reach 
levels of confidence.

03:44:05.970 --> 03:44:08.241
We'll talk about three in 
particular.  Device catalog,  

03:44:08.242 --> 03:44:10.242
preregistration, and then last, 
country targeting.

03:44:12.364 --> 03:44:14.364
Let's look at them in further 
detail.

03:44:17.276 --> 03:44:19.276
So device catalog, this feature 
is very popular.

03:44:20.944 --> 03:44:22.944
And the  reason is because it 
helps 

03:44:27.270 --> 03:44:29.115
you make better decisions when  
getting back fixes and 

03:44:29.116 --> 03:44:31.116
delivering the right experience 
for each  device.

03:44:34.688 --> 03:44:36.374
Since launch last year we've 
seen 66% of developers are using

03:44:36.375 --> 03:44:38.375
it on a monthly basis.

03:44:39.664 --> 03:44:41.505
We all know Android is 
incredible with  hundreds of 

03:44:41.506 --> 03:44:44.792
manufacturers and thousands of 
devices.  So let's  turn these 

03:44:44.793 --> 03:44:48.042
into an opportunity and try to 
deliver the best  experience 

03:44:48.043 --> 03:44:50.043
based on relevant factors 

03:44:51.107 --> 03:44:53.354
such as SOC, RAM, or CPU.
But during this process, there's

03:44:53.355 --> 03:44:57.045
one key thing to remember,  
which is essentially to think 

03:44:57.046 --> 03:45:01.776
big.  What I mean by think big 
is  just let's try to include as

03:45:01.777 --> 03:45:04.694
many devices by default as  
possible.

03:45:08.575 --> 03:45:10.206
Excluding devices should be a 
temporary measure until some of 

03:45:10.207 --> 03:45:13.481
these bugs are fixed.
Let's look at the device title 

03:45:13.482 --> 03:45:15.482
page.

03:45:17.309 --> 03:45:19.549
The device detail page is a 
feature that allows you to 

03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:21.550
review  individually 

03:45:23.035 --> 03:45:25.035
thousands of devices and 
identify 

03:45:26.233 --> 03:45:28.341
relevant criteria  such as RAM, 
CPU, so forth.

03:45:30.785 --> 03:45:32.785
.

03:45:35.902 --> 03:45:37.902
So we added things, such as the 

03:45:39.169 --> 03:45:41.828
unsupported reason, since  last 
year, so you can very quickly 

03:45:41.829 --> 03:45:43.829
identify why a device isn't  
supported by your game.

03:45:47.183 --> 03:45:49.044
Lastly, I wanted to highlight 
also some interesting  

03:45:49.045 --> 03:45:52.386
information that the device 
detail page is dividing.   

03:45:52.387 --> 03:45:54.387
Essentially, the number of 
active 

03:45:55.938 --> 03:45:57.938
devices in this particular  
game, the 

03:45:59.426 --> 03:46:01.426
average rating, and the revenues

03:46:05.597 --> 03:46:07.843
generated by either  purchases 
or subscriptions in the last 

03:46:07.844 --> 03:46:10.485
month.
So what are some developers 

03:46:10.486 --> 03:46:12.486
saying about this?

03:46:15.026 --> 03:46:17.026
So a mobile  developer from 
Barcelona, 

03:46:18.917 --> 03:46:20.917
they launched a very popular 
game:  Respondables, which 

03:46:26.071 --> 03:46:28.071
is launched in 2013, and since 
then 

03:46:30.631 --> 03:46:31.666
they've  seen more than 2 
billion battles played by the 

03:46:31.667 --> 03:46:33.667
players.

03:46:35.146 --> 03:46:37.146
So they check the device catalog
two or three times a week.

03:46:39.074 --> 03:46:41.074
They exclude those devices that 
do not 

03:46:42.594 --> 03:46:43.871
meet the minimum  requirements 
in order to deliver a great user

03:46:43.872 --> 03:46:46.121
experience.
Second, they isolate the bugs.

03:46:50.638 --> 03:46:52.638
Third, they prioritize device 
support, 

03:46:55.978 --> 03:46:58.022
as well as these bug   fixes.
Thanks to this feature, they've 

03:46:58.023 --> 03:47:02.752
seen increase in user  
experience, and ratings, as well

03:47:02.753 --> 03:47:04.753
on the overall quality and  
performance of the game.

03:47:06.215 --> 03:47:07.648
So in conclusion, I wanted to 
highlight three things to  

03:47:07.649 --> 03:47:11.932
remember.  So the first one: 
Think big and support as many  

03:47:11.933 --> 03:47:14.412
devices as possible.
Second, if we have to exclude 

03:47:14.413 --> 03:47:19.494
some devices, try to do it in a 
temporary way so we can fix all 

03:47:19.495 --> 03:47:21.737
those bugs and increase our  
chances to reach a bigger 

03:47:21.951 --> 03:47:23.951
audience.

03:47:25.021 --> 03:47:27.478
And then, last, use the device 
detail page to get very  

03:47:27.479 --> 03:47:29.519
relevant information such as, 
for example, the unsupported  

03:47:32.782 --> 03:47:34.782
reason, or their average 
revenues or average rating.

03:47:38.583 --> 03:47:40.583
And with this, let's move on to 
the next 

03:47:43.233 --> 03:47:45.233
functionality  feature: 
Preregistration.

03:47:49.224 --> 03:47:51.879
We all know in gaming creating 
excitement before launch is  

03:47:51.880 --> 03:47:53.916
increasing popular.
The preregistration has two 

03:47:53.917 --> 03:47:58.212
benefits.  As a player, it's  
clear.  You can preregister and 

03:47:58.213 --> 03:48:01.511
then when the game is launched  
you'll receive a notification to

03:48:01.512 --> 03:48:04.408
install the game.  We all know  
in certain types of games 

03:48:07.691 --> 03:48:10.161
-- multiplayer, competitive 
games in  general -- it's 

03:48:10.162 --> 03:48:12.162
critical to have a very 

03:48:14.478 --> 03:48:15.695
early, or get on early  into the
game.

03:48:15.696 --> 03:48:17.755
However, from a developer 
perspective, I can see there's 

03:48:17.756 --> 03:48:19.756
two  main benefits here.  The 
first one is you can start 

03:48:22.553 --> 03:48:24.553
marketing  early, and capture 
the audience's interest.

03:48:27.966 --> 03:48:29.966
As well, by  monitoring the 

03:48:30.985 --> 03:48:32.612
preregistration count we have an
indication of  the influx of 

03:48:32.613 --> 03:48:36.767
users at launch and we can plan 
ahead not only  from a server 

03:48:36.768 --> 03:48:39.436
side but also, like, marketing.
Let's look another a case study.

03:48:43.591 --> 03:48:45.591
Next one is a Korean  developer,
and 

03:48:49.369 --> 03:48:51.880
creator of Durango Wild lands 
launched in  January 25, 2018 in

03:48:51.881 --> 03:48:54.405
Korea.
They started preregistration six

03:48:54.406 --> 03:49:01.929
weeks before launching the  
game.  They saw 2.5 million 

03:49:01.930 --> 03:49:03.930
preregistration users.

03:49:06.479 --> 03:49:07.114
Out of  those, 46% were coming 
from the Play preregistration 

03:49:07.115 --> 03:49:09.604
feature.
What is very interesting here is

03:49:09.605 --> 03:49:11.605
that 

03:49:13.740 --> 03:49:14.551
the day-seven  conversion, 
meaning from launch date until 

03:49:14.552 --> 03:49:16.552
the day seven, the  

03:49:17.829 --> 03:49:19.829
first week, the conversion for 
Play 

03:49:20.866 --> 03:49:23.108
preregistration users was  about
70%, which is seven times higher

03:49:23.109 --> 03:49:25.109
than the other sources.

03:49:31.345 --> 03:49:33.345
So they at platform relations 
says it's 

03:49:34.455 --> 03:49:36.455
essentially a very  effective 
marketing tool.

03:49:40.834 --> 03:49:43.374
So Nexon has launched 20 games 
in 2017 and has used the  

03:49:43.375 --> 03:49:45.375
preregistration feature in ten 
games last year.

03:49:48.244 --> 03:49:50.933
They saw a 50%  conversion from 
preregistration users to actual 

03:49:50.934 --> 03:49:52.934
users  downloading this app, 
this game.

03:49:54.922 --> 03:49:56.922
They've seen also the CPI's are 
quite lower.

03:50:01.097 --> 03:50:02.944
They're 60%  lower in prelaunch 
than postlaunch period.

03:50:02.945 --> 03:50:04.945
As such, it led to a discussion 
to 

03:50:08.286 --> 03:50:10.286
allocate marketing budget  50% 
to the 

03:50:12.877 --> 03:50:14.877
prelaunch state rather than 
postlaunch.

03:50:15.311 --> 03:50:18.862
So far the preregistration pilot
has been very successful.   In 

03:50:18.863 --> 03:50:21.145
2017 we've seen numbers such as 
more than 50 developers using  

03:50:21.146 --> 03:50:25.648
this functionality, as well as 
200 million players registering 

03:50:25.649 --> 03:50:27.649
and a hundred million players 
actually downloading 

03:50:31.235 --> 03:50:32.867
those games,  and a total of 400
launches across both small and 

03:50:32.868 --> 03:50:34.868
big  developers.
Indeed, this is exciting.

03:50:37.164 --> 03:50:38.825
But what's even more exciting is
to know that today we're 

03:50:38.826 --> 03:50:40.826
announcing that 

03:50:41.901 --> 03:50:42.113
preregistration is  becoming 
available to all developers very

03:50:42.114 --> 03:50:44.794
soon.
So what are some of the things 

03:50:44.795 --> 03:50:48.695
we need to take into account  if
we want to have a good 

03:50:48.696 --> 03:50:51.564
experience with preregistration?
So three things, as well, that I

03:50:51.565 --> 03:50:53.565
wanted to remember.

03:50:56.057 --> 03:50:58.706
So the  first is allow some time
to build excitement.  So in 

03:50:58.707 --> 03:51:00.707
between  three to six weeks, 

03:51:03.412 --> 03:51:05.412
it's enough in order to gather 
all this  audience interest.

03:51:05.422 --> 03:51:08.264
As well, use all the channels 
that you have available in  

03:51:08.265 --> 03:51:10.265
order to build that excitement.

03:51:11.789 --> 03:51:13.789
For example, media communities, 
forum, your own website.

03:51:14.425 --> 03:51:16.468
Across all these channels, make 
sure you have a clear action.

03:51:20.960 --> 03:51:22.960
In this case, preregister Google
Play.

03:51:23.722 --> 03:51:25.722
With this in mind, let's jump 
into the 

03:51:26.801 --> 03:51:28.801
last tool, which is  country 
targeting.

03:51:29.279 --> 03:51:31.279
Country targeting is a very 
powerful tool.

03:51:36.375 --> 03:51:38.531
Essentially, it  allows two 
things: Different tracks per 

03:51:41.381 --> 03:51:43.033
country and can run open  test 
or production in a specific 

03:51:43.034 --> 03:51:45.034
geography.

03:51:46.690 --> 03:51:48.520
This is very useful for 
self-launching purposes where we

03:51:48.521 --> 03:51:50.521
want  to have one particular 
region in production to test 

03:51:54.799 --> 03:51:56.799
user  acquisition or 
monetization.

03:51:59.812 --> 03:52:01.878
Second is geography.  You can 
control the roll-out in  

03:52:03.310 --> 03:52:04.551
different countries and then 
monitor which users are getting 

03:52:04.552 --> 03:52:06.552
into the app.

03:52:09.234 --> 03:52:10.659
This allows us to test 
performance or user  feedback.

03:52:10.660 --> 03:52:15.574
Let's look at how some 
developers are using this  

03:52:15.575 --> 03:52:17.575
functionality.

03:52:21.514 --> 03:52:23.514
War of Gaming, they launched 
this game 

03:52:24.570 --> 03:52:27.217
in January, 2018, and  the game 
has already seen more than 3 

03:52:27.218 --> 03:52:29.218
million installs in Google  
Play.

03:52:30.662 --> 03:52:32.662
By the way, a hundred million 
sheeps 

03:52:34.131 --> 03:52:36.131
destroyed and more than  50 
million 

03:52:37.374 --> 03:52:39.374
planes shot down.  Incredible 
numbers on that side.

03:52:42.513 --> 03:52:43.482
We spoke with the marketing 
manager in war gaming and he 

03:52:43.483 --> 03:52:46.324
told  us they use the country 
targeting during the soft launch

03:52:46.325 --> 03:52:48.778
period.
This soft launch period took 

03:52:48.779 --> 03:52:50.779
about six 

03:52:52.698 --> 03:52:54.762
months and they  divided in 
three stages.  The first stage 

03:52:54.763 --> 03:52:56.763
they select a few  number of 
countries and were testing 

03:52:59.695 --> 03:53:01.695
things like stability, so  crash
rates, 

03:53:06.836 --> 03:53:08.356
monetization, and then 
engagement, user engagement  and

03:53:08.357 --> 03:53:10.357
duration of the games.

03:53:11.865 --> 03:53:13.297
On the second stage they open up
to a few more countries and  

03:53:13.298 --> 03:53:15.298
they were 

03:53:16.652 --> 03:53:17.876
testing mostly server capacity 
and ensuring the  stability of 

03:53:17.877 --> 03:53:19.877
the game.

03:53:21.187 --> 03:53:23.229
On a third stage they were 
opening up to already more  

03:53:23.230 --> 03:53:25.230
countries across all 

03:53:27.357 --> 03:53:28.595
continents, with an interest of 
testing  monetization mostly.

03:53:33.307 --> 03:53:34.941
So lastly, during this whole 
process, war gaming was testing,

03:53:34.942 --> 03:53:36.942
as well, and 

03:53:38.810 --> 03:53:40.429
monitoring the ratings and 
reviews and reacting  based on 

03:53:40.430 --> 03:53:42.430
the user feedback.

03:53:43.893 --> 03:53:45.114
In conclusion, regarding country
target, two things to  remember 

03:53:45.115 --> 03:53:47.786
today.  The first one is we can 
use country 

03:53:50.888 --> 03:53:52.888
targeting  during soft launch 
but also 

03:53:55.788 --> 03:53:57.788
during the open and close beta 
test  

03:53:59.975 --> 03:54:01.975
processes, as well as during 
future 

03:54:02.988 --> 03:54:04.988
updates or postlaunch  period.

03:54:05.998 --> 03:54:07.991
The second thing, at launch, 
plan ahead what is going to be  

03:54:07.992 --> 03:54:11.874
the roll-out to the different 
countries.  So people can 

03:54:11.875 --> 03:54:13.928
download  the game and enjoy it 
quickly without any issues.

03:54:17.178 --> 03:54:17.586
With this, I would like to call 
my colleague, David.  Thank  

03:54:17.587 --> 03:54:25.331
you.
(Applause)

03:54:25.736 --> 03:54:27.736
&gt;&gt; DAVID WIESENFELD:  Thanks, 
Ignacio.  I'm David.

03:54:30.836 --> 03:54:32.836
Product  manage on Play console 
market 

03:54:34.526 --> 03:54:36.391
tools and Google Play game  
services of.

03:54:36.392 --> 03:54:38.016
Now we're moving on to post 
launch.  At this point you  

03:54:38.017 --> 03:54:40.017
developed your 

03:54:42.491 --> 03:54:44.491
game, tested with a growing 
cohort of 

03:54:45.948 --> 03:54:46.759
testingers,  add a good launch 
day and launch week and the dust

03:54:46.760 --> 03:54:48.760
is settling.

03:54:50.666 --> 03:54:52.666
what do you think about next?

03:54:54.797 --> 03:54:56.857
Three post launch activities 
we'll focus on are growing your 

03:54:56.858 --> 03:54:58.858
audience to get as many people 
as possible playing your 

03:55:01.954 --> 03:55:03.784
great  game, engaging your 
players to a great experience 

03:55:03.785 --> 03:55:06.020
they can keep  coming back to, 
and earning money so you can 

03:55:08.262 --> 03:55:10.140
keep growing your  game or build
your next one.

03:55:10.141 --> 03:55:12.141
Let's start with audience 
growth.

03:55:12.191 --> 03:55:14.447
Players with becoming harder and
more expensive to acquire  and 

03:55:14.448 --> 03:55:16.448
retain.  Game developers like 
you are using 

03:55:19.519 --> 03:55:21.519
lots of  different strategies to
acquire users.

03:55:23.590 --> 03:55:25.590
UA is common but so are other 
less trackable methods.

03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:29.889
Cross  promotion and other 
games, 

03:55:32.304 --> 03:55:34.304
utilizing social channel

03:55:37.539 --> 03:55:39.539
s,  third-party marketing, and 
others as well.

03:55:41.486 --> 03:55:44.865
Players who install your app 
organically from the Play Store 

03:55:44.866 --> 03:55:46.866
who may get there from a search 
after reading about your game  

03:55:49.705 --> 03:55:52.212
from a third-party website are a
black box.

03:55:57.112 --> 03:55:59.112
Using new tools in Play Console 
you can 

03:56:01.207 --> 03:56:03.647
now see the breakdown  of how 
many new installers are accessed

03:56:03.648 --> 03:56:05.648
your listing 

03:56:07.356 --> 03:56:09.356
either by a  search or by 
browsing the Play Store.

03:56:13.473 --> 03:56:16.312
Most users find games using 
search.  You can see the 

03:56:16.313 --> 03:56:18.313
specific  search terms that 
drive users to your game.

03:56:20.586 --> 03:56:21.799
Organ acquisitions insight 
reports is coming soon to all  

03:56:21.800 --> 03:56:24.656
developers.
The developer we've talked to 

03:56:24.657 --> 03:56:26.657
are 

03:56:28.561 --> 03:56:30.825
excited to use these  insights 
in order to access strategies, 

03:56:30.826 --> 03:56:32.826
change their screenshot  to 
reflect what their users 

03:56:37.283 --> 03:56:39.555
are looking for, and even 
optimize  app experiences to 

03:56:39.556 --> 03:56:43.223
make sure it references the 
features that  users find more 

03:56:43.224 --> 03:56:45.224
appealing.

03:56:47.476 --> 03:56:49.476
This is a powerful new tool I 
hope you'll explore.

03:56:50.533 --> 03:56:51.354
You can go together talk 
tomorrow morning to find out 

03:56:51.355 --> 03:56:53.355
more  about it.

03:56:56.683 --> 03:56:58.683
Next, we'll talk about Google 
Play instant.

03:57:00.350 --> 03:57:03.810
Growing your game is getting 
users excited about it.  A great

03:57:03.811 --> 03:57:05.811
way to do that is to get them 

03:57:07.874 --> 03:57:09.874
excited by using and 
experiencing  it.

03:57:09.934 --> 03:57:11.934
We launched this last year and 
since 

03:57:14.231 --> 03:57:16.231
then we've been very   busy.

03:57:21.206 --> 03:57:23.206
We've made building in snaps 
even easyier.

03:57:24.652 --> 03:57:26.652
As of today, Google Play instant
is now 

03:57:27.917 --> 03:57:29.917
available to all game  
developers.

03:57:31.366 --> 03:57:33.366
So why should you consider 
making an instant game?

03:57:33.974 --> 03:57:35.974
Instant games allow players to 
try your 

03:57:36.987 --> 03:57:38.035
game before  installing it and 
make it easy to install the full

03:57:38.036 --> 03:57:40.036
game at the  

03:57:41.306 --> 03:57:42.392
end of the instant game 
experience using the install 

03:57:42.393 --> 03:57:44.393
prompt API.
Being able to try a game before 

03:57:45.034 --> 03:57:47.034
installing is a hit with  
players.

03:57:49.315 --> 03:57:51.315
After publishing their instant 
game 

03:57:53.490 --> 03:57:54.609
Mighty Battles saw  a 19% 
increase in acquisition rate.

03:57:54.610 --> 03:57:58.960
So what's the difference between
instant apps and instant  games?

03:58:01.522 --> 03:58:04.504
We adapted the instant app 
framework so it better meets  

03:58:04.505 --> 03:58:06.505
the needs of game developers 
like you.

03:58:06.906 --> 03:58:09.370
There's three things we changed.
We increased the size limit  to 

03:58:10.846 --> 03:58:12.846
10-megabyte.

03:58:14.273 --> 03:58:18.424
We enabled progressive 
download...and very  

03:58:18.425 --> 03:58:20.425
importantly, we've added full 

03:58:22.887 --> 03:58:24.887
support for native code and are 
we  go 

03:58:27.373 --> 03:58:29.453
grading with game engines and 
open PL.

03:58:32.490 --> 03:58:36.967
And by creating an instant game 
you open up a lot of  surfaces. 

03:58:36.968 --> 03:58:38.968
Players can experience instant 
games 

03:58:40.413 --> 03:58:42.413
directly from

03:58:44.596 --> 03:58:46.596
ads, in the play game

03:58:48.478 --> 03:58:49.509
arcade, via a messaging app, and
of course  in the Play Store.

03:58:52.778 --> 03:58:55.645
We need to touch back just for a
moment on launching tools.   

03:58:55.646 --> 03:58:57.646
Preregistration is a very 
successful program.

03:58:59.915 --> 03:59:01.137
We're bringing  the instant 
games to Play Store's 

03:59:01.138 --> 03:59:03.138
preregistration feature.

03:59:05.997 --> 03:59:08.871
Now  players that preregister 
did get a sneak preview of your 

03:59:08.872 --> 03:59:10.923
game.
And users will be able to play 

03:59:10.924 --> 03:59:12.924
instantly 

03:59:14.397 --> 03:59:18.464
from any Android  device when 
you promote it on social media. 

03:59:18.465 --> 03:59:18.980
It's an awesome way  to 
introduce your game to the 

03:59:18.981 --> 03:59:21.075
world.
To learn more about instant 

03:59:21.076 --> 03:59:23.076
games, you can attend this  
session on Thursday.

03:59:25.392 --> 03:59:27.432
Next, we'll look at engagement.
Android vitals is designed to 

03:59:27.433 --> 03:59:29.870
help you identify issues at  
scale so you can 

03:59:34.531 --> 03:59:34.930
create a better, more fluid, 
more optimized and  more 

03:59:34.931 --> 03:59:36.931
engaging experience for your 
players.

03:59:39.010 --> 03:59:41.446
There are a number of new vitals
features launching including  

03:59:41.447 --> 03:59:46.341
benchmarks for vitals and new 
vitals including startup time  

03:59:46.342 --> 03:59:47.763
which we discussed in the 
Android vitals session earlier 

03:59:47.764 --> 03:59:49.764
this  afternoon.

03:59:56.994 --> 03:59:58.620
Of particular and of game 
developers are stability and  

03:59:58.621 --> 04:00:00.621
battery statistics.

04:00:01.934 --> 04:00:03.934
We are now showing these vitals 
against 

04:00:05.443 --> 04:00:06.475
a bad behavior  threshold.  
Exhibiting bad behavior and 

04:00:06.476 --> 04:00:11.385
vitals will negatively  infect 
the user experience in your game

04:00:11.386 --> 04:00:15.523
and can result in bad  ratings 
and poor discoverability in the 

04:00:15.524 --> 04:00:17.524
Play Store.

04:00:19.210 --> 04:00:21.523
We also have renders for 
start-up time but that's 

04:00:21.524 --> 04:00:23.524
informable  at this point.

04:00:25.678 --> 04:00:27.678
You can can see how you stack up
against 

04:00:30.928 --> 04:00:32.928
similar games with  these 
benchmarks.

04:00:38.574 --> 04:00:41.424
Using vitals, game developer 
Kaloo who game subway surfers  

04:00:41.425 --> 04:00:43.425
was able to make distract 
improvements to their A and R 

04:00:49.244 --> 04:00:51.244
rate,  reducing it to below 0.
1%.

04:00:51.477 --> 04:00:53.920
So help you ensure your users 
enjoy playing your game, you  

04:00:53.921 --> 04:00:56.477
should be thinking about using 
vitals in your day-to-day.

04:01:01.959 --> 04:01:03.959
Keep  an eye on A and Rs, 
crashes, 

04:01:05.058 --> 04:01:07.058
wake locks and wake ups, which 
will  be 

04:01:08.781 --> 04:01:11.640
easier with alerts build in.
And use your tool kit to chase 

04:01:11.641 --> 04:01:13.278
down problems.
We wanted to share with you 

04:01:13.279 --> 04:01:15.920
something we've been working on.
It's not ready for general 

04:01:16.326 --> 04:01:19.813
consumption yet.  That's coming.
But  we're excited to be working

04:01:19.814 --> 04:01:24.145
to bring live ops to play.  
We're  creating new experiences 

04:01:24.146 --> 04:01:26.146
in the 

04:01:27.204 --> 04:01:29.239
store and in the Play games app 
to show players events that are 

04:01:29.240 --> 04:01:32.295
happening now in their games.   
This is proving very popular 

04:01:32.296 --> 04:01:34.735
with players and we'll continue 
exploring in this direction.

04:01:38.978 --> 04:01:40.978
Finally, let's move on to 
revenue.

04:01:44.055 --> 04:01:46.548
Google Play has had 
subscriptions since 2012.

04:01:53.018 --> 04:01:55.018
Games  typically monetize 
through...

04:01:56.898 --> 04:01:58.319
but a number have been  
experimenting with subscriptions

04:01:58.320 --> 04:02:00.320
and we wanted to share their  
experiences.

04:02:00.556 --> 04:02:02.556
What's the benefit of adding 

04:02:04.654 --> 04:02:06.654
subscriptions when I already  
have IAP?

04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:10.349
There's an increase in 
engagement and 

04:02:12.090 --> 04:02:14.570
retention not  just for 
subscribers but overall user 

04:02:14.571 --> 04:02:16.571
base, as well.

04:02:22.673 --> 04:02:27.687
Many also notice minimal canal 
billization.

04:02:31.152 --> 04:02:33.152
Another developer who has found 
success 

04:02:35.455 --> 04:02:37.455
with subscriptions is  Network 
in Legendary Game of Heroes.

04:02:39.377 --> 04:02:41.377
They use subscriptions for  
their loyalty VIP program.

04:02:43.246 --> 04:02:45.281
This has proven popular with  
players, as you can see, and 

04:02:45.282 --> 04:02:47.317
created a new revenue stream for
them with strong 

04:02:50.763 --> 04:02:52.763
overall impact on overall 
revenue.

04:02:54.293 --> 04:02:56.967
There are two ways to use 
subscriptions.  Loyalty programs

04:02:56.968 --> 04:02:58.968
for high value users 

04:03:01.667 --> 04:03:03.667
and a new access point for a 
premium  

04:03:06.161 --> 04:03:08.161
experience to nontraditional 
buyers.

04:03:11.441 --> 04:03:13.281
Some examples of a VIP loyalty 
feature includes exclusive or  

04:03:13.282 --> 04:03:18.568
early access to content, special
VIP status and title, or a  

04:03:18.569 --> 04:03:20.569
bonus payout with each purchase.

04:03:21.823 --> 04:03:22.650
This is the most popular 
subscription design we've seen 

04:03:22.651 --> 04:03:24.651
so  far.

04:03:26.973 --> 04:03:29.011
As you can see from Jurassic 
world the game, here.

04:03:31.009 --> 04:03:33.058
Developers have also found 
subscriptions can be effective 

04:03:33.059 --> 04:03:35.059
in  converting traditional 
non-buyers.

04:03:37.140 --> 04:03:37.541
These players are motivated by 
getting a good financial deal.

04:03:43.518 --> 04:03:45.143
You can see this program aimed 
at these traditional  

04:03:45.144 --> 04:03:47.144
non-buyers.

04:03:48.415 --> 04:03:51.300
As with any monetization system,
be aware of potential down  

04:03:51.301 --> 04:03:53.745
sides and keep a close pulse of 
player feedback and community  

04:03:53.746 --> 04:03:55.776
sentiment.
To help you with your 

04:03:55.777 --> 04:03:57.777
subscription 

04:03:59.447 --> 04:04:01.485
program, Google Play has a  very
robust subscriptions 

04:04:01.486 --> 04:04:03.486
infrastructure with a lot of 
rich  features.

04:04:06.362 --> 04:04:08.362
We support you with building 
tools and 

04:04:09.841 --> 04:04:11.841
analytics  insights reports 
through the 

04:04:12.959 --> 04:04:14.959
entire tunnel and we can take 
care  of 

04:04:16.500 --> 04:04:18.500
features such as flexible 
billing, free 

04:04:20.789 --> 04:04:23.649
trials, account hold,  so you 
can test this in in-game 

04:04:23.650 --> 04:04:26.345
subscription design.
To learn more, you can watch the

04:04:28.193 --> 04:04:30.256
recording of this session  from 
earlier this afternoon.

04:04:32.685 --> 04:04:34.685
We've gone through some of the 
tools you 

04:04:36.783 --> 04:04:39.655
can take advantage  of post 
launch but as we draw to a close

04:04:39.656 --> 04:04:42.535
I want to loop us back  to the 
beginning of our talk and call 

04:04:42.536 --> 04:04:44.536
out testing again.

04:04:46.309 --> 04:04:47.771
In comparison to apps, this can 
be tricky for games as some  

04:04:47.772 --> 04:04:50.670
games need people to be on the 
same version to function  

04:04:50.671 --> 04:04:56.191
possibly.  But think about how 
you can use testing tracks to  

04:04:56.192 --> 04:04:58.192
ensure your updates 

04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:02.910
live up to the quality bar set 
for your  game.

04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:06.922
To wrap up, we discussed a 
number of tools in Play Console 

04:05:06.923 --> 04:05:08.923
you can use in 

04:05:10.212 --> 04:05:12.882
various stages in your game's 
life cycle.   There's a lot 

04:05:12.883 --> 04:05:14.883
going on in mobile gaming right 
now.

04:05:17.174 --> 04:05:19.174
Fantastic  game growth, and lots
of 

04:05:20.250 --> 04:05:22.329
competition, it's your own fault
as you  keep raising the bar 

04:05:22.330 --> 04:05:25.641
higher and higher in terms of 
graphics,  story, and game play.

04:05:25.642 --> 04:05:27.695
We're excited to see what you're
going 

04:05:31.171 --> 04:05:33.171
to build next and  where games 
goes on from here.

04:05:34.848 --> 04:05:37.126
We can help you along in a few 
key places and give you  

04:05:37.127 --> 04:05:39.783
abilities and insights you can 
leverage to help you succeed.

04:05:39.784 --> 04:05:44.089
We'd also love to hear your 
feedback on this session.

04:05:45.717 --> 04:05:49.830
Thanks for your time.  We're 
around for the rest of the day. 

04:05:49.831 --> 04:05:51.279
You can also check out the 
sandbox over here.  Thank you.

04:05:51.280 --> 04:05:54.526
(Applause)
(Music)

04:06:00.474 --> 04:06:06.653
(End session at 6:37 p.m. PT.)
