00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.010
oh ouch that was weird.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.310
I hope I’m not having a heart attack.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.220
haha its funny because I’m not the typical
at risk demographic, right?

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.410
oh no.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.180
maybe i am.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.430
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.529
let me throw something shocking at you, Heart
attacks are the number one killer of both

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.949
men and women in the U.S.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.369
Yet young women UNDER the age of 55 are twice
as likely to die after being hospitalized

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.159
for a heart attack as men.

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.390
Every year 15,000 women will die from heart
disease.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.200
A new study from the Yale School of Public
Health published in the journal Circulation

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.149
suggests the reason might be because younger
women put off getting help.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.780
The researchers interviewed 30 women who had
heart attacks.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.950
They asked them why they delayed getting help.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.890
They mostly said their symptoms didn’t look
like they do in the movies and they didn’t

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.930
want to raise a false alarm.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.760
In Hollywood, a man, usually older, gets shooting
pain the left arm, intense pain in the chest

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.760
and he collapses.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.390
We’ve all seen that before.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.359
But heart attacks in women look a little less
dramatic.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.000
Women experience more mild discomfort which
can be easily dismissed as something else.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.220
Symptoms can vary pretty widely in women.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.820
Some look suspiciously like anxiety attacks.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.620
Shortness of breath, racing heart, sweating,
feeling of impending doom.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.970
Sometimes women experience nausea or pain
elsewhere besides the chest, like neck, shoulder,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.970
or jaw pain.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.150
So why don’t we see this kind of heart attack
on tv?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.150
Well.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.960
The problem in short, bras.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.080
Before anyone can use a defibrillator on a
woman, the bra has to be taken off because

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.970
the metal underwires could conduct electricity
and cause serious burns. and you can’t exactly

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.290
show a topless woman on cable tv.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.750
This lack of information leads women to put
off getting treatment, which is a huge problem.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.680
The national institute of health describes
a heart attack as when the flow of oxygen-rich

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.290
blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly
becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.500
If left untreated, sections of heart start
to die.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.090
Health professionals strongly suggest seeking
help with in an hour after the onset of symptoms.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.610
This critical period is called the golden
hour where chances of surviving are the best.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.070
So ladies, and gents.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.250
Learn the symptoms, know your risk of heart
disease.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.050
If you think you’re having a heart attack,
call 911, right away, chew or crush an aspirin

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.650
to prevent more clotting.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.160
Don’t take no for an answer, don’t let
anyone dismiss your symptoms, and demand to

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.640
see a doctor immediately.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.800
Switching gears to a much more upbeat topic
for a second, we are so excited that our new

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.560
channel Seeker launched this week!

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.520
One of the shows on the channel is called
"This Happened Here," and they take look at

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.880
the story behind some of the most beautiful
photos on the Internet.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:48.700
Like this video here exploring disappearing
ice caves of Alaska....

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.640
