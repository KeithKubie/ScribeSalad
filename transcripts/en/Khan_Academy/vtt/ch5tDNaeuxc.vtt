00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.790
Problem 75.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.300
Two airplanes left the same
airport traveling in opposite

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.090
directions.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.500
If one plane averages 400 miles
per hour-- so this is

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.330
the airport.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.430
One plane goes in that
direction at

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.550
400 miles per hour.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.970
That's a mile not a meter.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.110
And another plane averages
250 miles per hour.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.250
And it's going in the
other direction.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.840
And I do this as vectors.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.980
So the length of the my
arrow represents its

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.330
speed to some degree.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.810
And the direction represents
direction.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.660
250 miles per hour in that
direction, 400 miles per hour

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.170
in that direction.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.550
In how many hours will the
distance between the two

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.420
planes be 1625 miles?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.250
So you just have to say, if
you're sitting in this plane

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400
right here, this plane
to the left.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.530
And you let's say you think
you're stationary.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.280
How fast is that plane going to
be moving to the rightwards

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.800
direction, or I guess to
the eastward direction?

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.760
Well from your point of view,
it's going to be going in the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.790
east direction at 650
miles per hour.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.510
If you thought that you were
stationary, it would just be

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.200
going away from you at
650 miles per hour.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.940
Same thing, if you were sitting
in this plane right

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.270
here, and you thought you were
stationary-- and you are,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.400
relative to yourself-- you'd
say, oh, why this guy is going

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.540
to the west at 650 miles per
hour relative to me.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.300
And we're starting at
the same point.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.610
So this just becomes a standard
distance is equal to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.520
rate times time problem.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.780
So if we have to cover 1625
miles, because that's what

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.740
they want to know, when
does that happen?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.150
At what point are the planes
that far from each other?

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.410
That is equal to their relative
velocity, they're

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.870
separating from each other
at 650 miles per hour.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.250
And we want to know how long
is that going to take?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.420
So time is going to equal
1625 divided by 650.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.570
Let's see if we can simplify
that at all.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.480
Well, we could divide the top
and the bottom by 25.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.870
If we divide the top one-- let
me just get my calculator.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:17.090
So 1625 divided by 650
is equal to 2.5.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.770
And we were doing everything
in miles per hour.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.290
So time is going to be
equal to 2.5 hours.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.700
This choice is A.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.070
Problem 76.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.870
I'll just copy and paste all
these word problems. We'll

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.150
parse them together.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.200
Problem 76 in green.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.930
Lisa will make punch that is 25%
fruit by adding pure fruit

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.290
juice to a two liter mixture
that is 10% pure fruit juice.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.060
How many liters of pure fruit
juice does she need to add?

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.080
Pure fruit juice.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.810
So let P equal liters of pure.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.810
And that's what they want
us to figure out.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.830
So we have to figure out P.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.450
All right.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.170
And adding it to a two liter
mixture., So so let's say M is

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.700
equal to the liters
of the mixture.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.670
That is 10% fruit juice.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.470
So that is this right here, to
a two liter mixture, that is

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.740
10% fruit juice.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.100
We're calling that M.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.220
That is the two liter mixture
that is 10% fruit juice.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.140
OK, how many liters of
pure fruit juice

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.050
does she need to add?

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.985
OK, so let's think about
it a little bit.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.060
So, punch is going
to be pure juice.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.870
So let's think about how much
pure juice is going to be in

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.000
the system.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.120
The liters of pure juice
she adds, plus the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.030
liters of the mixture.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.620
Well it's a two liter mixture
that is 10% fruit juice.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.090
So how much fruit juice
is already there?

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.330
So, it's 0.2 liters
of fruit juice.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.450
I shouldn't even define M, we
know that M is equal to 2.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.459
So ignore that.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.029
You can tell I'm doing these
problems in real time.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.210
I'm struggling with
them as you would.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.160
Anyway, so how much fruit juice
is there going to be in

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.110
the mixture?

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.580
There's the amount of
liters of the pure

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.290
fruit juice she adds.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.390
This is a pure fruit
juice, that's P.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.340
And then you're going to have
the two liters of the mixture

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.550
that is 10% fruit juice.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.630
So how much fruit juice
is coming from that?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.850
Well 10% of two liters is
0.2 liters already.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.520
And then how many liters
is there going

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.160
to be in the mixture?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.000
In the combined, how many
total liters are there?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.460
Well, there's the liters of the
pure fruit juice, plus the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.210
two liters that we're
adding to.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.530
This is the amount
of fruit juice.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.790
This is a total amount
of liquid.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.950
And we got the 0.2
from 10% times 2.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.140
And we said that this
has to equal 25%.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.010
We want this to be
25% of this.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.100
So this should be 0.25.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.480
That was an inadvertent
mark right down there.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.000
So now we just solve for P.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.740
The hard part is setting
up the problem.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.770
So let's multiply P plus
2 times both sides.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.706
So you get P plus 0.2 is equal
to 0.25 times this.

00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:39.880
So 0.25P plus 0.25
times 2 is 0.5.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.760
Fair enough.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.490
Let's subtract 0.2
from both sides.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:50.300
You get P is equal to 0.25P,
0.5 minus 0.2 is plus 0.3.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.790
Let's subtract 0.25P
from both sides.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:59.440
1P minus 0.25P is 0.75P
is equal to 0.3.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.410
And let's see where this goes.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.550
Did I do that right?

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.130
0.75P is equal to 0.3.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.380
Right.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.410
The decimals sometimes
get confusing.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.430
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 10.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.500
You get 7.5P is equal to 0.3.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.250
Sorry, is equal to 3,
we multiplied by 10.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.690
So you get P is equal
to 3 over 7.5.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.760
How many times does
7.5 go into 3?

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.860
So that's the same thing
as how many times

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.280
does 75 go into 30.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.840
Put a decimal sign.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.100
Let's see, it goes into
it I think four times.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.860
It's 0.4.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.120
So P is equal to 0.4 liters.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.120
We have to add 0.4 liters of
pure fruit juice to the two

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.310
liter mixture.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.650
So you add 0.4 to the two liter
mixture, so you end up

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.150
with 0.6 liters of
pure fruit juice.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.200
So the numerator becomes 0.6.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.130
And the denominator
becomes 2.4.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.410
Which, sure enough,
is 1/4 or 25%.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.450
Fascinating problem.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.530
Next question.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.830
And these are good to learn.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.510
A lot of times in math class
people are like, what do I

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.170
need to learn this for?

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.143
But this type of algebra,
you're going to

00:07:29.143 --> 00:07:30.170
use it all the time.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.930
Especially if you go into
any type of science or

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.730
engineering.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.050
Or, for that matter, investing
or finance.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.780
You're going to use these kind
of, boy can I figure this out

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.370
or not type of equations all
the time when you're mixing

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.700
things and figuring out margins
and all the rest.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.590
OK, let's see.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.390
Which relation is a function?

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.320
So I have a little bit of
a review of a function.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.670
So a function is a relation
that maps from

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.820
a domain to a range.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.400
I want to say from A to B.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.390
Or we could say from the
domain to the range.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.140
Where it takes one set of
numbers, which you call the

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.080
domain, and we have another
set of numbers.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.000
And for every number here,
there's exactly one

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.080
number in the range.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.870
And that's the key.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.510
From here to here, there's
only one number.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.030
Now two of these could
meet the same number.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.320
But you can't have one number
here going to two separate

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.310
numbers there.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.560
That's the key.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.990
Here we have the same number.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.570
You have a minus 2 here.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.460
And you have a minus 2 here.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.220
So that's like the
same number.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.780
Let's say this is a minus 2.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.570
That minus 2 is going
to a 6 and here it's

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.530
going to minus 2.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.240
So you have the same
number going to

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.320
two different numbers.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.960
And you can't have that
in a function.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.330
For any given number in the
domain, you definitely get

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.410
only one in the range.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.100
So A is not the answer.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.800
Let's see, does this have
that same problem?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.440
See every number is there
exactly once.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.170
You have one minus 2, one 0,
one 1, one 2, so you're not

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.580
going to have that problem.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.940
My suspicion is it's
already B.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.200
C has the same problem.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.100
4 goes to a bunch of
different numbers.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.760
4 goes to 0, 4 goes to
1, so it's not C.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.650
And then this defines
two values for 10.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.280
So that doesn't work either.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.650
So the answer is B.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.890
Problem 78.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.140
All right.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.120
For which equation graphed
below, are all

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.180
the y values negative?

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.460
So if all the y values are
negative, we have to stay

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.460
below the x-axis.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.420
This is where all the y values
are negative, right there.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.520
So this one seems to work.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.430
A seems to work.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.205
Here, these aren't negative
y values.

00:10:04.205 --> 00:10:06.330
These are positive y values.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.660
I didn't even copy and
paste all these.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.940
But I can already see that these
are positive y values.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.150
So A was the answer.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.700
I'm sorry, I ran out of space.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.670
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.310
All of these y values,
they're all negative.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.090
You're staying in the third
and fourth quadrant.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.340
All right, next video.
