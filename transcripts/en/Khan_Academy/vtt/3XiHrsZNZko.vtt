00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.980
In this video, I want to
introduce you to a mechanism

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.875
called the aldol reaction.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.890
And it's easily one of the most
important mechanisms and

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.250
reactions in all of organic
chemistry because it's a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.350
powerful way to actually create
carbon-carbon bonds.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.290
And it'll actually be a little
bit of a review of what we saw

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.390
with enol and the enolate ions
and the keto-enol tautomerism.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.640
I have trouble saying that.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.049
Anyway, let's start with
a couple of aldehydes.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.430
And just for convenience I'll
make them identical.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.020
So let's say that this is one
of aldehydes, it just has a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.080
carbon chain there.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.980
That's what the r is, it
could be of any length.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.290
Who knows what's there.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.950
And then I have another
carbon here.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.295
And then this is bound to the
carbonyl group and we're going

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.920
to make it an aldehyde, although
you could do this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.380
reaction with a ketone
as well.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.050
And just to make things clear,
this carbon right here-- which

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.680
is going to be involved in a lot
of the business here-- let

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.080
me draw it's hydrogens.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.030
Normally we don't have to
draw its hydrogens.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.000
And just as a bit of review, the
carbon that is next to the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.430
carbonyl carbon is called
an alpha carbon.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.890
If this was a ketone, this would
have also been an alpha

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.330
carbon if this was a carbon.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.630
And we're going to see in this
reaction, besides just

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.620
exploring the reaction, is
that these hydrogens are

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.360
actually much more acidic then
traditional hydrogens attached

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.910
to carbons on the rest
of the chain.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.150
And it comes from the fact that
this proton can be given

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.020
to something else, the electron
can go to that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590
carbon, and then it'll be
resonance stabilized.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.340
And we're going to see
that in a second.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.620
Now I said I would draw two
molecules of that, because we

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.490
need two molecules.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.150
We're actually going to
be, to some degree,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.800
joining the two molecules.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.580
So let me draw another aldehyde
right over here.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.310
And I'm going to draw it
symmetric to this, because

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.750
it'll make it, I think, a little
bit easier to visualize

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.290
the two molecules.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.935
Actually, let me just draw
it the same way.

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:54.440
But I'll draw it in
a different color.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.140
So you have the r group
and then you have the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.980
oxygen right there.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.260
And I won't draw all of the
hydrogens on this guy, but

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.470
this and this are the
exact same molecule.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.300
It's just the hydrogens
are implicit here.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.509
Now, the aldol reaction I'll
show you will be in a basic

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.130
environment.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.500
So you could imagine that it'll
be catalyzed by a base.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.320
And so, imagine we have some
hydroxide laying around.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.790
Some of the hydroxide anion.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.870
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.910
So let's say we have some
hydroxide anion floating

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.260
around-- negative charge,
just like that.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.350
I just told you that these
hydrogens are much more acidic

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.020
then hydrogens anywhere else
on a carbon chain-- these

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.240
alpha hydrogens.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.770
So you could imagine a situation
where an electron

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.750
from the hydroxide is given to
one of these hydrogen protons

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.350
and then the electron that was
associated with that hydrogen

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.900
is now given back to
this alpha carbon.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.220
And so if that were to happen,
the next step in our reaction

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.460
would look like this.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.740
And I'll draw it
in equilibrium.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.480
Actually, let me draw
it this way.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.540
So the products of that step
would be in equilibrium, with,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.010
you have your carbon chain or
the rest of your molecule

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.530
right there.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.930
And that's just to show that
it could be anything.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.600
It's attached here to the alpha
carbon, which is now

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.760
going to be negative-- I'll show
that in a second-- which

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.160
is attached to the carbonyl
group, which is

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.535
attached to a hydrogen.

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.350
And actually, I'll
stop drawing that

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.700
hydrogen for now, too.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.420
Just, we know it's there.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.080
But I'll keep drawing this
hydrogen right over here.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.960
The other hydrogen was taken
away and this alpha carbon now

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.940
has a negative charge
because it got the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.820
electron from that proton.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.740
And of course, we have
the hydroxide.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.510
It grabbed this hydrogen
and it is now water.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.540
Now the reason why this was
acidic to begin with is

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.600
because this is resonance
stabilized.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.750
And I'll show you that
it's resonance

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.570
stabilized right now.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.460
This alpha carbon right here can
give its electron to the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.970
carbonyl carbon.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.260
And if the carbonyl carbon gets
an electron, it can give

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.250
an electron to this
oxygen up here.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.600
It'll break the double bond.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.700
So this configuration
is resonance

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.450
stabilized with this.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.800
So I could draw it like this.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.430
You have your r and then
you have a single

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.550
bond to this oxygen.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.210
It now gained an electron.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.710
It is now negative.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.190
And you now have a double
bond, just like that.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.120
And I could draw this hydrogen
if I like, or I don't have to.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.590
It's implicitly over
there now.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.270
And you might be familiar
with this.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.380
This is the Enolate anion.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.540
This right here is
the enolate ion.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.230
If we had a hydrogen right here,
it would be enol, and we

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.760
would say hey, this
is the keto form,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.990
this is the enol form.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.660
We've seen this before.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.610
Now, what's interesting about
the enolate ion is it can act

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.970
as a nucleophile.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.300
It can do a nucleophilic attack
on the other aldehyde's

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.680
carbonyl group.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.770
But it does it in kind of
a non-conventional way.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.800
And I'll show you how it
does it right now.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.955
So it does the attack
like this.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.220
So let me draw this
guy over here.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.420
So you have the carbonyl group
and then you have its alpha

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.430
carbon and then you have an
r group right over there.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.220
There's actually a hydrogen
right over here, as well.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.230
I just flipped it over.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.120
This and this are the
same molecule.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.960
And let me make it clear-- these
two guys right here are

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.480
residence forms. And, once
again, this is the reason why

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.090
it's easier to take this
hydrogen than other hydrogens

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.200
on a traditional carbon chain.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.640
Easier to take an alpha hydrogen
to a carbonyl group

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.730
because you have this
resonance structure.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.030
But this enolate ion, especially
this configuration

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.530
of it, you can imagine it doing
something like this.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.300
You can imagine this oxygen
giving back the electron to

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.970
the carbonyl carbon-- to
this carbon right here.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:17.500
And when that happens, then this
guy is going to be giving

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.650
up an electron.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.520
And that electron that he gives
up-- let me do it in a

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.400
new color-- this electron that
he gives up could go and do a

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.050
nucleophilic attack on
this carbonyl group.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.960
And so if that carbonyl carbon
gets-- let me do this in a new

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.305
color-- if this carbonyl carbon
gets an electron, then

00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:42.230
it could give away an electron
to that oxygen right up there.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.270
So the next step after
this, we would have

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.940
something like this.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.810
And once again, I'll show it as
happening in equilibrium.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.130
So from here we go right over
there, and what we have is a

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.470
situation-- let me draw this guy
on the left first. So we

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.190
have a double bond to
this oxygen now.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.310
Actually, let me draw
the second.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.400
So this is this oxygen.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.675
We now have a double bond.

00:07:06.675 --> 00:07:09.970
And let me do it in this same
purple color right over here.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.400
And then we have the rest
of what was an aldehyde.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:22.010
Where you have-- let me do it in
that same color-- and then

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.880
you have your r group
right over there.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.520
But now this electron
gets in an attack

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.860
on this other aldehyde.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.880
So this guy right here, this
alpha carbon is that same

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.030
alpha carbon we've been dealing
with, is now bonded to

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.260
this carbonyl carbon.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.100
So it is now bound
to this carbonyl

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.910
carbon right over here.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.100
And so it will look like this.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.470
Let me draw it with
the right colors.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.740
Get the orange out.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.660
So that carbonyl carbon,
it now has a single

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.370
bond to this oxygen.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.490
This electron was taken
back by it.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.150
So this oxygen now has
a negative charge.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.950
And it is bound to
its alpha carbon.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:13.860
And then that is bonded to
another group, probably a

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.710
carbon chain or something that
contains a carbon chain or

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.620
another function or group.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.000
Whatever you want to call it.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.990
And then the final step.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.840
This anion can get rid of its
negative charge by essentially

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.330
grabbing a hydrogen maybe
from this water

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.150
that was formed before.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.179
Obviously, not going to be the
same molecule, but it could

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.510
grab it from this in
a previous step.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.830
This water molecule that was
formed in a previous step.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.929
And of course, this is all
in a basic environment.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:46.980
So it can give an electron to
this hydrogen, and then the

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.910
hydrogen proton would lose an
electron to the hydroxide and

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.770
the hydroxide will become
negative again.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.910
And so what will be
the final product?

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.600
The final product will be-- and
I'm just going to try my

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.500
best to redraw this thing
right over here.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.970
You have this part of the
molecule, so you have this

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.400
carbonyl group right
over here.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.760
It is attached to this radical
group right over there.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.110
So that is this part.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.250
And I can even do
the same colors.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.130
This bond right over here is
this bond right over here.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.670
And then this carbon is attached
to a carbon that's

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.250
attached to a hydroxyl
group now.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.280
So it'll look like this.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.280
And let me draw it.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.690
So this oxygen is now this
oxygen, and it just captured

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.850
this hydrogen.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.640
So it is now a hydroxyl group.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.830
It's now an -OH group.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.630
And then, finally, this
guy is bound to what

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.390
was an alpha carbon.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.590
It's not anymore.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.780
What was an alpha carbon,
which is then bound to a

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.520
radical group.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.150
And if we want, we can remember
that there was

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.660
always, from the get-go,
there was always a

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.110
hydrogen over here.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.400
So why is this called
the aldol reaction

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.440
and why does it matter?

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.510
Well, it's called the aldol
reaction because what we

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.130
formed is both an aldehyde--
notice this is an aldehyde--

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.900
and it's an alcohol.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.220
So that's where the word
aldol comes from.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.240
But the more important thing
about this-- and I don't want

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.060
to mislead you-- could have also
done this with a ketone

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.400
You could have had a methyl
group or a ethyl group.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.830
You could have had a big
carbon chain here.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.920
It still would've worked.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.180
So the aldol reaction doesn't
only form things that are

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.310
aldehydes and alcohols.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.510
It could have formed something
that's both a

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.160
ketone and an alcohol.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.520
But that's why it's called
the aldol reaction.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.120
But the more important thing
about the aldol reaction is,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.840
one, it shows you how the
enolate ion can be a

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.810
nucleophile.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:48.750
It shows you why the alpha
hydrogens are more acidic than

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.150
hydrogens on other parts
of carbon chains.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.310
But the most useful aspect of
it is it's a useful way to

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.090
actually join two carbon
chains together.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.790
Notice, we were able to join
this alpha carbon right here

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:05.940
to this carbonyl carbon over
here to form this aldol.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.210
Or sometimes this will be
called-- because this is still

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.900
an alpha carbon right here, this
is an alpha carbon, this

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.320
is a beta carbon-- and so
sometimes this will be

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.780
referred to as a beta hydroxy.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:24.250
And we've probably used things
from the pharmacy that has

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.260
this word in it.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.710
This is also called
a beta hydroxy.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.985
This is alpha, this is beta.

00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:31.610
It has a hydroxyl group
on the beta carbon.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.430
Beta hydroxy aldehyde.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.290
Anyway, hopefully you found
that entertaining.
