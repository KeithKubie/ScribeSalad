00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:03.330
Voiceover:Let's say that
we have got 2 matrices,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.301
and I'll just, for simplicity,

00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:06.967
I'll start with two 2 by 2 matrices.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.566
Let's say that this
first one right over here

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:19.233
is 2, negative 2, 5,
and let's say 5 and 3,

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:24.330
and then I have this
matrix right over here that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.100
it's also going to be 2 by 2.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.300
Let's say it's negative 1, 4,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
and let's say 7 and negative 6.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.766
What I want to go through in this video,

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:40.188
what I want to introduce
you to is the convention,

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:41.890
the mathematical convention

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.766
for multiplying two matrices like these.

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.500
I want to stress that
because mathematicians

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.300
could have come up with
a bunch of different ways

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.700
to define matrix multiplication.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.566
But the convention that
I'm going to show you

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.572
is the way that it is done,

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:57.366
and it's done this way
especially as you go into

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.966
deeper linear algebra classes

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.900
or you start doing computer graphics

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.330
or even modeling different
types of phenomena,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.234
you'll see why this type
of matrix multiplication,

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.566
which I'm about to show you,

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.366
why it has the most applications.

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.766
But I really want to stress
this is a human construct.

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.500
Humans have found defining
matrix multiplication

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.766
the way I'm about to
show you to be useful.

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.166
Let's just think about how this could be.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.566
Once again, I want to stress
it's a human construct.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.635
There's several ways that
you could have thought about

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:29.330
multiplying two 2 by 2 matrices.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.633
You could have done it the
same way that you add matrices.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.634
When you add matrices,

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.566
both matrices have to
have the same dimensions,

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:39.563
and you just add the corresponding
entries in the matrices.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:41.967
One convention could have been

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.700
why don't we just, for our
product right over here,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.966
why don't we just multiply
corresponding entries?

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.368
2 times negative 1 would
put a negative 2 here.

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:54.966
Negative 2 times 4, put a negative 8 here.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:55.900
That's how we did addition.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.500
We added corresponding entries,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.366
but that is not the convention
for multiplying matrices.

00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:03.566
That is not the standard convention.

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:06.634
The standard convention
for multiplying matrices

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:07.900
is we're essentially going to take ...

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.700
To get this top left
entry right over here,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.166
we're going to take the
product of this row,

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.768
of that row with this
column right over here.

00:02:19.768 --> 00:02:20.567
Now what does it mean

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:23.433
to take the product of a row and a column?

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:25.778
If you are familiar with
vector dot products,

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:26.633
this might ring a bell,

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:29.300
where you take the product
of the corresponding terms,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.366
the product of the first terms,

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:31.700
products of the second terms,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.330
and then add those together.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.833
That's essentially what
we're going to be doing.

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.433
We're going to be taking the dot product

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.900
of this first row and this first column

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.700
to get this top left
entry right over here.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.500
If the word "dot product"
makes no sense to you,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.768
I will show you what that actually means.

00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:52.503
Actually, let's get some
more real estate here

00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:54.300
just so I think it will be useful,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.167
especially this very first time

00:02:56.167 --> 00:03:00.568
that we attempt to multiply matrices.

00:03:00.568 --> 00:03:05.966
This top left entry, it's
going to be 2 times negative 1,

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:09.233
so 2 times negative 1,

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:11.433
plus negative 2,

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:14.854
plus negative 2 times 7,

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:17.300
plus negative 2 times 7.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.700
Notice, I took the product,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.851
first entry in the row,
first entry in the column,

00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:22.330
those two products,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.566
then the product of
second entry in the row,

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.433
second entry in the column
that's right over there,

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:26.967
and then I added them together.

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:28.434
That's essentially taking the dot product

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:30.778
of this row vector and this column vector.

00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:32.101
If that doesn't make sense to you,

00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:34.340
if you're not familiar with
vectors and dot products,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.233
don't worry about it.

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.300
We just took the first end
product of the first entry,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.367
product of the second entry,
added them together to get ...

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:42.330
This is going to give us some number,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.245
and we'll calculate that in a few seconds.

00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:45.900
But let's think about the other ones.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.968
To get this,

00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:50.901
to get this entry right over here,

00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:54.300
we're going to take the
first row from this matrix

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.104
and the second column from this matrix.

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:01.833
That makes sense because
we're still in the first row

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:04.966
but we're in the second column
of the first row right here.

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:06.767
First row, second column.

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:08.833
It's going to be 2 times 4,

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:12.833
2 times 4 plus negative 2,

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:16.633
plus negative 2 times negative 6.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:18.330
At this point, I encourage
you to pause the video.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.300
Seeing what you just saw, see
if you could complete this.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.234
See if you can figure
out the bottom left entry

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:23.502
and the bottom right entry.

00:04:23.502 --> 00:04:24.833
I'll give you a clue.

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:27.933
It has something to do
with this second row here.

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:29.701
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:32.101
Now let's just power through it together.

00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:33.186
Sometimes matrix multiplication

00:04:33.186 --> 00:04:35.301
can get a little bit intense.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.301
We're now in the second row,

00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:39.568
so we're going to use the
second row of this first matrix,

00:04:39.568 --> 00:04:42.166
and for this entry,
second row, first column,

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:43.633
second row, first column.

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:45.790
5 times negative 1,

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.133
5 times negative 1 plus 3 times 7,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.868
plus 3 times 7.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.966
Then finally, we're in
the home stretch now,

00:04:54.966 --> 00:05:00.633
to get this bottom row second column,

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:01.900
or second row, second column,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.367
we multiply this row essentially

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:07.166
by this column right over here.

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:11.135
It is going to be 5 times 4,

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:16.330
5 times 4 plus 3 times negative 6,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.835
plus 3 times negative 6.

00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:23.233
Now what does all of this simplify to?

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:27.233
This is going to be equal to, let's see,

00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:32.566
so negative 2 plus negative 14,

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:34.835
that's going to be negative 16.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.567
That, right over there, is negative 16.

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:42.766
Then we have 8 plus 12,
so that's going to be 20.

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:48.100
Then we have negative 5 plus 21,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.900
which is going to be 16, positive 16.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.767
Did I do that right?

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:54.700
Yup, positive 16.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.701
Then finally, you're
going to have 20 minus 18,

00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:00.576
so that's just going to be 2.

00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:02.500
The product of these 2 matrices,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.900
we deserve a little bit of
a drum roll at this point,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.966
when we multiply this 2 by 2 matrix

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:08.900
times this 2 by 2 matrix,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.878
we are going to get negative 16, 20,

00:06:14.263 --> 00:06:16.900
20, 16,

00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:21.933
and 16 and 2,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.932
and we are done.
