00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.520
Yea now its just 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.429
people come in on any random day
whether a earth quake had happened or not

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.709
just got a lot of upper respiratory secretions now

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.919
you see quite liver failure

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.710
from some kind of hepatitis I think

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.279
yea the stuff we have been doing the last few nights, people would have died if we didn't take care of it. 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.489
it just regular medical 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.779
stuff people can get anytime

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.010
like the typhoid intestinal perpheration or appendicitis  
0:00:33.010,0:00:33.990
he had a 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.400
appendicitis that

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.040
had ruptured

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.360
and so like in the states

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.380
someone like him would have been operated on a week ago

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.290
and it ruptured and he had a lot of contamination

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.280
in his abdomen and he he will do fine

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.660
definitely got 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.980
a bigger surgery than he would have

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.170
had in the states

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.270
you want to 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.170
go over to the ed

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.180
see if there is anything happening

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.880
that group said they were coming tonight, right?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.699
yes, we sort of make it up as we go along

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.010
it's harder and have a system like that to say who is going to work
that work which shift

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.590
people come and go every day

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.159
and they're different groups all staying in different places
it ends up working ok

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.110
but there some challenges for sure

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.320
it's just sort of go with the flow and help with whatever needs to be helped with

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.080
when did he eat poison?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.550
so the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.890
population mentally is pretty upbeat

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.130
young people with amputations and they are totally
joking and laughing

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.490
the whole

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.410
 infrastructure of the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.880
country and government though seems

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.990
less than ideal to deal

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.430
Aphrotite

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.220
we're so happy to see you

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.939
your life saver
