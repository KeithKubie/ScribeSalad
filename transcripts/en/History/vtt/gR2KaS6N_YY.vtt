00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.210
What happened to the Seer?

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.960
If he's gone, we
need to find him.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.960
And if somebody has tried to
kill him, we need to know who

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.120
and why.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.670
I know.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.380
The Lord came
to me last night.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.330
He showed me a vision.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.380
A vision of Hell
and the damned that

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.500
must endure its fires for all
eternity, and I was afraid.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.830
I must renounce our love.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.380
You know something?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.420
Your soul, whatever
that is, meant

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.750
more to you than I ever could.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.000
I don't think you
ever did love me.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.540
My lord Canahad.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.420
You are arrested for treason.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.710
Were you part of a conspiracy
to overthrow my son Alfred?

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.750
[crying]

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.880
No.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.710
I need to know.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.920
And I will know.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.670
Tell us the weight you
need in gold and silver

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.000
to go and leave Wessex.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.670
Come back tomorrow
and I will tell

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.290
you and your Christian
friends what you must pay.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.420
No one has come.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420
Of course not.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.120
They're not going to come.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.290
They were not
really negotiating.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.460
While we have
been waiting here,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.790
they have moved their entire
army around our flanks

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.710
and are now almost
certainly positioned

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.040
in the very place
they had already

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.960
chosen for the battleground.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.710
King Harald.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.880
Why is the ground burned?

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.620
To battle!

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.750
For Christ, for Wessex,
and for England!

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.080
[shouting]

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.080
[music playing]

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.330
[shouting]

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.000
The king lives!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.830
Long live the king.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.250
[grunting]

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.750
Lagertha!

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.880
When King Harald urged his
devils to run from the field,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.620
I knew then that the day and
the battle had belonged to us!

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.880
[crowd cheering]

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.540
The conspiracy against you.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.210
Those who wish to
overthrow and kill you.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.380
I know their names.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.830
Aethelred is their leader.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.790
I think I have found her.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.040
This is not her.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.830
My mother always carried
Thor's hammer around her waist.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.250
I don't think we are
going to find her.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.670
Magnus, son of Ragnar.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.920
What is to become of us now?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.830
I have faith that
we shall prevail.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.580
Our gods will ultimately triumph
over the Christian god, who's

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.750
a usurper, who has no meaning--

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.250
who's not real.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.710
And one day not so far
away, the name Jesus Christ

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.080
will be utterly forgotten.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.580
[chuckles]

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.250
[sighs]
