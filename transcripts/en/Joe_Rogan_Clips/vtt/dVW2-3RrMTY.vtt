1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.850
So this book a blueprint,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:07.110
the evolutionary origins of a good society.
When did you start this?

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.860
About nine or 10 years ago.
Uh,
and I,

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.160
at the time in my lab we were doing research on friendship.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
We were doing research on,
on why people have friends.
It's actually,
it's not,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.850
it's not difficult to provide an account for why we have sex with each other.
Uh,

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.950
many animals,
most animals are,
well,
I don't know if it's most,
but uh,

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.900
animals either reproduce sexually or asexually and most animals,

9
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.320
I'm trying to remember now what the relative proportions anyway,
mama say most,

10
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:38.730
most animals reproduce sexually and it's not hard to provide an account for how,

11
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.050
um,
for why we,
why sex originated,

12
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.790
why we reproduce sexually.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.830
It's not hard to provide an account for why we are choosy in our mates or why
we,

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.530
uh,
are careful in who we have sex with.

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.160
But human beings don't just mate with each other.
We befriend each other.

16
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.370
We form longterm non reproductive unions to other individuals to whom we're not

17
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:05.640
related.
Why?
That's very rare in the animal kingdom.

18
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:10.230
Very few creatures do this.
We do it.
Certain other primates,
elephants,

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.020
certain whales.
And that's mostly it.

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.270
So the question is why.

21
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:18.450
So I became very interested in my lab and try and understand the deep origins of

22
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:22.110
friendship.
Why would natural selection have equipped us with this capacity?

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.680
And that set the stage then for an exploring all kinds of other things in our

24
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:29.290
lives.
Like why we love each other.
For example,
why do we,
why do we,

25
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.330
when we have a sex with a person,
we tend to become attached to them.

26
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.760
We develop emotional sentiment about them.

27
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.390
That's not an essential to having sex yet.
We do that.

28
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.200
And then I became interested in other kinds of good things like not into just

29
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:46.560
love and friendship,
but cooperation and teaching.

30
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.180
Teaching is another crazy thing.

31
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.070
We take it for granted that we teach each other.
But think about this.

32
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.110
Most animals are able to learn.

33
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.880
So a little fish in the ocean learns that if it swims to the light,

34
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:04.440
it finds more food there.
So the fish then learns to,
to,
to be tropic,

35
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.190
to move towards the light.
Uh,
and that's individual learning.

36
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.240
Some animals develop what's called social learning.

37
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.260
Social learning is really efficient.
So if I put my hand in the fire,

38
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.950
I learned that I burned myself.
I pull my hand out,
I've learned something,

39
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.570
I paid a price and I learned something.

40
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.970
I could observe you putting your hand in the fire,
you pay all the price.

41
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.210
But I gained most of the knowledge.
It's almost as good.
I learned,
oh people,

42
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.640
you shouldn't put your hand in the fire,
saw the job that is end of the fire.

43
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.450
So social learning is super efficient learning from others,

44
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.920
but we take it to an even further level.
We don't just passively observe other,

45
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.420
other animals of our own species and learn from them.
We teach each other.

46
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.820
That is very rare in the animal kingdom where one animal sets out to teach and

47
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:54.240
other animals something.
So the book is,
uh,
is,
is,
uh,

48
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.660
is about the evolutionary origins of a good society.

49
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.080
It's also a kind of a response to kind of push back to a,

50
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:08.291
a long tradition in the sciences of attention to the bad parts of our nature.

51
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.190
You know,

52
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.050
a scientist in my view have for too long been looking at the origins of,

53
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080
of murder and tribalism and selfishness and a mendacity.

54
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.650
Um,
but,

55
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.790
but I think the bright side has been denied the attention it deserves because we

56
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:29.200
have also evolved to love and to befriend each other and to be kind to each

57
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.260
other and to cooperate and to teach each other and all these good things.

58
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:36.190
And I'll shut up and uh,
please don't know.
And uh,

59
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.920
and here's the thing.
Here's this sort of one way to think about this.

60
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.400
This must have been the case that the benefits of a connected life outweighed

61
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.234
the costs.

62
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.620
We would not be living socially if my exposure to you harmed me on net.

63
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.400
In other words,
if I came near you and you were violent to me,
you killed me,

64
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.230
or you gave me misinformation,

65
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:06.400
you told me lies about the world than my connection to you would ultimately harm

66
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.920
me.
That I should be better off living as an isolated animal.

67
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.080
So animals that come together to live socially there,

68
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.800
the benefits of that must outweigh the costs.

69
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.350
My living us living as a group,

70
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.160
so all this attention to the ways in which our interactions are bad,

71
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.910
that we kill each other,
that we steal from each other,
that we lie to each other,

72
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.380
that we have tribalism and all of these traits which we do every century is

73
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:34.300
replete with horrors.
I'm not like Pangloss like I don't think like,
you know,

74
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.790
Pollyanna like,
oh,
everything's great.
That's not me.

75
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.330
But what is me is a kind of optimistic focus on the good parts of our,

76
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.730
of human nature and the recognition that those good parts must in toto

77
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.510
overwhelmed the bad parts.
Well they certainly have to,

78
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:56.770
there's so many human beings.
I mean it's obvious that this is working.
Yes.

79
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.720
I mean we propagated where everywhere on every single patch of land that's

80
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.350
occupiable.
In fact you're,
you're exactly right.
The argument,

81
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:06.520
and that's discussed in the book,

82
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.510
the way we have achieved the kind of social conquest of the earth,

83
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.710
the way our species is,
is as spread out to occupy every niche,

84
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:17.620
which is also very rare.
Most animals live in one,
you know,

85
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:22.270
grizzlies living in this part of the world.
They don't live in Amazonia.
And,
uh,

86
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:25.870
you know,
polar bears live in this part of the world take,
don't live in,
in,
uh,

87
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:29.170
Arizona,
et cetera.
So,
so,
uh,

88
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.330
but our species lives everywhere.

89
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.230
And the way we have come to be able to do that is by the capacity to have

90
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:38.770
culture,
to teach and learn from each other,
to accumulate knowledge.

91
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.780
So in the book I talk about lots of this famous set of stories called the last

92
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:48.781
European explorer files about how European explorers are lost.

93
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:52.660
They lose their supplies,
they wind up dying.
And um,

94
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.310
but they're in an environment in which other people thrive and survive because

95
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.340
they have learned to how to live there.
So we've spread out around the world.

96
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:05.090
And then though there's a chapter in the book at the beginning about shipwrecks.

97
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.660
So,
so I have this,

98
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.600
should I go on chap?
Yeah.
So I have this,
uh,
is,
I have this,
uh,
so,

99
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:15.710
so what I'd like to do is,

100
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.320
what I try to set out to do in the beginning of the book is I say,
look,

101
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.450
it's clear that our genes shaped the structure and function of our bodies.

102
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.760
It is increasingly clear that our genes also straight shape the structure and

103
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:32.810
function of our minds,
our behaviors,
whether you are risk averse,
uh,

104
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.750
how intelligent you are,
uh,
whether you have wanderlust,
uh,

105
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.940
these properties are properties that depend in part on your genes.

106
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.810
But it's also clear to me,
and that's what the book argues,

107
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.660
is that our genes shape not just the structure and function of our bodies,

108
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.790
not just the structure and function of our minds,

109
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.280
but also the structure and function of our societies.

110
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.410
And to really prove that what we would need is something known as the forbidden

111
00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:58.244
experiment.

112
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.420
And the forbidden experiment is an experiment in which we took a group of babies

113
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.450
who had never been taught anything,
who are a cultural,

114
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:10.451
had no culture and stranded them on an island and left them on their own to see

115
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:13.130
what kind of society they would make when they grew up.
You know,

116
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:14.960
how would they organize themselves socially?

117
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.980
Is there kind of an innate society that human beings are,

118
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.450
are pre wired to make in an essence.

119
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.300
Now obviously that's unethical and cruel,

120
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.680
but actually monarchs for thousands of years have contemplated this experiment.

121
00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:33.350
So Heraclitus writes in about how one of the ancient Egyptian Pharaohs wanted to

122
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:34.850
know what kind of language would,

123
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.480
what was a natural language we had in us that we would speak if we were not

124
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:40.430
taught a language.
So this pharaoh,

125
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:45.431
it has said took two babies and gave them to a mute shepard to raise to see how

126
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:49.980
did the children's speak when they grew up.
And uh,
and,
and,
and uh,

127
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.830
Emperor Akbar attempted this,

128
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:54.080
there was a couple of European kings that attempted this.

129
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.390
Obviously we can't actually do this.

130
00:07:56.391 --> 00:08:00.920
So what I do in the book is I look at a series of other approximations of that.

131
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.370
And one chapter is devoted to looking at shipwrecks groups of men typically,

132
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:08.480
but sometimes men and women who,
between 1500 and 1900,

133
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:13.370
there were 9,000 shipwrecks.
Many more thousands of ships were lost at sea.

134
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.080
And in 20 of those cases,
we found 20 cases where,
uh,

135
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.060
at least 19 people were stranded for at least two months.
And,
uh,
you know,

136
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:26.660
here's a,
there's a,
a kind of,
um,
here's a map of the,
uh,

137
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.780
here's one crew I can tell you about it,
but here's a map of the,

138
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.570
of the shipwrecks.
Like these are the,
Oh wow.

139
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.270
The all over the world where they occurred and,
uh,

140
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.790
when they occurred and how many people there were.
And,
uh,
and so then I,
I,
uh,

141
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:45.080
I got all the original accounts from the sailors,
from the people on the wrecks.

142
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.060
And all contemporary archeological excavations of those wrecks were where they

143
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:52.370
had been excavated.
And,
um,

144
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.330
and try to understand what kind of society these isolated crews actually wind up

145
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:01.140
making.
And there was some amazing stories that were,
uh,
that I found in there.

146
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.130
So they stayed for at least two months.

147
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:07.530
How many of them actually established a real civilization?

148
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.590
How many of stuck forever?
No,
no one was stuck forever.

149
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.110
Most of those crews were eventually,
in fact,

150
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:16.960
all of those crews had at least one survivor because if they had all died,
uh,

151
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.600
then I wouldn't be able to know about them.

152
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.100
But there's a one famous case in which these sailors were stranded in near

153
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:25.980
Australia,
I think somewhere in the Pacific.

154
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.970
And they managed to catch a big petrol,
one of those huge birds that,
you know,

155
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.270
like the condor and uh,
and they,
they,

156
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.830
they put a little note in a little tiny bottle and they tied it to its feet.

157
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.110
And this petro flew thousands of miles and landed in Australia and was found

158
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.040
with a note indicating where the ice stranded sailors were.

159
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.420
And to ship was sent to go find the men and it got there,

160
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:56.070
but they had all died.
They were all gone.
So they use this,
this,
uh,
this bird.

161
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.910
So the bird,
well,
no,
they didn't eat the bird.
They put shit up.
No.

162
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.180
I think if you had that choice,
you would communicate rather than eat Joe.

163
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:10.940
I think.
Yes.
Yeah.
For a little bit.
Well,
until the very expert.
Yes,

164
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.610
yes,
yes.
But they starve to death then we don't know.
Nobody knows.

165
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:17.820
But the point is that we have to have it for me to be able to describe what

166
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:19.590
happened.
We needed at least one survivor.

167
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.850
And often there were many cases where everyone survived.
I mean,

168
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:28.851
there was one pair of cases that I was amazing to me in 1846 in south Auckland

169
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:36.520
islands,
just north of Antarctica,
south of New Zealand.
Uh,
the,
uh,

170
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.120
the Grafton was wrecked on the southern part of the island.

171
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.490
I can't remember how big the island was.
I,
it's in the book,
I may be,

172
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:44.530
let's say 90 miles long or something,
or 20 miles long.

173
00:10:44.531 --> 00:10:48.960
And these 20 miles long on the southern part of the island,
uh,

174
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.100
five men are wrecked in the Grafton.
And,
uh,

175
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.900
on the northern part of the island,

176
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.830
the Invercote rex 19 men are wrecked on the INVICO.
Uh,

177
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.700
all the Grafton cruise survives.
The,
and both P,

178
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.670
both crews were on the island at the same time.

179
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.890
They never encountered each other.
They're struggling for survival.
It's like an,

180
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.340
like an experiment.
Like who's going to win?
I'm tempted to say fear factor.
Yeah.

181
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.110
And,
uh,
and,
and the question is who's going to survive and how and why?

182
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.300
Everyone on the graft and crew survives,
and 16 of the 19 men on the,
uh,

183
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.110
on the Invercote crew die.
There's also cannibalism in that crew.
So it's a,

184
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:33.060
it's a very,
it's a very different outcome for various reasons.
So,

185
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.550
anyway,
so the point is that in the book,

186
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:41.150
I start with a series of stories about how people come together to make,

187
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.830
attempt to make new civilizations.

188
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.210
I use the example of unintentional communities with,
uh,
with shipwrecks.
I have,

189
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.110
I looked at it,
intentional communities like communes and um,

190
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.560
and a kibbutz in Israel and a 1970s communes in the United States,

191
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.650
a 19th century communes in the United States.
Actually going back to Roman times.

192
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:05.800
There've always been groups of people who've said,
society's fucked up.

193
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.380
I'm going to go and we're going to make it again.
You know,

194
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:10.330
we're going to start a fresh.
Um,

195
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.940
I look at settlements in Antarctica of a scientist's,
I look at the pit Karen,

196
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.700
you know,
the mutiny on the bounty.
I look at the Shackleton expedition.
Many,

197
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:21.070
many cases of stranded,

198
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:24.010
isolated groups of people trying to make a new social order.

199
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.600
And then I also use data from,
um,
experiments we do in my lab.

200
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:32.620
We have the software where tens of thousands of people have come and played

201
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:33.400
these games.

202
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.400
We can create these temporary artificial societies of real people where people

203
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:42.310
come and spend an hour or two and we would as godlike way can engineer the

204
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:42.881
society.

205
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:47.320
We can have a lot of inequality or little inequality or various other features.

206
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:51.010
And then we can observe what happens.
And I look at all of that data,

207
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:53.950
all those stories,
and say,
look,

208
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:59.370
there is a deep and fundamental way that no matter what human beings,

209
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.960
uh,
make a society their underlying fundamental principles about society,

210
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.060
which are as innate as the fact that you have two kidneys.
You know,

211
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.960
most people,
almost everyone or your pancreas makes insulin,

212
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.000
but they're very different all throughout the world,
right?

213
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:23.440
I mean there's totalitarian society.
No,
no.

214
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.050
So here's the point.
No,
yeah.
So here's what,
here's the argument.

215
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.720
You look around the world and the way,
the example I give is that yes,

216
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:34.270
there's huge cultural variation around the world.
Just like you said,

217
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:35.240
to tell turn societies.

218
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.590
There's people have different foods and they have different ways of dressing and

219
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:40.360
there's enormous cultural variation.

220
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.660
And it's marvelous and interesting and obvious to anybody.

221
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.080
But I think we're missing the forest from the trees.
To me,

222
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:51.550
this is like you and I are sitting on a plane and we look it up a hill that's

223
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:55.510
300 feet and 900 feet.
And we say those are very different hills.

224
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.710
But actually if we took a step back,
we would see that we're on,

225
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:03.880
we were on a plateau and one was a mountain that was 10,300 feet,

226
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.660
and another was a mountain that was 10,900 feet.
And actually there,

227
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.750
there are these much more deep and fundamental plate tectonic forces that are

228
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:15.160
creating these two mountains that are very similar.

229
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.220
But we are just focused on the superficial top.

230
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.190
So the argument in the book is that everywhere in the world,

231
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.450
people have friendship.
People love their partners,
people cooperate,

232
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.800
people teach each other.

233
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.860
These are fundamental common principals shared by everyone,

234
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.960
even though there's also a lot of variation.
