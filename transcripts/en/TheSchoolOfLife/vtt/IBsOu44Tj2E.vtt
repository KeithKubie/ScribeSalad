00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.140
We all say we want to be with someone nice; it sounds so plausible.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.660
-Did I tell you about this date last night?
-What happened?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.820
It was, I mean, the worst!

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.460
You think they're not going to get any worse, but then they do!

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.660
Just doesn't make sense, I mean, you're clever, you're pretty, you're funny; why can't you find the right man?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.800
-Thank you!
-Yeah

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.080
Well, all I'm looking for, I don't think it's too much to ask, is someone who's, you know

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.060
kind, funny, nice, and normal

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.160
But in practice it's pretty hard to deal with niceness when it does come along.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.140
So I didn't run; it's so embarrassing!

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.240
Would you like to go out for a drink sometime?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.500
-Yeah, okay!
-Yeah, like, I could call you about 9 o'clock after work?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.020
-Yeah! Cool!
-Brilliant!

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.860
A tiny part of us might think "If they're any good, why are they interested in us?"

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.440
I had the most amazing time last night.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.440
Thank you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.660
I love the color of your hair.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.840
If we aren't totally convinced of our own lovability, another person's affections could be a bit unnerving.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.720
"Wouldn't they rather be with someone else? Is something wrong with them?"

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.960
Their niceness can be so unsettling you might even try a trick or two.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.900
Oh, hi! It's, it's me.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.360
It's Hannah?

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.400
People who treat us like shit can seem like they understand something profound about life and about us.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.120
Yeah, no, I'm, uh, I'm just at the office at the moment, yeah.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.180
Thought I'd call, see what you were doing, if you wanted to hang out.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.520
Uh, next week, sort of, time is good. I'll call you.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.620
Uh, or yeah, no, uh, you-you call me, an-or we'll figure it out.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.820
Their assessment of us is more align with our assessment of ourselves.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.420
We shouldn't hold it against nice people if they like us.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.520
Maybe they see something in us we've overlooked.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.280
But you, the nice ones, shouldn't be naive either.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.480
It's very frightening to have to deal with niceness.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.600
It can be unfamiliar. It can freak some of us out.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.460
So be ready for us to panic and hang on in there.
