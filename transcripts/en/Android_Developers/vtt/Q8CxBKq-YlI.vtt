Sharkey: So one of the things
I've learned

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:02.868
as I've been jumping
into Android

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:04.267
is about
all of the features

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:05.767
that you can
really take advantage of,

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.634
and one of those
is stateful drawables.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:10.033
Now, I've come from
a Swing background in Java,

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.434
and so I'm used to, okay,

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:12.634
let's say I have
a button on the screen,

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:13.968
and when the user clicks
on that button,

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:15.234
or maybe they mouse over it,

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:16.667
I want that icon to change,

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.667
uh, to maybe
an inverted icon.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.701
Uh, so the way
I'd write that in Swing

00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:22.234
is you'd write
an onClick listener

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.467
or an onMouseOver--
a mouse move listener

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:26.801
to watch for those actions
and then swap out the image.

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:29.200
Um, but with Android,
you don't have to write those.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.701
With stateful drawables,
you can have a single image

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:33.200
that changes the image it--

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.567
that changes what it is
based on the state.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.634
So I don't have
to write that code.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:39.334
As the user
moves over something,

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:41.501
or when they touch something,
or as they check an item,

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:44.033
that i--that image
automatically changes for me.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.334
A second thing
I've really found valuable

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:47.634
is the Hierarchy Viewer.

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:48.901
I've found myself
a lot of times

00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:50.167
as I'm trying
to lay out a view

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:52.300
and really see how things work
on the screen,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.834
that it doesn't look
the way I want it to.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.100
Something's not working out.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.367
And so many times,

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:57.934
instead of just
tweaking little changes

00:00:57.934 --> 00:00:59.300
one at a time
to see, you know,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.667
"How can I fix this?

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.567
How can I make this layout
work the way I want it to?"

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:03.834
I can use
the Hierarchy Viewer

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:05.334
to really drill down and see

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:07.100
how things are being
laid out on the device,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.234
where the boundaries
of the objects are,

00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:10.734
so that I can clearly see

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:12.000
where things
are being laid out

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.767
and how I could reorganize
to solve the problem

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:15.901
and fix the view to make it
the way I want it.
