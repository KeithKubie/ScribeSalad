Hey, what's up Guys so if You've Been Following my instagram or Facebook you know I'm out in Hawaii right Now Filming a series of

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.949
Different Videos and I just got Shipped this Thing this is the Factory Prototype of the stealth Shelf for our Kickstarter that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.899
We just launched Earlier this Month There's only A few Days Left so if You still want one go on and Grab it Really quick

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.410
I'll Show you kind of how This One Looks some of the Updates that, we're Making some of the improvements

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.570
We are Making now put some links in the Description as, [well] our Kickstarter was Successfully Funded in About Three

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570
Days so Thank You Guys This is Happening now This Is kind of what

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.029
We're Thinking I'll come in A black Box with some Diamond plated aluminum Tread when you open it up you're Gonna have some Foam Padding

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.280
And Should find your finished Shelf this Should be Ready to Take right out of the Box and mount to your wall

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.999
Now I originally designed it to be this length Because this is the biggest Shelf you can

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.559
Make With One [Four] Foot board but now that, we're Having to Manufacture, We don't have that Constraint Anymore so?

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.909
We Can Make them a little bit longer [now] [one] [of] the biggest Questions I had on my last Video [is] how do you mount

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.849
This Thing to your Wall it's Actually very Easy [in] America

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.239
We use Sheetrock and Studs on [sixteen] inch Centers and I just Screwed This board Directly Into the Studs Giving it A lot of Durability

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.020
All I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.520
Did Was drill a couple of Pilot holes right Here Near the Side and Took some Two and [a] half to three inch Wood Screws

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.180
And secured it straight Into the Stud now my Team Sent one of the Diy Kits to my friend zack from [Jury-Rigged] everything he put

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.930
Together A, [Step-By-Step], Tutorial Assembling The Kit and Mounting it to his Own Wall as

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.360
