1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
I'm taking over leadership of a team of
six people to I know and for I don't.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,430
When you've taken over leadership,

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:13,431
did you one give a group talk to
meet with each individual and three,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,920
what did you say? Good question.
Yes. Obviously give a group talk.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,250
That's affirmative. You get
everyone together. Hey guys,

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,090
my name is bill [inaudible].

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,970
I came from this place
I'm here to take over.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,480
Now there's a some judgment calls do
you have to make because you're going to

9
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,990
introduce yourself, but if you're
taking over a well functioning team,

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,861
then guess what?

11
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:45,861
You're not going into revamp everything
immediately cause everything's going

12
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:49,560
fine. So your hey, I'm happy to be working
with you guys. Looking forward to it.

13
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,620
I know you guys have a great reputation.
Glad to be a part of the team. Awesome.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,460
If you have any questions, let
me know. I'm here. That's easy.

15
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:59,370
If you're taking over a team
that's not a working well, right?

16
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,650
There's problems and that's why if
somebody got fired and that's why you're

17
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:04,500
coming in there, you might need to
address some of those things. Hey, listen,

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,100
I know things have been a
little off track. I'm going
to look at what's going on.

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,160
I'm going to take input from you guys.
We probably need to make some changes.

20
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,950
We're going to do it together as a team.
That's where we're moving from here.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,970
We need to get back to where we're
supposed to be. Boom. Something like that.

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:18,661
And again,

23
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,150
there's gonna be people on that team
that have been busting their ass and

24
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:24,870
working really hard. And if you go in
there and just disparage everyone there,

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,050
you're going to start off
on the wrong foot. So yeah,

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,290
have to keep it pretty broad when
you meet the whole group, hey,

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,140
this is who I am as to where I came from,
this is what I'm looking forward to.

28
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,760
All that stuff. And then yes. Do
you meet with people individually?

29
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,820
Absolutely. You go around, you
meet with them and when you,

30
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,070
what do you talk to them about?
You talk to them about them.

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,980
We talked to them about them.
You want to know about them,

32
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,530
you want to know who they are.
You want to know what their,

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,460
what their family situation is, what
their interests are, what's going on,

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,950
how they feel about the transitions
that have been taken place.

35
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,080
A little bit of that stuff. It's
not about you, it's about them.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,390
So go yes and talked to everyone. Take
notes, maybe not right in front of them.

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
So you look like a nerd but you
know you afterwards you go, hey,

38
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:11,190
bill has three kids.
His wife also works at the company,

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,110
he's interested in soccer and basketball,
whatever. You just take those notes.

40
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,140
You know it's actually good before
you take some on over a situation.

41
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,650
If you already familiarized
yourself with us, you look at the,

42
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,340
maybe the HR website at your company
has a picture of everyone so you kind of

43
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,790
know who they are, gives you less
stuff to remember. So there's that

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,390
make good first impression.
Don't go in there looking like an idiot.

45
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,600
Don't go in there thinking that,
oh, I just, I'm the boss man.

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,720
So everyone has to bow down
and bow down to my superiority.

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,390
No, they're actually mad at you for like
the, the thing is they're mad at you.

48
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:59,391
So I remember one time I was taking over
a small element and one of my friends

49
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,200
was a part of the element
and I went in like 20 guys.

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,110
I went in Hay and I walked in,

51
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,590
but I just had a notebook with like five
things I wanted to talk to them about.

52
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,780
And as soon as I walked in, I opened up
my notebook and he's said something like,

53
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,240
you brought a notebook,
you're always squared away.

54
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,590
That's why you're putting in charge.
That's when your boots are.

55
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:26,200
So like just a little impression of, hey
man, I'm, I take this stuff seriously.

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,030
And I would say overall your main
goal when you're meeting your team,

57
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:35,650
when you're meeting the individuals on
your team is you are looking to build

58
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,710
relationships with the people on the team.
That's what your goal is.

59
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,110
Because when you build these relationships
that's just gonna make your team

60
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:44,150
stronger, et cetera. Yeah.

61
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,950
I remember the time that you want when
you were on Joe Rogan the first time when

62
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,461
he was like,
hey,

63
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,240
you're the only ones who's ever brought
in note pad yolk and you're like,

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,680
just trying to be prepared
to just try to be prepared.

65
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,420
It was good in case there's
anything, you know, you hop,

66
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,020
it comes up to you don't want it to slip
your mind. Yeah. Yeah. That's funny.

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,950
And I'm trying to imagine
being a worker and you know,

68
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:10,000
when you get a new manager,
you know, whatever new boss,
um, you know, they come in.

69
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,510
Yeah. If they're at like
having the individual meeting,
I would dig it and then,

70
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:16,180
but if they're like taking
notes, I'd be like, wait, why
are you taking notes? Like,

71
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,660
well, how are you going to use this
against me later? Or something like that.

72
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,750
Hey man, how's it going? How
long have you been here for? Oh,

73
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:27,490
I've been here for four years. Oh,
cool. Do you you married? Yeah. Yeah,

74
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:29,410
I got two kids. Oh, that's
awesome. That's awesome.

75
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,930
How long have you been married
for? Six years. Like that.

76
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,330
You didn't even know the person.
If I go in there and I go,

77
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,090
how long have you been here and you're
like six years and I write that tonight.

78
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,130
And I say, ah, what? What? What is
your primary function here at the team?

79
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,870
You know what I mean?
If you just jumped right into that.

80
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,730
We're not looking to build a relationship.

81
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:48,760
We're just looking to find out how I can
use you. Yeah, that's what it feels like.

82
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,040
I mean you said it like Polo, you been
married, you said it like that man.

83
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,010
It doesn't matter how you say you can
say it the most nice polite way ever.

84
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,530
And when you write it down
it's kind of like, Bro,

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,610
you going to take all this information in,

86
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,890
sort of do some sort of evaluation for me.
You know,

87
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,870
kind of is what it feels like.
It does feel like that.

88
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:11,300
That's why I specifically said when
you're having a personal conversation with

89
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:12,790
the person that you're
meeting for the first time,

90
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,560
you're not scratching it into a note pad.
Now, that being said, if the guy says,

91
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,200
you know what, I've noticed some things
here around here that need changing.

92
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,060
You go,
really hold on a second.

93
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,570
Let me break out my notebook here and
take notes on what you're about to say.

94
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,240
Probably the guy that's a dance, you know,
it's like when you get a micro manager,

95
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,510
you're working for a micromanager.
Bring a notebook. You,

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,230
they see you writing stuff
down. They think it's, they,

97
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,710
they're like happy trick anyway.
Yeah.

98
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,320
Cause well because when you're writing
down their stuff saying flips the script,

99
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,860
it's like, it makes it like all
yeah. Yeah. He's taking notes.

100
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,810
It's a part what I'm saying,
you know for sure.

101
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,990
Like he's gonna evaluate like my
opinion. Oh heck yeah. That's good.

102
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,080
Roll in there with the Moog book.
It's like the doctor,

103
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,330
you know when you go to the doctor
and he's asking you, oh yeah,

104
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,180
like all this stuff. You see
them writing down, you know,

105
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,800
and your chart or whatever.

106
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,600
Even though situation is good cause
you want them to go evaluate it later,

107
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,480
whatever. You don't give you a
cure. But same deal, man. Same deal.

108
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,080
Be careful with those notes.
My seat Jack.

109
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,030
Jack Echoes not prepared for
you to take notes on them.

110
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:12,890
We're not with my personal stuff. How long
have been married? Oh, nine years old,

111
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:17,060
kid. Nine years. Anyway, you understand.
