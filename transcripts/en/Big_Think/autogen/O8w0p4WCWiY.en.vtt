most often we see that hyperactivity

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210
most often we see that hyperactivity
 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.559
most often we see that hyperactivity
disappears as someone gets older and so

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569
disappears as someone gets older and so
 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:55.419
disappears as someone gets older and so
when they're in their late adolescence

when they're in their late adolescence
 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.209
when they're in their late adolescence
and early adulthood that symptom seems

and early adulthood that symptom seems
 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.239
and early adulthood that symptom seems
to go away and if we are able to look at

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249
to go away and if we are able to look at
 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.740

children and in fact an important study

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240
children and in fact an important study
 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.540
children and in fact an important study
was done about 15 years ago that

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550
was done about 15 years ago that
 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.630
was done about 15 years ago that
followed kids over a decade who had

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640
followed kids over a decade who had
 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.690
followed kids over a decade who had
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.340
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
and these were children who had never

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350
and these were children who had never
 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.320
and these were children who had never
taken medication this was a group of

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330
taken medication this was a group of
 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.120
taken medication this was a group of
kids who met the diagnostic criteria

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130
kids who met the diagnostic criteria
 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.550
kids who met the diagnostic criteria
were studied at the National Institute

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560
were studied at the National Institute
 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.070
were studied at the National Institute
of Mental Health and had parents who

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080
of Mental Health and had parents who
 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.650
of Mental Health and had parents who
said under no circumstances will we

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660
said under no circumstances will we
 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.950
said under no circumstances will we
treat our kids with Ritalin or any kind

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960
treat our kids with Ritalin or any kind
 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.530
treat our kids with Ritalin or any kind
of medication and were compared to a

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540
of medication and were compared to a
 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.100
of medication and were compared to a
group of typical or normal children the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110
group of typical or normal children the
 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.110
group of typical or normal children the
same age and they found that there were

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120
same age and they found that there were
 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.760
same age and they found that there were
significant differences in the frontal

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770
significant differences in the frontal
 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.610
significant differences in the frontal
lobe and in the cerebellum the frontal

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620
lobe and in the cerebellum the frontal
 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.980
lobe and in the cerebellum the frontal
lobe is where you have your executive

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990
lobe is where you have your executive
 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.660
lobe is where you have your executive
functioning where you're able to

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670
functioning where you're able to
 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.690
functioning where you're able to
prioritize which items should I attack

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700
prioritize which items should I attack
 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.880
prioritize which items should I attack
first what's the important things that I

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890
first what's the important things that I
 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.950
first what's the important things that I
should do today and how do I get that

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960
should do today and how do I get that
 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.350
should do today and how do I get that
done before I go to item two three four

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360
done before I go to item two three four
 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.820
done before I go to item two three four
and five that are tackling me as far as

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830
and five that are tackling me as far as
 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.130
and five that are tackling me as far as
my daily tasks and the cerebellum is

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140
my daily tasks and the cerebellum is
 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.619
my daily tasks and the cerebellum is
where coordination is and so it's really

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629
where coordination is and so it's really
 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.440
where coordination is and so it's really
interesting that as these kids got older

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450
interesting that as these kids got older
 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.360
interesting that as these kids got older
and hit adolescence they're Sarah

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370
and hit adolescence they're Sarah
 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.610
and hit adolescence they're Sarah
Belem started to look more like the same

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620
Belem started to look more like the same
 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.820
Belem started to look more like the same
size as the typical normal kids and it

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830
size as the typical normal kids and it
 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.300
size as the typical normal kids and it
would explain why the hyperactivity

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
would explain why the hyperactivity
 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.820
would explain why the hyperactivity
symptom seems to diminish and yet the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830
symptom seems to diminish and yet the
 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.509
symptom seems to diminish and yet the
frontal lobes still seemed significantly

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519
frontal lobes still seemed significantly
 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.780
frontal lobes still seemed significantly
smaller than the typical normal child

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
 
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.309
 
so I think it's important for us to

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319
so I think it's important for us to
 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.429
so I think it's important for us to
realize that our brains are filled with

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439
realize that our brains are filled with
 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.199
realize that our brains are filled with
neurotransmitters these are brain

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209
neurotransmitters these are brain
 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.539
neurotransmitters these are brain
chemicals that move from one part of the

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549
chemicals that move from one part of the
 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.000
chemicals that move from one part of the
brain to another and take messages with

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
brain to another and take messages with
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.490
brain to another and take messages with
them the three big neurotransmitters

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
them the three big neurotransmitters
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.920
them the three big neurotransmitters
would be dopamine norepinephrine and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930
would be dopamine norepinephrine and
 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.800
would be dopamine norepinephrine and
serotonin and when you have attention

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810
serotonin and when you have attention
 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.949
serotonin and when you have attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder you use

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959
deficit hyperactivity disorder you use
 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.410
deficit hyperactivity disorder you use
your dopamine and your neuro epinephrine

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420
your dopamine and your neuro epinephrine
 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.680
your dopamine and your neuro epinephrine
faster in your brain than the average

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
faster in your brain than the average
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.839
faster in your brain than the average
person and when you don't have enough of

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849
person and when you don't have enough of
 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.809
person and when you don't have enough of
that you become an attentive or you

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819
that you become an attentive or you
 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.240
that you become an attentive or you
become more impulsive or you're more

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250
become more impulsive or you're more
 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.149
become more impulsive or you're more
hyperactive the centers of the brain

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159
hyperactive the centers of the brain
 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.780
hyperactive the centers of the brain
that are smaller on these patients who

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790
that are smaller on these patients who
 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.240
that are smaller on these patients who
have ADHD seem to be very rich in

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250
have ADHD seem to be very rich in
 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.390
have ADHD seem to be very rich in
dopamine and in norepinephrine so it's

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400
dopamine and in norepinephrine so it's
 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.879
dopamine and in norepinephrine so it's
very nice that there's a neuroanatomical

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889
very nice that there's a neuroanatomical
 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.420
very nice that there's a neuroanatomical
reason for us to be sure that the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430
reason for us to be sure that the
 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.979
reason for us to be sure that the
chemicals that we're talking about are

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989
chemicals that we're talking about are
 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.210
chemicals that we're talking about are
equal now you can't take dopamine or

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
equal now you can't take dopamine or
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.339
equal now you can't take dopamine or
norepinephrine or even serotonin and get

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349
norepinephrine or even serotonin and get
 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.500
norepinephrine or even serotonin and get
it to your brain because there's

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510
it to your brain because there's
 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.270
it to your brain because there's
something in our body called the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280
something in our body called the
 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.430
something in our body called the
blood-brain barrier protects the brain

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440
blood-brain barrier protects the brain
 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.309
blood-brain barrier protects the brain
and the spinal cord and the

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319
and the spinal cord and the
 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.300
and the spinal cord and the
neurotransmitters those brain chemicals

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310
neurotransmitters those brain chemicals
 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.039
neurotransmitters those brain chemicals
that move back and forth in that space

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049
that move back and forth in that space
 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.559
that move back and forth in that space
and so we give medications that kind of

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569
and so we give medications that kind of
 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.409
and so we give medications that kind of
change or trick the brain so that we

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419
change or trick the brain so that we
 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.009
change or trick the brain so that we
allow dopamine or norepinephrine in the

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019
allow dopamine or norepinephrine in the
 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.740
allow dopamine or norepinephrine in the
case of kids with ADHD to hang around

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750
case of kids with ADHD to hang around
 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.580
case of kids with ADHD to hang around
longer in the brain to make them look

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590
longer in the brain to make them look
 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.699
longer in the brain to make them look
more typical these medications whether

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709
more typical these medications whether
 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.770
more typical these medications whether
they're ritalin which is very similar to

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780
they're ritalin which is very similar to
 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.289
they're ritalin which is very similar to
focalin and a group that's called meth

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299
