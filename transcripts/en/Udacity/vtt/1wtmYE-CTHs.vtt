00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.600
Borderline personality disorder is a serious mental illness, and it's

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.454
categorized by unstable moods, thoughts and behaviors. People with this

00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:12.788
disorder have difficulty regulating their emotions and thoughts. They engage in

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:15.777
impulsive and reckless behavior, and they have difficulty maintaining

00:00:15.777 --> 00:00:20.679
relationships with other individuals. In addition, people with this disorder

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.965
have out of control emotions, they're afraid of being abandoned, and they

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:30.038
vacillate between idolizing and despising those who are close to them. People

00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:33.866
with this disorder are more likely to experience self-injury, such as cutting

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:39.862
themselves, burning themselves, or even attempting suicide. Moreover, they're

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:43.396
more likely to experience substance abuse, eating disorders, or anxiety

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:48.616
disorders. Interestingly, cultural factors or social factors may increase the

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:53.500
risk of this disorder. For example, living in a community or culture that has

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.280
unstable family relationships could increase the risk of borderline personality

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.880
disorder.
