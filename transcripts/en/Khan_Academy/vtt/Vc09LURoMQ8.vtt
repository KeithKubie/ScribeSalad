00:00:00.428 --> 00:00:03.040
- [Voiceover] In the video on
triangle medians and centroids

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.989
I did, essentially, the
proof that the centroid

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:08.080
is 2/3 along the way of a median.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.621
I did it using a two-dimensional triangle

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.453
in three dimensions,

00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:12.790
and I mentioned that I thought, at least

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.962
it made the math a little simpler,

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:16.566
but someone mentioned
that they'd be interested

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.506
in seeing the two-dimensional
version of the proof,

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:20.085
so why not do that?

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:22.385
So let's just draw an arbitrary triangle,

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.454
and I'll make one side of the triangle

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:26.752
right along the x-axis just to make,

00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:28.795
I think it'll make the
math a little bit easier,

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.295
maybe there's easier ways of doing it.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:33.316
So that's one side of the triangle,

00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:34.998
that's the other side of the triangle,

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:38.293
and let's put the height of the triangle,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.027
let's put it on the y-axis,

00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:43.541
so this triangle right here,

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:45.280
this is the y-axis

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:48.443
that is the y-axis,

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:49.846
and then this right here,

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:55.957
is our x-axis.

00:00:57.507 --> 00:00:59.851
Now, we said that this
is an arbitrary triangle,

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.517
so let's just make this distance

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:05.456
equal to a,

00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:07.382
so this point right here, this vertex

00:01:07.382 --> 00:01:10.017
would be the point a comma zero,

00:01:10.017 --> 00:01:11.330
so that distance is a.

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:16.552
Let's make this distance right here

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:19.954
be equal to, I don't know,
let's make it equal to b,

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:24.736
so this is the point
negative b comma zero,

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:27.082
and then let's make this distance,

00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:29.486
this is the point y is equal to c,

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:32.371
so this is a point zero comma c,

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:33.879
so it's an arbitrary triangle,

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:36.374
any triangle can be represented this way.

00:01:36.374 --> 00:01:38.638
Now, let's think about its medians.

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:40.705
Let's think about its
medians and the centroid.

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.586
I'm only going to do it
for two of the medians,

00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:44.292
because we know that the third median

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:47.143
will also intersect at the same centroid,

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:51.106
so we have a median on this,

00:01:51.106 --> 00:01:53.068
we have a midpoint, I should say,

00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:55.006
on this side of the triangle,

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.577
and its coordinates are just going to be

00:01:56.577 --> 00:01:58.303
the midpoint of those two points,

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:02.481
or zero plus a over two, which
would just be a over two,

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.489
and then c plus zero over two,

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:07.161
which would just be c over two.

00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.413
Let's do the same thing over here.

00:02:08.413 --> 00:02:11.734
The midpoint of this side right over here

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:14.717
is going to be negative
b plus zero over two,

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:17.399
so it's negative b over two,

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.847
and then zero plus c over two,

00:02:19.847 --> 00:02:24.602
so it's just going to be c over two.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.883
Now that we know all the coordinates

00:02:26.883 --> 00:02:28.415
for the vertices and the midpoints,

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:29.925
at least of these two sides,

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:33.199
we can find the equations for the lines

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.953
that the medians are part of,

00:02:34.953 --> 00:02:37.303
so we can find the equation for this line,

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:40.207
we could find the equation
for this line in purple,

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:42.193
then we can find the
equation for the other line

00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:43.620
that connects to these two dots,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.154
find their intersection,

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:48.888
and we'll essentially have the
coordinates of our centroid,

00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:50.286
of the intersection of the medians,

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:51.480
and we can do it for this one, too,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.448
but that would be redundant,

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:54.875
because it's going to
intersect in the same point.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:58.394
So what would be the equation
for this line right over here?

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:02.492
Well, our slope is going
to be change and y,

00:03:02.492 --> 00:03:04.104
so c over two minus zero,

00:03:04.104 --> 00:03:06.229
so that's just c over two,

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.451
over change and x,

00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:12.451
so a over two minus minus b,

00:03:14.623 --> 00:03:16.853
so minus negative b, I should say,

00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:20.147
so it's plus b, I could
write a plus b over here,

00:03:20.147 --> 00:03:21.656
but just to makes the
maths involved right,

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:25.255
plus 2b over two.

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:27.218
I just subtracted a negative b,

00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:29.434
which is the same thing as adding a b,

00:03:29.434 --> 00:03:32.358
and adding a b is the same
thing as adding a 2b over two,

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.968
and I did that so these
have the same denominator.

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:37.802
I could add them, or I could just multiply

00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:39.928
the numerator and the
denominator both by two

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.460
and I'll get the slope is equal to,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.117
c over a plus 2b,

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:48.026
so that's the slope of
this line right over here,

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:50.793
and then we know some points here.

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:53.395
We could just use the point slope formula

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:55.310
for the equation of a line.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.225
We know the point negative
b comma zero is on the line,

00:03:58.225 --> 00:04:00.414
so we know that the equation
of this line in purple,

00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:01.347
let me stay in the purple,

00:04:01.347 --> 00:04:04.603
is going to be y minus zero,

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.794
is equal to x minus negative b,

00:04:09.794 --> 00:04:12.005
or I could say x plus b,

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:13.284
times our slope,

00:04:13.284 --> 00:04:17.969
times c over a plus 2b.

00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:21.646
And obviously, this would just simplify to

00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:24.624
y is equal to all of
this business over here,

00:04:24.624 --> 00:04:26.528
so this is essentially the equation

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:29.295
of this median right here
if the line just kept going,

00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:33.364
or the median is a line segment
that is part of this line.

00:04:36.168 --> 00:04:39.948
Let us do the same thing for
this line right over here,

00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:42.397
this median right over here.

00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:45.145
So once again, its slope is

00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:48.515
change and y over change and x,

00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:51.293
so the change and y,
c over two minus zero,

00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:55.053
so the slope here is equal
to c over two minus zero,

00:04:55.053 --> 00:04:56.748
which is just c over two,

00:04:56.748 --> 00:04:58.757
over negative b over two,

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.830
minus a, or I could say minus 2a over two,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.822
that's the same thing as minus a,

00:05:07.822 --> 00:05:08.848
and do the same thing,

00:05:08.848 --> 00:05:11.680
multiply the numerator and
the denominator by two.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.604
We get

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.657
c over

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:20.170
negative b minus 2a,

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.980
so the equation of this line
right here, the other median,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.820
the equation of this other
median right over here,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.197
well we have this point over here,

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:31.541
so we could use the point slope again.

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:33.516
We get y minus zero

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.661
is equal to x minus a

00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:43.898
times the slope, times c over

00:05:46.894 --> 00:05:48.664
negative b minus 2a,

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:50.985
so we have the two
equations for these lines.

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:54.718
We can now use that information
to find their intersection,

00:05:54.718 --> 00:05:57.205
which is going to be the centroid.

00:05:57.205 --> 00:05:58.401
Well, to do that, we have

00:05:58.401 --> 00:05:59.795
both of these in terms of y, right?

00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:01.782
Y minus zero is the same thing as y,

00:06:03.807 --> 00:06:05.525
so we could just set this

00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:09.282
as being equal to that, so let's do that.

00:06:09.282 --> 00:06:14.282
We get x plus b times c,

00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:19.675
over a plus 2b is equal to

00:06:22.098 --> 00:06:26.029
x minus a times c over

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:28.780
negative b minus 2a.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.295
Well, both sides are divisible by c,

00:06:30.295 --> 00:06:33.000
we can assume that c is non-zero,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.678
so this triangle actually exists,

00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:36.651
it actually exists in two dimensions,

00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:39.629
so we can divide both
sides by c and we get that.

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:42.635
Let's see, now we can cross-multiply.

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:46.687
We can multiply x plus b times
this quantity right here,

00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:47.831
and that's going to be equal to

00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:50.049
a plus 2b times this quantity over here.

00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:52.423
We can just distribute it,

00:06:52.423 --> 00:06:54.721
so it's going to be x
times all of this business,

00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:59.346
it's going to be x times
negative b minus 2a,

00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:01.128
plus b times all of this,

00:07:01.128 --> 00:07:05.510
so that's going to be
minus b squared minus 2ab,

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.570
so I just multiply that times that,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.013
is going to equal to this times that,

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.480
so it's going to be x
times all of this business.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.603
X times a plus 2b,

00:07:15.603 --> 00:07:18.521
minus a times that, so distribute the a,

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.942
minus a squared

00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:24.191
minus 2ab.

00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:25.468
Let's see if we can simplify this.

00:07:25.468 --> 00:07:27.547
We have a negative 2ab on both sides,

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:28.909
so let's just subtract that out,

00:07:31.643 --> 00:07:33.001
so we cancelled things out,

00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:35.683
let's subtract this from
both sides of the equation,

00:07:35.683 --> 00:07:40.548
so we'll have a minus x times a plus 2b,

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:42.788
and I'll subtract that from here,

00:07:42.788 --> 00:07:44.842
but I'll write it a little
different, it'll simplify things,

00:07:44.842 --> 00:07:45.831
so this will become

00:07:47.778 --> 00:07:51.825
x times, I'll distribute the
negative inside the a plus 2b,

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:55.784
so negative a minus 2b,

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:58.628
and let's add a b squared to both sides,

00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:02.505
so plus b squared, plus b squared.

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:04.547
I want to collect all
the x terms on one side

00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:06.060
and all of the constants on the other.

00:08:09.257 --> 00:08:12.452
This becomes on the left-hand side,

00:08:12.452 --> 00:08:14.750
the coefficient on x, I have

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.598
negative b minus 2b is negative 3b

00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:23.979
negative 2a minus a is negative 3a,

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:27.745
times x is equal to,
these guys cancel out,

00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:28.903
and these guys cancel out,

00:08:28.903 --> 00:08:31.862
is equal to b squared minus a squared.

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:36.372
Let's see if we can factor,

00:08:36.372 --> 00:08:39.014
this already looks a little
suspicious in a good way,

00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:40.859
something that we should be able to solve.

00:08:40.859 --> 00:08:42.079
This can be factored.

00:08:42.079 --> 00:08:43.936
We can factor out a negative three.

00:08:43.936 --> 00:08:45.156
We can actually factor out a three.

00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:48.979
We'll get three times b minus a,

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.319
actually, let's factor
out a negative three,

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:56.741
so negative three

00:08:56.741 --> 00:08:59.581
times b plus a times x

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.297
is equal to, now this is
the same thing as b plus a

00:09:03.289 --> 00:09:04.677
times b minus a.

00:09:05.787 --> 00:09:08.498
So we can divide both sides by b plus a,

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:14.410
we have negative three times
x is equal to b minus a,

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.689
let's just divide both
sides by negative three.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.389
We get x is equal to

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:22.375
b minus a over negative three,

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:24.240
which is the same thing as

00:09:27.513 --> 00:09:29.559
a minus b over three,

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:34.251
so we have the x-coordinate
so far for our centroid.

00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:36.596
It is a minus b over three.

00:09:41.525 --> 00:09:43.683
You kind of see hints of
the solution over here.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.938
A minus b is this entire distance.

00:09:45.938 --> 00:09:48.123
It's one third of this entire distance,

00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:50.157
although I don't want
to jump the gun too much

00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:53.627
because it complicates
just the x-coordinate.

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:55.185
But let's figure out the y-coordinate.

00:09:55.185 --> 00:09:57.177
To do that, we can just substitute back

00:09:57.177 --> 00:09:59.915
into one of these equations up here.

00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:03.126
This was the equation of this median,

00:10:03.126 --> 00:10:05.262
the grey median that we had done,

00:10:05.262 --> 00:10:07.050
so lets substitute back in.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.229
We have, I'll do it over here,

00:10:11.229 --> 00:10:14.568
y is equal to x minus a times c.

00:10:14.568 --> 00:10:16.772
X is this thing over here, so it's

00:10:16.772 --> 00:10:21.772
a minus b over three minus a,

00:10:22.024 --> 00:10:23.104
so I'm going to subtract,

00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:24.876
instead of just writing
a minus a over here,

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:28.185
I'm going to write a
negative three over three,

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:31.064
so minus three a over three.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:32.967
That's this minus a right over here.

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:36.103
I just multiplied and divided it by three.

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:39.004
It's going to be all of that times c

00:10:40.383 --> 00:10:43.946
over negative b minus 2a,

00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:45.653
so this is going to be equal to c

00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:47.185
and the numerator up here,

00:10:47.185 --> 00:10:49.553
we have an a minus 3a,

00:10:49.553 --> 00:10:51.532
so this is equal to negative b,

00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:56.158
we have a negative b there

00:10:56.158 --> 00:11:00.297
and then we have a minus 3a is minus 2a,

00:11:00.297 --> 00:11:02.909
so this becomes negative b minus 2a,

00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:06.700
we can factor out the 1/3,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.163
times c over three, so
that's what the numerator is.

00:11:10.163 --> 00:11:12.648
All of that over negative b minus 2a,

00:11:12.648 --> 00:11:14.462
well, that's going to cancel with that,

00:11:14.462 --> 00:11:16.450
and so our y-coordinate is going to be

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.299
equal to c over three,

00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:23.423
so our y-coordinate over
here is c over three.

00:11:23.423 --> 00:11:25.348
Now, we could just use
the distance formula now.

00:11:25.348 --> 00:11:26.346
We know all the coordinates,

00:11:26.346 --> 00:11:28.499
and feel free to do it if you like,

00:11:28.499 --> 00:11:29.915
but there's a slight simplification,

00:11:29.915 --> 00:11:32.657
or at least in my mind
a slight simplification.

00:11:32.657 --> 00:11:36.204
We know that the height,

00:11:36.204 --> 00:11:37.751
we know that the y-coordinate

00:11:40.462 --> 00:11:43.538
of the centroid is c over three,

00:11:43.538 --> 00:11:47.896
so this right here, this point
over here, is c over three.

00:11:47.896 --> 00:11:50.748
We could actually use,
maybe an easier argument,

00:11:50.748 --> 00:11:52.534
because remember, our
whole point was to show

00:11:54.355 --> 00:11:58.557
that this point is 2/3 along the median

00:11:58.557 --> 00:11:59.881
away from the vertex.

00:11:59.881 --> 00:12:01.885
Let me draw this vertex now here.

00:12:01.885 --> 00:12:03.043
Our whole point of this video

00:12:03.043 --> 00:12:05.693
as we said this is the
midpoint of this side over here

00:12:05.693 --> 00:12:08.073
is to show that this right here

00:12:08.073 --> 00:12:09.921
is 2/3 along the way,

00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:12.515
or that this length is twice this length,

00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:16.056
or that this length is 2/3

00:12:16.056 --> 00:12:18.714
of the entire length of the median.

00:12:18.714 --> 00:12:20.386
So how can we do that?

00:12:20.386 --> 00:12:21.907
Well, the simplest way I can do that,

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:24.216
I mean you could actually
just use the coordinates

00:12:24.216 --> 00:12:25.307
and use the distance formula,

00:12:25.307 --> 00:12:27.287
but a simpler way, just the
way that we've arranged this,

00:12:27.287 --> 00:12:29.992
is just to use an argument
of similar triangles.

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:38.568
We know that this entire
height right here in blue is c.

00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:46.999
We know that this height right
over here is c over three.

00:12:47.927 --> 00:12:50.505
Or you could do that as 1/3 times c,

00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:54.882
so we know that this height over here

00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:59.882
we know that that distance is 2/3 c,

00:13:00.048 --> 00:13:02.672
so we can use a similar triangle argument.

00:13:02.672 --> 00:13:07.206
Let's say that this
entire thing right here

00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:09.335
is the length of the median,

00:13:09.335 --> 00:13:10.827
and let's just call that, I don't know,

00:13:10.827 --> 00:13:12.312
let's call that l,

00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:14.221
and let's say we want to figure out

00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:16.909
how far along the median
away from the vertex that is

00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:18.407
and let's just call that,

00:13:18.407 --> 00:13:19.499
let me use another,

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.806
let me just call that distance,

00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:24.280
let me do this in a different color.

00:13:26.918 --> 00:13:29.515
Let's call this distance, right over here,

00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:31.420
let's see, I've already used a, b, and c,

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.196
let's call that d.

00:13:33.196 --> 00:13:35.625
So if we can show that the ratio

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:39.552
of d to l is 2/3, that this
is 2/3 of the distance,

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:40.749
then we're done.

00:13:40.749 --> 00:13:43.077
We can do that by similar triangles.

00:13:43.077 --> 00:13:44.430
We have two similar triangles.

00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:47.036
Let me use a new color.

00:13:47.036 --> 00:13:50.055
We have this triangle,
which is kind of embedded

00:13:50.055 --> 00:13:52.310
inside of this larger
triangle right over here.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.549
They both share the same
vertex, this angle over here,

00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:58.255
they both have right angles over here,

00:13:58.255 --> 00:13:59.870
and since they have
two of the same angles,

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.358
their third angle has to be the same,

00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:03.877
so they're definitely similar triangles.

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:05.794
So we can just set up a ratio here.

00:14:05.794 --> 00:14:09.135
2/3 c, which is this
length right over here,

00:14:10.104 --> 00:14:12.809
that's just kind of the vertical side

00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:14.620
of these smaller triangles,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.670
we could write 2/3 c
over this entire length,

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.522
over the length of the larger,

00:14:20.522 --> 00:14:24.118
this corresponding side of
the larger similar triangle,

00:14:24.118 --> 00:14:26.434
over c is equal to

00:14:28.087 --> 00:14:30.811
the hypotenuse of the
smaller similar triangle,

00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:36.579
d over the hypotenuse of
the longer similar triangle,

00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:37.903
or the bigger similar triangle.

00:14:37.903 --> 00:14:39.203
D over l.

00:14:39.203 --> 00:14:40.704
This is clearly just dividing

00:14:40.704 --> 00:14:42.560
the numerator and denominator by c,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.383
this clearly becomes 2/3,

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:48.156
so the ratio of this length

00:14:48.156 --> 00:14:50.979
to this larger length is 2/3,

00:14:50.979 --> 00:14:55.498
or this is 2/3 along the median

00:14:55.498 --> 00:14:56.897
away from the vertex.

00:14:56.897 --> 00:14:57.629
So there you go,

00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:59.365
that's the two-dimensional proof

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:03.359
that the centroid is 2/3 along the way

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:04.916
of any median from the vertex,

00:15:04.916 --> 00:15:08.039
or 1/3 along the median,

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:10.188
or 1/3 the distance of the median

00:15:10.188 --> 00:15:12.487
from the opposite midpoint.

00:15:12.487 --> 00:15:13.815
Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that.
