00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.529
American cinema has been organized by genres
really since its very beginnings.

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.261
It was a way of establishing a bond with the
audience, a certain set of expectations, certain

00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:14.559
set of familiar characters.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.790
Today we’re going to look at what makes
a genre film, and more specifically take a look

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.200
at the Western.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.390
And the questions we'll be asking are: What
exactly is a Western?

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.300
Who were the key directors and stars of this
genre?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.130
We'll be looking at filmmakers like John Ford

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.130
Sergio Leone

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.130
and Clint Eastwood.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.380
And ultimately we’re going to explore a
question that’s nagged me since the 1980s

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.710
when I first began to write—

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.020
is the Western dead?

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.300
Probably the first thing that people expect
from a Western is the Western landscape.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.260
And it is a bit of blank page

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.460
the blank empty desert

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.400
waiting to be written on, an empty stage in
a lot of ways.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.329
And onto that stage, we can project many different
kinds of stories.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.250
Genres create a way of communicating in a
kind of shorthand through clusters of meaning

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.990
that had gathered around these various stock
characters and plot devices and themes and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990
images.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.400
A way of expressing pretty substantial sets
of values and associations with minimal means.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.960
At their most profound, Westerns, deal with
the intersection of the individual and society.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.270
You have a sense of what is gained and what
is lost by belonging to a community as opposed

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.970
to living in the wilderness where, as an individual,
you're completely free.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.430
It's the arrival of civilization in the form
of those ranchers and farms and small towns

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.200
that means that the hero is going to have
to sacrifice some of that freedom.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.160
“Alive or dead. It’s your choice.”

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.580
The classical Western is fundamentally concerned with the coming of law that defines a new society.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.500
The central irony of the classical Western
is that the law has to be established through

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.970
exactly the kind of personal force, strength,
violence that the law is meant to suppress.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.469
So the hero is the perennial outsider who
has to use the methods of the outlaw to fight

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:15.469
the outlaw.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:22.620
“Tell me, isn’t the sheriff supposed to
be courageous, loyal, and above all honest?”

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.560
“Yeah, that he is.”

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.080
And he's too much of an outlaw, ultimately,
because he has killed, because he has seen

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.249
this other side of life, to ever be fully
accepted by the townspeople he's been defending.

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.320
So the hero sacrifices himself for the sake
of the law.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.100
“I think you people need a new sheriff.”

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.340
And he, in a way, wills his own extinction
in the name of civilization.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.400
"Stagecoach" is a very good guide, among other
things, to the genre in its raw state.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.520
The outlaw, played by John Wayne, uses his skills and violence to protect the people around him.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.900
He becomes the savior of this little symbolic
society inside the stagecoach.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.760
Because he is outside of the social norms,
because he is able to use violence,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.680
because he is a man who has killed and will kill again,
he's rejected by the uptight bourgeois characters,

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.760
and at the end, he can go off and found a
new world with another moral outcast

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.049
which is the saloon girl/prostitute played by Claire Trevor.

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.559
Two rejects who go off and found what seems
to be an entirely new dynasty in some magical

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:42.579
place across the border, which is, of course,
the great immigrant story to America.

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.970
“Stagecoach" won a lot of Critics Awards,
extremely popular film, pulled the Western

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.680
back up out of those Saturday morning matinees
and made it a more respectable genre.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.489
By the time John Ford makes "My Darling Clementine"
in 1946, the Western has achieved a kind of

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.549
privileged status in American film.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.299
It's seen as the most American of genres.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.150
It's seen as the genre that most closely reflects
people's experience of the recent war.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.540
It's about universal sacrifice in pursuit
of a common goal.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.170
And you see the emergence, particularly in
those films, of this alienated hero who's

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.351
experienced violence, who's been traumatized
by the exposure to violence but amazed to

00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:29.750
discover the reserves of anger that he contains
within himself.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.201
And as a result, is having trouble reintegrating
himself into society, which is exactly the

00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:40.280
position that hundreds of thousands of people
have found themselves in returning from World War II.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.320
In an immediate sense, it was very hard for
a lot of those returning war vets, who'd seen

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.190
things that they could not possibly describe,
to just walk back into a normal life and pick

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.780
up where they left off.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.760
Genre gives you a way of stepping back from
that immediate emotional trauma and stylizing

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.820
it and putting it in the past and giving it
a, you know, structure in which it can be

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.240
contained and kind of analyzed and understood,
and then, ultimately, overcome.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.620
Well, then you have Sergio Leone coming along
in the early ’60s and realizing that things

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.620
have changed.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.290
That this kind of self-sacrificing, altruistic
hero is not quite as plausible, quite as relevant.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.720
Society is not worth saving.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.790
Society is hopelessly corrupt.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.010
There's not much he can do about it.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.260
It's bigger than he is.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.990
All you can do is try to take care of your
own interests.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.680
Very different perspective.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:41.650
I would say more cynical but more in tune
with what was happening in the ’60s in terms

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.960
of social alienation, all the nonconformist
impulses, people needing to reject the dominant culture.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.860
You have hippies on the one hand and you have
“the Man with No Name” on the other

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.960
and both trying to find a place for themselves, you know, in escaping from society rather

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.980
than protecting it.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.600
"Once Upon a Time in the West," was going
to be the ultimate Western.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.740
It's the great opera Western.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.740
It's grand.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.000
It's full of big gestures.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.900
It's full of, kind of, hypertrophied sequences
that seem to go on forever and ignore any

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.540
kind of narrative drive the way it opens with
20 minutes people waiting for a train to show up.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.460
Brilliant manipulation of time and space.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.780
It came at a time when suspicion
about the genre, mainly associated with Vietnam,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.840
American cowboyism, adventurism, was politically
bringing down the genre.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.480
What's fascinating to me about that film is
that it has both the cynicism of the Spaghetti Westerns

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.280
and the lyricism of the classical
Westerns able to exist side by side most beautifully

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.700
in that final shot where you just have marvelous
panorama of the city under construction.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.870
And walking through it, deep in the background,
is the horse carrying the dead body of the

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.930
protagonist almost imperceptible.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.680
Beautiful, beautiful image and just full of
such, you know, rich ambiguity.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.260
You can measure the distance between the classical
Western and the Italian Western

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.380
“Spaghetti Western” of the ’60s, just by looking
at the way John Ford treats Henry Fonda

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.280
and the way Sergio Leone treats Henry Fonda.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.840
Same actor, same technique, and yet, radically
different characters.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:29.060
Leone cast Henry Fonda in that part as a direct
connection to John Ford's films.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.780
And, of course, he cast him as the villain.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.800
So it's an inversion of what he was playing
in the Ford movies.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.980
There's a great story that Fonda tells in
his autobiography.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.500
He shows up on the set and he's got himself
some brown contact lenses.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.200
He says "We'll mute down these famous blue
eyes," which he thought were just too heroic

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.200
for this part.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.440
And Leone says, "No, no.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.130
I hired you because of your blue eyes.”

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.990
You know, take out those contact lenses.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.600
He wanted that, you know, full force of Fonda-ness.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.530
And he also finds something in Fonda that
is a bit cold, you know, a bit angry and remote.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.900
This has been part of his personality from
the beginning and that kind of folksy

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.900
“ah shucks” stuff, it's over a certain arrogance.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.400
And I think Leone really finds that.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.980
It seemed like
the kind of film that would just infuse energy

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.160
into this dying form and yet it was almost
too much.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.500
There was no way to follow that.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.470
In a way, it was the end of the conversation.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.910
The world was just too big and too evil for
us ever to do anything about, which I think

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:38.180
became more and more the sense of the American
public as the ’70s wore on and is certainly

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.860
the case today.

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:46.540
When the American cinema was turning toward
fantasy and science fiction in the 1970s,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:52.329
filmmakers like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg
drew on that classical Western imagery, plot

00:08:52.329 --> 00:08:57.800
patterns, characters, when they created films
like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and particularly

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.519
"Star Wars," which is constantly quoting from
"The Searchers." Entire shots are modeled from

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:05.050
moments in "The Searchers."

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.930
And yet, those Western themes are not easily
just transplantable.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.850
There was a film called "Outland" in the,
early ’80s that was a remake of "High Noon"

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.660
set at a space station and it was just nonsense.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.760
It really felt arbitrary, didn't work.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:27.009
As much as filmmakers have tried to refashion
science fiction or the superhero movie into

00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:32.329
the heroic mythos of the Western, it has never
really taken.

00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:36.410
I don't think it's possible to make a classic
Western today.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:42.579
We're just not organically related to the
genre in the way American culture was.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:48.420
At some point in the ’70s, movies stopped
being about life and started being about other movies.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.040
And Western certainly figured in there.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:57.069
And you would see more, kind of, artistic, decorative dilettantish kind of Westerns

00:09:57.069 --> 00:10:03.980
like "Heaven's Gate" with lots of baroque
stylistic flourishes, some new wave affectations

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.600
and less well-defined characters.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:14.170
You had Clint Eastwood, who had come out of
the Italian Westerns, making contemporary

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:21.149
Westerns like "Bronco Billy" that attempted
to bridge the gap between the values of the

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:25.160
classic Western and contemporary society and
often to, you know, comic end because the

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.730
old-fashioned hero was seen as being, you
know, out of place, out of time.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.019
And then just a lot of just flat out parody
Westerns because like any genre is open to

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:40.850
parody because that language is so familiar. Of which
Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles" is the great example.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.380
And those films were contemporary with the
final embers of the classical genre.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.560
“What’s your name?”

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.540
“Well, my name is Jim.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.480
But most people call me…”

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.600
“Jim.”

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.740
There's never been a star after Eastwood who
has embodied the genre that way.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:07.129
I suppose, Jeff Bridges, who is constantly
being cast in, well, literally old John Wayne

00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:12.480
parts as in the case of the Coen brothers
remake of "True Grit" or the more recent "Hell or High Water."

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:19.460
Certainly Tarantino's films embody that. Some of
the later Clint Eastwood films like "Unforgiven."

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.550
He's not working from inside the genre so
much as using the genre to make a point about

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.680
changing notions of heroism.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.440
It's almost like he's borrowing something
that he was once part of and he isn't really anymore.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.100
It's self-conscious.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.480
I could see him kind of reaching for an Oscar
in that one.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.260
He wanted approval for criticizing the genre.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.749
A fascinating hybrid Western, a film I really
like called "Bone Tomahawk," which combines

00:11:43.749 --> 00:11:49.269
a very respectfully treated classical Western
framework with a horror movie with a really

00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:50.690
startling effect.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.850
We've had "Westworld."

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.309
We've had "Deadwood."

00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:57.309
I think in both of those cases, they depart
so much from the classical Western.

00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:58.829
"Westworld" was, of course, science fiction.

00:11:58.829 --> 00:12:02.240
“Deadwood" was what people used to call
it a revisionist Western.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.059
This was an invented world that had very little
historical basis.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.860
And when you say you're going to provide the
historical corrector to that, you know, to

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.540
me, it's just, you know, that's something
else.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.820
For better or for worse, the audience has
just departed from that little cluster of

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:22.269
moral and social values.

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:27.660
This is now a beautiful self-contained thing
that we can approach with some historical distance.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.940
We can identify what's rich and wonderful
about it.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.689
We can identify what's reactionary and unfortunate
about it as well.

00:12:34.689 --> 00:12:38.429
But it's just not something that's going to
grow and change substantially from now on.

00:12:38.429 --> 00:12:40.490
It's like, you know, looking at frescoes or
something.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.269
It's a beautiful thing that is now pretty
much over.

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:49.110
I grew up in the ’50s and early ’60s when
Westerns were everywhere.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.529
It becomes a very personal thing.

00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:54.839
And, of course, I'm attached to the things
that I loved when I was a child.

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:57.970
You're always gonna have special feelings
for the things that first made you fall in

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:58.970
love with movies.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.320
Those were the Westerns for me.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.780
So those are some of my thoughts on genre
filmmaking and specifically on the western.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.139
And I'd love to know what your thoughts are.

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:15.220
Do you think the Western is dead?

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.459
Do you think there's any chance of bringing
it back?

00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:19.459
Did it mean anything particular to you?

00:13:19.459 --> 00:13:21.100
Does it mean anything today?

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:26.490
