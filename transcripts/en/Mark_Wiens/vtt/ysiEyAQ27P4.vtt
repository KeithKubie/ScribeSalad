00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:02.947
(crunching)

00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:04.585
(sizzling)

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:05.418
(laughing)

00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:06.598
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:06.598 --> 00:00:07.431
- [Mark] Oh, look at that.

00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:11.448
There must be 30 different
ingredients in this mole recipe.

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:15.750
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.460
- I can tell you certainly,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.740
there's nothing like this in the world.

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:22.760
(exciting music)

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.380
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.710
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Oaxaca, Mexico.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.740
Okay hold on, we've gotta back up.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.640
I need to tell you the full story.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.800
So at this point in the morning
when I started this video,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.270
I desperately wanted to eat some homemade

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.880
Oaxacan mole negro.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.078
The only problem was I had no clue yet

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:42.100
how it was going to happen.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.510
Our full plan for the day was to,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.970
number one, hire a van
and driver for the day,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.120
which we had already
arranged the night before.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.960
So we can cross that one off the list.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.050
Number two, drive to a
local Oaxacan village.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.210
Number three, go directly
to the fresh market.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.080
And number four, walk around
and find a grandmother

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.960
or aunty to cook us some mole.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.660
From scratch.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.550
Yes, we were going to wing it,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.200
and I knew very well the risk of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.500
failing the Oaxacan mole
negro mission was very likely,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.890
but sometimes when you
travel without a plan,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.545
you end up having the most memorable

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:19.080
experiences of your life.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.870
So we're now in the van,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.620
and we are on our way to a place called

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.980
Teotitlan del Valle,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.120
and that's when things
took a turn for the best.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.703
(bright music)

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.030
We're quickly stopping to get some gas,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.660
but I just gotta fill you
in on what's happening.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.410
When we started off today, we had not,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.910
we didn't really have a plan of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.810
what we were gonna do.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.250
We just wanted to go
to Teotitlan del Valle.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.320
And we wanted to find, especially mole,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.660
because they're known for mole
around that region of Oaxaca.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.910
But we were talking to the
driver, our van driver,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.970
who's a awesome guy, and
he mentioned that he's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.240
actually from a village
which is very close

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.520
to Teotitlan del Valle.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.150
And he called his mom.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.290
He asked if she could make mole for us,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.930
and she agreed.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.880
So we're on our way.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.220
Well, we're stopping for gas right now,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.620
but we're on our way
to go pick up his mom,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.730
then we're gonna go to the market.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.130
We're gonna buy all the
ingredients for mole,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.300
and she's gonna home cook us mole.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.391
This is gonna turn into a
Oaxacan food mole adventure.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.974
(upbeat music)

00:02:54.264 --> 00:02:58.181
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.020
- This could not be a
more perfect location.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.190
The house is beautiful,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.870
the countryside here is gorgeous.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.090
The family is so generous and so inviting.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.992
We're on our way to the market now.

00:03:21.992 --> 00:03:25.909
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.193
- The actual town that we're in

00:03:31.193 --> 00:03:33.280
is called Tlacolula de Matamoros.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.460
And this is a Zapoteca town,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.580
so that's the culture, the ethnicity.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.660
Okay, and we have just
arrived to the market now.

00:03:42.978 --> 00:03:46.895
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:52.944 --> 00:03:55.694
(exciting music)

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.040
- [Mark] We're stopping
first to buy the chilies.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.540
Oh man, so many different
types of chilies.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.686
That's a big bag of chilies right there.

00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:12.603
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.450
- Vegetable section now.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.470
We're buying some tomatoes, some onions,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.150
some peppers, some green tomatoes.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.450
And they even put bread
inside Oaxacan mole.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:43.350
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:52.854
(people chattering)

00:04:52.854 --> 00:04:54.525
- Chicken.

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:56.661
(squawking)

00:04:56.661 --> 00:05:00.578
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.299
- We're getting a full chicken
to go with that mole sauce.

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:12.216
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.088
- [Mark] It's her recipe, oh.

00:05:25.088 --> 00:05:26.608
Is she a relative?

00:05:26.608 --> 00:05:30.525
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.490
- While we were at the chicken stall,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.900
we met the grandmother whose
recipe we'll be making.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.400
It's her mole recipe.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.230
And she definitely knows what she's doing

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.180
when it comes to mole.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.760
Things just even got better.

00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:51.838
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:32.073 --> 00:06:32.906
- Okay, this is called tejate,

00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:33.990
and it's a traditional drink.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.460
She uses, there's corn in here,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.500
and there is chocolate,
I'm not sure what all else.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.840
But as we were entering the
market, she was making it,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.410
and she was whipping it up with her hands.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.700
It was like a thick paste.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.910
But now she added more water,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.760
so it's turned into a liquid beverage.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.990
But there's still some chunkiness on top.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.823
This is very interesting.

00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:52.900
I can't wait to try it.

00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:01.740
Oh, and I asked her for it with no sugar.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.120
She said you could have sugar or no sugar,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.090
or however much sugar you want.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.090
It's really good with no sugar.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.070
You can taste the corn in there.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.610
You can taste the chocolate.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.130
It's a little bit starchy.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.130
It tastes like kind of a cross between

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.150
a beverage and a porridge.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.018
It's great.

00:07:21.018 --> 00:07:23.944
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.694
(mariachi music)

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.830
- Okay, we made it back to the house.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.180
It's time to start cooking.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.230
I wanted to just explain
that this entire area

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:01.190
and this city is known for
it's Zapotec population,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.560
which is the indigenous people
of this region of Oaxaca.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.281
Tamales Oaxacenos.

00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:11.198
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.200
- She's getting started making the mole

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.110
by just first starting
off with the chilies.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.330
Those are pretty large chilies.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.020
She's emptying out the seeds,
scraping out the seeds.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.960
And in the meantime, we have gotten lucky,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.030
and she made, without knowing,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.903
she made some tamales, some
local Oaxacano tamales.

00:08:34.903 --> 00:08:37.040
Steamed in corn husk.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.140
Let me empty this out.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.790
Let me just break up this tamal.

00:08:41.626 --> 00:08:45.543
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.640
- I am not totally sure what that is.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.020
You know what it is?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.260
There's a tub of salsa that our driver,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.810
oh by the way, his name is Javier.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.170
He said this is his favorite
salsa that his mom makes.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.130
And he said it's picante, it's spicy.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.500
I'm gonna add on some of this salsa.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.450
He said it's spicy.

00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:14.210
Looks amazing.

00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:23.440
Oh, that's amazing.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.110
It's corn, but it's
not like finely ground.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.090
It's kind of coarse.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.010
You can taste that unique
vegetable in there.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.450
It's more like an herb I think.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.600
Maybe like a wild herb.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.390
It's delicious with that salsa.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.090
Oh, it's incredible.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.910
Salsa's a little bit spicy,

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.650
but just perfect with that tamale.

00:09:42.822 --> 00:09:44.072
It's delicious.

00:09:46.901 --> 00:09:50.818
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:53.188 --> 00:09:55.938
(mariachi music)

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.370
- That first step of chili is all ready.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.634
We're moving into the kitchen now.

00:10:02.634 --> 00:10:04.103
They're gonna light the fire,

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.620
and we're gonna get
started cooking this mole.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.510
And they're making it purely from scratch.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.030
All the raw ingredients,
or the dry chilies,

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.460
the dry ingredients.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.658
Yeah, but everything is from scratch.

00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:18.540
It's such a privilege to
have this opportunity.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.547
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.680
- [Mark] So she's
roasting the chilies now,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.160
or just heating them over the comal,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.030
which is the clay pan over fire.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.390
And they're not spicy,

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.010
but to me, they almost have like a sweet,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.740
almost tomato-y aroma to them.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.137
(speaking in foreign langauge)

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.210
- So she's roasting the chilies until,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.920
for a few minutes until they shrivel up,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.180
then they look kinda like a
shriveled piece of leather.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.090
But the aroma coming out,
they're slightly charred.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.880
I'm already starting to
sense that complex city of

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.730
aromas and flavors that
will be part of this mole.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:18.383
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:50.727 --> 00:11:51.660
- It's a plantain banana.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.152
She said that it's a little bit sweet,

00:11:54.152 --> 00:11:57.270
and I am still unsure how all of this

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.192
is gonna fit together.

00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:03.109
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:17.610
- [Mark] So for the almonds,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.460
she put in some oil into the clay pot

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.970
and then she's just frying the almonds.

00:12:25.508 --> 00:12:29.425
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:40.652 --> 00:12:41.700
- She just pulled the
almonds out of the oil,

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.050
and now she dropped in the walnuts.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.840
Take one.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.030
I never would've guessed
the next ingredient

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.160
in this mole recipe.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.220
They're kind of like cookie biscuits.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.470
And again, she's just
tossing them into the oil,

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.290
deep frying them just for
about 10 seconds or so.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.089
That's an ingredient I wasn't expecting.

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:14.006
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.410
- There's also bread in the mole.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.770
And it's a special type of bread.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.839
There's some chocolate in the bread,

00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:24.337
and something else.

00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:25.450
Is that gonna be fried, too?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.640
Oh yes, yes it is.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.710
As the bread and as the ingredients are

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.740
being fried and prepared,

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.040
something to know about
mole is that it's a very,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.320
very well known dish.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.860
It's one of the ultimate dishes of Oaxaca,

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.220
as well as in Puebla.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.680
And there are mixed theories
of how it was invented,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.730
or how it came about.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.080
But one thing is for sure is that

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.080
it is a combination of both the local

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.314
indigenous ingredients
and cooking techniques

00:14:02.314 --> 00:14:07.314
combined with the European
colonial influence

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.588
to create this truly unique
blend of flavors and tastes.

00:14:12.588 --> 00:14:16.245
It's an incredibly complex dish,

00:14:16.245 --> 00:14:18.170
using so many ingredients.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.580
I mean, if you were trying to even

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.398
come up with a dish like this,

00:14:21.398 --> 00:14:22.250
it would be impossible
because there are so many

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.420
random ingredients in it,

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.868
and it's such a complex dish.

00:14:25.868 --> 00:14:29.785
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.070
- [Mark] This is some type of pepper

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.950
that I've never seen before.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.000
The next spice is cloves going in.

00:14:42.066 --> 00:14:44.810
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.338
- Cinnamon.

00:14:46.338 --> 00:14:47.580
This is when things are
getting more and more complex.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.527
And they're adding the spices now.

00:14:49.527 --> 00:14:51.510
So now she's frying some cinnamon sticks,

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.170
and then we also counted out
some kind of peppercorns,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.340
and then cloves.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.690
There's gonna be some
sesames seeds that go in.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.500
Cloves and pepper go in the oil.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.160
The aroma of that is insane.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.690
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.730
- Oh, raisins, okay.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.010
Oh, that smells really good,

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.640
being stir fried in that oil.

00:15:21.091 --> 00:15:25.008
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.040
- As the ingredients are still being

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.720
prepared for the mole sauce,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.210
they're now preparing the chicken.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.080
The chicken has all
been cleaned and cut up.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.270
And I think she's just boiling
it straight up in water.

00:15:40.327 --> 00:15:44.244
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.590
- Mole is such a complex dish,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.280
and there's so many ingredients involved,

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.359
and each ingredient you
have to prepare separately,

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.780
and it's very time intensive,

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.320
and it's such a, it takes
a lot of work to prepare,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.710
so it's such a, it's so
cool to be able to watch

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.330
the whole process and
just anticipate the mole

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.600
that we're gonna be able to eat very soon.

00:16:14.859 --> 00:16:17.749
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:20.604
(sizzling)

00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:21.880
- [Mark] Plums, I think.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.160
Some type of plum, dried plum,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.410
and then deep fried also.

00:16:26.969 --> 00:16:29.719
(mariachi music)

00:16:31.374 --> 00:16:33.791
(chattering)

00:16:38.974 --> 00:16:42.891
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.320
- It's oregano and some
kind of other herb.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.220
So basically, the chilies
get blackened roasted,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.690
but everything else is fried in oil.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.570
Chicken is coming along
nicely, nice and slow.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.960
So she just tossed in
some onions and garlic

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.335
right into the fire to roast.

00:17:18.335 --> 00:17:22.252
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.230
- These white sesame seeds.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.017
That also goes into the oil to fry.

00:17:27.017 --> 00:17:32.017
Man, she has fried like at
least 15 ingredients so far.

00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:37.346
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.090
- Separately in the chicken pot,

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.300
after just boiling the chicken in water,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.680
then she added in some
onions and some garlic,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.670
and also a type of leaf called oja santa,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.620
and that's gonna create a chicken broth

00:18:04.857 --> 00:18:06.565
that they're also gonna use for the mole.

00:18:06.565 --> 00:18:07.440
These are all of the ingredients so far.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.000
Look, it's an entire
bucket of ingredients.

00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:18.209
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.230
- The onions and garlic
finished roasting in the fire,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.880
and then they're just peeling off that

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.900
outer blackened layer
and revealing just that

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.290
juicy flesh underneath.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.170
And then for the tomatoes,

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.400
there's two kinds of tomatoes.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.190
The green tomatoes and the red tomatoes.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.610
And she's again just frying it in

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.300
the clay pot for a little while.

00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:47.742
(mariachi music)

00:18:55.959 --> 00:18:58.959
(people chattering)

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:02.542
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:03.960
- That took about two hours
to prepare everything.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.680
It's now time to start
grinding everything together

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.840
to make he sauce.

00:19:09.093 --> 00:19:11.343
(grinding)

00:19:15.979 --> 00:19:18.979
(people chattering)

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.240
I love the sound of that rock on rock,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.430
but then with the squishing sound of

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.500
those chilies in between the rocks.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.150
And she's such an expert.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.400
You can even smell, you
can really fragrantly

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.465
smell the aroma of those
chilies in there, too.

00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:46.480
(grinding)

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.410
A stone grinder like
this is called a metate,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.810
but it's very, very time intensive.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.290
It would take hours and hours to grind up

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.250
this entire bucket full of
ingredients for the mole.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.660
They're gonna take it to the market

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.125
where they have a bigger
grinder called a molina.

00:20:02.125 --> 00:20:04.580
And they're gonna grind everything on that

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.140
so it will be a lot faster.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.530
So it doesn't, it wouldn't
probably take until tomorrow

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.160
if they tried to grind
all of that by hand,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.020
and we don't have that much time.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.230
So they're gonna do that,
but in the meantime,

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.340
we're gonna go to a waterfall

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.240
which is near to this area
because then after that,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.030
the paste, it has to cook for a while.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.830
And then we're gonna come back to eat

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.620
this just sensational mole.

00:20:28.731 --> 00:20:31.314
(bright music)

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.200
The drive to get here was gorgeous.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.650
We came really high into the mountains.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.700
It's the views, the rugged
landscape is incredible,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.030
and we've arrived the place,
it's called Hierve del Agua.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.030
It's beautiful here.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.870
It feels like you're on
the edge of the Earth here.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.180
And this is where the water is bubbling,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.160
but the water is not hot.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.530
It's just kind of like fizzing.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.180
It's just room temperature water.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.250
We now hiked over to
the main swimming pools.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.990
It's quite a unique landscape.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.900
It's almost like a moonscape.

00:21:27.872 --> 00:21:31.225
(water bubbling)

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:33.808
(bright music)

00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:37.547
Those were some pretty interesting

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:39.410
and very unique moonscapes,

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.520
but I am very, very hungry now.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.365
My excitement for eating
mole is at an all time high.

00:21:46.365 --> 00:21:49.698
(upbeat mariachi music)

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.667
(speaking in foreign language)

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.570
- Over here, this is the paste.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.370
And so that was all,
wow, you can smell it.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.680
So you can see the shimmering oil on it.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.660
I'm just gonna taste the paste.

00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:48.970
Oh wow.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.240
That's like unexplainable.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.470
It's almost like foamy in texture.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.510
You can taste the spices.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.270
The hint of clove, the pepper in there.

00:22:58.243 --> 00:23:01.243
(people chattering)

00:23:03.204 --> 00:23:04.808
(sizzling)

00:23:04.808 --> 00:23:08.725
(speaking in foreign language)

00:23:22.048 --> 00:23:23.130
- Also, they already added
the chocolate in there,

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.467
so we didn't see them add that,

00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:26.300
but they added chocolate in there.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.133
It's almost time.

00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:33.697
(laughing)

00:23:33.697 --> 00:23:36.435
(speaking in foreign language)

00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:38.685
(sizzling)

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:14.780
- Sesame seeds.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.180
It took like five hours to make this mole.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.160
They made everything from scratch,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.810
starting with the chilies.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.890
There must be 30 different
ingredients in this mole recipe,

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.490
and what I love is that the family,

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.240
they just kindly invited
us into their house,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.800
and into their compound, into their home,

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.110
like we were family here.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.750
So what's interesting about mole is that

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.890
they don't cook the
chicken within the sauce,

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.330
but rather the chicken
is cooked separately,

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.920
and then the sauce is prepared separately,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.740
and then they combine the
two for the final process

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.940
right before you eat it.

00:24:51.994 --> 00:24:54.030
(people chattering)

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.640
Wow.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.870
Oh wow.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.570
I can tell you certainly,

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.270
there's nothing like this in the world.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.360
It is, it's so unique.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.210
It's so, it's such like an impossible

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.690
mixture of ingredients.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.340
You don't even know, actually,

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.020
and it's true that they don't know

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.552
exactly how mole was invented.

00:25:16.552 --> 00:25:20.290
It's a very mysterious, amazing flavor.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.180
You can taste the chocolate,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.673
you can taste the chilies,

00:25:22.673 --> 00:25:23.983
you can taste the nuts in there.

00:25:23.983 --> 00:25:24.816
It has a nutty taste.

00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:26.840
It's really rich.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.810
Wow, it's phenomenal.

00:25:29.684 --> 00:25:31.700
Oh, look at that.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.820
It's really all about the sauce.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.280
But chicken is just like a,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.480
is just the second
ingredient in this dish.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.555
I have to taste a bite of chicken

00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:42.505
before I even move on to any carb form.

00:25:43.888 --> 00:25:47.805
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:53.507
- Wow.

00:25:53.507 --> 00:25:54.340
Yeah.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.388
That's stunning.

00:25:55.388 --> 00:25:57.860
And again, the sauce, I mean.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.300
The sauce is so incredibly flavorful

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.220
that all it needs to
do is coat the chicken.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.170
It doesn't need to permeate
into the center of the chicken.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.480
I gotta get a bit more
sauce though on there.

00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:19.169
(mariachi music)

00:26:27.288 --> 00:26:28.121
That's remarkable.

00:26:31.644 --> 00:26:32.477
(people chattering)

00:26:32.477 --> 00:26:33.610
Carlos and Annette, how's the mole?

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.080
Annette?

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.040
- Delicious.

00:26:38.141 --> 00:26:39.050
- [Mark] Carlos.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.770
- Unique, special.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.900
Very different than any
mole I've tried before.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.733
Very good.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.930
- [Mark] By the way,
she refilled my sauce.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:05.152
(speaking in foreign language)

00:27:05.152 --> 00:27:06.570
- This mole sauce is just
blowing my mind right now.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.360
They've also made us
a plate of chapulines,

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.390
which are grasshoppers.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.840
And grasshoppers are very,
very common in Oaxaca.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.560
You'll find them at the market.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.840
They said they harvest these grasshoppers

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.160
sometime in November, October or November,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.060
when that's grasshopper season.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.555
But then they save them all.

00:27:22.555 --> 00:27:25.870
So they have a continual little supply of

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.520
grasshoppers throughout the year.

00:27:30.826 --> 00:27:31.920
Oh wow.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.630
Oh those are just fantastic.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.040
Oh that's an entire mouth
full of grasshoppers.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.680
And they're kinda crunchy.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.870
They have, I think they're
cooked with some salt and lime,

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.250
because the flavor is amazing.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.550
Oh those are beautiful, I love it.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.240
Oh, with that sauce.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.090
Mole, chapulines.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.670
Oh yeah, look at that.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.540
I'm gonna add on a little more

00:27:57.729 --> 00:27:59.379
mole sauce onto this grasshopper.

00:28:04.089 --> 00:28:06.680
That's actually an
outstanding combination, too.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.630
I like it with the grasshoppers.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.830
That gives it a crunch.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.770
That chicken just falls off the bone.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:11.750
Oh look at that.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.830
I'm gonna add this to my rice,

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.520
and I've got one combination
that I need to try.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.920
I mean, I love it with the tortillas,

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.170
but with rice, I mean,
I am Asian, I love rice.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.640
It's so good with rice.

00:28:23.865 --> 00:28:25.880
Oh, this sauce is just insane.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.170
Okay, they also have one of mom's

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.430
homemade salsas here,
and I've seen Javier.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.220
He is adding some of
the salsa to his mole,

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.090
so I'm gonna follow.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.210
Oh wow.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.210
There's nothing better
than adding sauce to sauce.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.810
Okay and then finally,

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.060
I gotta go in for some
of those chapulines.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.450
Sprinkle those on top.

00:28:52.498 --> 00:28:54.890
Oh wow.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.900
Let me add one more grasshopper
for the final topping.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.633
And there it is.

00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:03.800
That is possibly the
greatest single bite of mole

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.190
in the entire world.

00:29:20.015 --> 00:29:21.560
And that completes the mole.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.260
That was an absolutely stunning meal.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.410
Do I have any grasshoppers
stuck in my teeth?

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.320
I don't think so, I just
have a chocolate mustache.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.570
A mole mustache.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.615
Oh man, that was so incredibly good.

00:29:39.615 --> 00:29:42.340
I love the mole.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.510
I love this entire experience.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.920
And when we set off this morning,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.550
we had no idea what we
were gonna do, actually.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.580
We didn't have plans.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.290
All we wanted to do was eat,

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.860
wanted to find and search
out some of the best mole.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.410
And it was an incredible success.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.500
But thanks to the family here,

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.240
I wanna say a huge thank you to Javier,

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.643
who was our driver, because he graciously

00:30:02.643 --> 00:30:05.150
thought of this idea and
then he called his mom.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.050
His mom agreed, and they
graciously invited us

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.910
into their home, which is incredible.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.210
I've said it many times before,

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.709
but this is another one
of those experiences

00:30:14.709 --> 00:30:17.740
that is worth traveling across the world.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.670
There's nothing like an
experience like this,

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.130
when it comes to food and travel.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.830
And I'm extremely grateful
to have this opportunity.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.650
So again, huge thank you to the family.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.720
We are all very happy
and full of mole now.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.760
And they're gonna give us
some of that mole paste

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.940
to bring home with us.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.590
Okay, I'm gonna, before I'm a little bit

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.340
under the influence of mole right now,

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.750
so I'm gonna quit talking,

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.930

you for watching this video.
