very hard to expand instant games into

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:25.419
very hard to expand instant games into
 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.089
very hard to expand instant games into
new areas such as premium and

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:27.099
new areas such as premium and
 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:29.129
new areas such as premium and
pre-registration as some of you here

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:29.139
pre-registration as some of you here
 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:30.809
pre-registration as some of you here
will know the premium games was

00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:30.819
will know the premium games was
 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:33.180

previously just a screenshot and a video

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.190
previously just a screenshot and a video
 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.189
previously just a screenshot and a video
in your store listing page but now we're

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199
in your store listing page but now we're
 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.450
in your store listing page but now we're
very proud to say that you have the

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460
very proud to say that you have the
 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.279
very proud to say that you have the
option of adding an instant game to this

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:38.289
option of adding an instant game to this
 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:40.589
option of adding an instant game to this
and once what's super important and very

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599
and once what's super important and very
 

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.240
and once what's super important and very
exciting here is this can really

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250
exciting here is this can really
 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.830
exciting here is this can really
increase your store conversion rate that

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840
increase your store conversion rate that
 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.570
increase your store conversion rate that
you're giving the user the opportunity

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:45.580
you're giving the user the opportunity
 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.520
you're giving the user the opportunity
to try the game before they actually

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:47.530
to try the game before they actually
 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.379
to try the game before they actually
commit to purchasing that and I think

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:49.389
commit to purchasing that and I think
 

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:50.610
commit to purchasing that and I think
that that's really important as this

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.620
that that's really important as this
 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.230
that that's really important as this
lowers the crucial entry barrier to your

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240
lowers the crucial entry barrier to your
 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.390
lowers the crucial entry barrier to your
title and also gives you the developer a

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400
title and also gives you the developer a
 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.310
title and also gives you the developer a
real platform to showcase your premium

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:56.320
real platform to showcase your premium
 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.399
real platform to showcase your premium
games and we've also worked hard on top

00:07:59.399 --> 00:07:59.409
games and we've also worked hard on top
 

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:00.959
games and we've also worked hard on top
of that to bring some pre-launch

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:00.969
of that to bring some pre-launch
 

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:02.760
of that to bring some pre-launch
opportunities to instant games and

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:02.770
opportunities to instant games and
 

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.110
opportunities to instant games and
what's really exciting about this is

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120
what's really exciting about this is
 

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.339
what's really exciting about this is
that you're able to create virality

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:05.349
that you're able to create virality
 

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:07.529
that you're able to create virality
right into your game by adding it to

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:07.539
right into your game by adding it to
 

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:09.540
right into your game by adding it to
your pre-registration before you've even

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:09.550
your pre-registration before you've even
 

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.969
your pre-registration before you've even
launched your game so why not why

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:11.979
launched your game so why not why
 

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:13.320
launched your game so why not why
wouldn't you take advantage of this when

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:13.330
wouldn't you take advantage of this when
 

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.790
wouldn't you take advantage of this when
you have the opportunity to drive

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800
you have the opportunity to drive
 

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.249
you have the opportunity to drive
signups and by creating variety and

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:17.259
signups and by creating variety and
 

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:19.800
signups and by creating variety and
really you know let giving a first taste

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:19.810
really you know let giving a first taste
 

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.749

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.709
it's even in the store and I think this
is going to be really integral going

00:08:25.709 --> 00:08:25.719

didn't work out well either because the

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:35.070
didn't work out well either because the
 

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.220
didn't work out well either because the
players dismissed it as being too simple

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:37.230
players dismissed it as being too simple
 

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.360
players dismissed it as being too simple
and too basic and then the final step

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:41.370
and too basic and then the final step
 

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:46.159

tutorial we also tested to see the
 

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.770
tutorial we also tested to see the
visual appeal of the game we found out

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780
visual appeal of the game we found out
 

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.490
visual appeal of the game we found out
that the player prefer

00:19:59.490 --> 00:19:59.500

with knives walking on the beach
so getting the visual appeal of it was

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:06.220
so getting the visual appeal of it was
 

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.500
so getting the visual appeal of it was
just as important as getting the

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:07.510
just as important as getting the
 

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.890
just as important as getting the

with the difficulty rate or the win rate

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:17.260
with the difficulty rate or the win rate
 

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.350

to collect data using that data then you
 

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.310
to collect data using that data then you
can kind of find the right length

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320
