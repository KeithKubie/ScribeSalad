00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.939
Hey guys welcome back, thank you for joining us today on the king of random

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.329
We recently had a video where we showed you how to build a full-sized

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.308
Crossbow out of a piece of 2x4 some PVC and some paracord well today

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.359
We want to take that project and scale it back just a little bit or quite a bit

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.940
We want to make a similar arrow launching weapon

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.969
But something that can be done quickly easily and with very low cost

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.539
Materials all we're gonna need today is some ballpoint pens some bamboo skewers some rubber bands and some tape the Pens

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.619
I'm using I bought at Walmart

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.470
and it was about

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.669
$1 for a pack of 15 of them in this case the cheaper pens actually work in our benefit because they're usually easier to

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.979
disassemble as a first step. That's exactly we're gonna

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.809
Do, is we're gonna take this pen apart

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.149
Remove the cap and using a pair of pliers pull off the front and back of the pen with the Pens

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.349
I'm using the front actually can disassemble even farther into more pieces

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.980
The cap the inner tube of ink and the end piece we're not gonna need so you can throw those away

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.640
We want to reattach this other end piece back where it was into the pen to make sure it's permanent

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.909
Let's also add just a tiny drop of super glue around the base now

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.239
We need to grab a rubber band if you can find one that's a little bit thicker it will work better

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240
Although a normal rubber band will which is fine

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.819
We're going to want to attach our rubber band with a little bit of tension on it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.799
So I have it currently looped around the bottom

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.529
and then I just want to stretch it out a little bit and

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.709
Mark off where I'm going to want to attach the rubber band now

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.099
Let's tear off a piece of pretty strong tape this tape is a little bit wider than I need so after tearing it off

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100
I'm also going to tear it in half

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.770
This width is plenty

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.970
We want our rubber band to line up with the pen as we attach it to help with that if we cross the two sides

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.140
Over and wrap it around

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.890
It will help the rubber band

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.500
Lie flat against the pen as we tape it just wrap the tape pulling it very tight down against both the rubber band

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.720
And the body of the pen

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.129
Now this is going to have to hold even while the rubber band is stretched out quite a bit

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.850
And that's why I specify that you should make sure you're using some good strong tape

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.560
If you just try this with scotch tape or masking tape there's a good chance it will just tear

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.630
Or not have the strength to hold on

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.229
Now we can do a quick test if we hold on to the tape or even the pen above it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.779
We can stretch our rubber band out very far, and it let go at all this would already work

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.919
But to make it a little bit easier to hold on to I'm going to start adding more tape at the top

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.370
So I have somewhere to put my finger and thumb as I secure the pen

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.910
By using more tape at the top

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.109
I've made it wider and so it'll be easier to hold on to as I'm applying pressure by pulling back on the rubber band now

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.779
Just because we like things black and yellow. I'm gonna draw with my marker all over the blue part and turn it black

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.680
At this point we can load the bamboo skewer in from the front push it down onto the rubber band a little bit

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.230
Drop act and fire I'm going to try and give it like the very minimum amount of power and see how it goes

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.020
Flies to the air

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.630
Beautiful that works pretty well, but these bamboo skewers aren't weighted at all, which means that they're flying to the air

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.920
They have a tendency to start turning

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.430
So I'm just going to use a little bit of tape to add some weight to the tip of it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.559
Hopefully that will keep it pointed straight like a dart

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.739
We've got our launcher we've got our dart

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.679
Let's take this outside and see how far it goes

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.269
All right, let's check out the range on our little sling launcher here

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.439
I think I managed to hit the wall. That's a good distance

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.620
one two

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.429
So my shoes are almost exactly one foot long which is convenient for measuring stuff so that arrow just flew over

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.920
75 feet not bad

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.639
Let's try sending it back the other direction

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.919
Beautiful right back across the yard

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.399
Now I've got here a dartboard, this is actually designed for darts with metal tips

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.939
We're gonna see if our bamboo is hard enough to stab into this thing

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.849
Boom

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.448
Stab right in beautiful so close to the bullseye look at that right next to it

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.599
Yeah

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.479
Works really well all right that is working great, so I'm gonna make a few more arrows

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.099
But I don't want to just carry them around so what I'm gonna try and do is make a sort of armband

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.090
Bandolier to hold my supply of arrows so I can shoot one and then shoot several more without having to go pick up my first

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.979
one to make this bamboo bandolier

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:51.549
I have a strap of leather a snap setting kit a small assortment of LEGO pieces and some contact cement the first step is going

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.020
To be measuring this piece of leather to know where it will sit on my arm and where to cut it so that it will

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.400
Easily snap together. I want this to rest high up on my arm. It's not going to be a wrist cuff

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.019
I'm gonna wrap it around here and just mark on the leather where to cut a

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.259
Little bit snug as well alright. I know that I want my leather strap to line up with this point

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.209
So I'm just gonna add about an inch and a half after that and that's where I'll cut my strap off

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:23.829
Now that I have my leather strap cut to the right length. I need to drill holes for our snap hardware to run through

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.810
With the first hole drilled I'll now mark through that hole where I need to drill the hole on the other side

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.090
The kit comes with this nice little dome shaped piece of it as I attach the snap

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.509
I don't ruin the dome shape of the hardware

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.508
We'll take this half of the hardware and slide it over the post

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.479
with this tool when we press it down into the post it will cause it to curl outward and

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.729
Secure the snap down to the leather

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.340
Go now that's attached

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:17.079
It's not gonna come off there forever now. We need to attach the other side of the hardware into the other hole in this draft

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.609
All right we have both sides of our snap Hardware attached

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.669
And it goes together great perfect see how that feels on my arm

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.990
Yeah there we go nice and snug

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:41.469
Holds itself in place pretty well

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.129
Now we just need a method to attach our ammunition to that

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:49.299
Here's the plan of how we're going to attach our arrows to our little bandolier

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.419
We have these Lego plates and several of these little

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.369
1x1 hook shaped pieces well attach two of these hook shaped pieces onto the plate

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.819
On the bamboo skewer package it says that these skewers are point one two inches in diameter or three millimeters wide

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.229
That happens to be just about the perfect size to fit into Lego hooks

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.989
You can also see that it will still slide up and down a little bit and so to get around that I'm going to offset

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:21.009
The angle of the hooks just a tiny bit, so they hold pressure on the sticks, so they won't go anywhere now

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.799
I've got three of these little plates and twelve of these little hooks

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.400
So I'm going to line them up so that it can hold six arrows at once

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.150
To ensure that when I pull the arrow off it doesn't take the little hook pieces with them

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.379
I'm going to use a little drop of glue on each little hook to hold it onto the plate

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.990
There we have it six little holster slots for our bamboo arrows

00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:07.109
Now what I need to do is attach each of these Lego plates to the leather armband for that

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.110
I'm going to be using our contact cement

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.419
Never use contact cement somewhere where you don't have good ventilation

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.709
Because it has a lot of really strong chemicals in it says on here could cause respiratory tract eye and skin irritation

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:26.099
Harmful or fatal if swallowed don't eat. Glue kids just make sure you've got lots of good ventilation now

00:08:26.099 --> 00:08:31.229
How contact cement works is you apply a very thin layer to both sides of what you're trying to adhere together

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:32.200
And then you let it dry

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.779
Almost completely it'll get to the point where it doesn't even really feel sticky if you were to touch it

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:42.479
But it sticks to itself very well at that point so you paint it on let it dry most of the way

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:47.009
And then you press the two sides together and they form a bond that doesn't come apart for anything

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.640
I'm just gonna use this pen to mark where I want to apply the glue on the leather

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:59.099
Also just to make sure that the glue has enough to grip onto and you're gonna rough it up with some sandpaper leather has a

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.800
Bit of a finish on it and the sandpaper just goes right through it

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:11.579
Letting it around remember you want a very thin layer if you're using contact cement more does not make a stronger bond

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:18.089
And then I'm just going to paint the bottom of the lego pieces as well while that glue dries a little bit

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:20.089
Let's make a few more arrows

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:29.039
Alright, I think our contact cement is it's just the right level of dry. It's just the tiniest bit sticky if I touch it

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.740
Let's throw our Lego pieces on

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.320
See how well they feel secured.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.110
That's pretty good right there

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.349
There we go a little bandolier armband

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:52.290
And I have my launcher and I have all of my ammunition close at hand let's try a couple more shots at our target now

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.540
Apparently, I'm not a very good shot yet, oh

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:07.169
Well that close that close to a bull's-eye it is like two millimeters off of the red circle -

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:26.009
There you have it an incredibly simple barbecue skewer arrow launcher that you can build out of a pen and a rubber band

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:30.448
It works really well it got great distance on it, and you can see it stabs right into this target

00:10:30.449 --> 00:10:35.878
That's designed to be used with metal tips be very careful of these you don't want to shoot these at people or animals or anything

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:39.509
That's particularly fragile because they have a fair bit of power and could do some serious damage

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.789
All in all this little arrow launcher cost probably about three dollars to make and for just a little bit more you can make yourself

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.589
This cool armband bandolier that holds all of your ammunition right where you need it to use?

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.749
Thinking it also might be possible if you built sort of a strap for that launcher itself

00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:58.169
You might be able to have that on your wrist, then you could have sort of a wrist

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.139
Crossbow setup that can be pretty fun as well

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.649
Maybe we'll try that in the future if you want to have some fun shooting some arrows

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:09.089
But you don't have the time or resources to build yourself one of the full-size crossbows. This is a great alternative

00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:13.049
Thank you guys for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you that

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:16.079
At this point we can load it

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.980
Waiting for some scraping noises upstairs to stop

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.309
No, it's sticking to not just the glove

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.100
The dried glue on the club

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.730
Apparently the two blues are very compatible

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.790
What's up, guys grant here? I'm just working behind the scenes on some important stuff keep supporting Nate

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.699
He's the man and he's bringing back all the DIY that you've been asking for
