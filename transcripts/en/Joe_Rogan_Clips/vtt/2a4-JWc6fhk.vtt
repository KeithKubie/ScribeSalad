00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.700
And parents,
man,
they've got to stop putting their kids on video.

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:04.920
We've got to stop.
It's enough you say that,

3
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.120
but there's a little kid that's like six years old at reviews toys and he makes

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.360
$20 million a year.
$20 million a year.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.240
Just looking at toys.
[inaudible] bucks.
I'll open up a box of you know toys.

6
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:22.050
I'll do it.
100 beans.
That's it.
Nobody wants to see you open up.

7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.050
[inaudible] not a baby.
I'm going to find something else.

8
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:28.330
You want to see little cute kids in a diaper?
What?

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.020
How's this all going to help?
Ah,
fuck.
I'm gonna find another,

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.880
I got to find another thing to make money.
I find another angle.

11
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:39.360
that kid.
He's making a lot of money on.
Be the youtube toy guy.

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.240
There's a lady who does it with just her hands.
A grown woman.

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.930
What did she do with her hands?
She opens things up.
Same thing for hands.

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.130
I don't know if they're beautiful.

15
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:50.470
I don't know if their feet out and start using it for her feet to do.

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.360
I'm going to open children's toys and my feet.
Is that weird?
No,
you should do.

17
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.180
You should do it and see which one gets better views.

18
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.960
Do it with you with painted toenails and doing deal with kind of like neglected

19
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.150
toenail toenail.
You know what I'm saying?

20
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.830
Like little chips in your paint.

21
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.950
You know this is on Saturday than a neglected toenail.

22
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.370
It's also kind of hot because it's Kinda check.

23
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.170
They'll take some chances like shit.
She's like,

24
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.680
bitch doesn't even have her toenails in order.
She'll,
she lives,

25
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.590
she'll move with you across the country.
She's crawling parking lots.

26
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:26.361
What's she doing?

27
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:29.730
Enter into a bank robbing scheme with you taking care of herself.

28
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140
She's got chip toenails first.
That's a bitch who puts people first.

29
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.510
She toenail check.
Just can't get it together.

30
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.400
Some people just never quite get it together,
right?
Yeah.

31
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.490
And then you see their toes and it's a reflection of their own downfalls.

32
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.110
They're their own worst enemy,
or they have a job or too busy,

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.860
too busy mom with a job in a couple of kids who's got time to do nails then

34
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:56.450
unless you,
you know,
you're a rich white yourself,
you can do them yourself.
