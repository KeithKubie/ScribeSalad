GUILLAUME MARTIN:
Hello everyone,

00:00:01.455 --> 00:00:03.970
and welcome to this
first live stream

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.120
from the NUMA studio in Paris.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.700
I have with me
here Gary Cige who

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.520
is the entrepreneur in residence
at NUMA, and especially

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.440
at Le Camping, which
is the accelerator.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.710
And Gary will shortly be
introducing our startups here.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.290
Before that, I would like to
show you what NUMA looks like.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.050
Could we please
switch to the image.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.820
And so NUMA is a space
with multiple stories

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.810
for multiple activities
dealing with entrepreneurships

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.500
and startups.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
And in the first floor at the
end of the co-working space,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.760
we now have this studio.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.780
This is what the plans
were looking like,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.680
and this is what the
reality looked like.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.010
Lots of cabling, lots of
boxes, lights, cameras,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.120
lots of putting it all together.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.030
This is the working equipment,
and the first recording,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.810
and a studio that is now
ready for you and all

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.660
of the residents at NUMA to use.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.020
Whoever wants to
broadcast their passion,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.410
their competency, or
simply information

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.150
about their products,
can now use this studio

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.840
to broadcast to the world.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.900
So Gary, can you
introduce our guests here?

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.434
GARY CIGE: I'd be happy to.

00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:35.475
The first start up we're
going to be interviewing

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:39.538
is called REALITICS, which
is one of the 12 startups

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:48.330
that joined Le Camping
a couple of months ago.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.590
It is a great adventure.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.810
They will explain a bit what
happened during those last four

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.310
months.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.720
Where did they come from?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.390
So basically, REALITICS
is something very simple.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.100
It is an analytics
platform dedicated

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.750
to TV advertisements and
TV advertising in general.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.820
My first question
is quite simple.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.400
It's what happened during
those last three months?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.140
How did you arrive with
what kind of product.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.194
And what has been evolving
for the last couple of months?

00:02:27.194 --> 00:02:29.110
SEBASTIEN MONTEIL: This
is Sebastien speaking,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.294
the founder of REALITICS.

00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:37.940
Actually we came in at Le
Camping with a piece of paper

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.070
and an idea coming from a
previous experience in Kobojo,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.890
a social gaming company where
we handled millions of users.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.890
And we had a big issue to
understand them and analyze--

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.370
be a viewer in the game.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.480
So we had an idea to create
a real time platform that

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.160
allowed us to understand
all the people.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.170
And this is the way we
came into Le Camping.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.142
But Guillaume will explain
what came after that.

00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:16.100
GUILLAUME BELMAS: Yeah.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.070
So I'm Guillaume,
the other co-founder.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.530
Actually we are four.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.860
And so when we first arrived at
Le Camping, what was very hard

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.090
was to actually pitch our
idea in a very short way,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.090
because everybody needs
analytics but everybody

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.070
has different needs.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.660
So Le Camping brings us a
lot of things-- mentorship,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.290
a lot of network, and basically
we got out to the building.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.350
We met people.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.345
We talked with people.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.990
We did it in the
least startup way.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.820
And so we found out
that there was something

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.790
which is completely
unaddressed today,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.780
which is analyzing the impact
of TV ads on online websites,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.850
mobile apps, et cetera.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.980
GARY CIGE: If I
recall, at first you

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.709
came with an idea which was
basically a big data analytics

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.860
tool, which was a bit
difficult to pitch.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.026
GUILLAUME BELMAS: That's it.

00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:28.120
GARY CIGE: And then, if
I remember well, the way

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.270
you previewed it was
basically that you

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.670
got some different demand from
a different type of client,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.380
and you analyzed basically what
was the most needed solution

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.770
for that specific line.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.610
And then you decided
to completely overhaul

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.870
the business you
were working on.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.030
GUILLAUME BELMAS: Yeah we kept
the technical assets we had,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.860
but as you mentioned
we completely

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.670
shifted from business analytics
to the TV ads landscape, which

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.670
is completely different with
different actors, et cetera.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.016
And so we built our very
first MVP during Le Camping.

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:11.140
Since, well thanks to you,
thanks to all the people

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.670
we met, we had great
ideas and great feedback.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.322
And this is most interesting.

00:05:16.322 --> 00:05:17.780
MARTIN GORNER: You
mean that nobody

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.290
was interested in big
data and heavy [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.376
just for the sake of it.

00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:25.000
GUILLAUME BELMAS:
Yes, they were, but--

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.999
MARTIN GORNER: They needed
at specific use case.

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.010
GUILLAUME BELMAS: They
were, but it's quite hard

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.070
to first arrive in a
big field like big data

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.740
with almost nothing to show.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.910
While when we arrived
in the TV ads landscape

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.650
with the first piece
of technology we had,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.240
we knew that we could build
a very valuable first product

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.050
for these people.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.100
And that's what we did.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.410
MARTIN GORNER: So show us.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.600
GUILLAUME BELMAS: Yeah.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.540
Sure.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:00.260
So what you see here is the
detail of one TV ad spot.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.890
What we do with
REALITICS is that we

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.510
track each and every TV
ad for an advertiser.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.900
And we also have our
own analytics tracker.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.310
So basically we deployed
our analytics tracker

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.360
on the platform.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.950
And we have a very
[INAUDIBLE] that

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.140
allows us to track the
data on the minute scale.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.490
GARY CIGE: Just to
explain, what you

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.380
call a granularity
is basically the fact

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:37.850
that you don't know only show
the visitors for a large period

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.294
of time, but basically for
a shorter period of time.

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:41.210
GUILLAUME BELMAS: Yes.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.820
That's it.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.370
Because when you do
drive to work TV ads,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.650
people are with their
phones and tablets,

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.460
and they browse the
website of the advertiser.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.640
So what we can do with
analyzing all the data is

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.400
to estimate very precisely how
many people came from the TV

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.090
ad, even if the TV is
completely a disconnected media,

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.370
we can track these people.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.620
And here, as you
see, we have a lot

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.540
of people coming from
the TV, but we also

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.950
have the regular traffic.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.085
And what we do is to compute
while the customer visit

00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:18.110
in order for web marketers to
have the same data that they

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.120
have when they do a Facebook
ad campaign, or Google AdWords,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.050
et cetera.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.100
And we also track all the
impact on the business metrics

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.170
of their ads.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.630
So here we have an
e-commerce website,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.300
and we track the impact of these
ads on the lead, so basically

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.030
account creation,
and order, et cetera,

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.450
so we can track every
metric you need.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.570
And we do this for
all the TV campaigns.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.230
So we can basically
tell you which

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.510
channel is best for
your project, which

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.160
time slot, which
TV show, et cetera.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.931
We can put all
the data together.

00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:57.430
MARTIN GORNER: And
now this product,

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.672
you have validated
it with customers?

00:07:59.672 --> 00:08:00.630
GUILLAUME BELMAS: Yeah.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.338
MARTIN GORNER: They
are happy about this?

00:08:02.338 --> 00:08:05.800
GUILLAUME BELMAS: We
have six customers today,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.170
including [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.440
And they are running all
their TV ads with our platform

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.870
and they're very happy.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.760
So we count on them
to spread the word

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.580
that we have a great
project for TV advertisers.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.670
MARTIN GORNER:
Thank you very much.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.160
Thank you Guillaume
and Sebastien.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:34.030
And now we are heading to
another accelerator, the Le

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.200
Camping Toulouse accelerator.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.390
From Le Camping we have
with us Guillaume Martin,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.860
who founded PICTARINE,
which actually

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.590
is a start up that went through
Le Camping here in Paris.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:55.250
And he has a story to tell us
about a radical pilot they did,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.580
and ended up with an application
that allows you to print

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.300
your photos at the nearest
Walgreen's in the United

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.159
States, an application
that actually makes money.

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:09.879
GUILLAUME MARTIN:
And that's true.

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:11.170
MARTIN GORNER: Hello Guillaume.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.997
GUILLAUME MARTIN: I
had a chance to go

00:09:13.997 --> 00:09:15.830
through three different
[INAUDIBLE] programs

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.265
in my entrepreneur's life.

00:09:18.265 --> 00:09:25.130
So first I joined Le Camping
in Paris about three years ago.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.630
MARTIN GORNER: So what was
the business model back then?

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.280
GUILLAUME MARTIN: We were
a photo management website.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.040
We basically enabled you
to upload or download

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.390
your photo from Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.630
and all of the usual
photo services.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:48.272
MARTIN GORNER: So a social
photo aggregation service?

00:09:48.272 --> 00:09:49.230
GUILLAUME MARTIN: Yeah.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.540
We had the aggregation
part, the management part,

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.210
and we've made it
since this time,

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.310
and then two or
three times I think.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.851
MARTIN GORNER: Gary,
as a specialist,

00:09:57.851 --> 00:09:59.450
any opinion on this
business model?

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.033
GARY CIGE: No.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:04.000
I think the issue when working
with different social networks

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.270
is it's always a bit tricky.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.950
Because you get a
good business model

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.480
that doesn't
generate any revenue.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.730
And I think Guillaume
realized quite quickly

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.930
that there was a good way
to use a social network

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.490
and derive basically
business from social media

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.560
directly to a
different business.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.490
And I think it's
an amazing story.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.440
I think they didn't take that
much time to realize that.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.930
And I knew Guillaume very well.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.090
And it's quite amazing.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:39.010
I'm a bit curious about--
you've been testing and more

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.530
than testing the
product for a while now.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.960
What are the current
results with the customers,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.460
and the number of pictures let's
say uploaded-- or not something

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.000
that specific--
but basically what

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.085
have been the results of
the last couple of months

00:10:55.085 --> 00:10:59.124
of operation with
that new product?

00:10:59.124 --> 00:11:01.290
GUILLAUME MARTIN: Are you
talking about the last app

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.540
that we created?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.250
GARY CIGE: Yeah.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.125
GUILLAUME MARTIN: OK.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.970
So basically from
the very first day

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.050
we had the chance to do earn
with this app, about $70 bucks,

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:19.360
which was more than what we
earned during four years.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.110
So we knew we really
had something.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.260
And at this time, we
were really focused

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.616
on making the user
experience awesome, which

00:11:27.616 --> 00:11:29.950
we could do because
we previously

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:34.570
worked on another Android app.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:41.370
And at the same time, we
really considered distribution

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.280
and user experience
at the same time.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.170
And I think this is why the
app is so successful today.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.330
MARTIN GORNER: How
did this happen?

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.850
You actually moved to
the US for a while.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.520
You went through
another accelerator.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.000
What was the switching
point at which

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.140
you made the right
contact and realized

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.682
there was a business
model after all?

00:12:01.682 --> 00:12:03.265
GUILLAUME MARTIN:
The thing is-- yeah,

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:05.620
we had the chance to join
[INAUDIBLE] Chicago two

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.740
years ago.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.730
And for us it was huge
because this place

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.290
was the first time
for me in the US.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:19.210
So we were super
excited about that.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.430
And the second thing
is they already

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.400
had us do work from a
website to a [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.680
And at the same
time, they enabled

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.930
us to change the
value proposition.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.100
And the best thing
that we learned

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.540
there is how their user
experience is super important

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.380
and how the distribution is
[INAUDIBLE] the start of life.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.310
And this is something that
people are missing here

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.926
in France, that distribution--
most people that

00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:51.842
think that the hardest
thing about the startup

00:12:51.842 --> 00:12:53.200
is to create the product.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.920
But that's completely wrong.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.570
The hardest thing
about the startup

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.180
is to get people to
use your product.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:06.070
And we learned all these things
the hard wary during one year

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.950
and 1/2 in the US.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.795
And when we found out that
there's already a real use

00:13:11.795 --> 00:13:15.130
case with photo printing,
we nailed the experience,

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.610
we nailed the distribution.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.800
And I think this
is why we managed

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.610
to get the success
with this app.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.040
MARTIN GORNER: And so actually
now you have a revenue stream.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.369
And as a result, you
moved back to Toulouse

00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:30.035
and you're now the
resident entrepreneur

00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:32.832
at Le Camping Toulouse
helping other startups.

00:13:32.832 --> 00:13:33.790
GUILLAUME MARTIN: Yeah.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.140
I'm really thankful about that.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.890
I contacted them six months ago
when I moved back to France.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.860
I chose Toulouse because
of the wine, and of course

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:48.002
because there was
a Camping here.

00:13:48.002 --> 00:13:48.900
And I contacted them.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.410
I told them, I'd like
to head some start ups.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.430
So now I'm the entrepreneur
in residence here.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.430
I'm having fun with
all the start ups here.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.910
And this is great
because I can teach them

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.560
what I learned in the US.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.312
And this is great because yeah.

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:06.770
MARTIN GORNER:
Thank you Guillaume.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.600
Since you are the
resident entrepreneur,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.930
feel free to pitch
in at any time

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.070
when we speak about
the other startups.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.930
And before we switch to
David-- who is here--

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:24.205
I would like to fly again,
this time to Berlin.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.980
So in Berlin, Google
for Entrepreneurs

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.860
has another partnership
similar to the one

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.680
we have here at NUMA.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.060
This is the factory.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:45.620
The factory actually underwent
a huge, huge renovation.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.870
It used to be a brewery.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.530
And the parts you see in brick
color are the original parts.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:55.070
All the rest, so the additional
two stories, are brand new.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.260
And the factory is
home to parties.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.250
Well of course, this is Berlin.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.100
And actually having Sound Cloud
as a resident at the factory

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.800
helped with the partying.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.200
But the factory also has
a lot more residents.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.090
The specificity-- I
will let Jeremy Bamberg,

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.630
who is the community
manager at the factory,

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.520
describe what is specific
about the selection of startups

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.530
you have.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.755
Hello Jeremy.

00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:24.838
JEREMY BAMBERG: Hi Martin.

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:25.732
Hello Paris.

00:15:25.732 --> 00:15:26.626
Hello Toulouse.

00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:27.927
How is everyone today?

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:28.885
GUILLAUME MARTIN: Good.

00:15:28.885 --> 00:15:29.920
MARTIN GORNER: Cool.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.170
JEREMY BAMBERG: I'm Jeremy,
from Berlin based factory.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.230
We're a 16,000 square
meter technology campus

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.990
based in Berlin Mitte, right
next to the former Berlin Wall.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.040
We house startups and
mature technology companies.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.710
So some Martin has already
mentioned, like Sound Cloud.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.310
Some other bigger Berlin
startups that are well known

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.420
are 6Wunderkinder.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:56.380
They just received $19 million
of investment from Sequoia.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.700
And then we also house some--
I would say maybe lesser

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.570
known-- startups if
you're outside of Berlin

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.360
and let's say based in France,
or somewhere else in Europe,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.410
or somewhere outside.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.662
I have Valentina from
URLI.ST right next to me.

00:16:09.662 --> 00:16:10.370
VALENTINA: Hello.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.190
JEREMY BAMBERG: We host many
other smaller stage teams

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.540
that have, let's say,
five to 10 people in them.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.274
The interesting aspect
about us as well

00:16:19.274 --> 00:16:21.440
is that we're looking for
different stage companies.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.520
So we plan to host
Mozilla, and we

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.891
also international companies.

00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:28.390
A few that have
signed on recently--

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.200
which I can't
unfortunately announce,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.850
but you'll hear about
that soon-- but some

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.575
that are quite well known
like Zendesk, that's based out

00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:38.190
of Silicon Valley,
and MyFitnessPal, also

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.117
a US based company.

00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:41.450
MARTIN GORNER: Thank you Jeremy.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.700
And tell us a story about the
reconstruction of the building.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.370
I know that while
digging out the courtyard

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.620
and underground parts you
found something amazing.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.480
What was that?

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.025
JEREMY BAMBERG: So actually
we have quite a lot

00:16:58.025 --> 00:16:58.900
planned for the area.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.380
So we're a tech campus.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.069
We have five buildings
right here, right now.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.740
We're planning to
build another one.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.849
The main building,
everything went fine.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:12.760
Like you saw, Martin probably
showed a wonderful photo

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.530
of this brick facade
with two modern floors

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.880
stacked on top of it.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.464
Directly next to
that right now we

00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:20.970
were digging to build
a new, modern building,

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.060
and we actually found a bunker.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.180
So we found a bunker that
was occupied by the Nazis,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.030
and the Russians
tried to blow it up,

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.440
and now we're trying
blow it up to build

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.950
some programs supported by
Google for Entrepreneurs,

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.500
Factory, and other partners that
support entrepreneurship here

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.400
in Berlin.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.500
So the historical
significance of that area,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.820
we can see it right
outside our windows.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.700
We're right next to the
Berlin Wall memorial.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.824
And you can still see the
pegs from the former wall

00:17:47.824 --> 00:17:49.890
right there.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.260
MARTIN GORNER: So
let's switch to URLI.ST

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.910
or shall we call
it DevCharm now.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.382
Hello, Valentina.

00:17:56.382 --> 00:17:57.090
VALENTINA: Hello.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.680
OK.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.020
So I am the
co-founder of URLI.ST.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.360
And URLI.ST is the product
that we built in the last year.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.520
It was a social bookmarking
tool with a very diverse target,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.730
with a wide target.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.940
And the story is
that we built URLI.ST

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.450
but now we're pivoting
to other projects.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.880
MARTIN GORNER: So URLI.ST
was all about curation.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.021
Curation, a series of links
about any kinds of topics?

00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:24.520
Yes.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.144
VALENTINA: Yes.

00:18:25.144 --> 00:18:29.810
But at some point after
the launch we worked on it,

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.490
but the performances
were not good enough.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.800
I mean, we were no
satisfied with the numbers.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.420
So we just learned
from that experience

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.310
and we pivoted to
another project that

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.660
is called DevCharm,
which is still curation,

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.780
but is directed to a
more precise target that

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.620
is a better place
for programmers.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.640
So now we're building
this project basically.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.224
And yes?

00:18:51.224 --> 00:18:52.640
MARTIN GORNER: And
maybe before we

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.570
continue, Gary, do you have
any general advice on business

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.100
models based around curation?

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.490
GARY CIGE: Well curation
is quite tricky.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.360
So I don't have advice
on any specific stuff.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.370
But usually when something
is that complex, especially

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.980
curation, the best
way to act first

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.050
is not to reinvent the wheel.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.310
Look at what has
been done before.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.240
Usually in everything
which is linked

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.780
to curation-- it
could be Pinterest,

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.610
it could be another
type of platform--

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.850
the issue is that people want
to distinguish themselves

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:39.750
on different business models
that are not as efficient as it

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.300
should be.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.840
And so what I
suggest is basically

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.952
to speak to people
that have been working

00:19:47.952 --> 00:19:49.780
at different curation websites.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.180
And just understand--
not especially

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.260
do exactly the same-- but
just understand the process

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:02.330
that they've been acting
through to see a bit

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.110
how they got to the
current business model.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.420
This will probably not tell
you exactly what to do,

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.460
but at least it will
give you an insight

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.169
of the thing that they've tried
before and that didn't work.

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:15.210
MARTIN GORNER: All right.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.850
And before we
continue, I will make

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.405
a demo of what
DevCharm is today.

00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:22.030
VALENTINA: Yes.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.410
Because now online you
can see a first pilot

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.570
test, because
actually we changed

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.000
around our work process.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.640
So instead of building
a problem from scratch,

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.990
we decided to build a
test that is now online.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.350
So now we're working
on the real platform

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.100
that will be launched soon.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.640
And that, that is
online, is a series

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.440
of articles, a list of links.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.700
It's a combination of
resources about development.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.100
And we wanted to test the
reach of the audience,

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.610
and we wanted to
test the interest,

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.060
and so that was our goal.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.880
MARTIN GORNER: So let me
show that to our audience.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.940
I'm here on DevCharm.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.430
And actually the only way
to log in is through GitHub.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.150
This is really for developers.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.210
And when I logged
in, I have this.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.690
So I have created
an accumulated list

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.290
of links, which is
about WebGL demos.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.380
Here on my links.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.950
I can switch to one of them.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.870
This is what it looks like.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:27.940
OK.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.490
And now the most
amazing part, something

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:38.220
that I really found
great about your website

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.650
is the way you edit those links.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.810
So this is the interface.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.250
At first I was dismayed.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.570
But actually for developers
and people used to GitHub,

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.420
this is great.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:57.420
The only way to edit this
list is to actually type code.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.520
I love typing code.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.840
So here for instance, if I
want to change the title,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.900
I go here, one WebGL.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.990
Let's call this
great WebGL demos.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.260
And here I go.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.990
The same for all the rest
of the links and so on.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.530
How did you come up with such
a radical user interface?

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:23.745
VALENTINA: Well the thing was
we had a very wide audience

00:22:23.745 --> 00:22:26.720
with URLI.ST. And
we thought, OK, we

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.540
should analyze this audience
and make something different

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.420
and more targeted
to a specific one.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.550
And since we were a
quite technical team,

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:38.160
and we knew that also our
audience-- actually of URLI.ST,

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.990
most of it was quite
technical too-- so

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.630
we decided just to
focus on developers.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.340
And this is what comes from
our experience with URLI.ST,

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.940
that it's much,
much better to work

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.590
with a very precise
audience now,

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.880
because we can understand
better their needs.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.790
So this is why we also
chose [INAUDIBLE] something

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.210
that looks like a text editor
when you edit your needs,

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.160
because it's more
comfortable for developers.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.730
It's just the way
they want web stuff.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.990
And we can [INAUDIBLE]
library that is wiki-based,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.310
so you can edit
other people's lists,

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.880
and you can build together
with others these lists.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.290
And this is also coming from
the experience of social coding.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.300
So that was the
great improvement

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.310
that we made on working on a
project with a web consumer

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:30.230
approach and switching to
something that is more precise.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.250
And also the attitude of
business model as well.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.460
Because in this case,
it's much precise

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.980
also the business
model, because you

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.300
can build a job board that
is tied up into developers

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.830
and is tied up to the
content of the platform.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.140
So for instance, it's much,
much more interesting and easy

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.414
actually to manage this idea.

00:23:50.414 --> 00:23:51.080
GARY CIGE: Yeah.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.740
It definitely has nothing to
do with the curation website

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.589
example I gave you.

00:23:56.589 --> 00:23:57.630
But you're totally right.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:01.110
I'm a bit curious about how
you tested the solution.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.120
How did you begin
with that solution?

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.610
How do you disseminate the
product in the community?

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.720
Did you use the
factory, for example,

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.930
developers from the factory?

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.210
Did use online communities?

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.980
How did you manage
to basically test

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.770
the first version of the
product with your target?

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.700
VALENTINA: Well the
thing is, obviously

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.720
the factory is very
important for us

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.670
because it's such a
great community in terms

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.060
of technology.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.140
I mean, we exchange a lot of
ideas with other teams here.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.575
We [INAUDIBLE] team because we
are basically the same team.

00:24:38.575 --> 00:24:44.320
And this made us think about our
text tech in a different way,

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.030
so we exchanged some solutions.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.150
In the very beginning
we decided, OK,

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.150
instead of building
a product, we'll

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.400
build something
like a prototype.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.140
So we built just a few
pages that were connected,

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.570
and we tested the reach
using [INAUDIBLE] and Reddit.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.320
Because we wanted
to see if people

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.750
are interested in this content.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:02.995
Are they willing to share it?

00:25:02.995 --> 00:25:04.495
Because that was
the problem that we

00:25:04.495 --> 00:25:05.744
had with the previous product.

00:25:05.744 --> 00:25:08.580
They were not willing
to share as much.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.345
It was more like
individual use, which

00:25:10.345 --> 00:25:13.560
was making any sense for
us on our business model.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.320
And so we just
gathered the numbers

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.390
and were like, OK, so this is
much more interesting in terms

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.510
of numbers compared
to what we had before.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.440
And then we decided to
build something smaller

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.980
for our first steps.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.770
So that was building a prototype
instead of a whole product,

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:35.094
and then deciding to go
for the platform we are now

00:25:35.094 --> 00:25:36.010
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.885
MARTIN GORNER: Thank
you very much Valentina.

00:25:37.885 --> 00:25:39.530
This is a great adventure.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.585
And we will now
continue the adventure

00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:47.512
and go back to Toulouse.

00:25:47.512 --> 00:25:49.590
In Toulouse we
have David with us.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.700
David, who is the
founder of CityMeo.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:57.274
And to show you what CityMeo is
about, let's play short movie.

00:25:57.274 --> 00:25:58.268
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:58.268 --> 00:26:34.442
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:34.442 --> 00:26:37.880
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.206
David.

00:26:39.206 --> 00:26:40.042
DAVID KERIBIN: Yes.

00:26:40.042 --> 00:26:40.460
Hello.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.360
MARTIN GORNER: Hello.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:49.420
So the first time we met I said,
this is a Chromecast for shops.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.997
And you told me, no, it's not.

00:26:50.997 --> 00:26:51.580
So what is it?

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.413
DAVID KERIBIN: Yeah.

00:26:52.413 --> 00:26:56.080
Like a Chromecast, but a
Chromecast [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.581
sort of.

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:57.330
MARTIN GORNER: No.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.720
Actually it's very different.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.529
And please tell us what
this connected object does.

00:27:02.529 --> 00:27:03.320
DAVID KERIBIN: Yes.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.900
In fact, at the
beginning of a our story,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.600
a short story, because
it was one year ago we

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.400
had the chance to
participate and to take part

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.530
as a startup in
Toulouse and to pitch

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.010
the idea, the original
idea of CityMeo,

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.940
which was a sort
of social network.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.890
But a physical one that
was based on screen

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.850
placed in shops.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:33.690
So this one was our
first siging idea,

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:40.300
but we had to make big pivots
in Le Camping, Toulouse.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.210
Thanks to La Camping
Toulouse because we

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:47.210
love to think about the
market, and the time to market.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.700
And this was a
program of our idea.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.580
And now--

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.740
MARTIN GORNER: So you
went to actual shops

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.620
and you pitched
them this solution.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.200
You told them,
well, buy a screen

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.940
and put this little box next
to it, and it will do wonders.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.469
It will do this and that.

00:28:03.469 --> 00:28:04.260
DAVID KERIBIN: Yes.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.720
It was the idea.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.800
And you can manage
another business,

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.150
which is digital signage,
simple digital signage

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:19.410
or other companies like
[INAUDIBLE] schools.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:25.410
Everyone can enjoy your
system in it's company.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.510
There is now screens, in fact.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:32.060
MARTIN GORNER: So it's better
to sell to companies who already

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.700
have those screens, because
then they only install

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.220
your little box, and that little
box is actually pretty cheap.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.470
DAVID KERIBIN: Yes.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.620
When we did that
pivot, we thought

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.440
about what do we
really have now.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.310
And we had a platform,
a web platform

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.490
where you can send your
content, your ideas, your photos

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.690
online or display on screens.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:06.110
We had a fantastic generator
of content, of ideas.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.790
The idea is showing it.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:12.060
And we had the real time
management of screen

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.800
based on the smallest per year.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.900
And this was the
beginning of the story

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.560
because this player is pretty
compatible with most screens.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.130
We don't sell screens.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.130
We say, OK, you have screens.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.077
Let's plug CityMeo in it.

00:29:27.077 --> 00:29:28.660
MARTIN GORNER: So I
would like to show

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:33.910
a little demo of the content
creation part on CityMeo.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.250
Actually here I'm on
the CityMeo website.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.790
And let's say I want
to create a video

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:46.460
and put that video on all the
screens I have around my shop.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.500
So let's pick this sample.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.500
I'm going to play the video.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.560
So it says, discover
the CityMeo experience.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.260
100% products from Toulouse.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.490
CityMeo.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.300
And now if I want to modify
this video, this is the editor.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.380
Actually what I can change
is the background picture

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.360
and those three messages.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.170
So it's extremely simple to
create those kinds of videos.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:20.040
And you have a ton of
presets with various styles

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.470
and specialized messages
for opening times,

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:28.720
for announcements, for
product promotions, and so on.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.770
So Gary.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.350
What do you think
about this pilot?

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.933
GARY CIGE: Well I
do know the company,

00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:36.960
but I think it's
quite interesting,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.060
because you are basically
moving outside, let's say,

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.390
the classical web
advertisement system

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:48.010
and you go to the online.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:53.180
I'm a bit curious about
the distribution part.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.800
Basically the box
is a simple box

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.470
connected to the internet
that is streaming something

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.625
on the TV screen.

00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:03.782
Is that it?

00:31:03.782 --> 00:31:07.570
The box is not a
very complex item.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:12.310
But how, for the moment,
do you sell the product?

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.360
How do you distribute it?

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.370
Do you do it by yourself?

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.250
Do you go in the shops?

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.060
Do you do phoning?

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.760
I'm a bit curious about
how you do it now,

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.180
or a how you plan to
basically scale up.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.839
Because that's always
the trickiest part.

00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:30.630
DAVID KERIBIN: Yes.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:34.990
Of course, this is the problem
with the original idea.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:41.610
We cannot go in every shop
to speak to every shopkeeper

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.000
and say, hey, we
have a cool product.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:53.060
We can't manage it, so now we
are dealing with big companies.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:32:01.280
I have let's say 100 shops when
there is one screen per shop,

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.370
and they will be able to
manage that content everywhere

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:11.070
in each individual
shop from one platform.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:16.800
So we can manage to reach
the top level of directions,

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.240
and then we have a
bigger [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.450
MARTIN GORNER: And how
about the physical part?

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.740
Because you're building
a hardware product.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.230
How did you start with that?

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:37.516
DAVID KERIBIN: In fact, the only
thing we do here in Toulouse

00:32:37.516 --> 00:32:43.360
is to assemble the [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:49.630
It's quite tricky
because we can't just

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:55.110
make 100 [INAUDIBLE] a
week right now because we

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.960
are as much as we could be.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.530
But it's going well right now.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.110
I think later we
will [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.110
as soon as possible.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.924
MARTIN GORNER: You mean you're
assembling them yourself?

00:33:08.924 --> 00:33:09.850
DAVID KERIBIN: Yes.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:10.766
MARTIN GORNER: Really.

00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:11.510
All right.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.577
All right.

00:33:12.577 --> 00:33:15.709
DAVID KERIBIN: Not really
hard, but time consuming.

00:33:15.709 --> 00:33:16.500
MARTIN GORNER: Yes.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.120
You're going to
have to scale that.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:19.940
GARY CIGE: Indeed.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.990
I was a bit curious, how
many are you in the team?

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.600
Who is taking care
of the hardware

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.210
and who is taking
care of the software?

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:32.580
What do you take care of
because we only see you?

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.100
And I guess if you
are doing everything,

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:42.390
even assembling the product,
you don't have enough time.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:46.450
DAVID KERIBIN: We have a
core team here in Toulouse,

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:52.600
and everyone has his
own parts of the story.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.810
So I make the
business parts of it.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:01.080
And [INAUDIBLE] is the website.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.270
And associates, my
first associates

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.570
in making the video platform.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:11.306
So there is a motion
designer and also

00:34:11.306 --> 00:34:12.889
an engineer who can
manage to do this.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.770
My other associate
is making the website

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.920
working and doing
direction with the user.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:33.400
And the last one is
making the product,

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.270
the heart of the product.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.969
So we are complementary.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:42.610
GARY CIGE: I was a bit curious
because the issue with hardware

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.429
companies always
that just to begin

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:49.250
with you have to be
around three or four,

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:54.659
which is always a challenge to
create that kind of company.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.969
So I was a bit curious as
to where, three, four, five,

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.760
or-- But that's a good mix.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.352
MARTIN GORNER: And
how is business?

00:35:02.352 --> 00:35:04.060
DAVID KERIBIN: It's
quite good because we

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.320
launched our product in January.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.380
February our first client,
March, national clients.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.099
So it's quite OK right now.

00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:15.140
MARTIN GORNER: All right.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.860
Thank you very much David.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.590
Thank you.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.524
And now--

00:35:18.524 --> 00:35:20.440
GUILLAUME MARTIN: Martin,
can I add something?

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.780
MARTIN GORNER: Yes of course.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:21.855
GUILLAUME MARTIN: Yeah.

00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:23.810
I just want to say,
as we're opening up

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.866
applications for the
company in Toulouse.

00:35:25.866 --> 00:35:28.820
We just opened them
and everyone is welcome

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.657
if they have the
balls to come here.

00:35:30.657 --> 00:35:32.240
MARTIN GORNER: Well
actually Gary, you

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.790
should say that
we're also opening

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.240
applications for Le Camping.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:35.906
GARY CIGE: Yeah.

00:35:35.906 --> 00:35:38.390
But I don't want to
compete with Guillaume.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.740
First, let's fill in the
Toulouse applications

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.407
and then we are going
to take the rest.

00:35:46.407 --> 00:35:48.240
MARTIN GORNER: So to
sum it up, applications

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.760
are now open for both Le Camping
in Toulouse and in Paris.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:36:00.410
Please apply And now we are
coming back to the studio here,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:06.339
and I have with me Romain
Cochet from SMIIRL.

00:36:06.339 --> 00:36:07.130
ROMAIN COCHET: Yes.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.690
Hello.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:08.930
Hello everyone.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:13.778
MARTIN GORNER: And before you
say anything, let's watch this.

00:36:13.778 --> 00:36:19.267
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:19.267 --> 00:37:02.887
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.230
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.320
So Romain, what is this?

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.520
ROMAIN COCHET: What is this?

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.580
So it's a flag.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.800
So we are Smiirl and we
are making this product.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.150
It's a connected
object which displays

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:22.860
the number of your fans
directly on the object.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.040
We are targeting
restaurants, shops, bars,

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.280
we call that break in models.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.770
And actually today when
you enter into a shop,

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:37.460
you can see if these people
have a community behind them.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.640
So the idea now is to display
it and to attract more fans

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.260
on your web page.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.810
MARTIN GORNER: And so what I
see, this piece of hardware

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.205
is actually very well designed.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.480
How did it look
before you started

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.890
working on it at
Le Camping here?

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.505
ROMAIN COCHET: So when
we came to Le Camping

00:37:58.505 --> 00:38:01.310
it was only made
in the laser cut,

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:04.410
so your could see through it.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:07.940
We only had the prototype
which was working,

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.790
but it was not efficient.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:14.460
And we had to resolve
a lot of problems

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.190
before having this project.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.470
MARTIN GORNER: And at what
stage of that development

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:24.810
did you think it was good
enough to go show to customers

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.274
and install in a shop?

00:38:26.274 --> 00:38:28.690
ROMAIN COCHET: You have to
show it as quickly as possible,

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.770
because when you start
to design something,

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.450
you have to think how
the people will use it.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.910
So when we came
to Le Camping, we

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:42.010
had the first idea of how
the object would look.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.480
But at first, we didn't
have the glass for example.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.850
And when we went to a shop, we
put it into a shop and someone

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.219
just say, oh, that's fine.

00:38:49.219 --> 00:38:49.760
That's great.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.680
And he put his
finger into the flags

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.780
and the object was broken.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.890
So we decided to add
the glass to the object.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.320
One thing is you have
to test it on your user.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:07.500
And it's very [INAUDIBLE] if
you're doing this with other.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.670
MARTIN GORNER: And
so the hardware part.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.820
I'm a software engineer.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.670
I don't get hardware.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.110
Explain to me what
is the process

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:19.520
of making a hardware product,
designing it, prototyping it,

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.000
manufacturing it.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.752
How does that work?

00:39:22.752 --> 00:39:24.460
ROMAIN COCHET: So it's
quite complicated.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.430
You have to understand
a lot of things

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.100
to do a product like this.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.310
You first have to
think about the design

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.280
and think about the user.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.180
It's the same as a website.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.240
You have to think about
the user and sell it

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.530
to the good customer.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.480
And you have to
answer a problem.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.090
And after, when
you do your design,

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.120
you can start to do your
prototype like this.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:55.130
You can show to customers,
to investors, to a community,

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:59.440
When you have that, you have
to [INAUDIBLE] the object

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.770
to be able to be produced.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.390
Because when you
do a prototype, you

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:06.140
can take half a day
to do one of it.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:12.260
But when you have to give
the product to your user,

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.030
you have to be able to
do a lot in one day.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:19.110
So you have to rethink the
object, rethink the prototype,

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.940
and then go to see manufacturers
who will be able to produce it.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.190
MARTIN GORNER: And do we
have manufacturers in France?

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.981
ROMAIN COCHET: Yes.

00:40:25.981 --> 00:40:31.400
So when we started, we
had to do our first-

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.620
so when we entered Le Camping,
the first question that we have

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:39.060
is how many objects
will we send.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:44.290
And we didn't know if we had to
do 10 objects, or 500 objects,

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.620
or 10,000, or much more.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.460
And so that's why it
was very useful to be

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.810
at Le Camping for that.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.200
And today we have a
factory in France.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.500
We have a supply chain.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.010
We have [INAUDIBLE] who
is coming from Toulouse.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.145
We have the printing
which is made in--

00:41:02.145 --> 00:41:03.520
MARTIN GORNER:
It's made of wood?

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.353
ROMAIN COCHET: Yeah.

00:41:04.353 --> 00:41:05.830
We have a small--

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.180
MARTIN GORNER: Oh yes, I see.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.530
The front panel is made of wood.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:09.363
ROMAIN COCHET: Yeah.

00:41:09.363 --> 00:41:10.410
The front.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.600
MARTIN GORNER: Very nice.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.225
ROMAIN COCHET: And
we have the plastic,

00:41:13.225 --> 00:41:15.580
which is made in [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.900
It's a French product for now.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.290
But it's not enough for us.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.740
We can't deliver
a lot of product

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.175
in the current
supply chain, so we

00:41:24.175 --> 00:41:27.210
are looking for a better one.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.570
GARY CIGE: And my
question is basically

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:34.630
for a hardware company, what
is the biggest challenge?

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:36.935
If you have to
name just one, what

00:41:36.935 --> 00:41:41.170
is basically the
biggest thing to tackle?

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.570
ROMAIN COCHET: I think
one of the biggest things

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.460
is distribution,
like said Guillaume.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.470
Because when you sell an object,
you have a lot of obstacles,

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.700
but they are in steps.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.700
So the first one is to be
able to produce the object.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:01.040
It's very complicated to
have a price of you're

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.180
object because you have to
enter into all the details

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.064
how do you inject plastic,
how you have to do molding,

00:42:07.064 --> 00:42:07.980
you have to do toning.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.820
So you have a financial problem.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:14.030
So it's different when
you're a startup like us when

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:18.190
you have only
$10,000 your product.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.670
GARY CIGE: And my
second question

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:24.590
is that it's really-- because
with that type of hardware

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.000
product usually you go
and you do crowd funding,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.012
and you decided not to do it.

00:42:29.012 --> 00:42:30.220
ROMAIN COCHET: Yeah.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.810
GARY CIGE: Could you explain
a bit the process of reasoning

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.810
behind that choice?

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:36.100
ROMAIN COCHET: Yes.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.550
When we thought
about that, we say,

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.230
oh, we can go on
Kickstarter and Testa

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.820
where there's a market for that.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.820
But after [INAUDIBLE]
are shops, are retailers

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.070
and they are not
really on Kickstarter.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:53.460
So we wanted to do
[INAUDIBLE] on our website

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.410
to be able to say, oh,
look, there is a market.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:00.020
And we didn't touch
the geek person

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.870
who is one who are very close
to the technology [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.890
We want to touch the
real one, and test

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.210
if we can sell a
product like this.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.250
So that's why we all didn't
choose to go on Kickstarter.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.375
But Kickstarter and
all the other platforms

00:43:14.375 --> 00:43:19.124
are very good to test the market
if you are into B2C model.

00:43:19.124 --> 00:43:19.762
GARY CIGE: OK.

00:43:19.762 --> 00:43:21.470
MARTIN GORNER: How
about the price point?

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:26.600
How do you nail the right price
point for something like this?

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.700
ROMAIN COCHET: For
the price point,

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:33.030
there is two
options of doing it.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.440
At first, we didn't have
time to think about,

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.250
to do market studies, how many
people will be able to pay.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:45.000
So what we think is
for the first price,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.110
we decided to evaluate
the cost and say, OK, this

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:50.300
is our target cost.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.460
And we will have to
have whole margin

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.420
to be able to live after.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.220
We have to be able
to have a margin

00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.410
to distribute the object.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.120
And yeah, so that's quite easy.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.060
You do your estimation after
you do your [INAUDIBLE] margin,

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.602
the distributor margin,
and that's quite-- yes.

00:44:07.602 --> 00:44:09.310
MARTIN GORNER: Well,
yes, but it also has

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.690
to correspond to a price
point that the customers

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.587
are ready to pay.

00:44:14.587 --> 00:44:15.420
ROMAIN COCHET: Yeah.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:19.330
After, when you have this
price point, you can test it.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.170
You can go on shops [INAUDIBLE],
and if people are saying,

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:25.980
OK, we are OK to buy it for
this price, that's fine.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.480
And we tested like that.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.070
At first, when we
started we decided

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:34.050
to fix the price at 300
euros without the taxes.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:37.070
And we went to shop [INAUDIBLE]
and saying, OK, it's 300 euros.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.657
Is that so much?

00:44:39.657 --> 00:44:40.490
And they say, oh no.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:44.810
My chair here is
only 200 euros or so.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:45.360
That's fine.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.060
I have 20 chairs like this,
so 300 euros is fine for me.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:53.130
GARY CIGE: But that's
the tricky part.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.000
We worked a lot on
the price point.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.270
We worked a lot on
testing because this

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:01.130
is a product that you
can actually easily test.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:04.140
Because you just go in the
street and you test it.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.260
And they were quite
effective on that.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.680
And the project changed a lot.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.570
The product changed.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.340
The price changed.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:16.850
And I was also a bit curious
because you basically

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:19.607
sold 500 of them,
and quite quickly.

00:45:19.607 --> 00:45:20.440
ROMAIN COCHET: Yeah.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:26.310
GARY CIGE: And what has been
the effect at the customers?

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:30.580
Because you sell something
like, improve your communication

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.700
with your client.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.990
What the effect of this
for your customers?

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:40.810
ROMAIN COCHET: So the benefit
of the customers-- here we are.

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:44.260
Today we are shipping the
first objects in two months.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.730
And we see the feedback
of the customer

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.550
and say, oh that's
great, because I

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:50.850
have 10 people who are
stopping behind my shop.

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:54.170
And I have more
fans on my web page

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.560
and on my Facebook
account, and then I

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.590
can reach them more
easily than before.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.520
So that was the
idea of the object,

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:08.160
and now we are seeing that
it's becoming ready to them.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.440
GARY CIGE: You actually
changed the transformation rate

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.407
of those shops?

00:46:14.407 --> 00:46:15.240
ROMAIN COCHET: Yeah.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.864
And the fist thing
that a customer does

00:46:16.864 --> 00:46:20.374
is just to open the box
and put it on the website.

00:46:20.374 --> 00:46:23.560
And the first day he
say, oh, do you like me

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.680
on Facebook, our Facebook page?

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.150
And we can see that
they have 20 or 40

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.855
more followers in the same day.

00:46:29.855 --> 00:46:30.710
So that's crazy.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.460
That's really working.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.300
GARY CIGE: And what's next?

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.360
So you sold 500, which was
not the final objective

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.180
of the company.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.010
ROMAIN COCHET: Yes.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.780
So there is two parts.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.210
The first part is make
this product more reliable

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:48.640
and sell it in mass production.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.250
So thanks to Le Camping,
we met Orange and we

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.010
went to [INAUDIBLE]
with them to see

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:59.140
how can we manufacture
this kind of product.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.710
And also we are-- Smiirl stands
for social media integrated

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:04.765
in real life.

00:47:04.765 --> 00:47:07.850
And the idea is just to bring
back all this social media

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:10.600
and [INAUDIBLE]
into the real life,

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.320
and there's a lot of call to do.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.860
We are three people.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.460
There's Gauthier,
who is our CEO.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.174
He was an advertiser.

00:47:19.174 --> 00:47:21.450
There is Raphael,
who is a designer.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:25.480
And I am a CTO on the
hardware and software parts.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.580
And this mix is made
to create new objects.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.070
And we want to go
further in the way

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.434
how we interact with reality.

00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:36.100
MARTIN GORNER: So we
should be expecting

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.050
more connected
objects from Smiirl.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.350
ROMAIN COCHET: Exactly.

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:40.230
MARTIN GORNER: Thank
you very much, Romain.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.720
ROMAIN COCHET:
Thank you, Martin.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.095
MARTIN GORNER:
Thank you, Romain.

00:47:42.095 --> 00:47:43.880
Thank you, Gary.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:47.070
Thank you everyone in
Toulouse and Berlin.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.490
And this is the
end of the stream.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.590
Thank you everyone for
watching this first live stream

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.550
from the NUMA Studio.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:55.450
GARY CIGE: Thank you.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:56.350
ROMAIN COCHET: Thank you.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.550
JEREMY BAMBERG: Thank you.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.100
VALENTINA: Bye.
