00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.858
At some point in our lives,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:17.847
almost every one of us
will have our heart broken.

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:23.203
My patient Kathy planned her wedding
when she was in middle school.

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:25.064
She would meet her future husband

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:26.721
by age 27,

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:28.532
get engaged a year later

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:30.799
and get married a year after that.

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:35.516
But when Kathy turned 27,
she didn't find a husband.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.780
She found a lump in her breast.

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:41.403
She went through many months
of harsh chemotherapy

00:00:41.427 --> 00:00:43.201
and painful surgeries,

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:47.729
and then just as she was ready
to jump back into the dating world,

00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:50.123
she found a lump in her other breast

00:00:50.147 --> 00:00:51.889
and had to do it all over again.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:54.434
Kathy recovered, though,

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:57.393
and she was eager to resume
her search for a husband

00:00:57.417 --> 00:00:59.832
as soon as her eyebrows grew back in.

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:02.925
When you're going
on first dates in New York City,

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.936
you need to be able to express
a wide range of emotions.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.343
(Laughter)

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.559
Soon afterwards,
she met Rich and fell in love.

00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:13.749
The relationship was everything
she hoped it would be.

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:15.878
Six months later,

00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:18.377
after a lovely weekend in New England,

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:21.943
Rich made reservations
at their favorite romantic restaurant.

00:01:22.877 --> 00:01:24.803
Kathy knew he was going to propose,

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:27.850
and she could barely
contain her excitement.

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.311
But Rich did not propose
to Kathy that night.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:32.968
He broke up with her.

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:36.280
As deeply as he cared
for Kathy -- and he did --

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.331
he simply wasn't in love.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.409
Kathy was shattered.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:46.276
Her heart was truly broken,
and she now faced yet another recovery.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.515
But five months after the breakup,

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.734
Kathy still couldn't stop
thinking about Rich.

00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:55.372
Her heart was still very much broken.

00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:57.303
The question is:

00:01:57.786 --> 00:01:59.220
Why?

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:03.340
Why was this incredibly strong
and determined woman

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:06.272
unable to marshal the same
emotional resources

00:02:06.296 --> 00:02:09.715
that got her through four years
of cancer treatments?

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.898
Why do so many of us flounder

00:02:12.922 --> 00:02:15.401
when we're trying
to recover from heartbreak?

00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:18.080
Why do the same coping mechanisms

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:21.228
that get us through all kinds
of life challenges

00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:24.440
fail us so miserably
when our heart gets broken?

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:28.322
In over 20 years of private practice,

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:31.326
I have seen people
of every age and background

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.975
face every manner of heartbreak,

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.071
and what I've learned is this:

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.380
when your heart is broken,

00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:42.294
the same instincts you ordinarily rely on

00:02:42.318 --> 00:02:46.784
will time and again lead you
down the wrong path.

00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:50.423
You simply cannot trust
what your mind is telling you.

00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:54.325
For example, we know from studies
of heartbroken people

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.775
that having a clear understanding
of why the relationship ended

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.609
is really important
for our ability to move on.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.007
Yet time and again,

00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:06.388
when we are offered a simple
and honest explanation

00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:08.724
like the one Rich offered Kathy,

00:03:08.748 --> 00:03:09.906
we reject it.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.698
Heartbreak creates
such dramatic emotional pain,

00:03:14.722 --> 00:03:18.290
our mind tells us the cause
must be equally dramatic.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.321
And that gut instinct is so powerful,

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:24.581
it can make even the most reasonable
and measured of us

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:28.004
come up with mysteries
and conspiracy theories

00:03:28.028 --> 00:03:29.215
where none exist.

00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:32.791
Kathy became convinced
something must have happened

00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:34.922
during her romantic getaway with Rich

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:36.868
that soured him on the relationship,

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:39.870
and she became obsessed
with figuring out what that was.

00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:42.334
And so she spent countless hours

00:03:42.358 --> 00:03:45.885
going through every minute
of that weekend in her mind,

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.057
searching her memory for clues
that were not there.

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:54.235
Kathy's mind tricked her
into initiating this wild goose chase.

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:58.611
But what compelled her to commit to it
for so many months?

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.553
Heartbreak is far more insidious
than we realize.

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:08.026
There is a reason we keep going
down one rabbit hole after another,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.831
even when we know it's going
to make us feel worse.

00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:13.442
Brain studies have shown

00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:15.959
that the withdrawal of romantic love

00:04:15.983 --> 00:04:19.469
activates the same mechanisms
in our brain that get activated

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:24.530
when addicts are withdrawing
from substances like cocaine or opioids.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.335
Kathy was going through withdrawal.

00:04:27.938 --> 00:04:31.728
And since she could not have
the heroin of actually being with Rich,

00:04:31.752 --> 00:04:36.227
her unconscious mind chose
the methadone of her memories with him.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.988
Her instincts told her
she was trying to solve a mystery,

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:41.942
but what she was actually doing

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:43.538
was getting her fix.

00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:48.534
This is what makes heartbreak
so difficult to heal.

00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:51.425
Addicts know they're addicted.

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.559
They know when they're shooting up.

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.480
But heartbroken people do not.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.823
But you do now.

00:04:58.587 --> 00:05:02.146
And if your heart is broken,
you cannot ignore that.

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:06.466
You have to recognize that,
as compelling as the urge is,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.901
with every trip down memory lane,
every text you send,

00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:13.408
every second you spend
stalking your ex on social media,

00:05:13.432 --> 00:05:15.572
you are just feeding your addiction,

00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:17.386
deepening your emotional pain

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.169
and complicating your recovery.

00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:23.694
Getting over heartbreak is not a journey.

00:05:23.718 --> 00:05:27.886
It's a fight, and your reason
is your strongest weapon.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.704
There is no breakup explanation
that's going to feel satisfying.

00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:34.567
No rationale can take away
the pain you feel.

00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:37.251
So don't search for one,
don't wait for one,

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:40.324
just accept the one you were offered
or make up one yourself

00:05:40.348 --> 00:05:42.268
and then put the question to rest,

00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:45.412
because you need that closure
to resist the addiction.

00:05:46.857 --> 00:05:49.402
And you need something else as well:

00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:52.833
you have to be willing to let go,

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:55.545
to accept that it's over.

00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:58.845
Otherwise, your mind
will feed on your hope

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:00.157
and set you back.

00:06:01.543 --> 00:06:05.503
Hope can be incredibly destructive
when your heart is broken.

00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:10.281
Heartbreak is a master manipulator.

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:13.958
The ease with which it gets our mind
to do the absolute opposite

00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:16.008
of what we need in order to recover

00:06:16.032 --> 00:06:17.253
is remarkable.

00:06:17.908 --> 00:06:21.798
One of the most common tendencies
we have when our heart is broken

00:06:21.822 --> 00:06:24.019
is to idealize the person who broke it.

00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:27.672
We spend hours remembering their smile,

00:06:27.696 --> 00:06:29.838
how great they made us feel,

00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:34.157
that time we hiked up the mountain
and made love under the stars.

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.533
All that does is make our loss
feel more painful.

00:06:38.937 --> 00:06:40.193
We know that.

00:06:40.217 --> 00:06:45.115
Yet we still allow our mind to cycle
through one greatest hit after another,

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.737
like we were being held hostage by our own
passive-aggressive Spotify playlist.

00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:52.117
(Laughter)

00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:57.072
Heartbreak will make those thoughts
pop into your mind.

00:06:57.096 --> 00:07:00.902
And so to avoid idealizing,
you have to balance them out

00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:04.039
by remembering their frown,
not just their smile,

00:07:04.426 --> 00:07:06.543
how bad they made you feel,

00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:10.229
the fact that after the lovemaking,
you got lost coming down the mountain,

00:07:10.253 --> 00:07:12.972
argued like crazy
and didn't speak for two days.

00:07:14.417 --> 00:07:18.648
What I tell my patients
is to compile an exhaustive list

00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:21.069
of all the ways
the person was wrong for you,

00:07:21.093 --> 00:07:23.581
all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves,

00:07:23.605 --> 00:07:25.973
and then keep it on your phone.

00:07:25.997 --> 00:07:27.040
(Laughter)

00:07:27.496 --> 00:07:29.151
And once you have your list,

00:07:29.175 --> 00:07:30.420
you have to use it.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.589
When I hear even a hint of idealizing

00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:36.706
or the faintest whiff
of nostalgia in a session,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.714
I go, "Phone, please."

00:07:38.738 --> 00:07:40.559
(Laughter)

00:07:41.098 --> 00:07:43.616
Your mind will try to tell you
they were perfect.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.355
But they were not,
and neither was the relationship.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:50.216
And if you want to get over them,
you have to remind yourself of that,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.422
frequently.

00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:54.951
None of us is immune to heartbreak.

00:07:55.689 --> 00:08:00.742
My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old
senior executive in a software company.

00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:03.505
Five years after his wife died,

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:06.158
he finally felt ready
to start dating again.

00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:07.892
He soon met Sharon,

00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:10.445
and a whirlwind romance ensued.

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:13.879
They introduced each other
to their adult children after one month,

00:08:13.903 --> 00:08:16.408
and they moved in together after two.

00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:19.556
When middle-aged people date,
they don't mess around.

00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:23.678
It's like "Love, Actually"
meets "The Fast and the Furious."

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:25.264
(Laughter)

00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:29.063
Miguel was happier
than he had been in years.

00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:32.293
But the night before
their first anniversary,

00:08:32.317 --> 00:08:33.640
Sharon left him.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:38.138
She had decided to move to the West Coast
to be closer to her children,

00:08:38.162 --> 00:08:40.611
and she didn't want
a long-distance relationship.

00:08:41.404 --> 00:08:46.167
Miguel was totally blindsided
and utterly devastated.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.605
He barely functioned at work
for many, many months,

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.125
and he almost lost his job as a result.

00:08:52.804 --> 00:08:56.619
Another consequence of heartbreak
is that feeling alone and in pain

00:08:56.643 --> 00:08:59.698
can significantly impair
our intellectual functioning,

00:08:59.722 --> 00:09:04.494
especially when performing complex tasks
involving logic and reasoning.

00:09:04.518 --> 00:09:06.830
It temporarily lowers our IQ.

00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:11.742
But it wasn't just the intensity
of Miguel's grief

00:09:11.766 --> 00:09:13.661
that confused his employers;

00:09:13.685 --> 00:09:15.145
it was the duration.

00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:18.266
Miguel was confused by this as well

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.046
and really quite embarrassed by it.

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:23.116
"What's wrong with me?"
he asked me in our session.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.102
"What adult spends almost a year
getting over a one-year relationship?"

00:09:27.804 --> 00:09:30.029
Actually, many do.

00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:35.541
Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks
of traditional loss and grief:

00:09:36.068 --> 00:09:38.512
insomnia, intrusive thoughts,

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.489
immune system dysfunction.

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:44.542
Forty percent of people experience
clinically measurable depression.

00:09:45.702 --> 00:09:49.032
Heartbreak is a complex
psychological injury.

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:51.697
It impacts us in a multitude of ways.

00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:54.873
For example, Sharon was both very social

00:09:55.405 --> 00:09:56.787
and very active.

00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:59.401
She had dinners at the house every week.

00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:02.444
She and Miguel went on camping trips
with other couples.

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:04.361
Although Miguel was not religious,

00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:06.563
he accompanied Sharon
to church every Sunday,

00:10:06.587 --> 00:10:08.874
where he was welcomed
into the congregation.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.791
Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.001
he lost his entire social life,

00:10:15.025 --> 00:10:17.463
the supportive community
of Sharon's church.

00:10:17.487 --> 00:10:19.617
He lost his identity as a couple.

00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:24.721
Now, Miguel recognized the breakup
had left this huge void in his life,

00:10:24.745 --> 00:10:27.506
but what he failed to recognize

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.907
is that it left far more than just one.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.980
And that is crucial,

00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:37.476
not just because it explains
why heartbreak could be so devastating,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.655
but because it tells us how to heal.

00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:43.079
To fix your broken heart,

00:10:43.103 --> 00:10:46.962
you have to identify these voids
in your life and fill them,

00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:48.563
and I mean all of them.

00:10:48.587 --> 00:10:50.316
The voids in your identity:

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.988
you have to reestablish who you are
and what your life is about.

00:10:54.012 --> 00:10:55.724
The voids in your social life,

00:10:55.748 --> 00:10:58.824
the missing activities,
even the empty spaces on the wall

00:10:58.848 --> 00:11:00.438
where pictures used to hang.

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:03.135
But none of that will do any good

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:06.406
unless you prevent the mistakes
that can set you back,

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.406
the unnecessary searches for explanations,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.637
idealizing your ex instead of focusing
on how they were wrong for you,

00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:17.482
indulging thoughts and behaviors
that still give them a starring role

00:11:17.506 --> 00:11:19.117
in this next chapter of your life

00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:20.683
when they shouldn't be an extra.

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:24.867
Getting over heartbreak is hard,

00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:29.355
but if you refuse to be misled
by your mind and you take steps to heal,

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:32.054
you can significantly minimize
your suffering.

00:11:32.078 --> 00:11:34.498
And it won't just be you
who benefit from that.

00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:36.577
You'll be more present with your friends,

00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:38.815
more engaged with your family,

00:11:39.236 --> 00:11:43.039
not to mention the billions of dollars
of compromised productivity

00:11:43.063 --> 00:11:45.156
in the workplace that could be avoided.

00:11:46.451 --> 00:11:48.741
So if you know someone who is heartbroken,

00:11:49.273 --> 00:11:50.832
have compassion,

00:11:50.856 --> 00:11:54.606
because social support has been found
to be important for their recovery.

00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:56.551
And have patience,

00:11:57.082 --> 00:12:00.812
because it's going to take them longer
to move on than you think it should.

00:12:01.646 --> 00:12:02.874
And if you're hurting,

00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:04.915
know this:

00:12:05.335 --> 00:12:08.425
it's difficult, it is a battle
within your own mind,

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:10.649
and you have to be diligent to win.

00:12:10.673 --> 00:12:12.478
But you do have weapons.

00:12:12.502 --> 00:12:13.772
You can fight.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.856
And you will heal.

00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:17.820
Thank you.

00:12:17.844 --> 00:12:21.761
(Applause)
