00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:03.569
If they have plants, I would get
a couple of cacti,

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:04.971
which is plural for cactus.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.172
Sure, I knew that, yep.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.473
I didn't know that,
somebody corrected me.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:08.708
I was like back the (beep) up.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.243
Who corrected you with cacti?
I hate that person.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.444
A Dutch person, a Dutch person.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:12.678
Oh, god.
Europeans love to correct me.

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:13.913
Your husband's Dutch, right?

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:15.114
He is.
Gross.

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:16.449
I know, but his (beep)
tastes good.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:17.683
True, true.

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.018
He tasted Mile's (beep).
He knows what's up.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.020
What are you gonna do? We got
drunk, shit got out of hand.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:22.855
You never know what's
gonna happen with Mrs. Buteau.

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.223
That's true.
Just like these stale pretzels.

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:25.525
Absolutely.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.759
Just salty and filling.

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.661
Yep.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:31.964
What's up, everybody.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.067
Welcome to Stupid Questions

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.769 line:0%
I'm with Michelle Buteau,
actress, comedian.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.004 line:0%
Yes.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.139 line:0%
She's got a show called
Late Night Whenever.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.408
It's a dope cool podcast.
She hosts it.

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.843
I'm making check, I'm
making checks.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.078
What else you got?

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.380
I got titties.
I like Rose and humus.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:49.449
Is that you just lifting
my titties?

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.650
They are that heavy.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.151
They are, yes.
I haven't felt it,

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:53.519
but they look heavy.
They look nice.

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:54.821
Do you wan tot feel it?
Go ahead.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.022
Uh, is that-

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.223
It's okay. It's okay.
Just feel it.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.458
Are you telling me to do it?

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.659
Yes. Do it. Just feel it.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.360
Oh, wow. That is nice weight.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:03.096
They're heavy, yeah.

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:06.799 line:0%
If you could shower
in any breakfast drink,

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.067 line:0%
what would you shower in?

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.402 line:0%
Oh my God.
What would you say?

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:10.937 line:0%
Mimosas on my titties all day.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.438
Wow, interesting.
Are you serious?

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.773
You want to bathe
in that brunch shit.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.374
Oh, gets the party started.

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.444
Started. We got to go
to brunch together.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.347 line:0%
Here's a stupid question.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.851 line:0%
What's the strangest thing
you've ever bought or seen

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.586 line:0%
at a convenient store?

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.621
Oh my God, a convenience store?

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:29.922
Yeah.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.158
You know what? I'm so glad
you're asking me these
questions.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.761
I saw this
one convenience store.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.130
Where was it, like upstate New
York? Ok.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:41.767
It was a tampon that is
specifically made for alcohol.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.102
What do you mean?

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:45.472
What do you mean
specifically made for alcohol?

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.274
It was a alcoholic tampon.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.243
Oh, that's how you're
getting drunk?

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.745
Yeah, without your breath
stinking.

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:54.247
It's just for women
or it's for men?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.515
What do you mean?

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.150
Live your life, girl.
I don't know you.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.518
Wow, Christopher.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.320
I don't know flexible you is.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.055
That is weird. I've never seen
anything quite that weird

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:04.257
at a convenience store.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.192
Well, you weren't looking
for tampons.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.162 line:0%
If you could switch places

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.563 line:0%
with another comedian,
who would it be?

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:11.797 line:0%
Oh God.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.033
The first person that pops
into my mind was Joan Rivers.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.501
Yeah, that's a good one.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.136
Because when she had her
late night talk show

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.371
and everyone shitted on her,

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:23.242
I'd love to go back in time
and be like, "(beep)."

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.778
Also, like I watch
Whoopi Goldberg on The View.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:27.647
I don't know if she's high.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.948
I don't know
if she's wearing a bra.

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.284
I don't care.
She is so smart.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.119
I know that she has
a Japanese toilet.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.387
Interesting.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.423
I feel like if I had a Japanese
toilet cleaning my bum,

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:40.993
in all the right ways,
nooks and crannies and crevices,

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:42.495
I might be smarter too.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:43.729
I guess I could be Joy Behar

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:45.665
I sound like her.
We have the same voice.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.733
I would just put on a wig,
and then I'm Joy Behar.

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.035
Oh my God.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.236
Yeah.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.637
That's your drag alias.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.072
That's a good ...
That's a stupid ...

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:54.273
Drag questions.

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:55.841
I don't think it's stupid.
I think it's beautiful.

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:57.043
I think it's beautiful too.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.244
I'm just kidding.
I know.

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:00.079
I love a sorry broke white guy.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.450
Did you have a good time here,
Stupid Questions?

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:05.718
Is that a stupid question?

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.420
It can be stupid, but I'm just
looking for an honest response.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.688
No, I had fun. I had fun
You had fun?

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.423
No, I had so much fun.
It's nice hanging out with you

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:13.025
like not in the back of a
comedy club waiting to go on.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:15.361
Yeah, we got your stupid gift,
two stupid gifts.

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:16.996
Most people just give one,
but you got two.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.798
Are you talking about my tits?

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.200
Yes. First, this is
a bottle of Rose.

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:22.468
Oh my God.

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:23.736
Because we know
how much you love Rose.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.538
I love Rose.

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.075
And then, you always say "hay",
so there you go.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.409
It's cow hay.

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:31.811
This is so-

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.079
Hay.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.413
Authentic. Hay.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:36.682
Hay. That gift is for you.

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:40.052
Hay and Rose, and it rhymes.
See you later.

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:40.687
Bye.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.392
Is this real Rose?
