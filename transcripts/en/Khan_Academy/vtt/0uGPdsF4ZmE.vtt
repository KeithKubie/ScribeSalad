00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.560
- [Instructor] In order
for emperor penguin chicks

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.540
to survive the harsh
weather in Antarctica,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.330
its parents share the responsibilities

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.790
of incubating the eggs and traveling

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.480
to the ocean to gather food.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.180
Alright, so let's look at the its

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.590
right over here, its parents.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.730
So its

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.280
is this right over here,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.170
its is a singular possessive pronoun.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.170
Singular possessive pronoun

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.610
which is just a fancy way of saying

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.990
it's referring to one individual
thing possessing something.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.160
Now here, are we referring

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.480
to one individual thing
possessing something?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.860
Are we talking about one thing's parents?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.810
Well let's look over here.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.630
In order for emperor penguin chicks

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.620
emperor penguin chicks to survive

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.690
so we're talking about
many penguins' parents.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.750
So it doesn't make sense to have

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.110
singular possessive pronoun.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.930
The singular possessive
pronoun would make sense

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.600
if it said, in order for
an emperor penguin chick

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.230
to survive the harsh weather
in Antarctica, its parents.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.330
So if they're just
talking about one chick,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.970
but they're talking about many chicks

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.010
so we're going to need a plural.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.210
We're going to need a plural possessive

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.870
possessive pronoun

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.670
and the one we would use is their.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.900
So in order for emperor penguin chicks,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.400
so we're talking about many things,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.490
to survive the harsh
weather in Antarctica,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.360
their parents share,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.840
so this is going to be their

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.770
their parents share the
responsibilities of incubating

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.770
the eggs and traveling to
the ocean to gather food.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.690
So that's this choice right over here.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.960
So once again, we rule out this one

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.460
because that would be
if we're talking about

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.740
one penguin chick's parents.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.890
So we're talking about many
penguin chicks' parents.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.610
And so an it with an apostrophe S,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.840
you might be tempted to think

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.760
that this is possessive
and this would still,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.210
even if you're kind of confusing it

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.790
with its right over here,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.130
this one actually here is a contraction.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.620
So it apostrophe S is a contraction for

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.043
is a contraction for it is.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.440
And the way that I remember
is its is like his or her.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.550
Its, you wouldn't write his like that

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.620
you would write his or
you would write her.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.990
And its is just if
you're not trying to talk

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.930
about the gender of whatever
is possessing things.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.820
So her, his, its, in
any of these situations,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.470
you wouldn't have an apostrophe.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.140
It's with the apostrophe, that is it is.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.460
Now we already talked about their

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.170
as being a plural possessive pronoun

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.380
and the right answer here.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.010
And then you have there
which sounds exactly the same

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.450
but it is spelled T-H-E-R-E

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.500
and that one, you would say hey,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.460
I didn't go there.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.940
So it's a different
word, it sounds the same

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.520
but it's spelled differently
and it has a different meaning.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.170
And this is actually
an embarrassing mistake

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.020
that I've made many times on emails

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.120
when I'm typing real fast

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.670
is where I'll type,
I'll use this for this,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.100
I'll use this there for that their

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.200
or that their for this there.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.390
So always double check
your emails for that,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.470
I know it's a mistake that I've done

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.940
many times inadvertently.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.540
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed that.
