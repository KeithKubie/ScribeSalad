00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.630
JARED COLE: Whether you're
a product manager, a CMO,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.150
or a CEO, chances are
you're facing many

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.720
of the same problems every day.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.680
How do you find new users?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.560
How do you keep them?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.522
And how do you get them to
invest a little bit more?

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:17.230
I'm assuming that the
people in this room

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.810
know a fair amount
about this question.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.580
And I'm assuming a
fair number of you

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.530
also know that 50% of users find
new apps and games through word

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.670
of mouth from their friends
and from their family.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.340
And research tells
us that 50% of users

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.340
are more likely to engage
with an app over a long period

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.080
of time if they
can actually use it

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.870
with their friends and family.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.560
Yet more often than not,
we dedicate our resources,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.190
our time, and our
money to the other 50%

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.180
of users looking at
indicators and incentives that

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.745
are targeting individual users
taking individual actions.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.020
And why do we do this?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.620
The answer is pretty simple.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.490
It's easier to measure.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.600
And it's easier to understand.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.540
We know exactly how
long it takes somebody

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.150
to fulfill a specific
task within an app.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.770
We know exactly how
many people click

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.020
through the ad in the game.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.260
But these tend to be
lagging indicators.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.430
Markers of decisions
that we've already made.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.140
And so, clearly,
there's a gap here.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.660
We should be thinking about
the forward looking indicators.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.840
The decisions that help us
get to that other 50% of users

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.580
that are harder to measure.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.670
The ones that are motivated by
word of mouth to find new apps.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.880
The ones that have community and
relationship to drive long term

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.090
engagement.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.750
And so my name is Jared,
and with me as Sam.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.907
We're from Context Partners.

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:45.490
Those of you that
don't know us, we're

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.170
based in Portland, Oregon.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.770
We focus heavily on
insights and engagement

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.760
and have decades of experience
strengthening relationships,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.430
growing communities,
and building loyalty

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.020
for brands and causes.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.870
For this project, we
partnered with three

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.470
incredible organizations.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.230
Gameloft--

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.150
[MIC FEEDBACK]

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.522
Gameloft, Butterscotch
Shenanigans, and Freeletics.

00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:15.980
Three organizations
that understand

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.620
the value of relationships
and the power of community.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.860
We started by interviewing their
developers and their community

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.520
managers, trying to understand
what really is working for them

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.070
and what isn't from
their perspective.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.270
And then we spoke to their users
to understand what's actually

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.320
working and what's not.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.810
And to do this, we used a wide
variety of qualitative research

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.270
methodology, but
focused primarily

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.940
on surveys and interviews
to understand the role

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.560
that apps and games play
in their users lives.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.845
And this gave us a window into
how people were talking about

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:56.470
apps, how they were
recommending apps--

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.040
in person and through
text conversations--

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.870
as well as realizing
how they are using apps

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.780
with each other in person
and across long distances.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.460
And very quickly we realized
that not all word of mouth

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.630
is created equal.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.240
Not every relationship
leads to engagement.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.170
And through all of
these conversations,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.060
we heard the same refrain.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.300
People want more
human connection.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.443
Especially with people who
love the things that they love.

00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:26.610
And especially with people
who care about the things

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.580
that they care about.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.620
When people have these
kinds of connections,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.500
that's when you see word of
mouth driving to adoption.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.072
Is this is better?

00:03:40.072 --> 00:03:41.044
Thank you.

00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:53.510
Today, we're going to
look at how and why users

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.270
have these kinds of
connected experiences.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.060
We're going to look at how
developers create opportunities

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.545
for meaningful connection.

00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:02.330
And we're going to
encourage you to change

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.830
the way that you
think about the way

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.997
that you approach your work.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.720
Over the next 20
minutes or so, we're

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.812
going to introduce you
to three principles

00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:15.770
that we've seen to be
most effective in driving

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.350
towards connected experiences.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.240
Investigating
personal affinities

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.400
as clues to underlying values.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.340
Challenging users to
reach beyond themselves

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.150
to connect with others.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.570
And finally, creating
unexpected connections that

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.950
make experiences feel magical.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.893
And as you hear
these stories, I want

00:04:37.893 --> 00:04:39.310
you to continue
to think about how

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.230
to bring this back
to your own work,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.270
into your day-to-day life.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.000
Now I'm going to ask Sam to
share a few of the stories that

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.070
emerged over the course
of the research conducted

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.830
for this project.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.090
SAM FOULGER: Thank you, Jared.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.120
I'm so excited to speak with
you today about the things

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.510
that we learned from getting to
know these developers, users,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.170
and players.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.090
And, as you listen
to them, I want

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.552
you to be thinking about
the mindsets behind many

00:05:06.552 --> 00:05:08.260
of the stories that
you're going to hear,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.590
not just the specific tactics
that these developers used.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.240
Because over and over
we heard that you

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.370
need to design for your
specific communities

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.680
in their specific moments.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.680
So we have a lot to
get through today.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.430
Let's get started.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.400
On this first mindset, I want
you to think about something

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.570
that we all know.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.070
We all know that
we should be giving

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.960
our users what they want.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.300
If what they want is a
feeling of progression,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.557
we're going to deliver that
feeling of progression.

00:05:33.557 --> 00:05:35.390
If what they want are
high quality graphics,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.265
we're going to deliver
high quality graphics.

00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:39.130
And if what they
want is astronomy,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.440
we're going to give
them the stars.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.660
But the opportunity that
we saw was for developers

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.540
to look beyond just thinking
about what their users like

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.520
and using those affinities
as breadcrumb trails

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.650
that you can follow
to the deeper values

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.070
that your users will love
to build communities around.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.390
We heard from a user
of the Star Walk 2 app.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.803
This is an augmented reality
app for staring at the sky

00:05:58.803 --> 00:06:00.220
and learning about
constellations.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.677
And, clearly, this was a
user who loved the stars.

00:06:03.677 --> 00:06:05.260
But what we heard
from him was that he

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.427
was having these connected
experiences with the app.

00:06:07.427 --> 00:06:09.940
He was using it with his
father, with his uncle.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.860
They were tracking
celestial objects

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.330
across long distances
with each other.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.450
And what was driving that
connection wasn't just

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.557
an affinity for the stars,
it was the shared value

00:06:19.557 --> 00:06:20.140
that they had.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.810
The sense of wonder that you
get when you look up at the sky.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.620
And we saw the
same thing when we

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.740
spoke to users of Gameloft's
Dragon Mania Legends.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.140
This is Debbie and
her daughter Hannah.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.090
And Debbie told us that
she plays this game

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.870
because her daughter
recommended it to her.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.115
Debbie plays this game
because she loves dragons.

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:39.740
And so we kept talking
to Debbie and we

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.392
said, where does this love
of dragons come from, Debbie?

00:06:42.392 --> 00:06:43.850
And she said, well,
my whole family

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.710
loves mythological creatures.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.090
I raised my kids in the arts.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.548
I would take them to Renaissance
fairs when they were kids.

00:06:49.548 --> 00:06:52.910
I try to take them to the
limits of their imagination.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.800
So when Hannah recommended
this to Debbie,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.238
they weren't connecting over
that affinity for dragons.

00:06:57.238 --> 00:06:59.030
They were connecting
over that deeper value

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.710
of imagination and a family.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.230
And we saw this
over and over again

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.240
in the broader spectrum
of Android users

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.380
that we looked at.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.540
The people who want to
connect over calendar apps

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.490
want to connect over
the value of respect

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.440
when it comes to
other people's time.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.417
The people who choose body
weight apps over gym equipment

00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:17.750
want to connect with people
over the value of discipline

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.372
and making no excuses when
it comes to their health.

00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:22.580
And the couple who's tracking
their finances together

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.830
is connecting over the value
of commitment and saying,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.452
I'm committed to our future.

00:07:27.452 --> 00:07:29.910
But how did we know that these
users were expressing deeper

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.535
values and they
weren't just connecting

00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.180
over these affinities?

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.170
Well, for this part
of our research,

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.657
we sent dozens of Android
users out into the real world

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.240
to capture the
conversations they were

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.910
having around apps and games.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.660
They brought us into
their dinner parties,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.993
into their lunch breaks at
work, into their text message

00:07:44.993 --> 00:07:45.678
conversations.

00:07:45.678 --> 00:07:47.970
And what we saw is something
I think a lot of you know.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.292
People love to talk
about apps and games.

00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:52.500
They love to share apps and
games with their friends.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.450
But so many of
those conversations

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.700
don't lead to more
app adoption, don't

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.447
lead to ongoing engagement.

00:07:58.447 --> 00:07:59.780
And we wanted to figure out why.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.990
What we learned is that not all
word of mouth is created equal.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.270
We heard from users
of finance apps

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.868
like Mint and Chase Mobile.

00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:10.410
And these users would tell us,
I love recommending these apps

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.370
to my friends.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.240
I show them these
beautiful pie charts.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.593
I tell them about the
amazing typography.

00:08:15.593 --> 00:08:17.760
I try to tell them how easy
it is to use these apps.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.650
And yet, my friends
don't use them.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.330
Even when I go so
far as to install

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.610
the app on their phone
for them, they still

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.053
don't start using the app.

00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:27.970
But when we talk to users
who were successful,

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.980
who did get their friends
to start using apps,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.970
we heard something
very different.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.580
We heard from a
Mint user who said,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.747
I struggle with my finances.

00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:37.330
So I asked a friend
of mine who looked

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.659
like she had it all together.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.159
And I said, how do you do it?

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.070
How do you stay on
top of your money?

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.060
My friend told me,
it's hard for me too.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.580
I use Mint so I can see
how I'm spending my money

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.290
and try to do a little
bit better next month.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.232
It's hard for me too.

00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:54.690
These aren't two people who
are connecting over an affinity

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.265
for pie charts or typography.

00:08:56.265 --> 00:08:58.140
These are people connecting
over their deeper

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.030
values of control
and struggle when

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.155
it comes to their finances.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.233
So today is about mindsets.

00:09:05.233 --> 00:09:06.900
And what we want you
to think about here

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.840
is how to look beyond just
your users affinities.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.820
Take what they like
as the beginning

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.220
of the journey of learning
about the deeper values

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.020
that people love to
build communities around.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.710
This is work that's a lot more
fun to do than you might think.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.602
We do it a lot at
Context Partners.

00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:23.560
And if we think of it as
ethnographic research,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.480
or you think of it as
qualitative research studies,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.688
it can sound really daunting.

00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:28.260
But what we're
really talking about

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.620
is giving your users space to
tell you their stories, what

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.973
your app really means to them.

00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:34.890
And this will make your
decision making easier

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.630
because you'll know
which parts of your app

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.880
really connect to those
deeper values that are driving

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.380
your word of mouth engagement.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.950
Now today, what I
want you all to do

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.872
is think about a project
you're working on right now,

00:09:45.872 --> 00:09:47.330
a decision you're
facing, something

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.080
you're going to have a
meeting about tomorrow.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.790
And I want you to
plug that decision

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.960
into a series of questions.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.460
Here's our first one.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.160
And ask, will this feature
that I'm working on,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.660
this new app that
I'm developing,

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.090
this marketing campaign
that I'm putting together

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.663
connect with what's truly
meaningful to our users?

00:10:04.663 --> 00:10:06.080
Because answering
this question is

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.320
how you're going to appeal
to that 50% of users

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.820
who finds their apps and
games through word of mouth.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.280
This is how you're
going to appeal

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.702
to that 50% of users who will
be more engaged with apps

00:10:14.702 --> 00:10:16.660
that they can use with
their friends and family

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.243
because it's those
values that they're

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.492
going to be connecting over.

00:10:19.492 --> 00:10:21.700
And if you're having trouble
answering this question,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.890
it's a good time to take
a step back and learn

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.783
which of your users affinities
map to those deeper values.

00:10:27.783 --> 00:10:29.200
So this is the
first step as we're

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.450
building these bridges
of connected experience.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.250
First, we need to get
to know our users.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.680
And we recommend digging into
their personal affinities

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.520
to find their underlying values.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.353
Next, we need to get our
users outside of themselves.

00:10:40.353 --> 00:10:42.520
And one of the most effective
ways we saw developers

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.770
doing this is by
using challenges

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.190
to motivate their users
to reach out to others.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.290
To illustrate this,
I want you to think

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.000
about a moment in
your life when there's

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.708
something you desperately
wanted that was

00:10:53.708 --> 00:10:55.780
just out of your reach.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.870
Something that you just
couldn't quite get to alone.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.430
What did you do?

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.190
Did you give up?

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.482
Or did you reach out for help?

00:11:04.482 --> 00:11:06.440
I want you to think about
a moment in your life

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.690
when you truly accomplished
something great, something

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.240
that meant a lot to you
and it was really hard.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.580
What did you want
to do right after?

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.740
I know for me, I want to
tell other people about it.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.260
And not just anybody,
I want to tell

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.570
the people who understand, who
know what I've been through,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.680
who know what it's like.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.590
And that's what we heard from
so many of these Android users.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.630
In the stories they would tell
us about their favorite apps

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.588
and games, we heard these
stories of challenge,

00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:29.870
of struggle, of overcoming.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.590
Those were the best stories.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.680
The ones that made us
want to try new apps.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.075
Apps like Freeletics.

00:11:36.075 --> 00:11:38.450
In a lot of ways, Freeletics
is built around this concept

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.222
of challenge.

00:11:39.222 --> 00:11:41.180
They're company that
makes several health apps.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.222
And they're best known
for one that coaches users

00:11:43.222 --> 00:11:45.082
through bodyweight exercises.

00:11:45.082 --> 00:11:46.790
Over the past five
years, they've built--

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.760
not just a big user
base, 20 million users--

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.530
but an active user community.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.740
People who work out together in
public at Freeletics training

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.840
spots around the world.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.510
And what was so striking when we
spoke to these Freeletics users

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.220
was the pride in their voices.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.800
The passion they felt
about Freeletics.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.240
So much of that passion came
from how hard the workouts are.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.063
That's all we heard
from users like Elliot.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.480
I'll tell you right
now, Elliot is

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.720
a user you want if you
care about community.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.220
Because Elliot is
the kind of person

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.762
who shows up at
training spots and he

00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:18.980
welcomes new users warmly.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.590
It's important to him that
people have a great first time

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.180
at these training spots.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.430
He's the kind of user who
doesn't just buy the premium

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.130
subscription for himself, he
buys premium subscriptions

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.665
as gifts for his
friends and family.

00:12:30.665 --> 00:12:33.438
And when I asked Elliot,
this incredible user,

00:12:33.438 --> 00:12:35.480
what did you like about
Freeletics when you first

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.770
started using it?

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.050
This is what he told me.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.670
He really didn't.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.300
His exact words were, liked
isn't the word I would use.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.370
He said it was too intense.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.000
But at that moment in
his life, that intensity,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.400
that challenge was exactly
what he was looking for.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.500
Freeletics delivered it.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.660
And now this is what he says.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.780
The people I work out with are
the people I hang out with.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.790
He welcomes new users warmly.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.500
He buys premium subscriptions
for other people.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.548
Why?

00:13:06.548 --> 00:13:08.340
Because he wants other
people who know what

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.350
it's like, who've
experienced the challenge.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.998
And we heard this from every
Freeletics user we spoke to.

00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:14.790
They all want to be
around other people who

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.230
know what it means to train.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.360
Multiple people said, I
want to be around people

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.190
who remember the pain.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.753
How often do we think about
removing pain from our users?

00:13:23.753 --> 00:13:25.170
And these users
are telling you, I

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.653
want to be around other
people who remember the pain.

00:13:27.653 --> 00:13:29.070
Because it's that
pain that drives

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.720
them to reach out to others.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.960
And I know some of you are
probably thinking, well, yeah,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.115
this is a fitness app.

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.990
People want to be
challenged in fitness apps.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.410
But my users want
everything to be easy.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.953
And you're mostly right.

00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:43.620
When it comes to the
transactional parts

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.930
of your app, when it comes
to your login screen,

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.300
the navigation of your
UI, yes, make these things

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.410
as easy as possible.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.930
But when it comes to the
core experience of your app.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.760
The reason your users are there.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.190
That's the time
to challenge them.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.330
That's the time
not to say, well,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.380
that's fine for Freeletics.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.463
But to ask, what is the
Freeletics of finance look

00:14:00.463 --> 00:14:01.240
like?

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.330
What would drive the
most passionate Pinterest

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.390
or Memorize users to
get outside and make

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.032
their things with others?

00:14:09.032 --> 00:14:10.490
And obviously,
there's tons of room

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.870
to talk about this in games.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.750
So we talked to the
indie developers

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.948
at Butterscotch Shenanigans.

00:14:15.948 --> 00:14:17.990
These are the makers of
the hit game, Crashlands,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.640
and the forthcoming Levelhead.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.200
Obviously, a studio
who knows how to

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.550
connect with the
values of their users.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.280
And they told us about
a constant debate

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.090
when they're making games.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.090
Something that I'm sure
a lot of you have faced.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.920
How much information
should we give our users?

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.050
Should we tell them
everything they need to know?

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.200
Make things super easy but
risk some users leaving if this

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.570
is too boring, too obvious?

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.980
Or do we hide some things?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.110
Give our users that wonderful
feeling of challenge

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.110
and discovery, but we risk
losing some users if we make

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.980
it too difficult.
Well, for Crashlands,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.758
they lean towards
guiding the player.

00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:51.550
Through in-game
instructions like this one,

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.330
their players were never unclear
on exactly what the next step

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.330
in their game should be.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.040
They always knew
exactly what to do.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.820
But these guys
are experimenters.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.380
So they made one exception.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.650
This is the Mega Gong, the most
powerful weapon in the game.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.010
And I can see on your faces--

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.800
this is a fish sword you want.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.490
I can tell.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.080
And this was a fish sword
their users wanted too.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.290
So for this one, they made
things more difficult.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.540
They didn't give their
users all the information.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.350
They hid things.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.730
They made real challenges.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.230
Users were going
to have to complete

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.910
tasks that had about a 1
in 1,000 chance of success.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.390
And what do you think happened?

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.032
Did the users who
love this game leave?

00:15:28.032 --> 00:15:30.490
Throw up their hands and quit
because it was too difficult?

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.020
Just the opposite.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.628
This challenge is what
drove users to their forums.

00:15:35.628 --> 00:15:37.420
Inside the Butterscotch
Shenanigans forums,

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.130
you saw users posting
screenshots, coming together,

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.430
trying to solve this together,
strategizing with each other.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.430
This was a single player game.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.400
And this weapon, this
challenge, became

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.980
what brought users together.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.990
So what would your
users work for?

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.700
What's the awesome
fish sword they're

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.670
waiting for you to build?

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.290
Now, today is about
mindsets, again.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.100
And this one can take a
little bit of a mindset shift

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.870
for some of us
because challenges

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.160
can be counterintuitive.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.652
We all want to make things
that are easy to use.

00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:11.110
We want to make those slippery
sales funnels that our users

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.630
can slide right down.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.530
And when it comes to
the transactional parts

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.930
of our apps, we
absolutely should.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.150
But again, when it comes
to the challenge, when

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.375
it comes to the core
experience of your app,

00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:22.750
this is the time
to think about--

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.360
what will my users
reach out to others for?

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.180
What will they really work for?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.290
Think about the best
stories you hear

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.540
and the best stories you tell.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.168
The things you keep
telling around your office.

00:16:34.168 --> 00:16:36.460
I'm betting that these aren't
the stories of everything

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.720
coming easily.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.190
Of everything working out.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.560
Of you always knowing
exactly what to do.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.510
The best stories are
full of challenge.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.160
And your users want it too.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.580
So let's think again about this
decision we're facing tomorrow.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.870
This project we're working on.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.330
And now, let's
ask this question.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.373
Will this inspire our users to
stretch beyond their limits?

00:16:56.373 --> 00:16:57.790
Because answering
this question is

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.610
how we're going to get, again,
to that 50% of users who'll

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.560
be more engaged with apps that
they can use with their friends

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.140
and family.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.165
This is how you'll
get them to reach out.

00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:07.540
This is how you're going to
connect with the 2/3 of users

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.920
who say they'll be
more engaged with apps

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.810
that they feel an
emotional connection to.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.810
You're going to create
that emotional connection

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.130
by genuinely challenging them.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.135
So as we're continuing
to build these bridges

00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:19.760
of connected
experiences-- we've talked

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.560
about how to get to
know our users better.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.102
We've talked now about how to
use challenges to motivate them

00:17:24.102 --> 00:17:25.890
to reach outside of themselves.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.453
Now let's talk about how
to bring them together.

00:17:28.453 --> 00:17:30.870
Because we said at the beginning
that your users have this

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.545
desire for connection.

00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:34.170
They want to be around
other people who

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.900
love the things that they
love, who care about the things

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.400
they care about.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.340
But so often what we're
pushing our users towards

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.282
are individual actions.

00:17:43.282 --> 00:17:45.240
We're tracking the things
that individual users

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.630
do to meet metrics that
individual users can meet.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.200
It's like we're a bookstore
and our only KPI is, did we

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.790
sell one book to one person?

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.560
Did one person buy one book
and they got out of here?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.060
Great.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.570
Success.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.730
That's fine.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.595
But it's awfully limiting.

00:18:01.595 --> 00:18:03.220
Because the opportunity
that bookstores

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.080
have is to create
the kind of space

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.265
for unexpected connections that
truly make experiences magical.

00:18:09.265 --> 00:18:11.140
That feeling that your
customers, your users,

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.700
can have when they can
say, I came here for this,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.750
but I found that.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.500
Sociologists have known about
this effect for decades.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.000
They tell us that one of the
keys to developing friendships,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.910
to developing relationships,
is to have repeated

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.830
unplanned interactions.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.358
Repeated unplanned interactions.

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.900
It's the way that you just bump
into people in the bookstore,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.580
in the coffee shop.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.660
What we found in our
research is that this is not

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.910
limited to the physical world.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.490
Your apps and games
can do it too.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.305
I spoke to a user of
the game Dice Duel.

00:18:41.305 --> 00:18:43.180
I don't know if they're
in the house tonight.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.110
But this is Dice Duel.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.970
This is a game for
virtually playing dice.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.680
And she told me about how I
recommended this app to my dad

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.275
because I had played dice games
with him when I was a kid.

00:18:53.275 --> 00:18:54.400
I thought he would like it.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.030
She was right.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.870
He loved it.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.150
What happened next
she was not expecting.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.760
She said, this is a guy who
won't check his text messages,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.230
who won't use WhatsApp.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.440
But inside of Dice Duel,
we are having the kinds

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.508
of repeated unplanned
interactions that are

00:19:07.508 --> 00:19:08.800
strengthening our relationship.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.148
I can always find him there.

00:19:12.148 --> 00:19:14.440
And when I tell that story,
people often tell me, well,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.652
that's just luck.

00:19:15.652 --> 00:19:17.860
Some of our users are always
going to find connection

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860
around our apps and games.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.152
We don't need to design for it.

00:19:20.152 --> 00:19:22.180
We can't even design for it.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.220
And I'm telling you
that it's not luck.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.800
Bookstores and coffee shops
are designed experiences.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.300
When you spend time
in them, you can

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.340
see how they're designed
to send traffic in ways

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.745
that put people together.

00:19:31.745 --> 00:19:34.120
Many of you probably know the
story of the Pixar building

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.578
that is designed to bring people
from different departments

00:19:36.578 --> 00:19:38.768
together in unexpected
and unplanned ways

00:19:38.768 --> 00:19:40.810
because they knew that it
was those moments where

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.120
the real magical ideas
were going to come from.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.280
Your apps and games
can do the same thing.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.030
Let's take a look at
how Gameloft does it.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.780
Again, inside of
Dragon Mania Legends.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.910
This is Neena.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.610
And Neena told me that like
so many Dragon Mania Legends

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.280
players, she came
for the dragons.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.402
But what she found was
something very different.

00:19:59.402 --> 00:20:01.360
She said she'd been
playing for a little while.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.650
She was getting bored.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.113
And she decided to
join an in-game clan.

00:20:05.113 --> 00:20:07.030
For anyone who doesn't
know, clans and leagues

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.580
inside of games are like
teams where 20 people work

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.250
together, share resources,
strategize, compete

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:13.850
against other teams.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.732
And the team that Neena
joined was very intense.

00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:18.190
This is a group of
people that vets

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.738
new users to make sure they
can stay committed to the game.

00:20:20.738 --> 00:20:22.405
They want people from
all over the world

00:20:22.405 --> 00:20:25.480
so that someone can be grinding
24 hours inside the game.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.638
And they formed
a real community.

00:20:27.638 --> 00:20:29.680
They maintain a separate
Facebook Messenger group

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.763
where they share pictures
of each other's puppies,

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.310
and keep up with
each other's lives,

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.530
and get each other excited about
what's coming next in the game.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.100
This was not what
Neena came for.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.720
Neena came for the dragons.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.078
She found a real community of
people who love what she loves,

00:20:44.078 --> 00:20:45.370
who cares what she cares about.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.420
And it wasn't luck.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.740
It wasn't coincidence.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.800
Gameloft designed
this space for her.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.390
I'm going to tell you about
two decisions they made.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.470
One, inside of this team, there
is an in-game chat window,

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.220
so people can communicate
with each other.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.400
That one might seem obvious.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.942
But I've seen a lot
of apps and games

00:20:59.942 --> 00:21:02.140
now that try to appeal
to the idea of teams.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.580
And they tell a bunch of users,
you are all on a team now.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.690
But there is no way for them
to interact with each other.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.530
Or they put users
into multiplayer modes

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.588
where they play a bunch
of random people one time

00:21:10.588 --> 00:21:12.130
and leave wondering
if they were even

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.510
playing against real people.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.150
That chat window is how Neena
is able to have those repeated

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.610
unplanned connections
with those people grinding

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.070
inside the game 24 hours a day.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.140
Gameloft also makes it
really easy for people

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.870
to not just join these
teams, but to leave them.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.270
Because we're talking about
sub-communities of players.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.228
Very specific cultures.

00:21:29.228 --> 00:21:31.145
There's a good chance
you're not going to join

00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:32.380
the one you want right away.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.630
They make it easy to
leave and try another one.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.748
Gameloft is designing
this experience.

00:21:36.748 --> 00:21:38.290
And players like
Neena are filling it

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.690
with that magical
feeling of connection.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.300
So again, today
is about mindsets.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.220
And what we're asking
you to do with this one

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.600
is to think beyond individual
users taking individual actions

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.585
that you can easily measure
with individual metrics,

00:21:51.585 --> 00:21:52.960
and think about
how you can drive

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.210
towards deeper connections.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.040
Real meaningful storytelling.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.110
The kind of thing that's
going to drive long term

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.220
engagement with your apps.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.500
Because let's look at the
users we've talked about.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.540
Neena was getting bored.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.710
The community is who
she plays for now.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.555
If we go back to
Elliot and Freeletics,

00:22:08.555 --> 00:22:10.180
Elliot told me he
downloaded Freeletics

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.920
so he could work out alone.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.050
Now that community is
who he plays for now.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.710
Neena and Elliot have both been
daily active users for years.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.040
These developers are solving
problems that all of you face.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.600
How do we keep long term
interest for our users?

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.840
How do we keep
subscriptions going?

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.710
How do we create surprise, and
delight, and novelty for them?

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.440
Well, think about where you find
those things in your own life.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.360
You find it in the bookstore
and in the coffee shop

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.100
when you keep running
into your friends.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.990
Maybe you find it on an
airplane when you strike up

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.365
a great conversation
with someone

00:22:39.365 --> 00:22:41.770
who just happens to have
the same backpack as you.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.140
Maybe it's at a conference
where you come to learn more

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.610
about your industry
but you leave

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.037
thinking about all the
new friends you've made.

00:22:48.037 --> 00:22:49.870
Each one of these things
can feel like luck,

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.040
can feel like coincidence.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.150
But they're all
designed experiences.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.365
And you can design
those experiences too

00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:56.740
by taking a look
at that decision

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.573
that you're facing right
now and plugging it

00:22:58.573 --> 00:22:59.920
into this question--

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.960
which is, will this move
us towards a culture

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.360
where relationships thrive?

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.430
Are we creating the
spaces for the kinds

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.735
of unexpected connections that
make experiences truly magical?

00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:11.110
Because this,
again, is how we're

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.093
going to get to
that 50% of users

00:23:13.093 --> 00:23:15.260
who find their apps and
games through word of mouth.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.390
The 50% of users who'll
be more engaged with apps

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.390
that they can use with
their friends and family.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.640
Answering this question
will do that for us.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.837
So at Context Partners,
we had such a great time

00:23:26.837 --> 00:23:28.670
getting to know these
developers, and users,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.240
and players.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.460
We had so many ideas
and stories that we've

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.170
been kicking around
that have really

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.550
re-inspired and reinvigorated
us in our own work.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.050
And I hope these
three mindsets have

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.280
done the same thing for you.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.280
We've talked about getting
to know your users better

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.655
by using personal affinities
to dig into their underlying

00:23:42.655 --> 00:23:45.890
values, how to use challenges
to motivate them to reach out

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.040
to others, and how unexpected
connections can truly

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.870
make experiences magical.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.110
I'll bring Jared back up now.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.440
JARED COLE: Thank you, Sam.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.350
So we've been talking
a lot about bridges

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.420
and connecting people.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.630
And it's through these
moments that you really

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:08.810
start to see things happen.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.420
Once you realize that
you're not the only one that

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.640
loves this app or feels
this way about the game.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.985
These are the experiences
that drive community.

00:24:21.985 --> 00:24:23.610
Experiences like the
one that we're all

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.260
having now, where
you can connect

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.530
with the people around you
over the idea of connecting

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.695
with people is a
task worth taking on.

00:24:31.695 --> 00:24:34.070
And so what should you do
after you leave the room today?

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.790
Bring back mindsets,
not tactics.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.640
Think about how you can bring
these into your work every day.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.370
We've introduced the
questions about how

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.250
to create those spaces to
inspire people to reach

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.720
beyond themselves, and asking
if this is the kind of work that

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.480
will move toward those places
where relationships can really

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.800
thrive.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.820
And as you do that, I want to
leave you with one question.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.640
Where will I build
bridges today?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.490
Thank you.
