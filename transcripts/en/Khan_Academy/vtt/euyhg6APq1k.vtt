00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.136
- [Voiceover] A total of 29.95 milliliters

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.492
of 1.25 molar hydrochloric
acid is required to reach

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:08.871
the equivalence point.

00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:12.612
Calculate the concentration
of potassium sorbate,

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.016
we put the brackets, so we're
talking about concentration,

00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:17.552
in the stock solution.

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:18.683
So let's juts remind ourselves

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:21.662
what the equivalence point is.

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:25.356
The equivalence point
is the point at which

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:29.362
all of the potassium sorbate has reacted

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.582
with the acid, with the titrate.

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:36.484
So, we have just gotten
to the right-hand side

00:00:36.484 --> 00:00:38.538
of this net ionic equation.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.213
So, another way to think about it is,

00:00:40.213 --> 00:00:43.131
it's the point in which,
because we are reacting,

00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.933
for every mole of the potassium sorbate

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.037
that we want to turn into sorbic acid,

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:53.849
we're adding a mole of
the hydrochloric acid.

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:56.010
So, one way to think about
the equivalence point

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.722
is if I've added a certain number of moles

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:00.894
of hydrochloric acid,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.228
that must the exact number of moles

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:06.084
of the potassium sorbate
that we started out with.

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:08.603
We've added the exact number of molecules

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:10.874
of hydrochloric acid as they originally

00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:12.737
were of potassium sorbate,

00:01:12.737 --> 00:01:16.149
so they can completely
cancel out with each other.

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.595
So if we can figure out
the number of moles,

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:20.341
if we can figure out the number of moles

00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:22.278
of hydrochloric acid here,

00:01:22.278 --> 00:01:24.608
then we could say, "Well,
the equivalence point",

00:01:24.608 --> 00:01:26.909
or if you needed that number of moles

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.580
of hydrochloric acid to
reach the equivalent point,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.673
then that means your
original stock solution

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:34.748
had that many moles of potassium sorbate,

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:37.144
and then we can use that to calculate

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:38.765
the actual concentration.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.743
So let's do the first part,

00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:42.869
let's think about how many
moles of hydrochloric acid,

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.894
this is right over here,

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:48.614
so I'll just write HCl,

00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:50.992
and so, if we have

00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:55.252
29.95

00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:57.022
milliliters,

00:01:57.022 --> 00:01:59.321
and let's just convert it into liters,

00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:00.157
because if we have,

00:02:00.157 --> 00:02:04.533
if our concentration is
given in terms of molarity,

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.298
this is moles per liter,

00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:08.229
so let's make sure we get our units right,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.865
so let's multiply this times,

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:11.711
so we wanna convert this to liters,

00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:13.914
so we want liters in the numerator,

00:02:13.914 --> 00:02:16.155
and milliliters in the
denominator, so these cancel out,

00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:19.545
so one liter's equal to 1000 milliliters,

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:20.238
and that makes sense,

00:02:20.238 --> 00:02:21.794
if you wanna go from
milliliters to liters,

00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:25.601
you would multiply by
1000, or divide by 1000.

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:28.574
So this would give us the total amount

00:02:28.574 --> 00:02:33.574
of hydrochloric acid solution
we've added in liters,

00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:35.900
and now let's figure out
how many moles that will be.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.737
Well, we multiply that times the molarity,

00:02:38.737 --> 00:02:41.822
times 1.25,

00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:44.746
instead of writing molar capital M,

00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:49.612
I'm gonna write 1.25 moles per liter,

00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:52.049
and what is this going to give us?

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.325
Well, let me get my calculator out,

00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:59.396
and so, I'm gonna have 29.95

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:03.807
divided by 1000, (mumbling) right there,

00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:05.540
times 1.25,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.551
times 1.25 is equal to,

00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.379
and let's see,

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.586
I have three significant
figures here, four over here,

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:15.708
so the product, I'm gonna have three,

00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:19.484
so 0.0374,

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:25.000
0.0374,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.317
and the unit is all work out,

00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:27.680
milliliters cancels out with milliliters,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.631
liters cancel out with liters,

00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:34.046
and I have 0.0374 moles,

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:37.026
and remember this is moles
of hydrochloric acid,

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:40.625
so when they say that a
total of 29.95 milliliters

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:44.965
of 1.25 molar solution of
hydrochloric acid is added,

00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:49.088
they really added this many
moles of hydrochloric acid.

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:51.308
So, that means our original solution had

00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:55.367
that many moles of

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:56.897
potassium sorbate.

00:03:56.897 --> 00:03:59.190
So it had that many moles
of potassium sorbate,

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.427
we can now figure out the
original concentration

00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:02.971
of potassium sorbate.

00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:06.766
The concentration of our potassium sorbate

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:12.312
C6H7O2

00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:15.450
is going to be equal
to the number of moles

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.814
of potassium sorbate our stock
solution starts off with,

00:04:18.814 --> 00:04:21.767
so that's going to be the
same number right over here,

00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:26.363
0.0374

00:04:26.363 --> 00:04:30.547
moles divided by

00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:35.090
what was our original volume
of our original solution?

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.267
Let's see.

00:04:36.267 --> 00:04:39.472
A student titrates 45.00,

00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:40.714
so we have four significant figures here,

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:45.466
a student titrates 45 milliliters
of the stock solution.

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:47.228
So the stock solution originally

00:04:47.228 --> 00:04:51.443
has a volume of 45 milliliters.

00:04:51.443 --> 00:04:52.672
So 45 milliliters,

00:04:52.672 --> 00:04:54.564
if we wanted to write
that in terms of liters,

00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:56.608
remember, the concentration,
the molarity here,

00:04:56.608 --> 00:05:01.143
we wanted it in terms of mole per liter,

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:04.035
45 milliliters is the same thing as

00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:08.851
0.045,

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:10.801
I can write zero there

00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:12.894
so that I have four
significant figures here,

00:05:12.894 --> 00:05:15.174
liters of solution,

00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:17.016
and what is this going to be equal to,

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.463
and I just divided this by 1000,

00:05:19.463 --> 00:05:24.463
45 milliliters is the same thing
as 45 thousands of a liter.

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.042
And so, what do we have?

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:29.457
We'll take that number we just had,

00:05:29.457 --> 00:05:32.036
and then we divided it by

00:05:32.036 --> 00:05:34.896
.045,

00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:36.239
and I can add two more zeros there,

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:37.695
but form the calculator point of view

00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:39.065
it doesn't make a difference,

00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:41.346
and that's going to be equal to,

00:05:41.346 --> 00:05:43.360
all right, how many
significant figures do we have?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.198
We have three significant figures,

00:05:45.198 --> 00:05:49.153
so 0.832,

00:05:49.153 --> 00:05:51.363
0.832,

00:05:52.383 --> 00:05:56.931
0.832

00:05:56.931 --> 00:05:58.161
moles per liter,

00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:02.644
or we could say 0.832 molar,
did I write that right?

00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:07.823
Yeah, 832, and there you have it,

00:06:07.823 --> 00:06:12.094
that's the initial concentration
of the potassium sorbate

00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:14.348
in our stock solution.
