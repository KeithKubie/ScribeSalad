00:00:00.123 --> 00:00:02.286
There is a famous quote from Steve Jobs,

00:00:02.286 --> 00:00:04.965
where he talks about computers as bicycles for the mind.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:07.889
He said that back in 1990,

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.704
today we have about a 100,000 times as much computing power

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:12.059
as people had back then,

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.079
so we should really think about computers as the interstellar spaceships for the mind.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.223
This is pretty amazing. You have in your pocket more computing power

00:00:19.223 --> 00:00:22.922
then the most powerful governments in the world had access to 20 years ago.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:26.237
But what is really great about computing is that computers are universal machines.

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:29.721
This means that you can program them to do just about anything.

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:33.837
We will do this by looking at something most people use every day - a web search engine.

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:37.455
You are not expected to have any previous programming experience entering the class,

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:41.518
but by the end of the class you will understand the big ideas that power a search engine,

00:00:41.518 --> 00:00:44.725
as well as how to read and write your own computer programs.

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:47.717
I hope you will join us and enjoy the ride!
