00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.190
If someone in a position of authority told
you to like, stop walking on the grass, you

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.050
would stop walking on the grass, right? And
if they told you to help someone's grandma

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.210
cross the street, or pick up your dog's poop,
or put your shoes on before you go into a

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.160
store, you'd probably comply.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.790
But what if they ordered you to physically
hurt another person? You're probably thinking

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.430
"No way! I could never do something like that."
But there's a good chance you're wrong.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.660
In the early 1960s, Yale University psychologist
Stanley Milgram began what would become one

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.560
of social psychology's most famed and chilling
experiments.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.060
Milgram began his work during the widely publicized
trial of World War II Nazi war criminal Adolf

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.870
Eichmann. Eichmann's defense, along with other
Nazis', for sending millions of people to

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.579
their deaths, was that he was simply following
the orders of his superiors. And while that

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.079
may have been true, it didn't fly in court
and Eichmann was ultimately executed for his

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.000
crimes. But the question got Milgram to thinking,
what might the average person be capable of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.409
when under orders?

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.900
So, for his initial experiment, Milgram recruited
forty male volunteers using newspaper ads.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.320
He built a phony "shock generator" with a
scale of thirty switches that could supposedly

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.320
deliver shocks in increments from 30 volts
up to 450 volts, labeled with terms like "slight

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.440
shock" to "dangerous shock" up to simply "XXX."
He then paired each volunteer participant

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.390
with someone who was also apparently a participant,
but was in fact one of Milgram's colleagues,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.909
posing as a research subject. He had them
draw straws to see who would be the "learner"

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.710
and who would be the "teacher." The volunteers
didn't realize that the draw was fixed so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.420
that they'd always be the teacher, while Milgram's
buddy would be the learner. So the fake learner

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.240
was put into a room, strapped to a chair,
and wired up with electrodes. The teacher,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.510
the person who was being studied, and a researcher
who was played by an actor, went into another

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.290
room with a shock generator that the teacher
had no idea was fake.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.920
The learner was asked to memorize a list of word
pairs, and the participant was told that he'd

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.990
be testing the learner's recall of those words
and should administer an electric shock for

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.249
every wrong answer, increasing the shock level a
little bit each time. From here, the pretend learner

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:16.459
purposely gave mainly wrong answers, eliciting
shocks from the participant. If a participant

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.709
hesitated, perhaps swayed by the learner's
yelps of pain, the researcher gave orders

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.239
to make sure he continued. These orders were
delivered in a series of four prods.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.379
The first was just "Please continue," and
if the participant didn't comply, the researcher

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.650
issued other prods until he did. He'd say
"The experiment requires you to continue"

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.180
and then "It's absolutely essential that you continue"
and finally "You have no choice but to continue."

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.059
Even Milgram was surprised by the first round
of experiments. About two-thirds of the participants

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:52.639
ended up delivering the maximum 450 volt shock.
All of the volunteers continued to at least

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.249
300 volts. Over years, Milgram kept conducting
this experiment, changing the situation in

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.719
different ways to see if it had any effect
on people's obedience. What he repeatedly

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.109
found was that obedience was highest when
the person giving the orders was nearby and

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.359
was perceived as an authority figure, especially
if they were from a prestigious institution.

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.269
This was also true if the victim was depersonalized,
or placed at a distance such as in another

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.120
room. Plus, subjects were more likely to comply
with the orders if they didn't see anyone

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.319
else disobeying, if there were no role models
of defiance.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.129
In the end, Milgram's path-breaking work sheds
some seriously harsh light on the enormous

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.109
power of two of the key cornerstone topics of social
psychology: social influence and 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.680
We all conform to some sort of social norms,
like following traffic laws or even obeying

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.779
the dress codes for different roles and environments.
When we know how to act in a certain group

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:45.939
or setting, life just seems to go more smoothly.
Some of this conformity is non-conscious automatic

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.749
mimicry, like how you're likely to laugh if
you see someone else laughing or nod your

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:53.449
head when they're nodding. In this way, group
behavior can be contagious.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:58.349
But overall, conformity describes how we adjust
our behavior or thinking to follow the behavior

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.900
or rules of the group we belong to. Social
psychologists have always been curious about

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.419
the degree to which a person might follow
or rebel against their group's social norms.

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:13.010
During the early 1950s, Polish-American psychologist
Solomon Ash expressed the power of conformity

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.120
through a simple test.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.720
In this experiment, the volunteer is told
that they're participating in a study on visual

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.790
perception and is seated at a table with five
other people. The experimenter shows the group

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.280
a picture of a standard line and three comparison
lines of various lengths, and then asked the

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.870
people to say which of the three lines matches
the comparison line. It's clear to anyone

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.560
with any kind of good vision that the second
line is the right answer, but the thing is,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.820
most, if not all of the other people in the
group start choosing the wrong line. The participant

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.400
doesn't know that those other people are all actors,
a common deception used in social-psychological

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.740
research, and they're intentionally giving
the wrong answer. This causes the real participant

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.510
to struggle with trusting their own eyes or
going with the group.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.700
In the end most subjects still gave what they
knew was the correct answer, but more than

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.760
a third were essentially just willing to give
the wrong answer to mesh with the group. Ash,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.780
and subsequent researchers, found that people
are more likely to conform to a group if they're

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.760
made to feel incompetent or insecure and are
in a group of three or more people, especially

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.290
if all those people agree. It also certainly
doesn't hurt if the person admires the group

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.640
because of maybe their status or their attractiveness,
and if they feel that others are watching their behavior.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.070
We also tend to conform more if we're from
a culture that puts particular emphasis on

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.900
respect for social standards. This might sound
a little bit familiar, like, all of high school,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.160
fraternities or sororities, the big company you work for,
or any other group that you've ever been a part of.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.830
The classic experiments of Milgram and Ash
showed us that people conform for lots of

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.740
different reasons, but they both underscored
the power of situation in conformity - whether

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.500
that situation elicits respect for authority,
fear of being different, fear of rejection,

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.080
or simply a desire for approval. This is known
as normative social influence, the idea that

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.280
we comply in order to fuel our need to be
liked or belong.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.530
But, of course, groups influence our behavior
in more ways than just conformity and obedience.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.940
For example, we may perform better or worse
in front of a group. This is called social

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.150
facilitation and it's what might, say, help
you sprint the last hundred meters of a race

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.420
if people are cheering you on, but it's also
what can make you nervous enough to forget

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.080
the words to that poetry you were supposed
to be slamming in front of a crowd.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.070
But that's what can happen in front of a group,
what happens when you're actually part of

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.310
a group? Do you work harder or start slacking?
One study found that if you blindfold students,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.010
hand them a rope and tell them to pull as
hard as they can in a game of tug-of-war,

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.140
the subjects will put in less work if they
think they're part of the team instead of

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.790
pulling by themselves. About 20% less, it
turns out. This tendency to exert less effort

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.920
when you're not individually accountable is
called social loafing. That's pretty good.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.480
You can now add the word "loafing" to your
scientific vocabulary.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.840
But a group's ability to either arouse or
lessen our feelings of personal responsibility

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.370
can make us do more dangerous things than
just phone in some group homework assignment.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.630
It can also lead to deindividuation, the loss
of self-awareness and restraint that can occur

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.040
in group situations. Being part of a crowd
can create a powerful combination of arousal

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.230
and anonymity; it's part of what fuels riots
and lynch mobs and online trolling. The less

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.889
individual we feel, the more we're at the
mercy of the experience of our group, whether

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:21.070
it's good or bad.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.210
And it should come as no surprise that the
attitudes and beliefs we bring to a group

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.350
grow stronger when we talk with others who
share them. This is a process psychologists

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:34.140
know as group polarization, and it often translates
into a nasty "us" vs "them" dynamic.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.500
And you know what is great at polarizing groups?
The internet. The internet has made it easier

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.870
than ever to connect like-minded people and
magnify their inclinations. This can of course

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.840
breed haters, like racists may become more
racist in the absence of conflicting viewpoints,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.690
but it can, and often does, work for good,
promoting education, crowd-sourcing things

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.930
like fundraising, and organizing people to
fight all kinds of worldsuck.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.370
And group dynamics can not only affect our
personal decisions, they can also influence

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.380
really big decisions on a larger, even national
scale. Groupthink is a term coined by social

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.960
psychologist Irving Janis, to describe what
happens when a group makes bad decisions because

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.730
they're too caught up in the unique internal
logic of their group. When a group gets wrapped

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.590
up in itself and everyone agrees with each
other, no one stops to think about other perspectives.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:28.460
As a result, you get some big and bad ideas,
including some enormous historical fiascoes,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.990
like the Watergate cover-up and the Bay of
Pigs invasion and the Chernobyl nuclear reactor

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.889
accident. So while two heads may often be
better than one, it's important to make sure

00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:41.490
those heads are still open to different opinions
or they could do some really dumb stuff.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.290
In the end, it's best to understand ourselves
and our decisions as informed simultaneously

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:52.170
by both individual and group factors, personality,
and situation. And don't get too freaked out

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.819
about what people are capable of; I mean,
just think back to Milgram's experiment. For

00:08:55.819 --> 00:09:00.149
the two-thirds of us who would shock someone
to death in the right circumstance, there's

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:06.409
another third who wouldn't, reminding us that while
group behavior is powerful, so is individual choice.

00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:11.340
Today you learned about the power of social
influence, conformity, and authority. We looked

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:16.939
at the shocking results of the famous Milgram
experiment, the concept of automatic mimicry,

00:09:16.939 --> 00:09:21.970
and how Solomon Ash proved the power of conformity
in situation. You also learned how normative

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.709
social influence sways us, how social facilitation
can make or break your performance and how

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:32.759
social loafing makes people lazy in a group.
And finally, we discussed how harmful deindividuation,

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:35.069
group polarization, and groupthink can be.
