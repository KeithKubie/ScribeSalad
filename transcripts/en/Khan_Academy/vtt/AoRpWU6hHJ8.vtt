00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.470
When people use the terms
"fascism" or "fascist"

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.810
today, they're usually
using it in a derogatory way

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.490
to refer to a group, a regime,
or even an individual that

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.710
is overly aggressive, and
controlling, and totalitarian.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.110
But its roots, actually,
lie with Benito Mussolini,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.640
who was in power in Italy
during the 1920s, and 1930s,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.140
and through World War II.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.640
And they proudly call themselves
the Fascists and their ideology

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.500
as fascism.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.880
And the root of
fascist and fascism

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.160
come from the Italian
word "fascio,"

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.030
which literally
refers to a bundle.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.770
It comes out of this idea
that a bundle of things

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.710
will be stronger together
than individually.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.590
And this is actually
the symbol for fascism.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.360
And this symbol of this bundle,
this sheath of sticks, this

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
actually predates Mussolini
by thousands of years.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.140
It goes back to Roman times.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.459
And even, based on some
of the things I've read,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.790
even predates Roman
times as a symbol

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.540
of unity, a symbol
of official strength.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.040
And even before
Mussolini came around,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.670
the term was used by many,
many, many groups that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.210
viewed themselves as a
league of revolutionaries.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.540
A group of people somehow
fighting for change.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.260
And Mussolini was no different.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.280
When in the end of 1914
and then in early 1915,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.010
he establishes the Fasci
d'Azione Rivoluzionaria.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.810
And I'm, once again, so
sorry for my butchering

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.430
of an Italian word.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.830
But this literally translates
to group action revolutionary,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.600
or you could say the
revolutionary action

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.140
group, founded by
Mussolini in 1915.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.310
And it was really a splinter
of the Socialist Party.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.480
Well, there's an irony there
because Mussolini and fascism,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.860
in particular, is associated
with strongly anti-socialist

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.100
ideology.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.740
But as Europe was entering
into World War I in 1914,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.650
some of the mainstream of
the Italian Socialist Party

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.170
was against Italy
entering the war.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.732
They wanted Italy to
maintain their neutrality.

00:02:25.732 --> 00:02:27.940
But you had splinter groups,
more nationalist groups,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.020
that said, hey, look,
this is Italy's chance

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.690
to claim its right.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.000
It should join the war on
the side of the Entente.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.860
And Mussolini was one
of these individuals.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.540
And because of his
strong pro-war stance,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.010
he was actually
kicked out of his--

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.510
he was head of a
socialist paper in 1914.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.680
And then he eventually, by 1915,
establishes the Fasci d'Azione

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.750
Rivoluzionaria.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.220
And by the end of World
War I, as we get into 1919,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.890
it regroups under the name
Fasci Italiani di Combattimento.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.730
So this literally translates
as, you could view Fasci

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.770
as a group, or league,
or revolutionary league

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.610
of Italians of Combatants.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.667
Or the Combatant Italian
Revolutionary Group--

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.250
I guess is one way
to think about it--

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.580
or the Group of
Italian Combatants,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.480
is another way to
think about it.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.640
And their ideology--
and their ideology

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.940
wasn't well established
right when they set up.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.980
It was just really
around this idea

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.470
of being super
pro-nationalist-- but it

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.179
began to develop over the course
of the '20s and the 1930s.

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.470
The core idea, and I've
already said it multiple times,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.790
is an extreme nationalism.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.530
And when we talk about extreme
nationalism, or nationalism

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.950
in general, it's talking
about the interests

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.760
of one nation, of one
group, above all others.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.110
About putting the state
above all other things.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.100
Oftentimes, fascism is
viewed as a right-wing group.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.590
But in its purest form, it's
neither left- or right-wing.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.180
At the left end of
the spectrum, you

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.360
could imagine
communist or socialism.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.100
I'll write communism,
which you could

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.720
view as an extreme
form of socialism.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.050
Communism.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.160
And at the extreme
right, you could

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.660
imagine just
complete free-market.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.590
Complete, unfettered,
free-market.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.110
Ultra small government.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.610
And fascists and
extreme nationalists,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.080
they didn't view themselves
as either end of the spectrum.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.080
They kind of viewed
themselves as a separate way

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.460
where everything
was subordinate.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.140
The economy itself was
subordinate to the state.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.130
Now with that said, they
tended to align themselves

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.010
more with folks on the right.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.810
So even though they
weren't completely

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.440
free-market
capitalists, they were

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.030
staunchly anti-communist
and anti-socialist,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.595
which caused them to form
alliances a little bit more

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:00.220
with the right.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.845
But from their point
of view, it wasn't

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:04.130
one of these extreme
right-wing ideologies

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.860
that the government should be
subordinate to the economy,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.480
that the government should
be as small as possible.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.760
It was much more that
the economy was there

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.050
to serve national interests.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.970
Some of the other ideologies
that the fascists began to hold

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.330
is this idea that force was a
legitimate part of politics.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.420
So force in politics.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.300
And you would see this when
Benito Mussolini's fascists,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.052
through the use of
the Black Shirts,

00:05:35.052 --> 00:05:36.760
which was their
paramilitary group, which

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.930
allowed them to eventually
take political control

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.650
and enforce political control.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.170
And we later see it with
other groups like the Nazis.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.310
Who are also tended to be
associated with fascism.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.740
And their storm troopers
and their storm battalions,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.970
their paramilitary forces,
that are used to, essentially,

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.560
take political control.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.330
The other aspect of
them-- and, as you

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.170
could imagine, when we're
talking about either Mussolini

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.930
or the Nazis-- is that
they weren't really

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.070
fans of democracy.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.842
Not only did they
think that everything

00:06:04.842 --> 00:06:06.300
should be subordinate
to the state,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.140
but that the state should
have absolute control.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.536
So it's not about democracy.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.410
It's about having a
strong leader at the top.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.100
A strong one party at the top.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.050
And in the case of Mussolini
it was the fascists.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.440
In the case of Hitler it
ends up being the Nazis.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.890
So totalitarian.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.830
Completely totalitarian.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.260
And then, they
also-- and these all

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.360
gel together-- this idea of
aggressive foreign policy.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.190
And this aggressive
foreign policy

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.400
is really rooted in this
belief of cultural superiority.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.840
And, if you take the
case of the Nazis,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.730
this belief in extreme
racial superiority,

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.380
cultural superiority.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.070
And I'm making a
slight distinction

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.004
there because in
Mussolini's eyes,

00:06:48.004 --> 00:06:49.420
he was actually
quite disparaging.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.700
Even though Hitler
looked to Mussolini

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.180
as something of a role model
when Mussolini took power

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.350
in 1922, it inspired
Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.630
Mussolini did not
think much of Hitler

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.190
through much of the 1920s
and even early 1930s.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.180
He thought Hitler's
ideas of racial purity

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.710
were really an illusion.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.260
That there was no
racially pure race.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.400
He didn't really appreciate
Hitler calling the Italians

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.950
a mongrel race.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.840
But Mussolini himself did
think that the Italians

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.140
were culturally superior.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.860
And that would be
their justification

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.480
for an aggressive
foreign policy.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:32.120
For them taking over
other territory in Europe

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.160
and in Africa.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.210
And as we'll see,
because they shared

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.790
so much in common
ideologically, the Nazis

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.260
were, you could kind of
view as a more extreme form.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.810
And the fascists themselves
were quite extreme.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.720
But the Nazis were
a more extreme form

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.410
of the same ideology.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.230
They will, even though in
the '20s and early '30s

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.420
Mussolini is more
eager to align himself

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.370
with some of the other
powers in Europe,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.350
in particular Great
Britain and France.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.090
As we go into the
second half of 1930s,

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.630
Mussolini and Hitler
find themselves

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.650
to be kindred spirits.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.060
They both want to be aggressive
in their foreign policy.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.840
They both want to
secure other territory.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.510
They both have
this idea that they

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.540
need space for their
superior populations,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.140
to their culturally superior,
and in the case of the Nazis,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.410
racially superior populations
to grow and thrive.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.380
And so as we enter
into the second half

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.530
of the 1930s and
World War II, you

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.980
have Mussolini and
the fascists become

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.797
close allies of
Hitler and the Nazis.
