00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.580
- [Announcer] This program
contains graphic images

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.150
and discussion of medical procedures.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.193
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.940
- [Host] Renee is a very popular speaker

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.690
at the Advances in
Pediatrics course at UCSF,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.760
Professor of Dermatology at UC

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.860
and Director of the UCSF
Benioff Children's Hospital,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.480
Oakland Dermatology Service,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.480
and I think we see you have
taught Noemi very well.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.560
She is going to speak on
dermatologic conditions

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.660
and other developmental disabilities.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.906
Welcome.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.910
- [Renee] Thank you,
Lucy, and you can all see

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.293
Noemi's a star student.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.973
We have many joint consultations.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:00.600
We do admit many of them
are by text message,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.680
but we also use the EPIC
system and staff messaging

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.930
to consult back and forth.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.830
It's been really fun working with her.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.610
We divided up the Down
syndrome skin problems

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.040
with those that other children

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.890
with developmental disabilities face,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.410
because she does run
the Down syndrome clinic

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.140
and she's learned a lot about
those specific skin problems

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.210
through that population,
and I learned a lot

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.550
from her as well, so it's been really fun.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.790
When I thought about what I've seen at

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.623
Children's Hospital, Oakland,

00:01:33.623 --> 00:01:35.350
I've been there for three years doing

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.350
referral academic peds derm
in patient and out patient,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.010
it ended up dividing up
into four categories.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.300
First I want to let you
know I have no disclosures.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.890
Any products I find, they're
random shots from the internet

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.680
and I have no personal stake in Amazon.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.480
I wish I did, but it's just a place

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.420
that a lot of families
shop, so if you see that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.050
that's why I use it.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.170
We're starting with
some visual relief here

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.140
and a moment of meditation.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.080
Hiking on Mount Tam in
February, I was able to

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.173
photograph snow, which was really fun.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.273
Everybody sigh and think
about being up there, okay.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.677
So I divided up the problems that I manage

00:02:16.677 --> 00:02:18.440
and that we all manage in our clinics

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.600
into sort of four categories.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.180
Some of these are more common than others.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.170
I like to start with the common things,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.960
which are the big five
diseases we see in derm clinic,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.680
eczema, acne, et cetera,
warts and molluscum.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.420
These are things you
manage even more than I do

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.250
because they are common.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.880
I was talking with one
of the audience members

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.490
about how many kids
that they see day to day

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.750
with skin problems they deal with

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.030
even if they come in for primary care.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.840
Those children with
developmental disabilities

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.780
have special challenges
when you're managing

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.890
common skin problems.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.510
Even just an average acne patient

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.170
can have special challenges
that we'll discuss.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.640
I want to give you some take home

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.730
clues and tricks and tips that you can use

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.160
in your own practice.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.290
Also, many patients with
developmental disability

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.810
have behaviors that affect
the skin, hair and nails,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.880
so we're going to talk about those.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.100
Nutritional deficiency is a
more rare problem that we see,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.744
but the skin can be a
window into diagnosing that.

00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:13.930
In our in patient service, we have had

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.169
more than a couple of patients
in the last three years

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.990
who manifest with nutritional
deficiency in the skin

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.280
and also in my out patient clinic

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.803
I saw one that I'll show you.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.510
That was, in one case of
an in patient, neglect,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.860
so that was a very sad case.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.150
Likewise, your children,
your infants, your babies

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.130
with developmental disability
who are manifesting

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.040
neurological issues, you may have the skin

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.860
as a window into a genetic diagnosis.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.110
I'm going to focus today
on hypopigmentation.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.420
To go over our learning objectives,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.900
we're going to start with
the five common skin diseases

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.770
and give you some tips and tricks

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.140
for management in this population.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.000
Then we're going to go
on to the body-focused

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.840
repetitive behaviors, the skin pulling

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.490
and hair pulling and nail disorders.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.620
We're going to talk about
two nutritional disorders

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.360
in the skin manifestations,
and finally learn

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.100
an approach to an infant with

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.190
developmental disability
and hypopigmentation.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.623
Okay, so let's start with
common things being common.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.130
Atopic dermatitis, my number
one diagnosis that I see

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.580
in my clinic in Oakland.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.050
It is a referral-based clinic.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.320
I see very severe atopic dermatitis,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.150
including in children with
developmental disability.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.400
These legs belong to an eight year old

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.380
who has autism spectrum disorder.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.300
He's extremely uncomfortable.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.850
He is digging and picking
his skin all day long,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.870
and we'll talk more about him in a moment.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.630
I see a lot of patients with acne,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.310
and it's a chance to think about

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.110
agency and independence
in our adolescents.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.160
Warts and molluscum when
the family are bothered

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.610
by the lesions more than the child,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.630
and maybe the child doesn't
want a painful procedure.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.300
That can be a challenge.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.270
Scalp psoriasis is extremely common.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.830
Noemi talked about that a little bit,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.390
but I see kids whose scalp itching

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.670
does exacerbate their behavioral problems,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.883
and finally talk a bit about
dermatologic procedures.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.510
What about the link between atopy and

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.790
autism spectrum disorder?

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.460
I haven't seen evidence
that really convinces me

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.270
that atopy predisposes to
autism spectrum disorder.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.560
There are some studies
that propose a link,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.750
but I didn't think the
data were very convincing.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.240
They're both extremely common,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.420
and just because they're
together doesn't mean

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.270
they're causative, one is
causative to the other.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.280
What we do know is that children who have

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.260
autism spectrum disorder
and then are sleep deprived

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.900
because of their atopic derma can make

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.020
their behavioral problems worse,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.910
and that's true in all
children, of course.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.540
So we don't know whether atopic dermatitis

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.900
is more prevalent in this population.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.347
There's some studies that say it is

00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:44.610
and others that say it isn't,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.903
so that's an open question at this point.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.460
The tactile sensory
dysfunction, of course,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.220
exacerbates the itch,
the perception of itch,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.910
the experience of itch, and the
behavioral response to itch.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.040
So where one child might rub
their skin, my patient here,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.820
like many patients with
developmental disability

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.020
tend to pick and dig at the skin,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.420
which is much more hard
to heal and hard to treat.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.130
It can increase agitation,
increase, of course,

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.890
sleep disruption, which also can increase

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.780
behavioral problems, and then
you will get super infections,

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.030
so our friend here had nafcillin sensitive

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.070
staph aureus infection that I cultured,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.810
and then worked with the
parents to eliminate that.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.570
That did help the eczema as well.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.930
Parents are already overwhelmed.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.700
You saw that diagram that Noemi showed

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.430
with all the things they have to do,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.210
and here is this chronic skin problem

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.140
that adds 45 minutes a day to the care.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.990
So I try to make it easy
for them and for the child,

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.430
who may resist all topical
applications of any kind,

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.630
and Noemi mentioned that as well.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.560
I'm asking them to use
greasy, thick moisturizers.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.160
It is not a pleasant sensation,
especially the older kids

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.930
really resist it, so I
work with the families,

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.130
I compromise on my
ointments, and I compromise

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.440
and allow them to use creams,
and if I have to, lotions,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.780
which are much easier to put on

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.600
and much less effective
at treating the dry skin,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.220
but I do believe that I need to make

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.100
the whole situation palatable and workable

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.240
and practical for the family.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.520
I will tend to use a
stronger topical steroid

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.290
once a day instead of a
mid-potency topical steroid

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.310
twice a day, that's another compromise.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.820
I'll use a cream and
I'll go up a class or two

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.480
on my topical steroid
strength in order to have

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.260
this be a bedtime routine
after the bath or shower

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.540
instead of having the family having to

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.820
deal with this in the morning,

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.680
trying to get the kid
out the door to school.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.650
We all know how hard that is.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.230
Then remember that topical
steroids do come in gels

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.110
and solutions for the scalp.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.110
Solutions that are alcohol based can sting

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.440
and the child may resist them,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.780
but gels tend to be not as
stingy, so remember that.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.820
You can look up and see if there's a gel

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.160
that you can use in
your pharmacy formulary.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.010
You work with the parents,
and the primary care

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.820
rely on you to also work with the parents

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.080
to work with the child's personality,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.320
temperament, and behavior issues.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.476
Give them rewards for doing the skin care,

00:08:04.476 --> 00:08:07.290
and then if it's a
teenager who wants to use

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.430
the smelly skin care products
that Noemi mentioned,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.170
I particularly will mention
Axe, which the boys love.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.210
Try to just keep those
products out of the house

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.163
so the kids can't use them,
because they're very irritating.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.010
Let's talk about itch.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.150
How can we break the itch/scratch/dig/pick

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.560
infection cycle in our patients?

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.590
I address staph
superinfection aggressively.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.630
Again, I like to apologize to Brian Lee

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.690
who is our infectious disease
specialist in our hospital

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.540
who's always trying to get
us not to use antibiotics.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.130
I get that, and I try really hard not to,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.300
but sometimes you just have
to use systemic antibiotics.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.520
The amount of staph on the
skin overwhelms bleach baths,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.143
in order to get the eczema under control.

00:08:49.143 --> 00:08:52.050
I do culture because the patients I see

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.430
are referred and severe, and I need data,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.540
so I do tend to culture
them more than you would

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.190
and direct the staph
infection systemic therapy

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.300
toward MSSA, MRSA, et cetera.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.770
Phototherapy is a tool that

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.130
I'm trying to start at Children's.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:05.963
I have a grant in.

00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:07.210
Anybody who knows anybody on the

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.450
President's Innovation
Fund grant committee?

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.400
Can you wave to them, because
we really need phototherapy.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.560
This is a health disparity
issue for our patients.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.380
What phototherapy does
for you is it drives

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.960
the immune system out of the
skin and immediately helps

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.520
the itch, and it helps the skin heal

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.630
in the case of atomic dermatitis.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.810
Systemic therapy such as
Dupilumad, as of two days ago,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.860
are now FDA approved
down to 12 years of age,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.890
so we're extremely excited about this,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.160
and it is a drug we can
use in this population.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.660
It's not immuno suppressive

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.070
like all of our other medications.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.480
Occlusion is great, but if you have a kid

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.040
who has sensory issues,
they are not going to

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.520
want their legs wrapped,
but if you do have a kid

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.810
who will tolerate it, you
can get these beautiful,

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.240
colorful Coban wraps
or other brands online

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.390
for pretty cheap in pretty colors,

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.580
and you can wrap the
legs and keep the fingers

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.210
off the wounds and allow them to heal.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.030
You can also, for a localized lesion,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.610
use a Duoderm, which is a
venous stasis ulcer dressing,

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.160
no stock in that company,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.260
or any kind of a stick
but not adhesive dressing

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.133
wrapped with an Ace
bandage and then Tegaderm.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.380
Yesterday you hear a little bit how

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.950
antihistamines, sedating antihistamines

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.160
can be problematic in kids
with behavioral problems.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.260
I second that, and it can
lower seizure threshold,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.690
but if they don't have those issues,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.638
they don't have paradoxical
reactions or seizure disorder,

00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:28.290
one per kilo hydroxyzine at bedtime

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.090
or Benadryl at bedtime can
really help during a flare.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.933
I don't use them chronically
unless I absolutely have to.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.343
Here's the culture from our
friend here with the MSSA.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.300
That's a little bit about eczema.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.160
Let's move on to acne.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.800
Acne is challenging to treat in all ages

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.993
and children of all abilities.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.430
In the teenage population,
we have issues with autonomy

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.041
and therapeutic decision-making.

00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:58.490
The caregiver as advocates,

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.320
this child came in to me having seen

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.380
an adult dermatologist who have thought

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.200
they were pretty much
done treating her acne.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.930
And I wanna know how
many people in this room

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.453
had acne as teenagers?

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.640
So, it's not just a cosmetic problem.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.160
It is uncomfortable, it hurts,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.148
and this mother was
advocating for her child

00:11:17.148 --> 00:11:18.330
to have a more aggressive therapy,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.070
and we teamed up and you'll see what we,

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.900
what we did for her ultimately.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.080
But she could not get access
to dermatology in her community

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.933
and she drove a ways to see me.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.380
There's pain, there's scarring,
there's disfigurement.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.910
And these are true issues that
need to be treated seriously.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.130
It's not just "cosmetic."

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.830
But there is a problem
with access to care,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.870
to dermatology, specialty care.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.010
I know that there's some
tele dermatology businesses

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.913
that are addressing this for
some of the clinics, FQHCs.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.400
But we do our best to help you

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.000
take care of these patients one on one.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.250
So this is the handout that our ER

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.820
gave to one of our patients saying

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.120
talk to your doctor about a possible

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.960
dermatology, skin specialist referral.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.880
Below is a listing of
Bay Area dermatologists,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.330
and you see there, it's just me.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.800
(audience laughing)

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.640
I am happy to tell you
that this Doctor Kittler

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.360
who's wonderful, is on my team now

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.510
as of October, and I have a wonderful PA,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.910
Anjali Washington, I work with them.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.920
She sees a lot of the older
kids and a lot of the acne

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.560
under my supervision, and she's excellent.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.310
So we are growing and we're
doing our best to help you.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.490
So we tried to write Isotretinoin

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.980
or Accutane for this child.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.080
We did the pregnancy test, we did put her

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.820
on the birth control pill
as required by the system,

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.990
and we thought it might help her acne.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.660
It was repeatedly denied
by her MediCal HMO.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.660
And again, I consider this
a health disparity problem.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.480
I have real difficulties
getting drugs I use

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.290
in patients with private insurance

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.360
with my government insured patients.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.130
Fortunately for our young lady,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.860
we added Aldactone as an anti-androgen

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.030
to her birth control
pill, and lo and behold,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.440
she was much helped by this,

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.900
and she was able to use topical.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.070
She didn't resist that at all

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.950
and was very compliant with our Retin-A.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.710
We're able to go up on strength.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.600
So we marched through all
the steps that you see here

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.570
before we finally controlled her acne.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.170
And mom and she are happy, and
I just got a referral request

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.310
for the Aldactone, so she's
doing very well now a year later

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.060
She never ended up taking Accutane.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.700
So some workarounds for you

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.570
for patients with government insurance

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.130
cause much of this population
does have government insurance

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.810
You can get an over-the-counter
benzoyl peroxide gel

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.820
that's really nice water-based.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.803
You see there, it's $20, that'll
last about a month or two.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.100
And you don't have to
get the $50 proactive.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.900
They are paying mostly
for their telemarketing

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.773
and their advertising, and
we don't wanna support that.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.270
Over-the-counter Adapalene,
I call it baby Retin-A.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.400
It works like Retin-A, but it's more,

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.317
it's easier to use, and
it's better tolerated.

00:13:48.317 --> 00:13:50.370
You can get that online for about $14

00:13:51.215 --> 00:13:53.330
or in your local drugstore.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.830
You all can use Doxycycline
for inflammatory acne

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.450
or bad truncal acne, the monohydrate

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.380
is not as irritating to the GI tract.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.310
They can take it once a day with dinner.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.890
Of course you want
dairy products separated

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.010
about half an hour from that pill.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.790
And then for girls that are
in the older teen group,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.640
oral contraceptives are wonderful.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.210
If you don't feel
comfortable using Aldactone,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.720
you can refer and we can get them started.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.730
And then we can treat them jointly.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.430
You can't use Aldactone
without good birth control

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.860
because of the risk of teratogenicity and

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.703
feminizing a masculine fetus.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.850
We all love warts, right,
don't you just love

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.350
when a patient comes in with 5,000 warts?

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.990
And the parents, this is my
favorite line from parents,

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.720
in my career, they walk
in, they point to the kid,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.420
and they say, we want these gone.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.193
The implication being I don't.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.670
The problem is freezing is really painful.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.550
Curetting is painful, I will
not do freezing and curetting

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.660
for warts and molluscum without
the permission of the child.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.800
If the child is not gonna
ask me to treat this

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.340
with a painful procedure,
I'm not gonna do it.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.530
I'm not gonna tell 'em it
doesn't hurt 'cause it does.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.230
How many people have had
a wart frozen, it hurts.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.302
So you need to, what?

00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:02.135
- [Male Audience Member] It's worth it.

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:05.220
- It's worth it, if the kid
is in pain, I will do it,

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.340
if they can't walk because
they have a painful wart.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.660
But I have to tell you in studies,

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.990
if he's had a wart more than a year,

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.330
it takes six to seven separate
liquid nitrogen treatments.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.310
And that's gonna make
the kid hate the doctor.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.200
Not just me, they're gonna
hate you too, so I won't do it.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.160
I have other tricks, but it does require

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.730
referral to me for
those, what you can do is

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.870
salicylic acid with duct tape occlusion.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.970
If the child resists
filing and pairing at home,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.400
duct tape will pull off the
top of the wart and in time

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.290
will help you irritate the
wart and get rid of it.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.420
You have to educate families,
it's a viral infection.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.720
It's not like a mole or skin
tag you can just cut off.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.030
You can't cut out warts,
it's an infection.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.300
There's HPV in the skin around the wart.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.470
If you cut off the wart, the
HPV will activate around it,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.560
and you'll end up with a bigger wart.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.830
So don't send your plantar warts

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.679
to podiatry for surgery, that's a myth.

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:55.731
You work around sal-acid, duct tape.

00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:57.310
If you have cantharone in your office,

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.680
you can use it on small warts.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.490
Sometimes they do get
bigger instead of smaller,

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.080
but it's worth a try, and then Imiquimod,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.590
some insurance plans cover Imiquimod,

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.010
which is immune stimulant,
it's something to do,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.670
I'm not sure if there's great data

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.420
supporting its use for
warts and molluscum,

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.890
but I don't have an objection to it.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.070
I do Squaric acid, which is
immunotherapy in my office.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.860
It's painless, it's
somewhat risky in terms of

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.870
causing a severe allergic
reaction in the skin.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.000
But that's what I use for my
kids with periungual warts.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.970
This child here, we
did Squaric acid twice,

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:28.870
and it cleared up.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.590
Okay, so you see that scalp down there

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.975
belong to an adolescent with
autism spectrum disorder.

00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:39.210
He was extremely agitated by the itching.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.460
He was head-banging, he
was hitting his head.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.910
His caregiver was very distressed.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.073
He had a wonderful dedicated caregiver.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.099
And she brought him in repeatedly.

00:16:48.099 --> 00:16:50.230
I cultured his scalp, looking for tinea,

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.320
because it wasn't some group situations,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.620
classrooms, et cetera.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.100
It was negative, so we went
on to topical steroids,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.000
to tar, some of the
things Noemi mentioned.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.470
Why do we use ketoconazole shampoo

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.920
in seborrheic dermatitis?

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.550
Because it's an inflammatory response

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.810
to a normal pityrosporum
colonization post puberty.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.150
So we like to reduce how
much fungus is on the scalp.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.900
It's not an infection with fungus.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.010
We did rule dermatophyte
infection out with a culture.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.450
But if you wanna start 2% ketoconazole

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.123
or if you don't have access to that,

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.850
1% over-the-counter ketoconazole shampoo,

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.630
twice a week, it's a great tool.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.040
And then the other days a week,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.590
if the kid's got shorter hair

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.920
and can wash their hair every day,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.340
it is helpful for seb-derm,
just hair washing every day.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.420
The days you don't use
the ketoconazole shampoo,

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.000
you can use any dandruff shampoo.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.360
I happen to like tar,
many of these patients

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.860
also have psoriasis,
and tar is really good

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.000
for both psoriasis and seb-derm.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.540
And the ketoconazole doesn't
hurt if there's psoriasis.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.630
It might help, but there's,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.650
it really helps with the seb-derm.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.050
The topical steroids, you
need to use a stronger one.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:55.830
The scalp is thick, you
won't get into trouble

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.070
with a stronger topical steroid,

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.253
like a class 2 lidex, something like that.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.260
And then you can layer the
tar, the topical steroid,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.510
salicylic acid, and do
combination therapy.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.990
Scalp psoriasis usually
does require help from us

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.990
cause really stubborn and hard to treat.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.043
Moving on to procedure, so
we do a lot of procedures in

00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:17.200
Peds Derm Clinic, biopsies,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.840
the wart and molluscum
procedures I mentioned.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.870
And my colleague here, Vikash Oza,

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.290
is a pediatric dermatologist at NYU.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.990
He trained with us at UCSF,
and I'm very proud of him.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.840
He gives a talk at the
National Dermatology Meeting

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.920
to adult dermatologists about how to

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.200
treat kids appropriately
with developmental disability

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.500
in their derm clinics and
tries to teach them about

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.180
derm procedures, things that all come

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.210
intuitively to us as pediatricians,

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.200
adult dermatologists may
not have good training.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.390
They may not have Ilona
Frieden as their derm teacher

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.040
or Kelly Cordoro or Erin
Mathis or I or anyone else.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.230
I think you all know that
pediatric dermatologists

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.450
are your friends when it comes to

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.670
treating kids with
developmental disability.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.770
We'll tell and show and
do, even if we can't get

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.120
consent from the child, we'll get assent,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.240
and also from the family.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.660
We use a lot of lidocaine
cream under occlusion

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.110
to localized lesions and then distraction,

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.820
physical distraction with
eyes or the buzzy bee.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.260
You see there, and then
also the shop blocker,

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.250
which is the little prongy thing.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.890
A child who has sensory
issues may not tolerate that,

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.020
but it might be more helpful in others.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.460
And then some distraction with
headphones and screen time,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.333
as long as the kid knows what's
coming, it could be helpful.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.760
I don't sneak up on any kid,

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.863
so I like to talk to 'em first if I can.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.400
We're gonna talk about body
focus repetitive behaviors.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.550
The language around these
issues has evolved over time.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.260
I got this pamphlet in the
mail literally as I was

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.550
developing this talk
and writing this talk.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.844
The DSM proper names for this body focused

00:19:52.844 --> 00:19:54.860
behaviors now are hair pulling disorder

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.550
and skin picking disorder,
habit tic deformity,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.053
and lichen simplex chronicus,

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.240
is under skin picking disorder.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.880
So habit tic is on the nail,
and lichen simplex chronicus

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.300
is rubbing as opposed to picking.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.030
But it's all in the same group.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.280
I call it restless hand syndrome.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.913
It's a place to put your
anxiety in the behavior.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.330
So, the old term Trichotillomania

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.470
is still out there in
studies, you'll see it.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.990
People will use it, but officially,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.440
we're supposed to call
it hair pulling disorder.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.897
I slip and call it
Trichotillo all the time.

00:20:24.897 --> 00:20:27.650
It's habitual pulling of hair from scalp,

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.480
browse, lashes, not just the scalp hair,

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.690
but body hair and facial hair.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.670
Part of the ritual's often
biting and eating the hair,

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.410
and that's where the
health consequences come in

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.430
that I'll show you, they present with

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.170
irregular, ill-defined patches

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.960
as opposed to the alopecia areata patients

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.870
that have these very well demarcated,

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.640
usually round, complete alopecia patches.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.113
Trichotillo's messy and irregular.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.100
It's associated with
impulsiveness and hyperactivity.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.833
It's self-stimulatory
behavior and serotoninergic.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.810
I can't talk, and you can use your

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.630
drug therapy to target that.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.070
It can be exacerbated by ADHD medications,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.710
and that's what these
pictures from the paper

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.600
that a hair pulling disorder started

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.453
after the kids started stimulatory drug.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.250
So you can get a bezoar of hair,

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.170
and it can cause a cast of the stomach

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.070
and the small intestine, it's
called the Rapunzel syndrome

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.590
for obvious reasons, I don't think I need

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.230
to go into detail about that.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.400
But this imaging shows that
the stomach is full of hair,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.170
and they had to operate
on this trichobezoar.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.070
So it's not a harmless behavior,
it needs to be addressed.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.910
In the case of the skin,
the main consequence is

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.000
scarring, permanent
scarring, from the picking,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.760
the digging, biting or
scratching with an instrument.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.963
Sometimes they use a pencil or a,

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.520
something else they find around the house.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.470
These kids present with
different faces of erosions,

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.970
crusted erosions, scarring, ulcerations,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.410
on the places they can reach.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.090
So it'll spare the mid
back, but just about

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.663
any place else can be affected.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.410
So you'll see that kid at the top

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.210
has scratches all around the
back but not in the middle.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.170
Lichen simplex chronicus is
a different response to itch.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.530
That's more of a rubbing
and the skin gets thickened.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.360
And if they have pigment in
their skin, hyperpigmented.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.020
It's usually just a place
that's very itchy probably

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.530
there's some perturbation
of the local sensory nerves

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:21.750
that drives this behavior,
and occlusion is helpful

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.080
with the wraps, and the
DuoDERM and the Tegaderm.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.810
Filling that potent topical steroids

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.460
and then address super infection.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.010
And this happens in adults and
kids with atopic dermatitis

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.960
without development disability as well.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.560
Habit tic deformity is
specifically picking out a nail

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.690
repeatedly in the same place to the point

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.380
where the nail is a dystrophic.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.040
It's very hard to stop this behavior

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.535
along the lines of fingernail biting.

00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:52.570
It's mostly cosmetic, you usually
don't get super infection.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.800
You need to reassure the family

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.910
and point out that the behavior

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.780
leads to the vertical ridging.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.040
You can treat with occlusion.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.740
If you occlude one nail,
they'll probably start

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.990
going after another one.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.520
And you wanna spare the patients

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.800
three months of oral lamisil

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.720
because this is not a fungal infection.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.190
If you aren't sure,
you can scrape the nail

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.843
and culture it or send to us.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.057
So, if you address the
underlying skin disease

00:23:14.057 --> 00:23:16.810
that is exacerbating behavioral problems,

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.680
you're gonna make these kids'
behaviors easier to control

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.053
and help the caregivers and the child.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.330
So there is some literature
about using N-Acetyl Cysteine

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.850
for skin picking disorder,
again not just in kids with

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.840
developmental disorders, disabilities,

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.429
but also in people who
have skin picking disorder

00:23:35.429 --> 00:23:38.891
from anxiety and mental health problems.

00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:42.620
I leave it to the child
psychiatrists and behavioral people

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.810
to use the psychoactive medications.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.140
I don't do that myself, and also remember

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.910
cognitive behavioral
therapy can be helpful

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.781
in a child who responds to that.

00:23:51.781 --> 00:23:53.250
N-Acetyl Cysteine smells like sulfur

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.940
so it may not be so popular

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.703
if somebody's sensitive to smell.

00:23:58.798 --> 00:24:02.220
Now let's talk about these
rare but important disorders

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.050
to recognize the nutritional disorders.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.960
This is my family, and my nephew,

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.120
who's got the white T-shirt, no, this is,

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.730
this is Johnny, and he taught me

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.040
about the diets of kids with
autism spectrum disorder.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.250
This is me with my son, and Johnny and

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.053
my son are very good friends.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.280
So John would pretty much stick to

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.640
Mountain Dew for beverage

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.960
and White Castle
hamburgers for solid food,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.360
along with golden Oreos that I

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.580
didn't even know anything about.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.010
He would not eat the chocolate Oreos,

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.700
only the golden ones, not
that the chocolate ones

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.313
have any more nutritional value.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.530
So from John, I learned about avoidant

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.960
restrictive food intake disorder.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.150
He would come and stay at our house,

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.859
and if we didn't have the food he wanted,

00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:47.770
he would not be happy,
and at Thanksgiving,

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.750
I learned to supply what he would eat.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.730
It distressed me greatly
to buy Mountain Dew,

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.350
I have to tell you, and of course,

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.890
my sister was very distressed about this

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.223
because she was very
much into nutrition and,

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.260
but the problem that you get into is that

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.070
this kind of diet, I call
it the yellow-white diet,

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.930
will lead to nutritional deficiency,

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.440
both protein deficiency and vitamin D,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.050
vitamin C deficiency, so those are

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.050
the two things I'm gonna talk about.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.140
I learned really about
nutritional disorder

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.410
in kids without genetic
problems from atopic dermatitis

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.580
because I published a series with

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.550
a group of other Peds Derms

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.270
about kwashiorkor in the
setting of atopic derm,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.530
where the parents put
the kids on fad diets,

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.760
i.e. rice milk, which has no protein,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.050
and these previously
healthy babies came in

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.170
with kwashiorkor which was
from the protein deficiency.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.080
So these therapeutic diets in the case of

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.199
some of your patients, kids
who have a lot of GI problems

00:25:43.199 --> 00:25:45.879
or parents who put their kids on fad diets

00:25:45.879 --> 00:25:49.550
and just parents who get too
tired to fight with their kids

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.080
and then of course in the
case I mentioned, neglect,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.930
all lead to nutritional disruptions

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.110
that can be quite profound and severe.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.730
So this is a case that was published

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.600
by a British dermatologist who said,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.120
who titled it Think About the
C (in custard and crackers),

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.200
so there's your yellow-white British diet.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.654
I think all of the British
diet is in yellow-white.

00:26:07.654 --> 00:26:11.470
But this child presented had
autism spectrum disorder,

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.110
presented with bone
changes and skin changes,

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.650
which I'll show you, from
vitamin C deficiency.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.623
So the child had scurvy.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.900
So you can measure vitamin C very easily

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.507
if a child is on a very restricted diet

00:26:26.507 --> 00:26:28.700
and the parent's concerned,
you can measure that

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.500
before the child presents with petechiae,

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.610
purpura, perifollicular hemorrhage,

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.770
corkscrew hairs, it's the
skin manifestations of scurvy,

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.610
and then gingival swelling and bleeding

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.790
is the oral manifestations, however,

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.930
they are often worked up
for leukemia and cancers

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.220
because they'll come into the ER

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.050
with the bony manifestations,

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.550
the limp, the bone pain, and fatigue.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.330
So you can imagine a child
with petechiae in their legs,

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.760
limping, with bone pain and fatigue,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.640
you're gonna be thinking
about something much worse

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.320
than scurvy which is cured with

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.703
100 to 300 milligrams of vitamin C a day.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.140
This is a really interesting patient

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.620
whose mother went to a
physical therapist in Canada,

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.330
and this child had profound
developmental disability,

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.580
was G-tube dependent and non-verbal.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.240
And the child was put on a
pure fruits and vegetable,

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.000
vegan diet by the mother,
so she started giving

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.040
the special formula and
noticed that the kid,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.560
after several months of this, had a rash.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.530
And the pediatrician knew
there was something off

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.640
about this rash and didn't
think it was normal psoriasis

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.740
and sent her to me, and
I quickly recognized

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.190
that this child had kwashiorkor

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.430
because I had experience with this

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.800
in the atopic dermatitis population.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.547
So the mother also said to me,

00:27:38.547 --> 00:27:39.967
"You know, her eyelashes are blonde,

00:27:39.967 --> 00:27:42.587
"and her hair is getting blonde,
and her hair is thinning.

00:27:42.587 --> 00:27:44.660
"And the child looks
puffy," and sure enough,

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.660
the child had profound protein deficiency.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.880
She had a low albumin, she
was, shortly thereafter,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.250
hospitalized for pneumonia,
we started evaluating her

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.940
nutritional deficiency, and by the way,

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.494
her zinc was okay, somehow, there was zinc

00:27:57.494 --> 00:27:58.910
in the fruits and vegetables.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.295
And so she was hospitalized,
and I was able to

00:28:01.295 --> 00:28:04.560
educate the residents and
the team about kwashiorkor

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.460
in the setting of
developmental disability.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.000
She also had low vitamin B1 and B6.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.160
And the mother was very cooperative

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.020
and happy to put her
back on slow re-feeding.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.440
And the rash cleared up.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.630
So we didn't put her on
topical steroids for psoriasis.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.190
We recognized the child
had a special situation.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.440
And that's what I want you all to have

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.050
at the back of your head,
if the skin looks funny,

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.090
if there's some weird dryness that

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.101
doesn't look like typical
psoriasis or eczema,

00:28:30.101 --> 00:28:33.960
think about a close dietary history.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.700
So again, I wrote this series
up about rice milk diets.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.390
And by the way, there's not
very much protein in almond milk

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.145
and any of these other nut milks that are

00:28:44.145 --> 00:28:46.940
on the market now, and it's not just kids

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.267
with developmental disability
that are getting these diets.

00:28:49.267 --> 00:28:53.853
But they may have self-chosen these diets.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.153
So this is a published
series of kwashiorkor,

00:28:59.153 --> 00:29:01.530
and these are my babies with eczema,

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.610
but the findings are gonna
be the same in infants.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.090
It's gonna look like flaky paint.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.540
Kwashiorkor is a protein
deficiency, not calorie deficiency.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.920
So they're not gonna be
underweight, like marasmus,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.200
when they're protein
and calorie deficient.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.500
They have edema, so they sort
of look fatter than they are.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.650
And they call that the
flaky paint dermatitis.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.020
So I showed you a more mild version.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.500
It looks like psoriasis, this
is a more severe version.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.500
It looks almost hemorrhagic.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.460
They'll have both low protein and albumin.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.600
So it's easy to diagnose them.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.910
And you treat 'em with re-feeding.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.410
Of course, we need a good
nutritionist to help us.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.670
Finally, let's talk about an
infant who's starting to show

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.240
neurologic or developmental issues

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.360
and maybe has something on their skin.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.050
And how do you look at
the skin in an infant

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.030
that you're concerned might have

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.670
a neurocutaneous syndrome of some kind?

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.240
So, skin, there're many,
many genodermatoses

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.530
that have developmental
disability and neurologic issues,

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.060
including some of these
more severe ichthyosis

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.557
or giant congenital nevi and
neurocutaneous melanosis.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.460
That could be whole four-hour seminar,

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.910
but we're gonna focus on pigmentation,

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.855
specifically hypopigmentation

00:30:07.855 --> 00:30:09.150
cause this is something
that comes up a lot,

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.250
and we don't wanna miss
tuberous sclerosis.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.240
So, this kid has tuberous sclerosis.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.340
That's an ash-leaf macule.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.863
And then this is a severe
ichthyosis and hyperpigmentation.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.750
So let's focus on linear,
streaky, and hypopigmentation

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.870
and also hypopigmented macules.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.930
So when you're looking
at pigment in the skin,

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.430
you always remember that it's gonna

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.320
correlate with, in the
case of hyperpigmentation,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.570
with the pigment of the child.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.310
So if you have a kid who's got
a lot of color in their skin,

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.610
their café au lait macules
are gonna be much darker,

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.180
and if you have a light colored skin,

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.360
you're gonna have very light
tan café au lait macules.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.810
And sometimes, they're really hard to see.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.530
Likewise with hypopigmentation,

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.700
if you have a child with very pale skin,

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.020
it's gonna be hard to see that.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.030
And before they have
any sun exposure at all,

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.230
so maybe you have a six-month-old

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.900
who's never been out in the sun,

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.340
you may not see that ash-leaf macule

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.310
until they do get sun exposure.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.710
So the way that we deal with that

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.120
is if you think you see any
sort of pigmentary change,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.700
we use a black light, which is
also called the Wood's lamp.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.950
And you can get this on yourself.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.090
They're very inexpensive, you
gotta turn all the lights off

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.920
in the room and hold the light
really close to the skin.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.270
And if you need glasses, wear glasses,

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.670
cause it can be hard to see.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.710
Look at the entire skin surface.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.060
I usually have the mom
hold the baby in her arms

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.910
kinda pulling down the diaper
for me to see the buttocks.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:33.970
So here is a case of vitiligo.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.960
So Noemi mentioned
vitiligo's deep pigmented.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.800
You can see how it
lights up on Wood's lamp.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.760
Whereas hypopigmentation will accentuate

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.363
but not light up like that.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.580
What about linear, streaky,
or block-like pigmentation?

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.420
Now this is a birthmark that can come

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.490
in the first years of life, so these kids

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.770
usually present in
toddler or older infancy

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.898
with streaky, whorly hypopigmentation.

00:31:57.898 --> 00:32:01.370
There're some old terms that
we don't use that much anymore,

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.720
like linear and whorled
nevoid hypermelanosis

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.780
is still used, I don't
use it, but I've heard

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.550
other people use it, speakers.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.480
We don't use nevoid, sorry,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.190
cutis tricolor or
incontinentia achromicans.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.623
If you see that in a
chart, it's not my chart.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.550
Usually, I'll use blaschkoid
hyper, hypopigmentation,

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:22.600
or dispigmentation, which
reflects the fact that there is,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.660
these are in developmental
blaschkoid lines.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.970
So that's what I mean by that, these are

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.820
developmental lines of
migration of the skin

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.120
that will carry a
mutation across the skin.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.490
And you can also have
block-like pigmentation.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.897
And why are we talking about this

00:32:35.897 --> 00:32:37.110
in a developmental disability conference?

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.520
Because kids who have extensive blaschkoid

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.560
hyper and hypopigmentation are at risk for

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.010
neurodevelopmental involvement,

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:46.930
including seizures and developmental delay

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.070
and autism spectrum disorder.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.410
I'm talking about extensive.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.550
If you have a localized lesion,

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.090
most of those kids are healthy.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:55.130
The problem with literature

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.290
is there's a lot of referral bias.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.680
So 75% are noticed at
birth or the first year.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.050
This 55% having systemic problems,

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.580
those studies are
published by neurologists,

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.630
not by dermatologists,
there was one study I found

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.910
by a dermatologic group that
showed a much lower rate

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.403
of developmental disability.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.629
They have also bony problems, so it's

00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:19.350
not just the neurocutaneous.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.840
It can have dysmorphic facies.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.750
And many of these have genetic issues that

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.520
hopefully with the micro array, et cetera,

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.000
whole exome sequencing, we'll start

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.580
identifying more and more of these genes.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.990
42% in this neurology series had abnormal

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:35.393
cytogenetic profiles and most are mosaic.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.490
So they have that selection bias.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.520
Here's just an example of a
kid who is referred in to me

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.380
with this widespread hypo
and hyperpigmentation,

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.840
head to toe, and so I do
ask to do a very close

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.700
review of systems, and we'll send them

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.840
back to you pediatricians,

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.640
asking for a neurology if I'm concerned.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.593
And ask you to very
closely follow development.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.340
So I will call this blaschkoid hypo, hyper

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.280
or dispigmentation, this is the

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.960
dermatology series I was mentioning.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.000
It was a chart review
referred to dermatology

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.410
as opposed to neurology clinic.

00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:11.360
And they saw neurological
problems in only 5%

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.810
as opposed to the 50 or 60
from the neurology series.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:18.360
But they had some extra
cutaneous feature on 13%.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.860
So again, if no obvious dysmorphic facies

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.390
or systemic features, you
just follow both their skin

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:26.270
and their neurodevelopmental progress.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.763
And I will do that jointly
with you as primaries.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.670
Focusing on tuberous sclerosis,

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.840
ash-leaf macules are present at birth,

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.770
but they're not always noticed at birth.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.480
Use a Wood's lamp head to toe
in any kid who has seizures

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.710
or you're concerned
about tuberous sclerosis.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.750
The differential diagnosis
includes pityriasis alba,

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:48.070
which is a form of eczema you
see in darker skin patients.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.690
This is a patient with pityriasis alba

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.660
and atopic dermatitis
who's African-American

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.307
who does not have ash-leaf macules.

00:34:53.307 --> 00:34:56.070
Her skin is very dry,
these lesions are scaly,

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.490
and they respond to
hydrocortisone and emollients.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.220
Any time you have inflammation of the skin

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.900
in a child with pigment,
they can lose pigment,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.560
that is not vitiligo, if a
family's asking you about it,

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.610
that's what they're concerned about,

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.100
you need to come out and
say that's not vitiligo.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.600
But early vitiligo can be hypopigmented.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.210
It will progress in a month
or two to total depigmentation

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.410
chalk-white, like I showed you

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.180
on that picture of the Wood lamp.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.330
If you're not sure and
the family is concerned,

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.586
just refer them so we can
talk to the family about it.

00:35:23.586 --> 00:35:26.470
Nevus depigmentosus is
an isolated macule that's

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.820
depigmented, usually flag-shaped,
usually on the trunk,

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.900
it doesn't progress, it's there at birth,

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.010
has no associations, and is pretty common.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:37.830
Then we talked about the
blaschkoid hypopigmentation.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.080
Ash-leaf macules, again,
can be very tricky.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.090
Usually, there's, right
there, they're usually sort of

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:47.010
look like a leaf shape but not always

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.090
and look for the other
features of tuberous sclerosis,

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.910
which anybody who works with
developmental disability

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:53.550
should know about periungal fibromas

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.750
and fibrous forehead plaque.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:56.650
And there're some good reviews

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.523
in your references and handout.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.210
So just take that in for a second,

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.610
your differential diagnosis
of hypopigmentation.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.700
So remember that patients with TS

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.790
can present with seizures
with infantile spasms

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:14.430
that may not be recognized by the family.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.140
That's why we care about trying to

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.110
look for the skin findings, and

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.510
they have a higher incidence of

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.180
autism spectrum disorder as do

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.620
patients with neurofibromatosis

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.210
in the case of café au lait macules.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.980
There's a list of the findings here,

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.460
and this is an important one.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.440
I want to let you all know
if you don't already know

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.090
that we now use topical sirolimus
for facial angiofibromas

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.610
in patients with tuberous sclerosis.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.460
We get it compounded, it's covered by CCS.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.780
And it's very effective
in conjunction with laser

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.620
at preventing the
disfigurement of angiofibromas

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.590
in patients with tuberous sclerosis.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.080
So bear in mind, we have a
new treatment for facial,

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.900
what's so called previously
adenoma sebaceum.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.130
Now we recognize these are angiofibromas.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.650
They're related to the TS mutation.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.383
They respond to topical sirulimus.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.170
So I think we've covered a ton today.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.210
Maybe almost as much as Noemi covered

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.590
with the Down Syndrome, so I understand

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.690
you may have questions,
happy to answer those.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.820
My acknowledgements are to Noemi,

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.670
my colleague and friend Vikash,

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.010
and then my teams at Children's.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.830
Here's Anjali Washington, my PA.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.450
Our new dermatologist, Nicole Kittler

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.590
who's wonderful and she's bilingual.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.383
And then this is my UCSF team.

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:31.559
(audience clapping)
