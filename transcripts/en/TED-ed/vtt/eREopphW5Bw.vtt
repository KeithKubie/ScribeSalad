00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:15.992
We often hear that studying literature

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:18.501
involves finding a deeper meaning to a text.

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.127
When writing about literary works,

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:22.425
we're expected to mentally dive below the surface

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.850
in order to come back up with big ideas.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.143
But you may find yourself looking

00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:27.514
at the flat page of a book,

00:00:27.514 --> 00:00:29.470
wondering how deep it can really go?

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.391
How do we reach those ideas that turn into great essays?

00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:34.330
Well, there are two crucial thinking steps

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.143
that can lead us in the right direction:

00:00:36.143 --> 00:00:37.320
practicing insight

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.147
and acknowledging complexity.

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:41.277
Insight is the ability to arrive

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:43.929
at an intuitive understanding of a big idea

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.104
using only small clues to get there.

00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:47.606
If you're practicing insight,

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:49.247
you'll able to use observations

00:00:49.247 --> 00:00:51.417
about character behavior to figure out

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.730
their true emotions and motivations.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.229
Pay attention to little things

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.795
because they add up to what is really meaningful.

00:00:57.795 --> 00:00:59.808
For example, if you consider a character

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:01.964
like Mr. Darcy from &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt;,

00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:05.097
who openly declares his dislike for Miss Lizzy Bennet,

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:07.807
you might, at first, assume he's just a mean guy.

00:01:07.807 --> 00:01:09.376
But, using your powers of insight,

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:11.928
you're noticing other smaller things -

00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:13.979
how Darcy's eyes linger on Lizzy's face

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.315
and how he seems all flustered when she's around.

00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:18.128
Add to the mix your knowledge that Mr. Darcy

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:20.486
is in a much higher social class than Lizzy,

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:22.447
and your sense of insight should be telling you

00:01:22.447 --> 00:01:24.376
that there's something more here.

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:25.700
In this case, it will tell you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.955
that Darcy's surface behavior is in conflict

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.790
with his true feelings of attraction

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.415
because the difference in wealth between himself and Lizzy

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:34.875
makes him feel that it'll never work.

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:36.793
Thinking about all those small clues

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:39.839
gives us insight about some of the big, abstract ideas

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:42.800
within the novel that we can approach in an essay:

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.618
appearances versus reality,

00:01:44.618 --> 00:01:46.846
the power of wealth and social stratification,

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:49.946
and the unpredictable nature of love and attraction.

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:52.226
Look at that! Deeper meaning.

00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:54.619
The second step to a sophisticated analysis

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.541
is acknowledging complexity.

00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:59.066
Let's face it. In both life and literature,

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.736
situations are complicated

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:03.168
due to social forces like relationships,

00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:04.111
moral codes,

00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.070
personal desires,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.738
and power structures.

00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:08.907
This means that there are, at any given time,

00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:11.743
multiple factors that shape what is true.

00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:13.913
In order to acknowledge complexity in your writing,

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:17.003
refrain from making broad generalizations about a text

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.293
or establishing quick, simple judgements about a character.

00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:22.898
Explore each facet of your subject carefully

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:26.260
and make sure to consider multiple influences on events.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.678
Explain the tension of multiple forces

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:30.342
that create the story.

00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:34.012
For example, a basic analysis of Toni Morrison's &lt;i&gt;Beloved&lt;i&gt;,

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:35.934
where the protagonist has killed her own child

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:38.145
rather than allow her to grow up in slavery,

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:39.757
might sound like this,

00:02:39.757 --> 00:02:41.631
"Sethe murdered her own daughter.

00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:42.655
This act was wrong,

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:44.066
and causes the ghost of the child

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.287
to haunt her throughout the novel."

00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:48.155
These observations are simplistic.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.156
They don't acknowledge all the different forces

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:52.555
that contribute to what the character has done.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:54.553
Try something like this instead,

00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:56.933
"A culture of slavery disturbs the ability

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:58.933
to determine what is morally right.

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:00.888
Sethe's past experiences with violence

00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:03.551
reinforce the fear she has for her child's fate,

00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:06.059
and transform the murder into a protective act.

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:07.392
As the novel progresses,

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:10.134
Sethe is haunted both by the angry spirit of her daughter

00:03:10.134 --> 00:03:11.928
and by the memories of everything else

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:13.556
slavery took from her."

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:16.100
Here, we see those influential forces at work,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.566
and we've shown off our ability to understand

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.770
the complicated nature of the human experience,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.733
which, again, allows us to access

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:26.150
those big ideas that reveal the deeper meaning of a story,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.724
ideas, in this case, like the parameters of maternal instinct,

00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:31.644
the consequences of injustice,

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.225
and the question of whether or not

00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:36.454
ethics can even exist in a corrupted moral system.

00:03:36.454 --> 00:03:37.787
It's impossible to sit down

00:03:37.787 --> 00:03:39.872
and write an amazing essay about literature

00:03:39.872 --> 00:03:41.725
without first thinking about it.

00:03:41.725 --> 00:03:42.751
Before you hit the keys,

00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:43.991
go back to the text

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.639
and fish out the small moments,

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.974
the complicated moments in the story.

00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:49.423
Line them up in your mind,

00:03:49.423 --> 00:03:50.309
practice insight,

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:51.630
acknowledge complexity,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.395
arrive at some big ideas.

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:54.310
Before you know it,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.015
the deeper meaning will be close at hand.
