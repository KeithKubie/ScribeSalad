the black side start to move away from
 

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.820
the black side start to move away from
the light so it starts to move in this

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:26.830
the light so it starts to move in this
 

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.180

so the Crookes radiometer

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480
so the Crookes radiometer
 

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:40.659

but let's look at the transparent sphere

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:08.830
but let's look at the transparent sphere
 

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.370
but let's look at the transparent sphere
that is one micron in diameter so it's

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:11.380
that is one micron in diameter so it's
 

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.330
that is one micron in diameter so it's
very small so if we shine light on it

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:15.340

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.080
its direction so that the momentum is
conserved if the photon arrived in the

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.090

lower part of the sphere it deflected

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:37.780
lower part of the sphere it deflected
 

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.890
lower part of the sphere it deflected
upward and the sphere goes downwards so

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:40.900
upward and the sphere goes downwards so
 

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.330
upward and the sphere goes downwards so
this is the basic mechanism for this

the laser as it was in the previous
 

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.690
the laser as it was in the previous
slide but now is 1/2 axis so what will

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:39.700
slide but now is 1/2 axis so what will
 

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.330
slide but now is 1/2 axis so what will
happen to that sphere the transparent

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:42.340
happen to that sphere the transparent
 

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.360
happen to that sphere the transparent
sphere so the laser as of course higher

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:45.370
sphere so the laser as of course higher
 

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.570

forces the scattering force which make
 

00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:20.399
forces the scattering force which make
the sphere move in the direction of the

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:20.409
the sphere move in the direction of the
 

00:32:20.409 --> 00:32:23.489
the sphere move in the direction of the
beam a gradient force that makes the

00:32:23.489 --> 00:32:23.499
beam a gradient force that makes the
 

00:32:23.499 --> 00:32:25.560
beam a gradient force that makes the
sphere goes toward the center of the

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:25.570
sphere goes toward the center of the
 

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.960
sphere goes toward the center of the
beam so what is very interesting here is

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:27.970
beam so what is very interesting here is
 

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.350
beam so what is very interesting here is
that the sphere will be attracted to the

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360
that the sphere will be attracted to the
 

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.899
that the sphere will be attracted to the
high power region of the laser which

00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:33.909
high power region of the laser which
 

00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:35.970
high power region of the laser which
seems a little bit counterintuitive but

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:35.980
seems a little bit counterintuitive but
 

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.519
seems a little bit counterintuitive but
it actually happens so the sphere goes

00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:38.529
it actually happens so the sphere goes
 

00:32:38.529 --> 00:32:41.460
it actually happens so the sphere goes
towards the center of the beam so let's

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:41.470
towards the center of the beam so let's
 

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:45.629
towards the center of the beam so let's
look at a little animation so the

00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639
look at a little animation so the
 

00:32:45.639 --> 00:32:48.090
look at a little animation so the
photons are arriving here more photon at

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:48.100
photons are arriving here more photon at
 

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.590
photons are arriving here more photon at
the top because it's near the center

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600
the top because it's near the center
 

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.539
the top because it's near the center
look more or less photon here and the

00:32:51.539 --> 00:32:51.549
look more or less photon here and the
 

00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:53.669
look more or less photon here and the
ball will start to move toward the

00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679
ball will start to move toward the
 

00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:55.680
ball will start to move toward the
center of the beam when it's at the

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:55.690
center of the beam when it's at the
 

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.570
center of the beam when it's at the
center it just moved forward to the

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:57.580
center it just moved forward to the
 

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.669
center it just moved forward to the
scattering force and here it's going to

00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679
scattering force and here it's going to
 

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:03.299
scattering force and here it's going to
hit a slide but a microscope slide let's

00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:03.309
hit a slide but a microscope slide let's
 

00:33:03.309 --> 00:33:04.859
hit a slide but a microscope slide let's
stop the sphere so this sphere is

00:33:04.859 --> 00:33:04.869
stop the sphere so this sphere is
 

00:33:04.869 --> 00:33:07.950
stop the sphere so this sphere is
trapped like the beam on the left and by

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960
trapped like the beam on the left and by
 

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:16.169
trapped like the beam on the left and by
the microscope slide on the right so art

00:33:16.169 --> 00:33:16.179
the microscope slide on the right so art
 

00:33:16.179 --> 00:33:19.590
the microscope slide on the right so art
got the idea that because he saw this

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600
got the idea that because he saw this
 

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.749
got the idea that because he saw this
phenomenon that he could actually put

00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:21.759
phenomenon that he could actually put
 

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:24.480
phenomenon that he could actually put
two beams counter-propagating and put a

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:24.490
two beams counter-propagating and put a
 

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.460
two beams counter-propagating and put a
sphere in the middle the transparent

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:26.470
sphere in the middle the transparent
 

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.190
sphere in the middle the transparent
sphere and this fear would be trapped

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200
sphere and this fear would be trapped
 

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.659
sphere and this fear would be trapped
because the scattering force of this

00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:30.669
because the scattering force of this
 

00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:32.820
because the scattering force of this
beam and the scratches form of this beam

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:32.830
beam and the scratches form of this beam
 

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.100
beam and the scratches form of this beam
would be a comfortable compensate each

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.110
would be a comfortable compensate each
 

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.409
would be a comfortable compensate each
other and the particle will be in

00:33:37.409 --> 00:33:37.419
other and the particle will be in
 

00:33:37.419 --> 00:33:40.289
other and the particle will be in
equilibrium there so that's part of his

00:33:40.289 --> 00:33:40.299
equilibrium there so that's part of his
 

00:33:40.299 --> 00:33:41.130
equilibrium there so that's part of his

a little animation on this two beam trap

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:02.190
a little animation on this two beam trap
 

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:05.100
a little animation on this two beam trap
so all the photon arrives symmetrically

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:05.110
so all the photon arrives symmetrically
 

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.740
so all the photon arrives symmetrically
so the net force on the sphere is zero

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:07.750
so the net force on the sphere is zero
 

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.550
so the net force on the sphere is zero
it doesn't move so this is the first all

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560
it doesn't move so this is the first all
 

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:19.349
it doesn't move so this is the first all
optical trap so art decided in the next

00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359
optical trap so art decided in the next
 

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:24.240
optical trap so art decided in the next
year and 71 to look at what will happen

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:24.250
year and 71 to look at what will happen
 

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.909
year and 71 to look at what will happen
if it takes the laser and turn it

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919
if it takes the laser and turn it
 

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:32.330
if it takes the laser and turn it
upwards and use gravity as a force to to

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:32.340
upwards and use gravity as a force to to
 

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:37.250
upwards and use gravity as a force to to
to produce the trapping so here's the

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.260
to produce the trapping so here's the
 

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:46.200
to produce the trapping so here's the
laser so initially the sphere is sitting

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:46.210
laser so initially the sphere is sitting
 

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.169
laser so initially the sphere is sitting
on microscope slide then we turn on the

00:34:49.169 --> 00:34:49.179
on microscope slide then we turn on the
 

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.629
on microscope slide then we turn on the
laser but it's too low power this fear

00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639
laser but it's too low power this fear
 

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.450
laser but it's too low power this fear
is not levitating we increase the power

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:54.460
is not levitating we increase the power
 

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.390
is not levitating we increase the power
more photons and this fear will start to

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400
more photons and this fear will start to
 

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:03.390
more photons and this fear will start to
levitate and eventually this at the

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400
levitate and eventually this at the
 

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.640
levitate and eventually this at the
height that it is determined by the

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:05.650
height that it is determined by the
 

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:14.300
height that it is determined by the
laser power and the beam divergence

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:14.310
 
 

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.250
 
so I decided that he will try to measure

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:17.260
so I decided that he will try to measure
 

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.260
so I decided that he will try to measure
the charge of the electron using an

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:19.270
the charge of the electron using an
 

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:23.150
the charge of the electron using an
optical live data so here's the set up

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160
optical live data so here's the set up
 

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.270
optical live data so here's the set up
that was in 1980 so there is a sphere

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280
that was in 1980 so there is a sphere
 

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.990
that was in 1980 so there is a sphere
that is levitating and there is a

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000
that is levitating and there is a
 

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.820
that is levitating and there is a
feedback control where he's monitoring

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:32.830
feedback control where he's monitoring
 

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.990
feedback control where he's monitoring
the height of that sphere and it changes

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000
the height of that sphere and it changes
 

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.610
the height of that sphere and it changes
the power of the laser to keep the

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:38.620
the power of the laser to keep the
 

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.330
the power of the laser to keep the
height the same so then he shined UV

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:42.340
height the same so then he shined UV
 

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.850
height the same so then he shined UV
light in the chamber that created

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:44.860
light in the chamber that created
 

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.430
light in the chamber that created
electrons and he applied difference of

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440
electrons and he applied difference of
 

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.490
electrons and he applied difference of
voltage something similar to the

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:50.500
voltage something similar to the
 

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.600
voltage something similar to the
Milliken experiment so the child did the

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:54.610
Milliken experiment so the child did the
 

00:35:54.610 --> 00:36:00.140
Milliken experiment so the child did the
sphere started to acquire charges and

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:00.150
sphere started to acquire charges and
 

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.720
sphere started to acquire charges and
the power of the laser is adjusted

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:03.730
the power of the laser is adjusted
 

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.750
the power of the laser is adjusted
automatically to compensate the electric

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760
automatically to compensate the electric
 

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.300
automatically to compensate the electric
force that the sphere will under go

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:09.310
force that the sphere will under go
 

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:11.910
force that the sphere will under go
under this difference of potential so

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920
under this difference of potential so
 

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:16.380
under this difference of potential so
here are the measurements so you can see

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:16.390
here are the measurements so you can see
 

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.680
here are the measurements so you can see
that this is the charging time so how

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:19.690
that this is the charging time so how
 

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.290
that this is the charging time so how
long the UV light is on and this is the

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:22.300
long the UV light is on and this is the
 

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.020
long the UV light is on and this is the
power of the laser needed to levitate

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.030
power of the laser needed to levitate
 

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.840
power of the laser needed to levitate
and you can see as UV light shines and

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:27.850
and you can see as UV light shines and
 

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.470
and you can see as UV light shines and
charges are created on the sphere the

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480
charges are created on the sphere the
 

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.600
charges are created on the sphere the
power to levitate changes and of course

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:33.610
power to levitate changes and of course
 

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:38.750
power to levitate changes and of course
it's actually step exactly by the power

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760
it's actually step exactly by the power
 

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.100
it's actually step exactly by the power
by the charge of the electron is a

by the charge of the electron is a
 

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.770
by the charge of the electron is a
discrete power change that correspond to

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:43.780
discrete power change that correspond to
 

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.110
discrete power change that correspond to
the charge of the electron and this is a

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:46.120
the charge of the electron and this is a
 

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.960
the charge of the electron and this is a
very high accuracy measurement of the

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:48.970
very high accuracy measurement of the
 

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:52.490

aperture microscope objective focus the
light very tightly just not too far from

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:22.270
light very tightly just not too far from
 

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.770
light very tightly just not too far from
the objective and what happened is that

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:25.780
the objective and what happened is that
 

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.530
the objective and what happened is that
if we look

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540
if we look
 

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.560
if we look
here at the zoom of this location at the

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:31.570
here at the zoom of this location at the
 

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:34.350
here at the zoom of this location at the
center here the minimum size of the beam

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:34.360
center here the minimum size of the beam
 

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.720
center here the minimum size of the beam
the waste of the beam the highest power

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:36.730
the waste of the beam the highest power
 

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.020
the waste of the beam the highest power
is in the middle here then there is a

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.030
is in the middle here then there is a
 

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.790
is in the middle here then there is a
gradient in the transverse direction

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800
gradient in the transverse direction
 

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.920
gradient in the transverse direction
that any laser have it has more power

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:43.930
that any laser have it has more power
 

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.690
that any laser have it has more power
near the center of the beam than on the

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:45.700
near the center of the beam than on the
 

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.470
near the center of the beam than on the
edges but now because of this very tight

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480
edges but now because of this very tight
 

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.680
edges but now because of this very tight
focusing the there is a gradient of

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:52.690
focusing the there is a gradient of
 

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:57.060
focusing the there is a gradient of
power along the axis of the beam so now

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:57.070
power along the axis of the beam so now
 

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.750
power along the axis of the beam so now
from the center here to going forward

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760
from the center here to going forward
 

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.540
from the center here to going forward
there is a very big gradient of power

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:03.550
there is a very big gradient of power
 

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:06.750
there is a very big gradient of power
and what is the impact of that so we

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760
and what is the impact of that so we
 

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.060
and what is the impact of that so we
have learned from previous slides that a

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:09.070
have learned from previous slides that a
 

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.750
have learned from previous slides that a
sphere is attracted towards the region

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760
sphere is attracted towards the region
 

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.240
sphere is attracted towards the region
of high power so the sphere will

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:15.250
of high power so the sphere will
 

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.250
of high power so the sphere will
experience a force that's called a

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:17.260
experience a force that's called a
 

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.150
experience a force that's called a
gradient force that is not forward but

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160
gradient force that is not forward but
 

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.310
gradient force that is not forward but
is backward so it's the sphere wants to

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:23.320
is backward so it's the sphere wants to
 

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.190
is backward so it's the sphere wants to
go back to the center of the laser and

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200
go back to the center of the laser and
 

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.890
go back to the center of the laser and
if you have a sufficient focusing then

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:28.900
if you have a sufficient focusing then
 

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.020
if you have a sufficient focusing then
this the gradient force will exceed the

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.030
this the gradient force will exceed the
 

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.550
this the gradient force will exceed the
scattering force that is always there

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560
scattering force that is always there
 

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.840
scattering force that is always there
and produce an attract small sphere

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:36.850
and produce an attract small sphere
 

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:40.560
and produce an attract small sphere
towards the center of the beam but not

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:40.570
towards the center of the beam but not
 

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.240
towards the center of the beam but not
exactly at the center there is a little

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:42.250
exactly at the center there is a little
 

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.250
exactly at the center there is a little
bit offset which is a maximum gradient

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:44.260
bit offset which is a maximum gradient
 

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.310
bit offset which is a maximum gradient
of light so the sphere will set off just

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:47.320
of light so the sphere will set off just
 

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.840
of light so the sphere will set off just
before the focus so in the single beam

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:50.850
before the focus so in the single beam
 

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:55.130
before the focus so in the single beam
you can track that you can trap a small

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140
you can track that you can trap a small
 

00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:01.710
you can track that you can trap a small
very cold transparent particle so let's

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720
very cold transparent particle so let's
 

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:06.780
very cold transparent particle so let's
see it in operation so here we have an

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:06.790
see it in operation so here we have an
 

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.910
see it in operation so here we have an
optical imitator which will be used just

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920
optical imitator which will be used just
 

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.530
optical imitator which will be used just
to bring the spheres next to the

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:10.540
to bring the spheres next to the
 

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.710
to bring the spheres next to the
tweezers on top you have the optical

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720
tweezers on top you have the optical
 

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.040
tweezers on top you have the optical
tweezers so the sphere is at the bottom

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:17.050
tweezers so the sphere is at the bottom
 

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.610
tweezers so the sphere is at the bottom
of the tank you turn the laser on so the

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:20.620
of the tank you turn the laser on so the
 

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.480
of the tank you turn the laser on so the
tweezer here as it's a fixed power very

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:24.490
tweezer here as it's a fixed power very
 

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.670
tweezer here as it's a fixed power very
high intensity in it the focus point

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680
high intensity in it the focus point
 

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.010
high intensity in it the focus point
then there is low intensity of levitator

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:29.020
then there is low intensity of levitator
 

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.410
then there is low intensity of levitator
it's not sufficient to levitate then we

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:31.420
it's not sufficient to levitate then we
 

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.210
it's not sufficient to levitate then we
increase the power of the levitator

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:33.220
increase the power of the levitator
 

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.960
increase the power of the levitator
the particle goes up and then is trapped

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:35.970
the particle goes up and then is trapped
 

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:39.030
the particle goes up and then is trapped
so a particle let's do it again

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040
so a particle let's do it again
 

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.829
so a particle let's do it again
so the when the particle

00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839
so the when the particle
 

00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:43.589
so the when the particle
lift is become trapped all of a sudden

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599
lift is become trapped all of a sudden
 

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:46.079
lift is become trapped all of a sudden
in this location just after the focus so

00:39:46.079 --> 00:39:46.089
in this location just after the focus so
 

00:39:46.089 --> 00:39:53.539
in this location just after the focus so
that's the way in optical tweezers works

00:39:53.539 --> 00:39:53.549
 
 

00:39:53.549 --> 00:39:57.029
 
so let's now talk about some of the

00:39:57.029 --> 00:39:57.039
so let's now talk about some of the
 

00:39:57.039 --> 00:40:00.420
so let's now talk about some of the

00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:17.469
microscope to trap bacteria using 11.06
 

00:40:17.469 --> 00:40:23.160
microscope to trap bacteria using 11.06
micron neodymium YAG laser so he started

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.170
micron neodymium YAG laser so he started
 

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.729
micron neodymium YAG laser so he started
with non living organisms and something

00:40:26.729 --> 00:40:26.739
with non living organisms and something
 

00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:30.079
with non living organisms and something
that doesn't have the shape of a sphere

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:30.089
that doesn't have the shape of a sphere
 

00:40:30.089 --> 00:40:33.839
that doesn't have the shape of a sphere
so here I'm gonna show a video where

00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:33.849
so here I'm gonna show a video where
 

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:37.219
so here I'm gonna show a video where
they took himself where you can see this

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:37.229
they took himself where you can see this
 

00:40:37.229 --> 00:40:40.410
they took himself where you can see this
irregular particle being moved by an

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:40.420
irregular particle being moved by an
 

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.440
irregular particle being moved by an
optical tweezer and you can see

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:43.450
optical tweezer and you can see
 

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:48.329
optical tweezer and you can see
obviously that is not circular but it's

00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:48.339
obviously that is not circular but it's
 

00:40:48.339 --> 00:40:49.589
obviously that is not circular but it's
going to be manipulated by the optical

00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599
going to be manipulated by the optical
 

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:52.019
going to be manipulated by the optical
tweezers so the laser is that's one

00:40:52.019 --> 00:40:52.029
tweezers so the laser is that's one
 

00:40:52.029 --> 00:40:54.950
tweezers so the laser is that's one
micron so we cannot see it's not visible

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960
micron so we cannot see it's not visible
 

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.900
micron so we cannot see it's not visible
but when it's turned on it moves this

00:40:59.900 --> 00:40:59.910
but when it's turned on it moves this
 

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.329
but when it's turned on it moves this
small object here so it shows that you

00:41:03.329 --> 00:41:03.339
small object here so it shows that you
 

00:41:03.339 --> 00:41:06.509

don't need a sphere to use optical

00:41:06.509 --> 00:41:06.519
don't need a sphere to use optical
 

00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:13.650
don't need a sphere to use optical
tweezers to exert force on objects then

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:13.660
tweezers to exert force on objects then
 

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.499
tweezers to exert force on objects then
he it turns its attention to living

00:41:16.499 --> 00:41:16.509

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:35.069
of microns
 

00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:39.359
of microns
here's a video that art took where it

00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:39.369
here's a video that art took where it
 

00:41:39.369 --> 00:41:41.430
here's a video that art took where it
trapped one of the organelles I want to

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440
trapped one of the organelles I want to
 

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.829
trapped one of the organelles I want to
attract your attention here to the white

00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839
attract your attention here to the white
 

00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:48.239
attract your attention here to the white
dot which is a an organelle and he's

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:48.249
dot which is a an organelle and he's
 

00:41:48.249 --> 00:41:49.890
dot which is a an organelle and he's
going to trap them let's trap the

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:49.900
going to trap them let's trap the
 

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.950
going to trap them let's trap the
organelle twice so let's look at the

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960
organelle twice so let's look at the
 

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.200
organelle twice so let's look at the
video so this organelle

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:55.210
video so this organelle
 

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.690
video so this organelle
it's trapped and a Paramecium will move

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:57.700
it's trapped and a Paramecium will move
 

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:02.250
it's trapped and a Paramecium will move
and then when it you're gonna eat the

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:02.260
and then when it you're gonna eat the
 

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.099
and then when it you're gonna eat the
wall its exit the trap and it's gonna be

00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:05.109
wall its exit the trap and it's gonna be
 

00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:07.890
wall its exit the trap and it's gonna be
trapped again anybody it's the wall

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:07.900
trapped again anybody it's the wall
 

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:15.720
trapped again anybody it's the wall
it's leave the trap again and now let's

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:15.730
it's leave the trap again and now let's
 

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.120
it's leave the trap again and now let's
look at what happens to a tobacco mosaic

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.130
look at what happens to a tobacco mosaic
 

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.880
look at what happens to a tobacco mosaic
virus a tobacco mosaic virus it's very

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:20.890
virus a tobacco mosaic virus it's very
 

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.799
virus a tobacco mosaic virus it's very
long so it's very different from a

00:42:22.799 --> 00:42:22.809
long so it's very different from a
 

00:42:22.809 --> 00:42:25.620
long so it's very different from a
sphere so I want to attract your

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:25.630
sphere so I want to attract your
 

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:31.650
sphere so I want to attract your
attention here this rectangle so the

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:31.660
attention here this rectangle so the
 

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.900
attention here this rectangle so the
tobacco mosaic virus is freeze moving

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:33.910
tobacco mosaic virus is freeze moving
 

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.880
tobacco mosaic virus is freeze moving
around there's gonna be trapped so now

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:35.890
around there's gonna be trapped so now
 

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.980
around there's gonna be trapped so now
it's trap doesn't move and then it's

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:37.990
it's trap doesn't move and then it's
 

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:42.750
it's trap doesn't move and then it's
turn in the inwards and because it's

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760
turn in the inwards and because it's
 

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.859
turn in the inwards and because it's
trapped using by the end of the virus

00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:46.869
trapped using by the end of the virus
 

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:49.109
trapped using by the end of the virus
because the end of the virus refract

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119
because the end of the virus refract
 

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:51.839
because the end of the virus refract
light more and the optical tweezer is

00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:51.849
light more and the optical tweezer is
 

00:42:51.849 --> 00:43:00.839
light more and the optical tweezer is
stronger and now I decided to trap

00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:00.849
stronger and now I decided to trap
 

00:43:00.849 --> 00:43:05.420
stronger and now I decided to trap

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:26.310
let me sit here I'm moving him now I got
 

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.460
let me sit here I'm moving him now I got
a reference to movement right here you

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:28.470
a reference to movement right here you
 

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:39.170
a reference to movement right here you
can see our movie so now let's talk

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.180
can see our movie so now let's talk
 

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:45.950
can see our movie so now let's talk
about a few different applications so

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960
about a few different applications so
 

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.660
about a few different applications so
molecular motors are biological

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:47.670
molecular motors are biological
 

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.570
molecular motors are biological
molecules molecular machines that are

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:50.580
molecules molecular machines that are
 

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.790

has been attached to a Kinnison any

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:08.070
has been attached to a Kinnison any
 

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:11.510
has been attached to a Kinnison any
Kinnison is on a microtubule so the

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520
Kinnison is on a microtubule so the
 

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.400
Kinnison is on a microtubule so the
keynesian want to transport that bead

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:13.410
keynesian want to transport that bead
 

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.920
keynesian want to transport that bead
and that bead is being trap and an

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:15.930
and that bead is being trap and an
 

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:19.190
and that bead is being trap and an
optical tweezer and this optical tweezer

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200
optical tweezer and this optical tweezer
 

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.230
optical tweezer and this optical tweezer
is soft in a sense that it traps the

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240
is soft in a sense that it traps the
 

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.990
is soft in a sense that it traps the
beat but not too strongly so the bead is

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000
beat but not too strongly so the bead is
 

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
beat but not too strongly so the bead is
kind of free to move a little bit and as

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.010
kind of free to move a little bit and as
 

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:30.170
kind of free to move a little bit and as
it moves the it chain it deflects the B

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180
it moves the it chain it deflects the B
 

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.410
it moves the it chain it deflects the B
is the beam of the tweezer so it can be

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420
is the beam of the tweezer so it can be
 

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.900
is the beam of the tweezer so it can be
detected where the bead is in the

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:35.910
detected where the bead is in the
 

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.170
detected where the bead is in the
tweezer and if we look now at

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180
tweezer and if we look now at
 

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.300
tweezer and if we look now at
measurements those are three different

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:41.310
measurements those are three different
 

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:45.080
measurements those are three different
measurements the step size here this is

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:45.090
measurements the step size here this is
 

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.609
measurements the step size here this is
a function of time of the position of

00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:46.619
a function of time of the position of
 

00:44:46.619 --> 00:44:48.320
a function of time of the position of
the other bead and you can see the bead

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:48.330
the other bead and you can see the bead
 

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.930
the other bead and you can see the bead
move and by step size of eight

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940
move and by step size of eight
 

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:56.240
move and by step size of eight
nanometers so the bead is kind of the

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:56.250
nanometers so the bead is kind of the
 

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.270
nanometers so the bead is kind of the
keynesian is kind of walking along the

00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280
keynesian is kind of walking along the
 

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.280

step stop for a while another let me

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:04.470
step stop for a while another let me
 

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:09.260
step stop for a while another let me
just step and and so on so now let's

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:09.270
just step and and so on so now let's
 

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:10.970
just step and and so on so now let's
look now something a little bit more

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980
look now something a little bit more
 

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:16.430
look now something a little bit more
advanced which is the measurement of the

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440
advanced which is the measurement of the
 

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.290
advanced which is the measurement of the
DNA on DNA templates so a DNA template

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300
DNA on DNA templates so a DNA template
 

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.810
DNA on DNA templates so a DNA template
is attached to one bead which is in a

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:23.820
is attached to one bead which is in a
 

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.960
is attached to one bead which is in a
trap then the RNA polymerase is attached

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:26.970
trap then the RNA polymerase is attached
 

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:30.800
trap then the RNA polymerase is attached
and not a beat also in a trap one of the

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:30.810
and not a beat also in a trap one of the
 

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.990
and not a beat also in a trap one of the
trap is soft so it let the bead moves

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000
trap is soft so it let the bead moves
 

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.609
trap is soft so it let the bead moves
the other one is strong the video

00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619
the other one is strong the video
 

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:36.610
the other one is strong the video
doesn't move much

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:36.620
doesn't move much
 

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.340
doesn't move much
and in the what we're going to observe

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:39.350
and in the what we're going to observe
 

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:43.110
and in the what we're going to observe
here is that the NRA Paulina Ramirez is

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:43.120
here is that the NRA Paulina Ramirez is
 

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.840
here is that the NRA Paulina Ramirez is
transcribing the DNA and we're gonna see

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:46.850
transcribing the DNA and we're gonna see
 

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.150
transcribing the DNA and we're gonna see
a video that is at 30 times the speed of

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160
a video that is at 30 times the speed of
 

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:53.200
a video that is at 30 times the speed of
the two beats moving from a single DNA

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:53.210
the two beats moving from a single DNA
 

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:58.570
the two beats moving from a single DNA
and single RNA polymerase in action so

00:45:58.570 --> 00:45:58.580
and single RNA polymerase in action so
 

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.900
and single RNA polymerase in action so
the beat is moving as you can see and

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:00.910
the beat is moving as you can see and
 

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:04.240
the beat is moving as you can see and
what bring them together is the RNA

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:04.250
what bring them together is the RNA
 

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:11.380
what bring them together is the RNA
polymerase transcription so now if we

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:11.390
polymerase transcription so now if we
 

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.690
polymerase transcription so now if we
look at the measurements of this

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:13.700
look at the measurements of this
 

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.190
look at the measurements of this
distance between the beats this is a

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200
distance between the beats this is a
 

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:22.540
distance between the beats this is a
measurement that is about 1200 second so

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:22.550
measurement that is about 1200 second so
 

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.280
measurement that is about 1200 second so
we can zoom on it because there's a very

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:24.290
we can zoom on it because there's a very
 

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.740
we can zoom on it because there's a very
high resolution by a factor of 10 so we

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:26.750
high resolution by a factor of 10 so we
 

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.410
high resolution by a factor of 10 so we
see how yeah sometimes there's no motion

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:29.420
see how yeah sometimes there's no motion
 

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.830
see how yeah sometimes there's no motion
sometimes there's motion and if we zoom

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:32.840
sometimes there's motion and if we zoom
 

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.030
sometimes there's motion and if we zoom
even further we can see that now they

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040
even further we can see that now they
 

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.420
even further we can see that now they
have steps of 3.4 Armstrong so to

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:40.430
have steps of 3.4 Armstrong so to
 

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.130
have steps of 3.4 Armstrong so to
perform Armstrong is only a few atoms

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:42.140
perform Armstrong is only a few atoms
 

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.880
perform Armstrong is only a few atoms
wide and this 3.4 instrum corresponds to

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:45.890
wide and this 3.4 instrum corresponds to
 

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.130
wide and this 3.4 instrum corresponds to
the distance between the nucleotides of

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:48.140
the distance between the nucleotides of
 

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:55.480

did not come off when they tried to get
 

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.320
did not come off when they tried to get
the light as bright as they could

the light as bright as they could
 

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:59.200
the light as bright as they could
electrons did not come off now when they

00:52:59.200 --> 00:52:59.210
electrons did not come off now when they
 

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.510
electrons did not come off now when they
switch to green light which has a little

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520
switch to green light which has a little
 

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.260

came off but they came off with very low

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480
came off but they came off with very low
 

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.410
came off but they came off with very low
speed they turned up the power of their

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:11.420

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.470

green light and more electrons came off

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480
green light and more electrons came off
 

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.580
green light and more electrons came off
but always with very low speed and

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:17.590
but always with very low speed and
 

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:20.020
but always with very low speed and
finally when they tried violet light

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:20.030
finally when they tried violet light
 

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:23.740
finally when they tried violet light
which is the shortest wavelength that we

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:23.750
which is the shortest wavelength that we
 

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.020
which is the shortest wavelength that we
can see with our eyes so the shortest

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:26.030
can see with our eyes so the shortest
 

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:27.810

electrons came off with higher speeds

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:30.380
electrons came off with higher speeds
 

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:32.950
electrons came off with higher speeds
and when they turned up the power more

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960
and when they turned up the power more
 

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.230
and when they turned up the power more
electrons came off but always with those

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:35.240
electrons came off but always with those
 

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.810
electrons came off but always with those
same speeds now this flies in the face

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:37.820
same speeds now this flies in the face
 

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.570

of light being a wave if you can imagine

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:40.580
of light being a wave if you can imagine
 

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.970
of light being a wave if you can imagine
walking on a beach that's stony Beach

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:42.980
walking on a beach that's stony Beach
 

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.180
walking on a beach that's stony Beach
and if you just have small sea I know I

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:46.190
and if you just have small sea I know I
 

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:49.089
and if you just have small sea I know I
talk to a lot I don't need a mic

00:53:49.089 --> 00:53:49.099
talk to a lot I don't need a mic
 

00:53:49.099 --> 00:53:53.270
talk to a lot I don't need a mic
so when you walk on a beach and they're

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280
so when you walk on a beach and they're
 

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.190
so when you walk on a beach and they're
stones and you just have little ripples

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200
stones and you just have little ripples
 

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.200
stones and you just have little ripples
in the waves the stones don't even move

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:57.210
in the waves the stones don't even move
 

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.780
in the waves the stones don't even move
but if the waves are really crashing in

00:53:59.780 --> 00:53:59.790
but if the waves are really crashing in
 

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:01.730
but if the waves are really crashing in
you will see those stones flying up the

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740
you will see those stones flying up the
 

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.770
you will see those stones flying up the
beach and this is how waves would

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780
beach and this is how waves would
 

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.990
beach and this is how waves would
usually move objects and so when we

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000
usually move objects and so when we
 

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.579
usually move objects and so when we
turned up the power of the light we

00:54:07.579 --> 00:54:07.589
turned up the power of the light we
 

00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:09.440
turned up the power of the light we
certainly expected that the electrons

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:09.450
certainly expected that the electrons
 

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:15.220
certainly expected that the electrons
would fly off faster and yet they didn't

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:15.230
 
 

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:18.500
 
so it's this man here Albert Einstein

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:18.510
so it's this man here Albert Einstein
 

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.390
so it's this man here Albert Einstein
who probably thought of almost all of

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400
who probably thought of almost all of
 

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.150
who probably thought of almost all of
physics all on his own what he won the

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160
physics all on his own what he won the
 

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.670
physics all on his own what he won the
Nobel Prize for though was explaining

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680
Nobel Prize for though was explaining
 

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.530
Nobel Prize for though was explaining
this effect and so we and optics are

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540
this effect and so we and optics are
 

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.880
this effect and so we and optics are
pretty proud of the fact that this is

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:28.890
pretty proud of the fact that this is
 

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.940
pretty proud of the fact that this is
what he won the Nobel Prize for so what

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:31.950
what he won the Nobel Prize for so what
 

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.339
what he won the Nobel Prize for so what
he figured out was that light actually

00:54:34.339 --> 00:54:34.349
he figured out was that light actually
 

00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:37.370
he figured out was that light actually
is quantized in its energy there is a

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380
is quantized in its energy there is a
 

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.400
is quantized in its energy there is a
minimum energy unit of light that we now

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:40.410
minimum energy unit of light that we now
 

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:41.810
minimum energy unit of light that we now
call the photon

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:41.820
call the photon
 

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:46.400
call the photon
it's a wave-like particle so what it

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:46.410
it's a wave-like particle so what it
 

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:49.910
it's a wave-like particle so what it
says though is that the total energy in

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920
says though is that the total energy in
 

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.849
says though is that the total energy in
your light is then the energy of an

00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859
your light is then the energy of an
 

00:54:52.859 --> 00:54:54.829
your light is then the energy of an
individual photon multiplied by the

00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839
individual photon multiplied by the
 

00:54:54.839 --> 00:54:57.200
individual photon multiplied by the
number of photons the other thing that

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:57.210
number of photons the other thing that
 

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.510
number of photons the other thing that
he figured out then is that each photon

00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520
he figured out then is that each photon
 

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.050
he figured out then is that each photon
has an energy given by this wavelength

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:03.060
has an energy given by this wavelength
 

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.359
has an energy given by this wavelength
and so I'm going to do an analogy

00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:05.369
and so I'm going to do an analogy
 

00:55:05.369 --> 00:55:07.490
and so I'm going to do an analogy
because it's harder for us to feel the

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500
because it's harder for us to feel the
 

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:11.000
because it's harder for us to feel the
energy of light so we'll use gravity

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:11.010
energy of light so we'll use gravity
 

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:12.710
energy of light so we'll use gravity
that we all know about standing on the

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720
that we all know about standing on the
 

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.990
that we all know about standing on the
earth and that if we drop the ball from

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000
earth and that if we drop the ball from
 

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.540
earth and that if we drop the ball from
higher up it would be faster when it hit

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:17.550
higher up it would be faster when it hit
 

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.140
higher up it would be faster when it hit
the ground the higher up you can drop it

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:20.150
the ground the higher up you can drop it
 

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:26.240
the ground the higher up you can drop it
so now a red photon is a small photon so

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:26.250
so now a red photon is a small photon so
 

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:27.500
so now a red photon is a small photon so
we're going to imagine playing

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:27.510
we're going to imagine playing
 

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:32.240
we're going to imagine playing
basketball with a child-size basketball

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:32.250
basketball with a child-size basketball
 

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.089
basketball with a child-size basketball
net and so if it's a red photon playing

00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099
net and so if it's a red photon playing
 

00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:38.270
net and so if it's a red photon playing
basketball no matter how they try even

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280
basketball no matter how they try even
 

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.490
basketball no matter how they try even
up on their tippy toes they cannot reach

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500
up on their tippy toes they cannot reach
 

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.859
up on their tippy toes they cannot reach
that net to drop their electron through

00:55:42.859 --> 00:55:42.869
that net to drop their electron through
 

00:55:42.869 --> 00:55:45.260
that net to drop their electron through
and no matter how many of these

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:45.270
and no matter how many of these
 

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:48.349
and no matter how many of these
childlike photons there are the electron

00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359
childlike photons there are the electron
 

00:55:48.359 --> 00:55:49.760
childlike photons there are the electron
is never going to get through that

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:49.770
is never going to get through that
 

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:53.420
is never going to get through that
basketball net now if you have a green

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:53.430
basketball net now if you have a green
 

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:55.130
basketball net now if you have a green
light that's like an adults playing with

light that's like an adults playing with
 

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.920
light that's like an adults playing with
a child-size basketball net and they can

00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:57.930
a child-size basketball net and they can
 

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.470
a child-size basketball net and they can
actually dunk through but only barely

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480
actually dunk through but only barely
 

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.370
actually dunk through but only barely
they're only stay

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380
they're only stay

you go see so slow because it's just

the very Tolga people and so they're
 

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.090
the very Tolga people and so they're
well above the net and when they drop

well above the net and when they drop
 

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.280

boom a lot more speed but it wouldn't

it's about quantum mechanics but that's

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:44.670
it's about quantum mechanics but that's
 

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:46.370
it's about quantum mechanics but that's
not what I want you to concentrate on

not what I want you to concentrate on

not what I want you to concentrate on
what it really told us about how light

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:49.050
what it really told us about how light
 

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:51.470
what it really told us about how light
interacts with matter is that it's

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480
interacts with matter is that it's
 

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.110
interacts with matter is that it's
always one photon meeting up with one

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:54.120
always one photon meeting up with one
 

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.420
always one photon meeting up with one
atom at a time and they meet with each

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:56.430
atom at a time and they meet with each
 

00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:58.610
atom at a time and they meet with each
other and if that photon has enough

00:56:58.610 --> 00:56:58.620
other and if that photon has enough
 

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.890
other and if that photon has enough
energy more than the energy that the

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:00.900
energy more than the energy that the
 

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.620
energy more than the energy that the
atom is holding on to its electron it

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:03.630
atom is holding on to its electron it
 

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:05.180
atom is holding on to its electron it
can then send the electron on its way

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:05.190
can then send the electron on its way
 

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.370
can then send the electron on its way
and when there's more photons coming

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380
and when there's more photons coming
 

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.950
and when there's more photons coming
they interact with more atoms but always

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960
they interact with more atoms but always
 

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:13.180
they interact with more atoms but always
one photon meeting one atom at a time

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:13.190
one photon meeting one atom at a time
 

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:15.860
one photon meeting one atom at a time
and that's how we understood how light

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:15.870
and that's how we understood how light
 

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:18.080
and that's how we understood how light
interacted with matter through the

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:18.090
interacted with matter through the
 

00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.330
interacted with matter through the
beginning of the 20th century and then

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:20.340
beginning of the 20th century and then
 

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.690
beginning of the 20th century and then

her PhD in 1930 she published the paper

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140
her PhD in 1930 she published the paper
 

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:41.270
her PhD in 1930 she published the paper
in 1931 and I cited that 1931 paper in

in 1931 and I cited that 1931 paper in
 

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.150
in 1931 and I cited that 1931 paper in
my own PhD so I don't know why she

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160
my own PhD so I don't know why she
 

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.010
my own PhD so I don't know why she
thought about this right maybe she

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020
thought about this right maybe she
 

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:47.510
thought about this right maybe she
brought her woman's way of looking at

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520
brought her woman's way of looking at
 

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.730
brought her woman's way of looking at
science and thought why don't photons

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740
science and thought why don't photons
 

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:54.320

get along why don't vote on want to work

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:54.330
get along why don't vote on want to work
 

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:58.130
get along why don't vote on want to work
together right because if two photons

00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140
together right because if two photons
 

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.110
together right because if two photons
would just come into that atom at one

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:00.120
would just come into that atom at one
 

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.780
would just come into that atom at one
time they would share their energy and

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:02.790
time they would share their energy and
 

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:05.810
time they would share their energy and
two little red photons would have the

00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:05.820
two little red photons would have the
 

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:08.180
two little red photons would have the
same energy as one violet photon and

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:08.190
same energy as one violet photon and
 

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:11.690
same energy as one violet photon and
then the there we go

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700
then the there we go
 

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.060
then the there we go
it would have an electron come through

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:14.070
it would have an electron come through
 

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:15.160
it would have an electron come through
with pretty high speed

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:15.170
with pretty high speed
 

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:18.220
with pretty high speed
this is what we now call multiphoton

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:18.230
this is what we now call multiphoton
 

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:21.280
this is what we now call multiphoton
ionization because there's more than one

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:21.290
ionization because there's more than one
 

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:24.490
ionization because there's more than one

to call it that I don't know what she

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000
to call it that I don't know what she
 

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.690
to call it that I don't know what she
called it it's all in German um so so

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:31.700
called it it's all in German um so so
 

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.640
called it it's all in German um so so
now we could understand that but nobody

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:33.650
now we could understand that but nobody
 

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:34.299
now we could understand that but nobody
had seen it

00:58:34.299 --> 00:58:34.309
had seen it
 

00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:36.460
had seen it
don't forget I'm Stein was actually

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:36.470
don't forget I'm Stein was actually
 

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.309
don't forget I'm Stein was actually
sitting there wondering why the

00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319
sitting there wondering why the
 

00:58:38.319 --> 00:58:40.270
sitting there wondering why the
experimentalists were seen with Racine

00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280

Maria gave admirer I had nobody had seen
anything like this so I don't know what

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:44.630
anything like this so I don't know what
 

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:47.349
anything like this so I don't know what
made this woman think about it but in

00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359
made this woman think about it but in
 

00:58:47.359 --> 00:58:50.140
made this woman think about it but in
fact nobody would see this effect for

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:50.150
fact nobody would see this effect for
 

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:52.900
fact nobody would see this effect for

Michigan people in the audience that

00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119
Michigan people in the audience that
 

00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:01.569
Michigan people in the audience that
were the first people to see a

00:59:01.569 --> 00:59:01.579
were the first people to see a
 

00:59:01.579 --> 00:59:05.230
were the first people to see a
multiphoton effect now they were doing

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240
multiphoton effect now they were doing
 

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.049
multiphoton effect now they were doing
their experiment not with atoms that

00:59:08.049 --> 00:59:08.059
their experiment not with atoms that
 

00:59:08.059 --> 00:59:11.260
their experiment not with atoms that
would eject electrons but what happened

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:11.270
would eject electrons but what happened
 

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:15.250
would eject electrons but what happened
was that two red photons were

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:15.260
was that two red photons were
 

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.000
was that two red photons were
momentarily absorbed by an atom and then

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.010
momentarily absorbed by an atom and then
 

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:20.380
momentarily absorbed by an atom and then
when the atom wanted to let that energy

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:20.390
when the atom wanted to let that energy
 

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.510
when the atom wanted to let that energy
go it didn't let it go as two red

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520
go it didn't let it go as two red
 

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.170
go it didn't let it go as two red
photons it let it go as one photon with

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:26.180
photons it let it go as one photon with
 

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:28.420
photons it let it go as one photon with
twice the energy so you'll see then that

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:28.430
twice the energy so you'll see then that
 

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:31.870
twice the energy so you'll see then that
the wavelength here is half well does

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880
the wavelength here is half well does
 

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.430
the wavelength here is half well does
that looks less than half but whatever

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440
that looks less than half but whatever
 

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.789
that looks less than half but whatever
we'll call it a half kind of everything

00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799
we'll call it a half kind of everything
 

00:59:36.799 --> 00:59:39.309
we'll call it a half kind of everything
right anyway so this is now what we call

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319
right anyway so this is now what we call
 

00:59:39.319 --> 00:59:42.220
right anyway so this is now what we call
second harmonic generation all right

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:42.230
second harmonic generation all right
 

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:45.400
second harmonic generation all right
and we now see it more routinely

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:45.410
and we now see it more routinely
 

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:49.359
and we now see it more routinely
but this was something to see in 1961 so

00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:49.369
but this was something to see in 1961 so
 

00:59:49.369 --> 00:59:52.030
but this was something to see in 1961 so
then it begs the question why did it

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:52.040
then it begs the question why did it
 

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.780
then it begs the question why did it

already been mentioned in the previous
talk what was special about 1961 is that

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040
talk what was special about 1961 is that
 

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.500
talk what was special about 1961 is that
in 1960 the laser was born so because

light in lasers technologically it was
 

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.560
light in lasers technologically it was
easier to make a maser than a laser and

easier to make a maser than a laser and
so that was done in the 50s and they won

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280
so that was done in the 50s and they won
 

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.370
so that was done in the 50s and they won
a Nobel Prize but it was the precursor

01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:35.380
a Nobel Prize but it was the precursor
 

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.920
a Nobel Prize but it was the precursor
to the laser art shallow than one for

laser spectroscopy later on but he had a
 

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:42.960
laser spectroscopy later on but he had a

where I shine it you don't see it going

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:43.660
where I shine it you don't see it going
 

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.570
where I shine it you don't see it going
over there because the light's not going

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:45.580
over there because the light's not going
 

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.520
over there because the light's not going
into your eyes the light's going over

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:47.530
into your eyes the light's going over
 

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:50.400
into your eyes the light's going over
there so we already have it concentrated

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:50.410
there so we already have it concentrated
 

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:52.890
there so we already have it concentrated
into one beam you'll also see that the

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:52.900
into one beam you'll also see that the
 

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.720
into one beam you'll also see that the
layers is just one color and in the case

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:54.730

also the photons in the laser all talk

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:00.550
also the photons in the laser all talk
 

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.400
also the photons in the laser all talk
to each other and when one's out of

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:02.410
to each other and when one's out of
 

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:04.920
to each other and when one's out of
crest they're all at a crust and so each

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:04.930
crest they're all at a crust and so each
 

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.660
crest they're all at a crust and so each
of these photons are going together and

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:06.670
of these photons are going together and
 

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:08.220
of these photons are going together and
so they are making themselves to be a

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:08.230
so they are making themselves to be a
 

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:10.950
so they are making themselves to be a
giant wave and a giant wave means

01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960
giant wave and a giant wave means
 

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.170
giant wave and a giant wave means
there's the density of photons is

01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:13.180
there's the density of photons is
 

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.110
there's the density of photons is
greater so let's go back and think about

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:16.120
greater so let's go back and think about
 

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.990
greater so let's go back and think about
the linear case here's what they saw

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000
the linear case here's what they saw
 

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.860
the linear case here's what they saw

is not very high so also when you maybe

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:34.570

it's not going to a point
 

01:02:40.569 --> 01:02:42.959
it's not going to a point
we can only focus light down to a

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:42.969
we can only focus light down to a
 

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:46.739
we can only focus light down to a
wavelength so the light that we see is

01:02:46.739 --> 01:02:46.749
wavelength so the light that we see is
 

01:02:46.749 --> 01:02:48.630
wavelength so the light that we see is
about a half a micron the laser eye

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640
about a half a micron the laser eye
 

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.339
about a half a micron the laser eye
Bilt's one micron so we're gonna go with

01:02:50.339 --> 01:02:50.349
Bilt's one micron so we're gonna go with
 

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:52.499
Bilt's one micron so we're gonna go with
that one micron is a thousandth of a

that one micron is a thousandth of a
 

01:02:52.509 --> 01:02:54.929
that one micron is a thousandth of a
millimeter and so you can't focus your

01:02:54.929 --> 01:02:54.939
millimeter and so you can't focus your
 

01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:57.839
millimeter and so you can't focus your
beam any smaller than that to

01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:57.849
beam any smaller than that to
 

01:02:57.849 --> 01:02:59.849

dimension of an atom is an angstrom but

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:08.829
dimension of an atom is an angstrom but
 

01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:09.989

1/10 of a nanometer all right so this

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:17.049
1/10 of a nanometer all right so this
 

01:03:17.049 --> 01:03:19.049
1/10 of a nanometer all right so this

atom is actually ten thousand times
 

01:03:19.059 --> 01:03:21.329
atom is actually ten thousand times
smaller than you can focus the light so

01:03:21.329 --> 01:03:21.339
smaller than you can focus the light so
 

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.489

01:04:10.259 --> 01:04:12.329
celebrating 50 years of nonlinear optics
and I'll just tell you the people that

01:04:12.329 --> 01:04:12.339
and I'll just tell you the people that
 

01:04:12.339 --> 01:04:14.519
and I'll just tell you the people that
study molecules and atoms those are the

01:04:14.519 --> 01:04:14.529
study molecules and atoms those are the
 

01:04:14.529 --> 01:04:17.370
study molecules and atoms those are the
atomic physics types they say when they

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:17.380
atomic physics types they say when they
 

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.659
atomic physics types they say when they
watch in the atom that they're doing

01:04:18.659 --> 01:04:18.669
watch in the atom that they're doing
 

01:04:18.669 --> 01:04:20.640
watch in the atom that they're doing
multi photon physics those of us who

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:20.650
multi photon physics those of us who
 

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.949
multi photon physics those of us who
actually study light coming out we're

01:04:22.949 --> 01:04:22.959
actually study light coming out we're
 

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.989
actually study light coming out we're
doing nonlinear optics but to me it was

01:04:24.989 --> 01:04:24.999
doing nonlinear optics but to me it was
 

01:04:24.999 --> 01:04:27.899
doing nonlinear optics but to me it was
a very subtle difference so this man

01:04:27.899 --> 01:04:27.909
a very subtle difference so this man
 

01:04:27.909 --> 01:04:29.759
a very subtle difference so this man
wanted for nonlinear optics so here we

01:04:29.759 --> 01:04:29.769
wanted for nonlinear optics so here we
 

01:04:29.769 --> 01:04:32.069
wanted for nonlinear optics so here we
go we now have a chance of two photons

01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079
go we now have a chance of two photons
 

01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:36.749
go we now have a chance of two photons
so this gets me to my PhD sherrard gave

01:04:36.749 --> 01:04:36.759
so this gets me to my PhD sherrard gave
 

01:04:36.759 --> 01:04:38.789
so this gets me to my PhD sherrard gave
me a paper written by Stephen Harris of

01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799
me a paper written by Stephen Harris of
 

01:04:38.799 --> 01:04:41.549
me a paper written by Stephen Harris of
Stanford University and he had this idea

01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:41.559
Stanford University and he had this idea
 

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:44.459
Stanford University and he had this idea
that lasers were sort of stuck in the

01:04:44.459 --> 01:04:44.469
that lasers were sort of stuck in the
 

01:04:44.469 --> 01:04:46.709
that lasers were sort of stuck in the
visible to the infrared but we might

01:04:46.709 --> 01:04:46.719
visible to the infrared but we might
 

01:04:46.719 --> 01:04:49.019
visible to the infrared but we might
want this wonderful type of radiation in

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:49.029
want this wonderful type of radiation in
 

01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:53.069
want this wonderful type of radiation in
high-energy photons past the violet

01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079

maybe even out to the extreme
 

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:58.620
maybe even out to the extreme
ultraviolet so for that we can't just do

01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:58.630
ultraviolet so for that we can't just do
 

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:00.840

my paper that was only three pages long
 

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:28.260
my paper that was only three pages long
and got me this Nobel Prize only had one

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:28.270
and got me this Nobel Prize only had one
 

01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:31.350
and got me this Nobel Prize only had one
milli Joule of energy created it's also

all the energy you need to slice your

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:33.820
all the energy you need to slice your
 

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.120
all the energy you need to slice your
eyeball up it's all the energy you need

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.130
eyeball up it's all the energy you need
 

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:39.510
eyeball up it's all the energy you need
to cut glass and yet it doesn't hurt my

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520
to cut glass and yet it doesn't hurt my
 

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.600
to cut glass and yet it doesn't hurt my
hand at all and so what's the difference

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:42.610
hand at all and so what's the difference
 

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:45.600
hand at all and so what's the difference
well if I had shown that one second

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:45.610
well if I had shown that one second
 

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.700
well if I had shown that one second
pulse of light out to where the moon is

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:47.710
pulse of light out to where the moon is
 

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.590
pulse of light out to where the moon is
and I have no idea where the moon is but

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:49.600
and I have no idea where the moon is but
 

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.990
and I have no idea where the moon is but
and and I couldn't do it anyway it would

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000
and and I couldn't do it anyway it would
 

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.990
and and I couldn't do it anyway it would
be the beginning part of the pulse would

01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000
be the beginning part of the pulse would
 

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.790
be the beginning part of the pulse would
actually be this is always the one that

01:06:58.790 --> 01:06:58.800
actually be this is always the one that
 

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.160
actually be this is always the one that
oh there we go the front part of the

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:02.170
oh there we go the front part of the
 

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:04.650
oh there we go the front part of the
pulse would actually be 2/3 of the way

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:04.660

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:09.690
would leave the laser that's how fast
 

01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:12.500
would leave the laser that's how fast
light travels and so now in our

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:12.510
light travels and so now in our
 

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:14.960
light travels and so now in our
one-second pulse we have one millijoules

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:14.970
one-second pulse we have one millijoules
 

01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:17.720
one-second pulse we have one millijoules
of energy in this one-second long pulse

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:17.730
of energy in this one-second long pulse
 

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:20.089
of energy in this one-second long pulse
of light now what did the Franken group

01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099
of light now what did the Franken group
 

01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:23.060
of light now what did the Franken group
have in order to see that very first

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:23.070

was one millisecond long so that's a

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:33.300
was one millisecond long so that's a
 

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.290

you they had more than a millage all

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:39.990
you they had more than a millage all
 

01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:41.660
you they had more than a millage all
they had a Joule so they had a thousand

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:41.670
they had a Joule so they had a thousand
 

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:44.120
they had a Joule so they had a thousand
times shorter and a thousand times more

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:44.130

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.510
picosecond or just a third of a
millimeter so all of the many photons

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520
millimeter so all of the many photons
 

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.099
millimeter so all of the many photons
that would have stretched two-thirds of

01:08:10.099 --> 01:08:10.109
that would have stretched two-thirds of
 

01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:12.380
that would have stretched two-thirds of
the way to the moon were squeezed down

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:12.390
the way to the moon were squeezed down
 

01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:14.270
the way to the moon were squeezed down
till they were just a third of the

01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:14.280
till they were just a third of the
 

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.840
till they were just a third of the
millimeter we packed those photons in so

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:17.850
millimeter we packed those photons in so
 

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:20.780
millimeter we packed those photons in so
I know that my supervisor and colleague

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:20.790
I know that my supervisor and colleague
 

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:22.099
I know that my supervisor and colleague
will be coming up here and telling you

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:22.109
will be coming up here and telling you
 

01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:24.229
will be coming up here and telling you
all the amazing things this laser has

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239
all the amazing things this laser has
 

01:08:24.239 --> 01:08:26.720
all the amazing things this laser has
done for us I'm sure even some of them

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:26.730
done for us I'm sure even some of them
 

01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:28.220
done for us I'm sure even some of them
are gonna be he's gonna talk about

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:28.230
are gonna be he's gonna talk about
 

01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:30.860
are gonna be he's gonna talk about
things going on in space but I'm gonna

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:30.870
things going on in space but I'm gonna
 

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:35.809
things going on in space but I'm gonna
bring us back to earth I'm gonna bring

01:08:35.809 --> 01:08:35.819
bring us back to earth I'm gonna bring
 

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:37.729
bring us back to earth I'm gonna bring

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.570
Institute of optics at the University of
Rochester and I did my research here at

01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580
Rochester and I did my research here at
 

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.309
Rochester and I did my research here at
the laboratory for laser energetics and

01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319
the laboratory for laser energetics and
 

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:50.870
the laboratory for laser energetics and
there I am back in the day now inside

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880
there I am back in the day now inside
 

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.780
there I am back in the day now inside
this laboratory for laser energetics was

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:53.790
this laboratory for laser energetics was
 

01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:56.479
this laboratory for laser energetics was
this absolutely beautiful dye laser it

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:56.489
this absolutely beautiful dye laser it
 

01:08:56.489 --> 01:08:59.030
this absolutely beautiful dye laser it
was red and green and as I said it just

01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040
was red and green and as I said it just
 

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.950
was red and green and as I said it just
seemed like a Christmas tree to me and I

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960
seemed like a Christmas tree to me and I
 

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.900
seemed like a Christmas tree to me and I
wanted to work with Gerard and this

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:02.910
wanted to work with Gerard and this
 

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:05.840
wanted to work with Gerard and this
wonderful group it is a dye laser a dye

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:05.850
wonderful group it is a dye laser a dye
 

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.329
wonderful group it is a dye laser a dye
laser is a type of short pulse laser in

01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339
laser is a type of short pulse laser in
 

01:09:08.339 --> 01:09:10.789
laser is a type of short pulse laser in
fact this laser the pulses were actually

01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799
fact this laser the pulses were actually
 

01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:12.680
fact this laser the pulses were actually
ten times shorter than what I'm talking

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:12.690
ten times shorter than what I'm talking
 

01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:14.420
ten times shorter than what I'm talking
about so only a thirtieth of a

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:14.430
about so only a thirtieth of a
 

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.940
about so only a thirtieth of a
millimetre long so we had short laser

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:16.950
millimetre long so we had short laser
 

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:19.490
millimetre long so we had short laser
pulses problem is dye lasers don't like

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500
pulses problem is dye lasers don't like
 

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.450
pulses problem is dye lasers don't like
to grab their energy

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.460
to grab their energy
 

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.820
to grab their energy
and hang on to it so you can't get a big

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:22.830
and hang on to it so you can't get a big
 

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:24.770
and hang on to it so you can't get a big
energy dial user so you can have short

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:24.780
energy dial user so you can have short
 

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.930
energy dial user so you can have short
pulses but the reason that the

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940
pulses but the reason that the
 

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.520
pulses but the reason that the
laboratory for laser energetics was

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:28.530
laboratory for laser energetics was
 

01:09:28.530 --> 01:09:30.350
laboratory for laser energetics was
there was to study laser fusion and to

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:30.360
there was to study laser fusion and to
 

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.360
there was to study laser fusion and to
study laser fusion you need a big laser

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:32.370
study laser fusion you need a big laser
 

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:34.760
study laser fusion you need a big laser
and they had a big laser this was known

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:34.770
and they had a big laser this was known
 

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.850
and they had a big laser this was known
as the mega laser it was 24 beams and it

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:37.860
as the mega laser it was 24 beams and it
 

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.070
as the mega laser it was 24 beams and it
could produce a kilojoule of energy not

01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080
could produce a kilojoule of energy not
 

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.870
could produce a kilojoule of energy not
a millijoules a kilojoule that's a

01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880
a millijoules a kilojoule that's a
 

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.600
a millijoules a kilojoule that's a
million times more energy so in the

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:44.610
million times more energy so in the
 

01:09:44.610 --> 01:09:46.640
million times more energy so in the
laser lab we had short pulses and we had

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:46.650
laser lab we had short pulses and we had
 

01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:48.860
laser lab we had short pulses and we had
big energy lasers but we couldn't put

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:48.870
big energy lasers but we couldn't put
 

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:51.290
big energy lasers but we couldn't put
them together more than one problem one

01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:51.300
them together more than one problem one
 

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.960
them together more than one problem one
the dye laser had red photons and this

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:53.970
the dye laser had red photons and this
 

01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:56.090
the dye laser had red photons and this
one wants to amplify infrared photons so

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100
one wants to amplify infrared photons so
 

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.320
one wants to amplify infrared photons so
they wouldn't have spoken to each other

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:57.330
they wouldn't have spoken to each other
 

01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:59.240
they wouldn't have spoken to each other
but there was a bigger problem when

01:09:59.240 --> 01:09:59.250
but there was a bigger problem when
 

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.430
but there was a bigger problem when
people tried to put slightly short

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440
people tried to put slightly short
 

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.890
people tried to put slightly short
pulses even into these lasers what they

01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:03.900
pulses even into these lasers what they
 

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.080
pulses even into these lasers what they
found was that the rod would actually

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:06.090
found was that the rod would actually
 

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.630
found was that the rod would actually
get drilled all the way through and you

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640
get drilled all the way through and you
 

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.700
get drilled all the way through and you
were left with a very expensive piece of

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:10.710
were left with a very expensive piece of
 

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:13.040
were left with a very expensive piece of
glass that wasn't any good so that

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:13.050
glass that wasn't any good so that
 

01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:15.020
glass that wasn't any good so that
didn't so they had a stop trying to put

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:15.030
didn't so they had a stop trying to put
 

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:17.000
didn't so they had a stop trying to put
short pulses down their laser rods

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:17.010
short pulses down their laser rods
 

01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:19.460
short pulses down their laser rods
because these nonlinear optical effects

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:19.470
because these nonlinear optical effects
 

01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:21.770
because these nonlinear optical effects
were happening inside the laser rods and

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780
were happening inside the laser rods and
 

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.690
were happening inside the laser rods and
they were drilling holes all the way

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:23.700
they were drilling holes all the way
 

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.210
they were drilling holes all the way
through them so that was the conundrum

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:26.220
through them so that was the conundrum
 

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:28.660
through them so that was the conundrum
that we were in in the early 1980s and

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:28.670
that we were in in the early 1980s and
 

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:31.610
that we were in in the early 1980s and
then gerard had his beautiful idea so

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620
then gerard had his beautiful idea so
 

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:32.960
then gerard had his beautiful idea so
there are no pictures because i hate

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:32.970
there are no pictures because i hate
 

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:34.730
there are no pictures because i hate
having my picture taken i've had to get

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:34.740
having my picture taken i've had to get
 

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.440
having my picture taken i've had to get
used to it since october seconds but

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:36.450
used to it since october seconds but
 

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.480
used to it since october seconds but
there are no pictures which are night

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:38.490
there are no pictures which are night
 

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:40.280
there are no pictures which are night
together so we were out a meeting a few

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:40.290
together so we were out a meeting a few
 

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:43.430
together so we were out a meeting a few
years back and took this picture so this

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440
years back and took this picture so this
 

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.490
years back and took this picture so this
is a very simple beautiful idea this is

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:46.500
is a very simple beautiful idea this is
 

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.040
is a very simple beautiful idea this is
what we want here we want a lot of

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.050
what we want here we want a lot of
 

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:51.590
what we want here we want a lot of
energy we want it in a very short pulse

01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600
energy we want it in a very short pulse
 

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.140
energy we want it in a very short pulse
we just don't want that in our amplifier

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:54.150
we just don't want that in our amplifier
 

01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:55.850
we just don't want that in our amplifier
so if we don't want that in our

01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860
so if we don't want that in our
 

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:58.820
so if we don't want that in our
amplifier what can we do just start with

01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:58.830
amplifier what can we do just start with
 

01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:01.430
amplifier what can we do just start with
a short pulse strive to the naked a long

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440
a short pulse strive to the naked a long
 

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.830
a short pulse strive to the naked a long
pulse amplify it up and then about the

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840
pulse amplify it up and then about the
 

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.450
pulse amplify it up and then about the
end compress it all the way back down

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:08.460
end compress it all the way back down
 

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:11.660
end compress it all the way back down
and here you have what I like to call a

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:11.670
and here you have what I like to call a
 

01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:17.780
and here you have what I like to call a
laser hammer so now how did we actually

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:17.790
laser hammer so now how did we actually
 

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:19.850
laser hammer so now how did we actually
do it we're gonna go back to this lab

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860
do it we're gonna go back to this lab
 

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.430
do it we're gonna go back to this lab
because this was the lab I now you'll

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440
because this was the lab I now you'll
 

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.960
because this was the lab I now you'll
see I've changed the title of it even

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:23.970
see I've changed the title of it even
 

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:24.920
see I've changed the title of it even
though I'm showing you the very same

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:24.930
though I'm showing you the very same
 

01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:27.950
though I'm showing you the very same
laser and so the green beam is actually

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960
laser and so the green beam is actually
 

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.870
laser and so the green beam is actually
not a green laser this is the laser back

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880
not a green laser this is the laser back
 

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.300
not a green laser this is the laser back
here it's infrared you can't see the

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:32.310
here it's infrared you can't see the
 

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.160
here it's infrared you can't see the
beam coming out of the laser because

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:34.170
beam coming out of the laser because
 

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.840
beam coming out of the laser because
is infrared and we can't see it neither

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:35.850
is infrared and we can't see it neither
 

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:38.479
is infrared and we can't see it neither
can the camera the kind of mirrors that

01:11:38.479 --> 01:11:38.489
can the camera the kind of mirrors that
 

01:11:38.489 --> 01:11:41.180
can the camera the kind of mirrors that
we use in a laser lab direct just the

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:41.190
we use in a laser lab direct just the
 

01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:43.340
we use in a laser lab direct just the
color we want to direct and so this

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:43.350
color we want to direct and so this
 

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.439
color we want to direct and so this
green light bends at this mirror but the

01:11:45.439 --> 01:11:45.449
green light bends at this mirror but the
 

01:11:45.449 --> 01:11:47.780
green light bends at this mirror but the
infrared came on through it would have

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:47.790
infrared came on through it would have
 

01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:50.090
infrared came on through it would have
gone to a beam dump to protect all of us

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.100
gone to a beam dump to protect all of us
 

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.340
gone to a beam dump to protect all of us
from I feeling the heat of that very

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:52.350
from I feeling the heat of that very
 

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:56.419
from I feeling the heat of that very
strong laser and so that laser had the

01:11:56.419 --> 01:11:56.429
strong laser and so that laser had the
 

01:11:56.429 --> 01:11:58.430
strong laser and so that laser had the
same wavelength as the big neodymium

01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440
same wavelength as the big neodymium
 

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.800
same wavelength as the big neodymium
glass amplifiers that we wanted to use

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:00.810
glass amplifiers that we wanted to use
 

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:04.550
glass amplifiers that we wanted to use
so that was the laser I was to use you

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560
so that was the laser I was to use you
 

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.500
so that was the laser I was to use you
can also see there's simply no room in

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:06.510
can also see there's simply no room in
 

01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:09.439
can also see there's simply no room in
the end for me there this was one packed

optical fiber so why did we need this

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:22.230
optical fiber so why did we need this
 

01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:24.650
optical fiber so why did we need this
fiber well there was one advantage of

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:24.660
fiber well there was one advantage of
 

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.479
fiber well there was one advantage of
it's not why we needed it because there

01:12:26.479 --> 01:12:26.489
it's not why we needed it because there
 

01:12:26.489 --> 01:12:28.310
it's not why we needed it because there
was no room for me here once we had the

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320
was no room for me here once we had the
 

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.169
was no room for me here once we had the
light going down the fiber that fiber

01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179
light going down the fiber that fiber

at the other end of the building that

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:37.110
at the other end of the building that
 

01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:39.080
at the other end of the building that
was one thing but two other reasons that

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:39.090
was one thing but two other reasons that
 

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:41.630
was one thing but two other reasons that
we needed this fiber is that the laser

01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640
we needed this fiber is that the laser
 

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.580
we needed this fiber is that the laser
that pumped the dye laser it was not as

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:43.590
that pumped the dye laser it was not as
 

01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:45.380
that pumped the dye laser it was not as
short as we wanted and we needed more

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:45.390
short as we wanted and we needed more
 

01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:47.150
short as we wanted and we needed more
colors I'm going to explain why we

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:47.160
colors I'm going to explain why we
 

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.070
colors I'm going to explain why we
needed more colors I don't have time to

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080
needed more colors I don't have time to
 

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.840

tell you what nonlinear optical effect

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:50.850
tell you what nonlinear optical effect
 

01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:52.640
tell you what nonlinear optical effect
made the colors you'll just have to

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:52.650
made the colors you'll just have to
 

01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:55.160
made the colors you'll just have to
believe me that it did and then this is

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:55.170
believe me that it did and then this is
 

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.200
believe me that it did and then this is
the component though what we really

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:57.210
the component though what we really
 

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:59.419
the component though what we really
needed the fiber for this was our pulse

01:12:59.419 --> 01:12:59.429
needed the fiber for this was our pulse
 

01:12:59.429 --> 01:13:02.209
needed the fiber for this was our pulse
stretcher so first understand pulse

01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:02.219
stretcher so first understand pulse
 

01:13:02.219 --> 01:13:05.810
stretcher so first understand pulse
stretching we have to know why do we

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820
stretching we have to know why do we
 

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.850
stretching we have to know why do we
need a lot of colors in order to make a

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860
need a lot of colors in order to make a
 

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.640
need a lot of colors in order to make a
short pulse if you watch just one of

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:10.650
short pulse if you watch just one of
 

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:12.110
short pulse if you watch just one of
these colors and we can just do the red

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120
these colors and we can just do the red
 

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.350
these colors and we can just do the red
one you see it goes along there a red

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360
one you see it goes along there a red
 

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.290
one you see it goes along there a red
wave would go on forever now if you take

01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300
wave would go on forever now if you take
 

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.150
wave would go on forever now if you take
more colors and you say that you want

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:20.160
more colors and you say that you want
 

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.669
more colors and you say that you want
all of them to start here you will see

01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679
all of them to start here you will see
 

01:13:22.679 --> 01:13:24.620
all of them to start here you will see
that each wavelength starts to come

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:24.630
that each wavelength starts to come
 

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:27.550
that each wavelength starts to come
apart you don't have to go very far

01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560
apart you don't have to go very far
 

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.620
apart you don't have to go very far
until summer Peaks when others are

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:30.630
until summer Peaks when others are
 

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:32.959
until summer Peaks when others are
troughs and so if one waves a peak and

01:13:32.959 --> 01:13:32.969
troughs and so if one waves a peak and
 

01:13:32.969 --> 01:13:34.669
troughs and so if one waves a peak and
the other waves of trough they cancel

01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679
the other waves of trough they cancel
 

01:13:34.679 --> 01:13:37.130
the other waves of trough they cancel
each other out to be nothing and so the

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140
each other out to be nothing and so the
 

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.560
each other out to be nothing and so the
more colors you can add in the quicker

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:39.570
more colors you can add in the quicker
 

01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:42.500
more colors you can add in the quicker
you will get to where it's zero and so

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:42.510
you will get to where it's zero and so
 

01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:44.540
you will get to where it's zero and so
the more colors you have the shorter

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:44.550
the more colors you have the shorter
 

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:47.390
the more colors you have the shorter
pulse you have so we created the colors

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400
pulse you have so we created the colors
 

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.080
pulse you have so we created the colors
in the five

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:48.090
in the five
 

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:53.330
in the five
and now it's time to stretch it how does

01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340
and now it's time to stretch it how does
 

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:53.990
and now it's time to stretch it how does
that work

01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000
that work
 

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.540
that work
well in the way that light interacts

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:56.550
well in the way that light interacts
 

01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:58.970
well in the way that light interacts
with matter I said that the red photons

01:13:58.970 --> 01:13:58.980
with matter I said that the red photons
 

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.500
with matter I said that the red photons
have the least energy when they meet up

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:00.510
have the least energy when they meet up
 

01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:02.420
have the least energy when they meet up
with their atoms they sort of shake

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:02.430
with their atoms they sort of shake
 

01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:04.310
with their atoms they sort of shake
hands but then they say we have you know

01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320
hands but then they say we have you know
 

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.110
hands but then they say we have you know
have nothing in common off you go

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120
have nothing in common off you go
 

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.390
have nothing in common off you go
so they actually run faster than the

01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400
so they actually run faster than the
 

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.940
so they actually run faster than the
green and by the time it's a blue photon

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:10.950
green and by the time it's a blue photon
 

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:12.500
green and by the time it's a blue photon
they're actually considering some time

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:12.510
they're actually considering some time
 

01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:14.540
they're actually considering some time
do we or do we not want to interchange

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:14.550
do we or do we not want to interchange
 

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.430
do we or do we not want to interchange
your energy and it takes a little longer

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440
your energy and it takes a little longer
 

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.170
your energy and it takes a little longer
for that blue one to the side now and

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:18.180
for that blue one to the side now and
 

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:18.860
for that blue one to the side now and
keep on going

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:18.870
keep on going
 

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:22.670
keep on going
so now if you go down fiber you will see

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:22.680
so now if you go down fiber you will see
 

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.470
so now if you go down fiber you will see
that the red ran the green walked and

01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480
that the red ran the green walked and
 

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.180
that the red ran the green walked and
the blue sort of crawled and if you go

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:26.190
the blue sort of crawled and if you go
 

01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:28.430
the blue sort of crawled and if you go
down something like 1.4 kilometers of

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440
down something like 1.4 kilometers of
 

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.890
down something like 1.4 kilometers of
fiber well the red ran the green and now

01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:30.900
fiber well the red ran the green and now
 

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.050
fiber well the red ran the green and now
you have a long pulse so I want to

01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:33.060
you have a long pulse so I want to
 

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.510
you have a long pulse so I want to
explain the name of chirped pulse

01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520
explain the name of chirped pulse
 

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.970
explain the name of chirped pulse
amplification a birds chirp is called a

01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980
amplification a birds chirp is called a
 

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:39.770
amplification a birds chirp is called a
chirp because the sound frequency

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:39.780
chirp because the sound frequency
 

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:42.200
chirp because the sound frequency
changes in time through the note that

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:42.210
changes in time through the note that
 

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:44.840
changes in time through the note that
he's making so you'll see that in the

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:44.850
he's making so you'll see that in the
 

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:47.360
he's making so you'll see that in the
way to get a long pulse is to have the

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:47.370
way to get a long pulse is to have the
 

01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:49.280
way to get a long pulse is to have the
red frequencies out first

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:49.290
red frequencies out first
 

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:51.830
red frequencies out first
and then the green and then the blue so

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840
and then the green and then the blue so
 

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.420
and then the green and then the blue so
through our laser pulse now the

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:53.430
through our laser pulse now the
 

01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:55.310
through our laser pulse now the
frequency changes and that's called a

01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320
frequency changes and that's called a
 

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.990
frequency changes and that's called a
chirp it's called short pulse

01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000
chirp it's called short pulse
 

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.760
chirp it's called short pulse
amplification because this is an hour

01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:58.770
amplification because this is an hour
 

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:01.130
amplification because this is an hour
stretch pulse that we want to amplify up

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.140
stretch pulse that we want to amplify up
 

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:06.170
stretch pulse that we want to amplify up
so how does the amplification work so

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:06.180
so how does the amplification work so
 

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.900
so how does the amplification work so
it's it's some material that has some

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:08.910
it's it's some material that has some
 

01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:12.020
it's it's some material that has some
atoms and sitting there not doing

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:12.030
atoms and sitting there not doing
 

01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:14.270
atoms and sitting there not doing
anything they have to be excited by some

01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280
anything they have to be excited by some
 

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.980
anything they have to be excited by some
kind of energy source the original

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:15.990
kind of energy source the original
 

01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:17.750
kind of energy source the original
lasers and the laser that I used you

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760
lasers and the laser that I used you
 

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.210
lasers and the laser that I used you
just use flash lamps you'll see that it

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:20.220
just use flash lamps you'll see that it
 

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.180
just use flash lamps you'll see that it
lets up most not all most of the atoms

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:23.190
lets up most not all most of the atoms
 

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.850
lets up most not all most of the atoms
and a good storage medium we'll hang on

01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860
and a good storage medium we'll hang on
 

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.220
and a good storage medium we'll hang on
to that energy and stay excited until a

01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:28.230
to that energy and stay excited until a
 

01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:31.460
to that energy and stay excited until a
photon decides to come by so then you

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:31.470
photon decides to come by so then you
 

01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:34.460
photon decides to come by so then you
can have a photon come along and meet up

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:34.470
can have a photon come along and meet up
 

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:37.220
can have a photon come along and meet up
with an atom and because we've excited

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:37.230
with an atom and because we've excited
 

01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:38.960
with an atom and because we've excited
these atoms so they have the very same

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:38.970
these atoms so they have the very same
 

01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:40.670
these atoms so they have the very same
energy as the photon that we're going to

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:40.680
energy as the photon that we're going to
 

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.130
energy as the photon that we're going to
try to amplify they meet each other and

01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140
try to amplify they meet each other and
 

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.200
try to amplify they meet each other and
the photon says to the atom I'll take

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:45.210
the photon says to the atom I'll take
 

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:47.750
the photon says to the atom I'll take
your energy with me and now we have two

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760
your energy with me and now we have two
 

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.330
your energy with me and now we have two
photons and that atom lost its energy

01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:50.340
photons and that atom lost its energy
 

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:53.120
photons and that atom lost its energy
those two photons are marching in step

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:53.130
those two photons are marching in step
 

01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:55.520
those two photons are marching in step
together and they meet two more atoms

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:55.530
together and they meet two more atoms
 

01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:59.150
together and they meet two more atoms
and now we have four photons and we've

01:15:59.150 --> 01:15:59.160
and now we have four photons and we've
 

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.740
and now we have four photons and we've
given up two atoms of energy and

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:01.750
given up two atoms of energy and
 

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:04.530
given up two atoms of energy and
by the end we'll have eight photons and

01:16:04.530 --> 01:16:04.540
by the end we'll have eight photons and
 

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.170
by the end we'll have eight photons and
they've given up the app four more atoms

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:07.180
they've given up the app four more atoms
 

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.240
they've given up the app four more atoms
of energy now this is actually very

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:09.250
of energy now this is actually very
 

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.100
of energy now this is actually very
wasteful because you'll see that by the

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:11.110
wasteful because you'll see that by the
 

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:13.650
wasteful because you'll see that by the
end of it we've left most of the energy

01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:13.660
end of it we've left most of the energy
 

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.210
end of it we've left most of the energy
there in the amplifier so that's a

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:15.220
there in the amplifier so that's a
 

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.710
there in the amplifier so that's a
complete waste and we don't want to do

01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:16.720
complete waste and we don't want to do
 

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.690
complete waste and we don't want to do
that if it was a laser if we were

01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:18.700
that if it was a laser if we were
 

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.280
that if it was a laser if we were
putting mirrors on either end and have

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:20.290
putting mirrors on either end and have
 

01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:22.410
putting mirrors on either end and have
it go back and forth until we steal all

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:22.420
it go back and forth until we steal all
 

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.260
it go back and forth until we steal all
of that energy and this is then why we

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:25.270
of that energy and this is then why we
 

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:28.170
of that energy and this is then why we
have to keep building huge lasers if we

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:28.180
have to keep building huge lasers if we
 

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.870
have to keep building huge lasers if we
want a lot of energy the laser rod

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880
want a lot of energy the laser rod
 

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.060
want a lot of energy the laser rod
itself determines the energy per unit

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:33.070
itself determines the energy per unit
 

01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:35.610
itself determines the energy per unit
area that you can take and if you want

01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:35.620
area that you can take and if you want
 

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.980
area that you can take and if you want
to grab it all you actually have to put

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:37.990
to grab it all you actually have to put
 

01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:40.410
to grab it all you actually have to put
in almost that much energy to start so

01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:40.420
in almost that much energy to start so
 

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.320
in almost that much energy to start so
snowplow through and take the energy so

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:43.330
snowplow through and take the energy so
 

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:45.810
snowplow through and take the energy so
each amplification gets a certain energy

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:45.820
each amplification gets a certain energy
 

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.610
each amplification gets a certain energy
per unit area if you want more energy

01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:47.620
per unit area if you want more energy
 

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:50.730
per unit area if you want more energy
you must get make your beam bigger you

01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:50.740
you must get make your beam bigger you
 

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.620
you must get make your beam bigger you
must make your amplifier bigger and you

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:52.630
must make your amplifier bigger and you
 

01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:55.350
must make your amplifier bigger and you
plow through again the other thing I

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360
plow through again the other thing I
 

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.180
plow through again the other thing I
want to point out that is that the laser

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:57.190
want to point out that is that the laser
 

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:59.280
want to point out that is that the laser
material decides what's the energy per

01:16:59.280 --> 01:16:59.290
material decides what's the energy per
 

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:01.770
material decides what's the energy per
unit area but the nonlinear things that

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.480

can cause damage is the energy per unit

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:03.490
can cause damage is the energy per unit

you're using that determines how much
you must stretch the pulse so that you

01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:10.300
you must stretch the pulse so that you
 

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.480
you must stretch the pulse so that you
keep it below any kind of damage

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:12.490
keep it below any kind of damage
 

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:14.550
keep it below any kind of damage
threshold so that's why we would have to

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560
threshold so that's why we would have to
 

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.500
threshold so that's why we would have to
chirp based on the type of laser that we

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:16.510
chirp based on the type of laser that we
 

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:19.740
chirp based on the type of laser that we
used so now that we're amplified up it's

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:19.750
used so now that we're amplified up it's
 

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:22.830
used so now that we're amplified up it's
just time to compress and so with a pair

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840
just time to compress and so with a pair

answer was yes so we were very

01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280
answer was yes so we were very

copy that night in 1985 so what did we

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:18.610

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:21.450
copy that night in 1985 so what did we
do with it well remember I wanted to

01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:21.460

generation that proved too difficult so

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400
generation that proved too difficult so
 

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.010
generation that proved too difficult so
we're going to go back to the idea of

01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:26.020
we're going to go back to the idea of
 

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.890
we're going to go back to the idea of
multiphoton ionization and we thought

01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:28.900
multiphoton ionization and we thought
 

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.170
multiphoton ionization and we thought
that we would just kick that electron

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:31.180
that we would just kick that electron
 

01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.900
that we would just kick that electron
and give it so much energy that it would

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:33.910
and give it so much energy that it would
 

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:35.670
and give it so much energy that it would
be able to come out of this well that it

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:35.680
be able to come out of this well that it
 

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.340
be able to come out of this well that it
sits in in the atom and so all those

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:38.350
sits in in the atom and so all those
 

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:40.560
sits in in the atom and so all those
photons would come up and kick that

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:40.570
photons would come up and kick that
 

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:43.230
photons would come up and kick that
electron out that's what we were

01:18:43.230 --> 01:18:43.240
electron out that's what we were
 

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.750
electron out that's what we were
expecting to see but that's not what we

01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760
expecting to see but that's not what we
 

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.960
expecting to see but that's not what we
saw we have made such an intense laser

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:48.970
saw we have made such an intense laser
 

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:51.960
saw we have made such an intense laser
that the photons were packed in there so

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:51.970
that the photons were packed in there so
 

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:54.660
that the photons were packed in there so
tight we no longer had to worry about

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:54.670
tight we no longer had to worry about
 

01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:57.510
tight we no longer had to worry about
them being photons it was back to being

01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520
them being photons it was back to being
 

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.020
them being photons it was back to being
just one giant wave now although it's a

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:01.030
just one giant wave now although it's a
 

01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:03.330
just one giant wave now although it's a
short pulse wave so each crest gets a

01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:03.340
short pulse wave so each crest gets a
 

01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.100
short pulse wave so each crest gets a
little bit more intense and a little bit

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:05.110
little bit more intense and a little bit
 

01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:07.710
little bit more intense and a little bit
more intense and so what happens when

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:07.720
more intense and so what happens when
 

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.290
more intense and so what happens when
you have a giant wave is that it

01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:10.300
you have a giant wave is that it
 

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.600
you have a giant wave is that it
interacts with the atom that was sitting

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:12.610
interacts with the atom that was sitting
 

01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:14.130
interacts with the atom that was sitting
in its potential my head can be the

in its potential my head can be the
 

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.350
in its potential my head can be the
electron and it would the wave would

01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360
electron and it would the wave would
 

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.330
electron and it would the wave would
push it this way and then the wave would

01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:18.340
push it this way and then the wave would
 

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:20.250
push it this way and then the wave would
push it that way and then it pushed it

01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:20.260
push it that way and then it pushed it
 

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.560
push it that way and then it pushed it
more and it pushed it more and finally

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:22.570
more and it pushed it more and finally
 

01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:25.110
more and it pushed it more and finally
pushed it so much that electron was

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120
pushed it so much that electron was
 

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.260
pushed it so much that electron was
allowed to go out of the wealth but not

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:28.270

intensity lasers and so on you don't

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:17.250
intensity lasers and so on you don't
 

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:21.350
intensity lasers and so on you don't
need much more than that okay and so but

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360
need much more than that okay and so but
 

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.450
need much more than that okay and so but
I'm going to tell you what you can do

01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460
I'm going to tell you what you can do
 

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:28.120
I'm going to tell you what you can do
with that okay because it's true that

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:28.130
with that okay because it's true that
 

01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:31.490
with that okay because it's true that
it's only only recently but we had this

01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500
it's only only recently but we had this
 

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:37.130
it's only only recently but we had this
phenomenal intensity available and so

01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:37.140
phenomenal intensity available and so
 

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:41.360
phenomenal intensity available and so
there is many new discovery shall be

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:41.370
there is many new discovery shall be
 

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:45.590
there is many new discovery shall be
made okay so that's my patient all right

01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600
made okay so that's my patient all right
 

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:59.750
made okay so that's my patient all right
okay and so I can maybe act okay I can I

01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760
okay and so I can maybe act okay I can I
 

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.780
okay and so I can maybe act okay I can I
can i yeah so everything like Donna said

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:02.790
can i yeah so everything like Donna said
 

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:05.930
can i yeah so everything like Donna said

yes and this one thing you know which

01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:19.540
yes and this one thing you know which
 

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:24.900
yes and this one thing you know which
really strikes me about about light it's

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:24.910
really strikes me about about light it's
 

01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:29.160
really strikes me about about light it's
a variety of things we can do okay

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:29.170
a variety of things we can do okay
 

01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:36.720
a variety of things we can do okay
and as after ash Kingdom sorry showed

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:36.730
and as after ash Kingdom sorry showed
 

01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:39.450
and as after ash Kingdom sorry showed
but what you can do you know

01:26:39.450 --> 01:26:39.460
but what you can do you know
 

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.250
but what you can do you know
first thing is maybe you can slow down

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:41.260
first thing is maybe you can slow down
 

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:45.050
first thing is maybe you can slow down
at homes and it's a very very

01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060
at homes and it's a very very
 

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:48.630
at homes and it's a very very
interesting phenomenon we have seen with

01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:48.640
interesting phenomenon we have seen with
 

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:58.430
interesting phenomenon we have seen with
the tweezers and so on and this so

01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440

but we cannot really slow down the atoms

01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080
but we cannot really slow down the atoms
 

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:44.100

okay you can do just the opposite you

01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:06.820
okay you can do just the opposite you
 

01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:12.420
okay you can do just the opposite you
can accelerate particles and and you can

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:12.430
can accelerate particles and and you can
 

01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:15.180

anymore okay
 

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:14.979
anymore okay
so so we we did she build it and the CPA

01:34:14.979 --> 01:34:14.989
so so we we did she build it and the CPA
 

01:34:14.989 --> 01:34:18.520
so so we we did she build it and the CPA
and then we we cool really now we are

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:18.530
and then we we cool really now we are
 

01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:23.970
and then we we cool really now we are
not limited by by the breakdowns of

01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:23.980
not limited by by the breakdowns of
 

01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:27.189
not limited by by the breakdowns of
material loss and but and we could

01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199
material loss and but and we could
 

01:34:27.199 --> 01:34:30.250
material loss and but and we could
really climb up now the intensities and

01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:30.260
really climb up now the intensities and
 

01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:35.609
really climb up now the intensities and
now I mean since we 85 when we did it

01:34:35.609 --> 01:34:35.619
now I mean since we 85 when we did it
 

01:34:35.619 --> 01:34:38.800
now I mean since we 85 when we did it
the intensity have to say as increase

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:38.810
the intensity have to say as increase
 

01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:44.439
the intensity have to say as increase
anonymously okay eight or nine orders of

01:34:44.439 --> 01:34:44.449
anonymously okay eight or nine orders of
 

01:34:44.449 --> 01:34:47.830
anonymously okay eight or nine orders of
magnitude okay and it going to go

01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840
magnitude okay and it going to go
 

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.040
magnitude okay and it going to go
further up okay with with lasers like

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.050
further up okay with with lasers like
 

01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:56.229
further up okay with with lasers like
Apollo that is being built lasers which

01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239
Apollo that is being built lasers which
 

01:34:56.239 --> 01:34:58.410
Apollo that is being built lasers which
which is part of the Eloi

01:34:58.410 --> 01:34:58.420
which is part of the Eloi
 

01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:00.729
which is part of the Eloi
infrastructures you know and Gary and

01:35:00.729 --> 01:35:00.739
infrastructures you know and Gary and
 

01:35:00.739 --> 01:35:07.300
infrastructures you know and Gary and
and home mania and and and crag and so

01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:07.310
and home mania and and and crag and so
 

01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:08.259
and home mania and and and crag and so
on

01:35:08.259 --> 01:35:08.269
on
 

01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:11.950
on
so he's going up and as we are going up

01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960
so he's going up and as we are going up
 

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.580
so he's going up and as we are going up
you know of course we are traversing new

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:15.590
you know of course we are traversing new
 

01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:19.149
you know of course we are traversing new
regimes of physics so the first one you

01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159
regimes of physics so the first one you
 

01:35:19.159 --> 01:35:23.259
regimes of physics so the first one you
know we and Donna said it you know we we

01:35:23.259 --> 01:35:23.269
know we and Donna said it you know we we
 

01:35:23.269 --> 01:35:25.750
know we and Donna said it you know we we
started to really observe multiphoton

01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760
started to really observe multiphoton
 

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.890
started to really observe multiphoton
ionization differently and so on and and

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:29.900
ionization differently and so on and and
 

01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:36.149
ionization differently and so on and and
and and observe what she was saying I

01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159
and and observe what she was saying I
 

01:35:36.159 --> 01:35:37.479
and and observe what she was saying I
know

01:35:37.479 --> 01:35:37.489
know
 

01:35:37.489 --> 01:35:40.870
know
and so we climbed up this this means as

01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880
and so we climbed up this this means as
 

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.450
and so we climbed up this this means as
we climb up the intensity then we go

01:35:43.450 --> 01:35:43.460
we climb up the intensity then we go
 

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:47.649
we climb up the intensity then we go
into relativistic optics Y relativistic

01:35:47.649 --> 01:35:47.659
into relativistic optics Y relativistic
 

01:35:47.659 --> 01:35:51.069
into relativistic optics Y relativistic
optics because for the first times you

01:35:51.069 --> 01:35:51.079
optics because for the first times you
 

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:53.830
optics because for the first times you
know when you have when you can see

01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840
know when you have when you can see
 

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.370
know when you have when you can see
something this means that you have been

01:35:57.370 --> 01:35:57.380
something this means that you have been
 

01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:00.100
something this means that you have been
you have electrons with which are

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:00.110
you have electrons with which are
 

01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:02.109
you have electrons with which are
agitated and because they are agitated

01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:02.119
agitated and because they are agitated
 

01:36:02.119 --> 01:36:06.129
agitated and because they are agitated
they are really move producing light

01:36:06.129 --> 01:36:06.139
they are really move producing light
 

01:36:06.139 --> 01:36:08.669
they are really move producing light
which are coming and striking your eyes

01:36:08.669 --> 01:36:08.679
which are coming and striking your eyes
 

01:36:08.679 --> 01:36:13.330
which are coming and striking your eyes
okay so but in the case of when you are

01:36:13.330 --> 01:36:13.340
okay so but in the case of when you are
 

01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:16.540
okay so but in the case of when you are
passing 10 to be 18 watt per square

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:16.550
passing 10 to be 18 watt per square
 

01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:19.899
passing 10 to be 18 watt per square
centimeter so then what happened is now

01:36:19.899 --> 01:36:19.909
centimeter so then what happened is now
 

01:36:19.909 --> 01:36:24.430
centimeter so then what happened is now
the electrons in your atoms move by a

01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440
the electrons in your atoms move by a
 

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.750
the electrons in your atoms move by a
large amount and move at the speed of

01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:28.760
large amount and move at the speed of
 

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.660
large amount and move at the speed of
light so the electrons not to light but

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:31.670
light so the electrons not to light but
 

01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:34.450
light so the electrons not to light but
the electrons are really moving at the

01:36:34.450 --> 01:36:34.460
the electrons are really moving at the
 

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:37.180
the electrons are really moving at the
speed of light so so that's about two

01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:37.190
speed of light so so that's about two
 

01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:39.189
speed of light so so that's about two
very interesting regimes you know which

01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199
very interesting regimes you know which
 

01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:44.370
very interesting regimes you know which
leads to a lot of fact and and so on so

01:36:44.370 --> 01:36:44.380
leads to a lot of fact and and so on so
 

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:48.129
leads to a lot of fact and and so on so
now of course if you are pushing this is

01:36:48.129 --> 01:36:48.139
now of course if you are pushing this is
 

01:36:48.139 --> 01:36:50.290
now of course if you are pushing this is
what we are trying to do now if you are

01:36:50.290 --> 01:36:50.300
what we are trying to do now if you are
 

01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:52.810
what we are trying to do now if you are
pushing the intensity up you know like

01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:52.820
pushing the intensity up you know like
 

01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:54.549
pushing the intensity up you know like
we are trying to do it upon in the eye

01:36:54.549 --> 01:36:54.559
we are trying to do it upon in the eye
 

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:58.299
we are trying to do it upon in the eye
and so on the end you go into the you

01:36:58.299 --> 01:36:58.309
and so on the end you go into the you
 

01:36:58.309 --> 01:37:00.970
and so on the end you go into the you
travel atavistic regime and this time it

01:37:00.970 --> 01:37:00.980
travel atavistic regime and this time it
 

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:04.330
travel atavistic regime and this time it
is because not only the electrons don't

01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:04.340
is because not only the electrons don't
 

01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:07.569
is because not only the electrons don't
can be moved at the speed of light but

01:37:07.569 --> 01:37:07.579
can be moved at the speed of light but
 

01:37:07.579 --> 01:37:10.029
can be moved at the speed of light but
also the protons protons which are

01:37:10.029 --> 01:37:10.039
also the protons protons which are
 

01:37:10.039 --> 01:37:14.109
also the protons protons which are
massive they're 2,000 times the mass of

01:37:14.109 --> 01:37:14.119
massive they're 2,000 times the mass of
 

01:37:14.119 --> 01:37:18.129
massive they're 2,000 times the mass of
the electron so the massive but a 10 to

01:37:18.129 --> 01:37:18.139
the electron so the massive but a 10 to
 

01:37:18.139 --> 01:37:21.219
the electron so the massive but a 10 to
the 25 or so what Pascrell centimeters

01:37:21.219 --> 01:37:21.229
the 25 or so what Pascrell centimeters
 

01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:22.209
the 25 or so what Pascrell centimeters
they move

01:37:22.209 --> 01:37:22.219
they move
 

01:37:22.219 --> 01:37:23.770
they move
the speed of light and that's going to

01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:23.780
the speed of light and that's going to
 

01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:27.100
the speed of light and that's going to
be very important then finally if we

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:27.110
be very important then finally if we
 

01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:33.580
be very important then finally if we
push even the intensity even higher and

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:33.590
push even the intensity even higher and
 

01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:35.979
push even the intensity even higher and
I won't say exactly how we're going to

01:37:35.979 --> 01:37:35.989
I won't say exactly how we're going to
 

01:37:35.989 --> 01:37:38.080
I won't say exactly how we're going to
do that Jonathan wheeler indeed in the

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:38.090
do that Jonathan wheeler indeed in the
 

01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:41.050
do that Jonathan wheeler indeed in the
audience and can we can talk about it

01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:41.060
audience and can we can talk about it
 

01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:44.800
audience and can we can talk about it
but so we go into this regime where

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:44.810
but so we go into this regime where
 

01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:49.360
but so we go into this regime where
light interact with vacuum okay

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:49.370
light interact with vacuum okay
 

01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:53.290
light interact with vacuum okay
like my friend position says we are

01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:53.300
like my friend position says we are
 

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:58.860
like my friend position says we are
boiling the vacuum okay we are really

01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:58.870
 
 

01:37:58.870 --> 01:38:04.510
 
separating the particles real particles

01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520
separating the particles real particles
 

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:08.740
separating the particles real particles
and the article virtual particle in

01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:08.750
and the article virtual particle in
 

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:12.130
and the article virtual particle in
vacuum and this is what we can do and at

01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:12.140
vacuum and this is what we can do and at
 

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:15.580
vacuum and this is what we can do and at
this regime which is ten to the twenty

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:15.590
this regime which is ten to the twenty
 

01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:17.590
this regime which is ten to the twenty
eight twenty to twenty nine what Pascal

01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600
eight twenty to twenty nine what Pascal
 

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.780
eight twenty to twenty nine what Pascal
Santa materials okay and basically what

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:19.790
Santa materials okay and basically what
 

01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:23.229
Santa materials okay and basically what
we do is we materialize the value vacuum

01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:23.239
we do is we materialize the value vacuum
 

01:38:23.239 --> 01:38:29.880
we do is we materialize the value vacuum
okay anybody so moving right along okay

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:29.890
okay anybody so moving right along okay
 

01:38:29.890 --> 01:38:35.470
okay anybody so moving right along okay
so now just one thing if we go back to

01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:35.480
so now just one thing if we go back to
 

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.959
so now just one thing if we go back to
the regime's you know at ten to fourteen

01:38:37.959 --> 01:38:37.969
the regime's you know at ten to fourteen
 

01:38:37.969 --> 01:38:41.400
the regime's you know at ten to fourteen
and so on you know then we can really

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:41.410
and so on you know then we can really
 

01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:46.920
and so on you know then we can really
use this femtosecond lasers so we don't

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:46.930
use this femtosecond lasers so we don't
 

01:38:46.930 --> 01:38:53.800
use this femtosecond lasers so we don't
add for instance to to micro machines to

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:53.810
add for instance to to micro machines to
 

01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:56.680
add for instance to to micro machines to
remove to a blade material very very

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:56.690
remove to a blade material very very
 

01:38:56.690 --> 01:39:00.760
remove to a blade material very very
precisely the reason is femtosecond

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:00.770
precisely the reason is femtosecond
 

01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:04.270
precisely the reason is femtosecond
laser are so good for that is because if

01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:04.280
laser are so good for that is because if
 

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.709
laser are so good for that is because if
you are using for me number continues

01:39:05.709 --> 01:39:05.719
you are using for me number continues
 

01:39:05.719 --> 01:39:07.870
you are using for me number continues
laser and you're shining the continuous

01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880
laser and you're shining the continuous
 

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:12.220
laser and you're shining the continuous
lasers on the on the on a target then

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:12.230
lasers on the on the on a target then
 

01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:14.620
lasers on the on the on a target then
you are going finally to heat to all

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:14.630
you are going finally to heat to all
 

01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:17.020
you are going finally to heat to all
volumes over targets so you cannot

01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:17.030
volumes over targets so you cannot
 

01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:19.479
volumes over targets so you cannot
really micro machine with that now if

01:39:19.479 --> 01:39:19.489
really micro machine with that now if
 

01:39:19.489 --> 01:39:22.870
really micro machine with that now if
you are using pulses which are much

01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880
you are using pulses which are much
 

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.430
you are using pulses which are much
shorter nanosecond

01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:24.440
shorter nanosecond
 

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:30.100
shorter nanosecond
me nano secondly nanosecond pulses which

01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:30.110
me nano secondly nanosecond pulses which
 

01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:32.950
me nano secondly nanosecond pulses which
is for us is infinity you know it's very

01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960
is for us is infinity you know it's very
 

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.830
is for us is infinity you know it's very
long but you do better

01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840
long but you do better
 

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.140
long but you do better
because of course the heat doesn't have

01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:38.150
because of course the heat doesn't have
 

01:39:38.150 --> 01:39:40.750
because of course the heat doesn't have
the time to pop again between between

01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760
the time to pop again between between
 

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:47.620
the time to pop again between between
before the blockages it's it's molten

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:47.630
before the blockages it's it's molten
 

01:39:47.630 --> 01:39:50.860
before the blockages it's it's molten
and and then you have the femtosecond

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:50.870
and and then you have the femtosecond
 

01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:53.470
and and then you have the femtosecond
laser where you come with a very very

01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:53.480
laser where you come with a very very
 

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.170
laser where you come with a very very
short pulse and you deposit the energy

01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:56.180
short pulse and you deposit the energy
 

01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:01.360
short pulse and you deposit the energy
and the the temperature I mean hate

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:01.370
and the the temperature I mean hate
 

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:03.730
and the the temperature I mean hate
doesn't have the time to propagate and

01:40:03.730 --> 01:40:03.740
doesn't have the time to propagate and
 

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:08.410
doesn't have the time to propagate and
you make this very nice holes and it's a

01:40:08.410 --> 01:40:08.420
you make this very nice holes and it's a
 

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:13.450
you make this very nice holes and it's a
very very precise way to read oblate

01:40:13.450 --> 01:40:13.460
very very precise way to read oblate
 

01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:20.080
very very precise way to read oblate
materials and this gives you some idea

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:20.090
materials and this gives you some idea
 

01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:23.020
materials and this gives you some idea
you know of what we could do what we can

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:23.030
you know of what we could do what we can
 

01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:25.920
you know of what we could do what we can
do in fact we are easily now is really

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:25.930
do in fact we are easily now is really
 

01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:29.890
do in fact we are easily now is really
what widely known was he highly done

01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:29.900
what widely known was he highly done
 

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:34.300
what widely known was he highly done
everywhere and you can see that we can

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:34.310
everywhere and you can see that we can
 

01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:38.490
everywhere and you can see that we can
really make holes and so on very

01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:38.500
really make holes and so on very
 

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:39.760
really make holes and so on very
precisely

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:39.770
precisely
 

01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:42.040
precisely
there is no collateral damage and no

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:42.050
there is no collateral damage and no
 

01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:45.490
there is no collateral damage and no
one's very clean and very small okay you

01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:45.500
one's very clean and very small okay you
 

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.890
one's very clean and very small okay you
see but we have feature size which is

01:40:47.890 --> 01:40:47.900
see but we have feature size which is
 

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:50.410
see but we have feature size which is
less than a micrometers you know in in

01:40:50.410 --> 01:40:50.420
less than a micrometers you know in in
 

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:55.810
less than a micrometers you know in in
size and no damages so of course now one

01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:55.820
size and no damages so of course now one
 

01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:00.160
size and no damages so of course now one
beautiful way to use this with this this

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:00.170
beautiful way to use this with this this
 

01:41:00.170 --> 01:41:05.380
beautiful way to use this with this this
laser is to is to do I surgery because

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:05.390
laser is to is to do I surgery because
 

01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:08.560
laser is to is to do I surgery because
after all eyes you know is some magical

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:08.570
after all eyes you know is some magical
 

01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:12.370
after all eyes you know is some magical
tissue and also is not the kind of

01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:12.380
tissue and also is not the kind of
 

01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:14.710
tissue and also is not the kind of
things where you have to be accurate

01:41:14.710 --> 01:41:14.720
things where you have to be accurate
 

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:18.670
things where you have to be accurate
with eyes and so we thought about that

01:41:18.670 --> 01:41:18.680
with eyes and so we thought about that
 

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:22.780
with eyes and so we thought about that
in fact we thought because we had with

01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:22.790
in fact we thought because we had with
 

01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:26.500
in fact we thought because we had with
little mishap happening in my lab and

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:26.510
little mishap happening in my lab and
 

01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:31.330
little mishap happening in my lab and
this is one of one of my students within

01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:31.340
this is one of one of my students within
 

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:36.070
this is one of one of my students within
the audience you know got a line into

01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080
the audience you know got a line into
 

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.450
the audience you know got a line into
laser cutter laser in his eyes and and

01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:40.460
laser cutter laser in his eyes and and
 

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.430
laser cutter laser in his eyes and and
immediately you know for me to to the

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440
immediately you know for me to to the
 

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.730
immediately you know for me to to the
students you know to the hospital and

01:41:44.730 --> 01:41:44.740
students you know to the hospital and
 

01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:49.220
students you know to the hospital and
they made the met after largest we

01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:49.230
they made the met after largest we
 

01:41:49.230 --> 01:41:55.729
they made the met after largest we
also here on Kurt and and so honkers

01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739
also here on Kurt and and so honkers
 

01:41:55.739 --> 01:41:59.959
also here on Kurt and and so honkers
look at the detail do eyes both are here

01:41:59.959 --> 01:41:59.969
look at the detail do eyes both are here
 

01:41:59.969 --> 01:42:04.609
look at the detail do eyes both are here
and say wow this is very strange

01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619
and say wow this is very strange
 

01:42:04.619 --> 01:42:10.660
and say wow this is very strange
and yes you got hit by the laser but

01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:10.670
and yes you got hit by the laser but
 

01:42:10.670 --> 01:42:12.260
and yes you got hit by the laser but
it's strange

01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:12.270
it's strange
 

01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:14.540
it's strange
and so detail do you see what is strange

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:14.550
and so detail do you see what is strange
 

01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:17.510
and so detail do you see what is strange
well it's strange because the damage on

01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520
well it's strange because the damage on
 

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.879
well it's strange because the damage on
your retina is perfect so that

01:42:21.879 --> 01:42:21.889
your retina is perfect so that
 

01:42:21.889 --> 01:42:24.919
your retina is perfect so that
immediately you know of course you know

01:42:24.919 --> 01:42:24.929
immediately you know of course you know
 

01:42:24.929 --> 01:42:26.839
immediately you know of course you know
we had the University of Michigan you

01:42:26.839 --> 01:42:26.849
we had the University of Michigan you
 

01:42:26.849 --> 01:42:29.990
we had the University of Michigan you
know excited about it they put some

01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000
know excited about it they put some
 

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.810
know excited about it they put some
money in it and and and then we add but

01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820
money in it and and and then we add but
 

01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.120
money in it and and and then we add but
started the field of femtosecond laser

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:35.130
started the field of femtosecond laser
 

01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:39.290
started the field of femtosecond laser
which is a very very important field ok

01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300
which is a very very important field ok
 

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.049
which is a very very important field ok
so this is just just to give you an idea

01:42:42.049 --> 01:42:42.059
so this is just just to give you an idea
 

01:42:42.059 --> 01:42:47.530
so this is just just to give you an idea
what we can do you know on on the on the

01:42:47.530 --> 01:42:47.540
what we can do you know on on the on the
 

01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:50.899
what we can do you know on on the on the
cornea we can use it all kinds of things

01:42:50.899 --> 01:42:50.909
cornea we can use it all kinds of things
 

01:42:50.909 --> 01:42:56.450
cornea we can use it all kinds of things
now we can on enough technology and so

01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460
now we can on enough technology and so
 

01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:58.040
now we can on enough technology and so
it was very exciting

01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:58.050
it was very exciting
 

01:42:58.050 --> 01:43:01.580
it was very exciting
in fact so if you are I'm just show here

01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:01.590
in fact so if you are I'm just show here
 

01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:07.120
in fact so if you are I'm just show here
if you have 50 picosecond laser which is

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:07.130
if you have 50 picosecond laser which is
 

01:43:07.130 --> 01:43:12.620
if you have 50 picosecond laser which is
long for us ok and if you have 310 toes

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:12.630
long for us ok and if you have 310 toes
 

01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:14.600
long for us ok and if you have 310 toes
are gone you can you see we can really

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:14.610
are gone you can you see we can really
 

01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:18.200
are gone you can you see we can really
create this flap you know very very

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:18.210
create this flap you know very very
 

01:43:18.210 --> 01:43:22.160
create this flap you know very very
nicely you know and this is being done

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:22.170
nicely you know and this is being done
 

01:43:22.170 --> 01:43:28.100
nicely you know and this is being done
you know now as I saw also a few few of

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:28.110
you know now as I saw also a few few of
 

01:43:28.110 --> 01:43:30.140
you know now as I saw also a few few of
the largest here in the audience and

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:30.150
the largest here in the audience and
 

01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:35.020
the largest here in the audience and
right so now I I had I had a movie

01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:35.030
right so now I I had I had a movie
 

01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:40.370
right so now I I had I had a movie
showing this creation of a flap but I

01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:40.380
showing this creation of a flap but I
 

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.100
showing this creation of a flap but I
have to say that and some cup after some

01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:43.110
have to say that and some cup after some
 

01:43:43.110 --> 01:43:45.020
have to say that and some cup after some
comments people say well if you show

01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:45.030
comments people say well if you show
 

01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:48.919
comments people say well if you show
this this this movie maybe some people

01:43:48.919 --> 01:43:48.929
this this this movie maybe some people
 

01:43:48.929 --> 01:43:50.959
this this this movie maybe some people
are not going to stand it you know for

01:43:50.959 --> 01:43:50.969
are not going to stand it you know for
 

01:43:50.969 --> 01:43:53.270
are not going to stand it you know for
because it's so I'm I'm not going to

01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280
because it's so I'm I'm not going to
 

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.270
because it's so I'm I'm not going to
show it okay and I will save some time

01:43:58.270 --> 01:43:58.280
show it okay and I will save some time
 

01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:01.250
show it okay and I will save some time
but anyway if you want really to talk

01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260
but anyway if you want really to talk
 

01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:02.839
but anyway if you want really to talk
about that here your stay

01:44:02.839 --> 01:44:02.849
about that here your stay
 

01:44:02.849 --> 01:44:05.779
about that here your stay
cellist at least real at least we a

01:44:05.779 --> 01:44:05.789
cellist at least real at least we a
 

01:44:05.789 --> 01:44:08.719
cellist at least real at least we a
specialist you know on this thing here

01:44:08.719 --> 01:44:08.729
specialist you know on this thing here
 

01:44:08.729 --> 01:44:15.049
specialist you know on this thing here
okay down let's go back to my to my my

01:44:15.049 --> 01:44:15.059
okay down let's go back to my to my my
 

01:44:15.059 --> 01:44:20.479
okay down let's go back to my to my my
roadmap here and so as I said you so we

roadmap here and so as I said you so we
 

01:44:20.489 --> 01:44:22.729
roadmap here and so as I said you so we
were here for a short while and now we

01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739
were here for a short while and now we
 

01:44:22.739 --> 01:44:25.639
were here for a short while and now we
are climbing up as I said we are in this

01:44:25.639 --> 01:44:25.649
are climbing up as I said we are in this
 

01:44:25.649 --> 01:44:29.060
are climbing up as I said we are in this
area right now and what's exciting here

01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:29.070
area right now and what's exciting here
 

01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:35.500
area right now and what's exciting here
you know one we are like this right yeah

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:35.510
you know one we are like this right yeah
 

01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:40.750
you know one we are like this right yeah
when we when you are in this area of of

01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760
when we when you are in this area of of
 

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.259
when we when you are in this area of of
you know 10 to the 20 and 25 weeks ago

01:44:45.259 --> 01:44:45.269
you know 10 to the 20 and 25 weeks ago
 

01:44:45.269 --> 01:44:48.560
you know 10 to the 20 and 25 weeks ago
when you are shining the laser over a

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:48.570
when you are shining the laser over a
 

01:44:48.570 --> 01:44:51.529
when you are shining the laser over a
really small size I mean sports spots

01:44:51.529 --> 01:44:51.539
really small size I mean sports spots
 

01:44:51.539 --> 01:44:54.279
really small size I mean sports spots
eyes like donna said wavelength of light

01:44:54.279 --> 01:44:54.289
eyes like donna said wavelength of light
 

01:44:54.289 --> 01:44:57.560
eyes like donna said wavelength of light
then you have producing with amongest

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:57.570
then you have producing with amongest
 

01:44:57.570 --> 01:45:00.580
then you have producing with amongest
intensities and you are producing

01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:00.590
intensities and you are producing
 

01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:05.089
intensities and you are producing
particles you know of any kind of

01:45:05.089 --> 01:45:05.099
particles you know of any kind of

now it is really we were talking last

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:51.930
now it is really we were talking last
 

01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:56.330
now it is really we were talking last
night with Olga this is ready is the

01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340
night with Olga this is ready is the
 

01:47:56.340 --> 01:48:00.910
night with Olga this is ready is the
future for electron accelerations and

01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920
future for electron accelerations and
 

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:04.670
future for electron accelerations and
for is because we have example problems

01:48:04.670 --> 01:48:04.680
for is because we have example problems
 

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:07.310
for is because we have example problems
in in high energy physics the other

01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320
in in high energy physics the other
 

01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.230
in in high energy physics the other
problems because they have to build this

01:48:09.230 --> 01:48:09.240
problems because they have to build this
 

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:13.280
problems because they have to build this
huge accelerators here you have the CERN

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:13.290
huge accelerators here you have the CERN
 

01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:18.850
huge accelerators here you have the CERN
accelerator and see 27 kilometer in

01:48:18.850 --> 01:48:18.860
accelerator and see 27 kilometer in
 

01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:22.670
accelerator and see 27 kilometer in
confluence yeah you know and about 70

01:48:22.670 --> 01:48:22.680
confluence yeah you know and about 70
 

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.300
confluence yeah you know and about 70
meters underground so it is really of

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:26.310
meters underground so it is really of
 

01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:30.359
meters underground so it is really of
course it cost enormous amount of in

01:48:30.359 --> 01:48:30.369
course it cost enormous amount of in
 

01:48:30.369 --> 01:48:34.799
course it cost enormous amount of in
of of money and now because for the the

01:48:34.799 --> 01:48:34.809
of of money and now because for the the
 

01:48:34.809 --> 01:48:37.319
of of money and now because for the the
next step the next next Collider is

01:48:37.319 --> 01:48:37.329
next step the next next Collider is
 

01:48:37.329 --> 01:48:40.859
next step the next next Collider is
going to be even bigger okay and will

01:48:40.859 --> 01:48:40.869
going to be even bigger okay and will
 

01:48:40.869 --> 01:48:46.799
going to be even bigger okay and will
cost in an affordable amount of money so

01:48:46.799 --> 01:48:46.809
cost in an affordable amount of money so
 

01:48:46.809 --> 01:48:49.290
cost in an affordable amount of money so
really it is very important really to

01:48:49.290 --> 01:48:49.300
really it is very important really to
 

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:52.649
really it is very important really to
come to come and and with the new

01:48:52.649 --> 01:48:52.659
come to come and and with the new
 

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:55.199
come to come and and with the new
technology and you think that if you are

01:48:55.199 --> 01:48:55.209
technology and you think that if you are
 

01:48:55.209 --> 01:48:58.679
technology and you think that if you are
ready we placing the technology use

01:48:58.679 --> 01:48:58.689
ready we placing the technology use
 

01:48:58.689 --> 01:49:03.479
ready we placing the technology use
right now in this in this case for

01:49:03.479 --> 01:49:03.489
right now in this in this case for
 

01:49:03.489 --> 01:49:07.040
right now in this in this case for
instance which is using radiofrequency

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:07.050
instance which is using radiofrequency
 

01:49:07.050 --> 01:49:12.209
instance which is using radiofrequency
microwave and so on where you have the

01:49:12.209 --> 01:49:12.219
microwave and so on where you have the
 

01:49:12.219 --> 01:49:14.850
microwave and so on where you have the
gradients is of the order of less than

01:49:14.850 --> 01:49:14.860

principal okay turn on a football field

01:49:45.239 --> 01:49:45.249
principal okay turn on a football field
 

01:49:45.249 --> 01:49:50.969
principal okay turn on a football field
okay so this is pretty good okay but you

01:49:50.969 --> 01:49:50.979
okay so this is pretty good okay but you
 

01:49:50.979 --> 01:49:53.819
okay so this is pretty good okay but you
know of course we like with toshi to

01:49:53.819 --> 01:49:53.829
know of course we like with toshi to
 

01:49:53.829 --> 01:49:59.669
know of course we like with toshi to
look ahead all the time and so some

01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679
look ahead all the time and so some
 

01:49:59.679 --> 01:50:03.060
look ahead all the time and so some
people you know in agencies difficulty

01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:03.070
people you know in agencies difficulty
 

01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:06.299
people you know in agencies difficulty
to see that you know and and but anyway

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:06.309
to see that you know and and but anyway
 

01:50:06.309 --> 01:50:10.199
to see that you know and and but anyway
this way we are okay and so we like to

01:50:10.199 --> 01:50:10.209
this way we are okay and so we like to
 

01:50:10.209 --> 01:50:14.850
this way we are okay and so we like to
look ahead and so right now let me tell

01:50:14.850 --> 01:50:14.860
look ahead and so right now let me tell
 

01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:19.020
look ahead and so right now let me tell
you but we can produce now something

01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:19.030
you but we can produce now something
 

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:24.509
you but we can produce now something
like devices GeV devices centimeter size

01:50:24.509 --> 01:50:24.519
like devices GeV devices centimeter size
 

01:50:24.519 --> 01:50:29.219
like devices GeV devices centimeter size
okay now we can produce up to 5 GeV but

01:50:29.219 --> 01:50:29.229
okay now we can produce up to 5 GeV but
 

01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:33.239
okay now we can produce up to 5 GeV but
5 GV is is something like 10 centimeter

01:50:33.239 --> 01:50:33.249
5 GV is is something like 10 centimeter
 

01:50:33.249 --> 01:50:38.580
5 GV is is something like 10 centimeter
nap okay and yes we could really maybe

01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:38.590
nap okay and yes we could really maybe
 

01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:42.209
nap okay and yes we could really maybe
put turn on the football field but could

01:50:42.209 --> 01:50:42.219
put turn on the football field but could
 

01:50:42.219 --> 01:50:43.980
put turn on the football field but could
we - but much better

01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:43.990
we - but much better
 

01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:47.280
we - but much better
than that and right now the reason is

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:47.290
than that and right now the reason is
 

01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:52.890
than that and right now the reason is
yes yes we cool

01:50:52.890 --> 01:50:52.900
yes yes we cool
 

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:58.080
yes yes we cool
in fact I'm not putting your leg here

01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:58.090
in fact I'm not putting your leg here
 

01:50:58.090 --> 01:51:06.050
in fact I'm not putting your leg here
okay I week already in fact next the

01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.060
okay I week already in fact next the
 

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:08.850
okay I week already in fact next the
accelerator kind of TeV accelerator on

01:51:08.850 --> 01:51:08.860
accelerator kind of TeV accelerator on
 

01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:13.130
accelerator kind of TeV accelerator on
the fingertip and by by doing what okay

01:51:13.130 --> 01:51:13.140
the fingertip and by by doing what okay
 

01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:17.520
the fingertip and by by doing what okay
instead of using gas which has which has

01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:17.530
instead of using gas which has which has
 

01:51:17.530 --> 01:51:23.280
instead of using gas which has which has
a very low density of electrons then we

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:23.290
a very low density of electrons then we
 

01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:26.360
a very low density of electrons then we
have to use will act like to use solid

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:26.370
have to use will act like to use solid
 

01:51:26.370 --> 01:51:32.040
have to use will act like to use solid
solid and so you have six order of

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:32.050
solid and so you have six order of
 

01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:35.940
solid and so you have six order of
magnitude larger amount of electrons

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:35.950
magnitude larger amount of electrons
 

01:51:35.950 --> 01:51:38.100
magnitude larger amount of electrons
okay because we are working also with

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:38.110
okay because we are working also with
 

01:51:38.110 --> 01:51:43.350
okay because we are working also with
gas at low low density gas and and then

01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360
gas at low low density gas and and then
 

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:45.930
gas at low low density gas and and then
but you say Wow but I mean now light

01:51:45.930 --> 01:51:45.940
but you say Wow but I mean now light
 

01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.880
but you say Wow but I mean now light
won't be able to propagate through the

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:47.890
won't be able to propagate through the
 

01:51:47.890 --> 01:51:52.680
won't be able to propagate through the
solid at this very high intensity and so

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:52.690
solid at this very high intensity and so
 

01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:56.280
solid at this very high intensity and so
so okay fine but if we can if we can

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:56.290
so okay fine but if we can if we can
 

01:51:56.290 --> 01:52:01.860
so okay fine but if we can if we can
really develop high I intensity x-ray

01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:01.870
really develop high I intensity x-ray
 

01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:05.400
really develop high I intensity x-ray
now but is instead of busy working in a

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:05.410
now but is instead of busy working in a
 

01:52:05.410 --> 01:52:08.510
now but is instead of busy working in a
visible work in the x-ray regime then

01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520
visible work in the x-ray regime then
 

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:12.480
visible work in the x-ray regime then
with the x-rays high intensity can

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:12.490
with the x-rays high intensity can
 

01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:17.550
with the x-rays high intensity can
penetrate into into the salad and to

01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560
penetrate into into the salad and to
 

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:21.180
penetrate into into the salad and to
produce this Wakefield this is exactly

01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:21.190
produce this Wakefield this is exactly
 

01:52:21.190 --> 01:52:23.310

a big application coming back to to

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:07.010
a big application coming back to to
 

01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:09.890
a big application coming back to to
societal applications there's a very

01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900
societal applications there's a very
 

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:12.410
societal applications there's a very
important applications if you can

01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:12.420
important applications if you can
 

01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:16.820
important applications if you can
produce beams of particles let's suppose

01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:16.830
produce beams of particles let's suppose
 

01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:18.770
produce beams of particles let's suppose
that you can put we can really produce

01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:18.780
that you can put we can really produce
 

01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:22.750
that you can put we can really produce
beams of protons well you know protons

01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:22.760
beams of protons well you know protons
 

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:26.090
beams of protons well you know protons
therapy per exam for cancer and so on is

01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100
therapy per exam for cancer and so on is
 

01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:31.190
therapy per exam for cancer and so on is
really the the the really the therapy of

01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:31.200
really the the the really the therapy of
 

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:35.060
really the the the really the therapy of
choice okay because the protons not like

01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:35.070
choice okay because the protons not like
 

01:54:35.070 --> 01:54:38.300
choice okay because the protons not like
other radiation of particles they don't

01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:38.310
other radiation of particles they don't
 

01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:42.680
other radiation of particles they don't
burn the tissue between bit between

burn the tissue between bit between
 

01:54:42.690 --> 01:54:48.680
burn the tissue between bit between
really the the skin and the tumors you

01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:48.690
really the the skin and the tumors you
 

01:54:48.690 --> 01:54:53.930
really the the skin and the tumors you
can really address tumor ask almost you

01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940
can really address tumor ask almost you
 

01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:56.180
can really address tumor ask almost you
know uniquely so you can deposit your

01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:56.190
know uniquely so you can deposit your
 

01:54:56.190 --> 01:55:02.660
know uniquely so you can deposit your
proton exactly in a tumor now also what

01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:02.670
proton exactly in a tumor now also what
 

01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:05.960
proton exactly in a tumor now also what
is nice about having a high intensity

01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:05.970
is nice about having a high intensity
 

01:55:05.970 --> 01:55:10.229
is nice about having a high intensity
lasers is you can make particles

01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239
lasers is you can make particles
 

01:55:10.239 --> 01:55:13.229
lasers is you can make particles
these particles you know can be had your

01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:13.239
these particles you know can be had your
 

01:55:13.239 --> 01:55:16.140
these particles you know can be had your
nucleotides and and so on and you can

01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:16.150
nucleotides and and so on and you can
 

01:55:16.150 --> 01:55:20.970
nucleotides and and so on and you can
use them you know to implant these

01:55:20.970 --> 01:55:20.980
use them you know to implant these
 

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:26.970
use them you know to implant these
particles into into the near the tumor

01:55:26.970 --> 01:55:26.980
particles into into the near the tumor
 

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:32.310
particles into into the near the tumor
or in the tumor of the patient also you

01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320
or in the tumor of the patient also you
 

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:40.799
or in the tumor of the patient also you
can use these these I do isotopes and so

01:55:40.799 --> 01:55:40.809
can use these these I do isotopes and so
 

01:55:40.809 --> 01:55:44.069
can use these these I do isotopes and so
on but you know which in order to do all

01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:44.079
on but you know which in order to do all
 

01:55:44.079 --> 01:55:47.910
on but you know which in order to do all
kind of diagnostics and so on so this

01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920
kind of diagnostics and so on so this
 

01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.709
kind of diagnostics and so on so this
this CPA I mean CPA high intensity or

01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719
this CPA I mean CPA high intensity or
 

01:55:52.719 --> 01:55:55.830
this CPA I mean CPA high intensity or
extremely light in the extremely extreme

01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840
extremely light in the extremely extreme
 

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.339
extremely light in the extremely extreme
light intense intensity or lasers you

01:55:59.339 --> 01:55:59.349
light intense intensity or lasers you
 

01:55:59.349 --> 01:56:01.709
light intense intensity or lasers you
know are very very used but will be very

01:56:01.709 --> 01:56:01.719
know are very very used but will be very
 

01:56:01.719 --> 01:56:07.379
know are very very used but will be very
useful in in in in medical world now

01:56:07.379 --> 01:56:07.389
useful in in in in medical world now
 

01:56:07.389 --> 01:56:11.040
useful in in in in medical world now
just also another egg applications but

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:11.050
just also another egg applications but
 

01:56:11.050 --> 01:56:13.229
just also another egg applications but
this is dreaming what I like to do in

01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:13.239
this is dreaming what I like to do in
 

01:56:13.239 --> 01:56:16.319
this is dreaming what I like to do in
anyway so I did that all my life and

01:56:16.319 --> 01:56:16.329
anyway so I did that all my life and
 

01:56:16.329 --> 01:56:21.379
anyway so I did that all my life and
when I made my living with that and so

01:56:21.379 --> 01:56:21.389
when I made my living with that and so
 

01:56:21.389 --> 01:56:25.470
when I made my living with that and so
anyway so just one one really big

01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:25.480
anyway so just one one really big
 

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.830
anyway so just one one really big
problem we have and this also together

01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840
problem we have and this also together
 

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:33.450
problem we have and this also together
with Toshi while working on it and by

01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:33.460
with Toshi while working on it and by
 

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.939
with Toshi while working on it and by
the way we're not working because it's

01:56:35.939 --> 01:56:35.949
the way we're not working because it's
 

01:56:35.949 --> 01:56:38.970
the way we're not working because it's
easy what's going to be working on it

01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:38.980
easy what's going to be working on it
 

01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:42.479
easy what's going to be working on it
because it's difficult okay and what we

01:56:42.479 --> 01:56:42.489
because it's difficult okay and what we
 

01:56:42.489 --> 01:56:47.180
because it's difficult okay and what we
want her to do is to transmute transmute

01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:47.190
 
 

01:56:47.190 --> 01:56:50.009
 
nuclear waste because we have all

01:56:50.009 --> 01:56:50.019
nuclear waste because we have all
 

01:56:50.019 --> 01:56:53.239
nuclear waste because we have all
nuclear energy it may be the best

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:53.249
nuclear energy it may be the best
 

01:56:53.249 --> 01:56:56.310
nuclear energy it may be the best
candidate for the future but you are

01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320
candidate for the future but you are
 

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:59.790
candidate for the future but you are
still you are still you know left with a

01:56:59.790 --> 01:56:59.800
still you are still you know left with a
 

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:04.169
still you are still you know left with a
lot of his junk dangerous junk and and

01:57:04.169 --> 01:57:04.179
lot of his junk dangerous junk and and
 

01:57:04.179 --> 01:57:06.989
lot of his junk dangerous junk and and
that's reason Toshi you invented the

01:57:06.989 --> 01:57:06.999
that's reason Toshi you invented the
 

01:57:06.999 --> 01:57:10.080
that's reason Toshi you invented the
terms now toilet science it's time to do

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:10.090
terms now toilet science it's time to do
 

01:57:10.090 --> 01:57:12.720
terms now toilet science it's time to do
toilets and it's time to to clean up

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:12.730
toilets and it's time to to clean up
 

01:57:12.730 --> 01:57:16.109
toilets and it's time to to clean up
what we have produced you know producing

01:57:16.109 --> 01:57:16.119
what we have produced you know producing
 

01:57:16.119 --> 01:57:19.589
what we have produced you know producing
energy and so on for our living and so

01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599
energy and so on for our living and so
 

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:23.910
energy and so on for our living and so
and so the idea now of course is

01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920
and so the idea now of course is
 

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.790
and so the idea now of course is
is we have to find ways okay to mitigate

01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800
is we have to find ways okay to mitigate
 

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.970
is we have to find ways okay to mitigate
you know this you can't waste in one way

01:57:33.970 --> 01:57:33.980
you know this you can't waste in one way
 

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:37.960
you know this you can't waste in one way
will be maybe to transmute this this

01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:37.970
will be maybe to transmute this this
 

01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:43.510
will be maybe to transmute this this
this nuclear waste into a new new new

01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520
this nuclear waste into a new new new
 

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:48.910
this nuclear waste into a new new new
form of atoms which are not which don't

01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:48.920
form of atoms which are not which don't
 

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:51.460
form of atoms which are not which don't
have this problem of radioactivity and

01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:51.470
have this problem of radioactivity and
 

01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:54.790
have this problem of radioactivity and
so what you have to do is to change the

01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800
so what you have to do is to change the
 

01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:59.440
so what you have to do is to change the
making of the nucleus okay of so for me

01:57:59.440 --> 01:57:59.450
making of the nucleus okay of so for me
 

01:57:59.450 --> 01:58:02.130
making of the nucleus okay of so for me
now if you have a if you have a nucleus

01:58:02.130 --> 01:58:02.140
now if you have a if you have a nucleus
 

01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.490
now if you have a if you have a nucleus
items a okay and you have a isotope a

01:58:06.490 --> 01:58:06.500
items a okay and you have a isotope a
 

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:09.910
items a okay and you have a isotope a
and which is maybe like active for a

01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920
and which is maybe like active for a
 

01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.310
and which is maybe like active for a
long time so that attracted me example

01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320
long time so that attracted me example
 

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:15.220
long time so that attracted me example
of technician for instance and which can

01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:15.230
of technician for instance and which can
 

01:58:15.230 --> 01:58:17.680
of technician for instance and which can
be radioactive for hundred thousand of

01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:17.690
be radioactive for hundred thousand of
 

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:20.710
be radioactive for hundred thousand of
years then if you can if you can hurry

01:58:20.710 --> 01:58:20.720
years then if you can if you can hurry
 

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:26.350
years then if you can if you can hurry
large a a neutrons because now we have

01:58:26.350 --> 01:58:26.360
large a a neutrons because now we have
 

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:28.450
large a a neutrons because now we have
freedom we we know that we can produce

01:58:28.450 --> 01:58:28.460
freedom we we know that we can produce
 

01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:31.030
freedom we we know that we can produce
any kind of particles you know including

01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040
any kind of particles you know including
 

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:34.510
any kind of particles you know including
neutrons we can produce neutrons you

01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520
neutrons we can produce neutrons you
 

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:37.660
neutrons we can produce neutrons you
know in in this in nucleus then you are

01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:37.670
know in in this in nucleus then you are
 

01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:43.120
know in in this in nucleus then you are
changing the isotope a B but this time

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:43.130
changing the isotope a B but this time
 

01:58:43.130 --> 01:58:47.440
changing the isotope a B but this time
it can have ready now radioactivity time

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:47.450
it can have ready now radioactivity time
 

01:58:47.450 --> 01:58:52.690
it can have ready now radioactivity time
wheel is of the order of seconds of

01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:52.700
wheel is of the order of seconds of
 

01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:56.110
wheel is of the order of seconds of
course this is most favorable case but

01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:56.120
course this is most favorable case but
 

01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:58.990
course this is most favorable case but
so we will I try to extend the concept

01:58:58.990 --> 01:58:59.000
so we will I try to extend the concept
 

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.400
so we will I try to extend the concept
you know to to of course so nuclear

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:03.410
you know to to of course so nuclear
 

01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:05.740
you know to to of course so nuclear
wastes which are really polluting our

01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:05.750
wastes which are really polluting our
 

01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:09.550
wastes which are really polluting our
life right now so and so by the way

01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:09.560
life right now so and so by the way
 

01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:12.250
life right now so and so by the way
sometimes you have a lucky and this

01:59:12.250 --> 01:59:12.260
sometimes you have a lucky and this
 

01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:16.690
sometimes you have a lucky and this
isotope B becomes isotope C and it's

01:59:16.690 --> 01:59:16.700
isotope B becomes isotope C and it's
 

01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:21.990
isotope B becomes isotope C and it's
it's stable so it doesn't emit anything

01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000
 
 

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:28.600
 
so in conclusion for me is extreme light

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:28.610
so in conclusion for me is extreme light
 

01:59:28.610 --> 01:59:31.930
so in conclusion for me is extreme light
is capable of generating the largest

01:59:31.930 --> 01:59:31.940

01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:36.190
is capable of generating the largest
field the largest accelerations the

01:59:36.190 --> 01:59:36.200
field the largest accelerations the
 

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.419
field the largest accelerations the
largest amperage

01:59:37.419 --> 01:59:37.429
largest amperage
 

01:59:37.429 --> 01:59:41.500
largest amperage
and the largest pressure just with

01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:41.510
and the largest pressure just with
 

01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:44.740
and the largest pressure just with
flight mazing and it carries the best

01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:44.750
flight mazing and it carries the best
 

01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:46.990
flight mazing and it carries the best
hope and opportunity for the future of

01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000
hope and opportunity for the future of
 

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:52.689

know we are doing this very rich field
right now

02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280
right now
 

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:06.910
right now
a field of extreme light but I think the

02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920
a field of extreme light but I think the
 

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:08.919
a field of extreme light but I think the
best is yet to come

02:00:08.919 --> 02:00:08.929
best is yet to come
 

02:00:08.929 --> 02:00:10.760
best is yet to come
