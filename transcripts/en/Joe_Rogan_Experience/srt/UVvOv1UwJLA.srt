1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,260
Well, I, I was there,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,300
I went to Stockholm twice in Oslo
twice and Helsinki twice and, and,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,180
and Copenhagen once in the last month.

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:13,530
And I spent quite a bit of
a lot of interviews, um,

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,980
and a lot of discussion about
the so called gender paradox.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,340
Now it's a very interesting thing cause
it's really put their tails into not in

7
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,810
Scandinavia. And,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,900
and that makes sense because
the Scandinavians are
going to have to deal with

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:29,901
this first because they've
gone the farthest down the
road for like making their

10
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:35,700
society gender equal. Explain
that to people. I will. I will.

11
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,534
Okay. So,

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,620
so imagine first of all that there's
two kinds of equality that you might

13
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,454
pursue.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,560
One would be equality of opportunity and
so that would mean that um, you know,

15
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:51,090
there's, there's wide range of talent
across people regardless of their type,

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,860
whatever that might be. Sex,
gender, race, ethnicity,

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,560
there's, there's talent
distributed everywhere.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,800
And it's a kind of a truism.

19
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:04,680
And I would say a truism of
the West in the deepest sense,

20
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:08,520
that each of the individuals within
those groups should be put in a position

21
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:13,440
where they, their talents are, they're
encouraged to manifest those talents,

22
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,290
partly because that would be good for
them spiritually and psychologically,

23
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,500
but also because that would be of
obvious benefit to the community, right?

24
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:22,170
I mean, talents rare, which
people don't understand.

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,720
There's lots of different
kinds of talent, but it's,

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,280
but in each domain it's rare.

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,440
And so it's to everyone's benefit to
exploit talented people to the maximum

28
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:33,960
possible degree. So even
if you're just selfish,

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,760
you want to push for equality
of opportunity because
the more talented people

30
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:42,270
there are out there, the more cool stuff
you get to have. And hopefully the,

31
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,330
the more diverse and
interesting your life is. So,

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,510
so you can pursue equality
of opportunity, um,

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,720
policies and the
Scandinavians have done that,

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,190
especially trying to knock down
barriers for women in the workplace.

35
00:01:56,191 --> 00:02:00,540
And by all accounts, by
all standard theories,

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,680
the Scandinavian countries in places
like, like ho, like the Netherlands,

37
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,730
Canada to to a slightly lesser
degree, um, have done, uh,

38
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,040
have gone farther than any other
countries in pursuing those, um,

39
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,560
policies. Okay. And, and,

40
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:21,750
and part of the consequence of that is
that some of the differences between men

41
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:24,540
and women have been minimized.

42
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,050
So obviously there's far more women in
the workplace and there were 40 years ago

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,590
and in many occupations there's
actually dominance by women.

44
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:32,910
There's dominance in the universities,

45
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,470
there's dominance in
the healthcare fields.

46
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,690
And so women have poured
into the workplace.

47
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,160
And hypothetically there's problems with
that because it's put a lot of stress

48
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,630
on family structure. But
hypothetically, that's for the best.

49
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,230
And because it gives people a broader
range of choices and it gives everyone

50
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:52,530
access to more talent. So, and then
also if you look around the world,

51
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,240
you see that one of
the best predictors of,

52
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,170
of the probability of economic development
in developing countries is their

53
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:02,260
attitude is the attitude in those
countries towards equal rights for women.

54
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,400
And it looks causal.

55
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,230
The more positively the country
is predisposed to female rights,

56
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,090
the more likely they are
to develop economically.

57
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,180
And maybe that's because that indicates
that they're open to new ideas or

58
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,480
something like that or open
to transformation. So, okay,

59
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,920
so that's one kind of equality.

60
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,430
Open up the playing field so that
everybody has a chance to compete and

61
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,470
cooperate and land and
land where they will.

62
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,890
But then the other kind of equality
is equality of outcome. So,

63
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,130
and that's often described as
equity in today's language.

64
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,130
And so the ultimate equity
utopia would be take every job,

65
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,360
every conceivable kind of job,

66
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,640
and then stratify that by
every conceivable level of
authority within every job

67
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,210
and then ensure that every single category
of person is represented in precise

68
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,750
proportion to their, to their
prevalence in the population.

69
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,140
So every job should be 50% women and
50% man and say 13% non Western ethnic

70
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:04,150
minority and whatever that happens to be.

71
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,210
And then you could break that
down and so and otherwise,

72
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,330
there's evidence of
systemic prejudice. Okay.

73
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:14,260
Now first thing to say about
that is that's impossible.

74
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,000
And the reason it's impossible is because
there's no limit to the number of ways

75
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,360
that you can categorize people
into groups. So you know, you,

76
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,720
you know about sex and ethnicity and
race, maybe those are the obvious ones,

77
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:29,230
but now you have gender and then
you have ethnicity and you know,

78
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,020
and then there's attractiveness and
intelligence and temperament and,

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,580
and height and age and, and, and
socioeconomic background. And I mean,

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,550
let's say there's 20 but
there's a lot more than that.

81
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,300
There's no possible way that you could
ever regulate a society so tightly that

82
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,270
every single one of those groups was
equally represented in every single one of

83
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:56,830
those occupations at every single level
of the hierarchy that concentrate on the

84
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,780
significant ones, men and women and race.

85
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,230
But who's to say those are the
significant ones? That's the other thing.

86
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,410
It isn't even obvious that they are
because I would say that like a more

87
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:09,610
significant one is cognitive ability
because that's a way bigger predictor of

88
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,830
longterm life success than sex or race.

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,420
So I don't even think that
we've necessarily identified
the canonical groups.

90
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:20,260
We've just decided that gender and race
are the, maybe they're the most obvious.

91
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:20,531
Right.

92
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:24,460
But isn't there a problem is that people
don't [inaudible] what they don't do is

93
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:28,600
they don't take in, in terms of cognitive
ability, they don't get on a team.

94
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,250
They don't get on like there's people
that are sexist. Yeah. But there's,

95
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:37,990
it's very rare that someone is elitist
in terms of their cognitive ability.

96
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,970
Well, hard to say Joe.

97
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:44,020
I mean I think one of the reasons that
elite is prejudiced is a better word.

98
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,660
I don't know. I mean you
could be right, but look,

99
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:48,790
I think one of the
reasons that like if you,

100
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
here's something that's kind of cute.

101
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,020
It makes sense now that I'm thinking
about it. Of course they are. Well,

102
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:56,230
there's one thing that's quite peculiar
about the United States in that regard

103
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,900
is like most working
class people, let's say,

104
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,460
are far more irritated with the
intellectual elite than they are with the

105
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,360
wealthy elite.

106
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,830
And that's because they think they
could become wealthy and they could,

107
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,010
but they don't think they could
become part of the intellectual elite.

108
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,860
And it isn't obvious to me
that the intellectual elite,

109
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,070
so those would be the liberal left
leaning types that dominate the media and

110
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:23,900
academia are particularly,
um, positive in their,

111
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,520
in their attitudes towards the
typical working class person.

112
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,360
I think they're prejudiced and elitist.
I do believe that that's the case.

113
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:36,170
And I think there are also, um,
what would you call it? Patronizing.

114
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,730
And I think that the typical working
class person say who voted for Trump is

115
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,140
very, very sensitive to that.

116
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,190
And so they're much more concerned with
the 1% who are the cognitive elite than

117
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:50,000
they are the 1% who are the economic
elite because at least they think that's a

118
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:53,780
game they could play. So anyways, anyway,

119
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,870
it's also because there's caricature
is right of the 1% of the economically,

120
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,120
you just think of people that are in
these lofty positions that are in control

121
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,380
of the financial institutions.

122
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,670
But the 1% of the intellectually you
think of in terms of like some of the more

123
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:12,230
preposterous things you hearing out of
universities now and safe spaces and Oh

124
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,920
yeah, there's that too. There's
that too. There's no, well,

125
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,890
there's no appreciation on the part
of the intellectual elite for the

126
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:22,970
pathologies of rational of
rationalism. Right? I mean there's no,

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,410
there's nothing stupid or than a
smart person who went wrong. You know,

128
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:30,740
like you, you can Tang on, I've, I've
seen this in my clients, you know,

129
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,491
frequently,

130
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:36,320
like if I have a particularly smart
client who's particularly disordered in

131
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:40,130
their personality, that that's just,
that's often just, that's so difficult.

132
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:43,430
It's almost unimaginable because they're
so good at rationalizing. For example,

133
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,280
what is your approach to handling some
blind that who's like super intelligent

134
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,930
but yet completely their life is in
disarray? Well, you know, I'm, I usually,

135
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,890
I usually take a very practical approach.
Like, you know, we try to identify,

136
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,410
cause I start always
in my therapy practice,

137
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,570
I always start with behavioral
principles. It's like, okay,

138
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:06,260
well let's see if we can
identify a few areas, you know,

139
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,890
through negotiation that are really
causing you grief and misery. You know,

140
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,530
like what's, what's wrong with your
life as far as you're concerned.

141
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,950
And so that often takes a
lot of discussion and then
we might try to figure out

142
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:19,850
what's causing that. And that's often
very difficult to figure out too.

143
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,180
Cause it might be, jeez it might
be something physical, you know,

144
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:26,630
you might be sick in some way cause
depression is lots of depression is

145
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,320
autoimmune related and and anxiety
can be a side effect of all sorts of

146
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:34,040
physiological disorders or eating
improperly or sleeping badly or,

147
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,150
or not exercising, you know enough
to kind of keep yourself regulated.

148
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,470
She tried to figure out what,

149
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,490
what's causing it and then you try to
sketch out some possible solution that we

150
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:47,690
could both test. And then
with the, with the, uh,

151
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,910
with the more intelligent ones, you know,

152
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:52,820
often they can come up with all sorts
of reasons why none of this is going to

153
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:56,280
work or, or a thousand. Why? Yeah.

154
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,890
While usually a thousand reasons
why none of this is going to work.

155
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,360
And that with people like that,

156
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:03,780
sometimes it's useful to turn to
their dreams if, if they dream.

157
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,720
Because one of the things that's cool
about dreams is that even though they're

158
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,520
hard to interpret, they never lie.

159
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,210
And so sometimes you can take someone
who's hyper rational and the how of a

160
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:13,740
dream, and they'll tell you the dream.

161
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,250
And then you can work
through an interpretation,
which is a tricky business.

162
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,790
And the dream will tell them something
and there's just no denying it.

163
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:24,330
It's like, well, it's a statement
from nature. So what are you gonna do?

164
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,350
You're gonna pretend that that's
not the case. And also, so that's,

165
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:32,340
that's often extremely
useful. So, so, okay,

166
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:35,730
so while back to the equality issue,
so, okay, so here's what's happened.

167
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,960
So psychologists have, and
this is what's putting a tail,

168
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,610
not in the tail of the Scandinavians.

169
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,780
Psychologists have come to a pretty decent
agreement about standard personality

170
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,990
models, right? So there's extroversion,
neuroticism, agreeableness,

171
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,190
openness and conscientiousness. And they
look fairly stable cross-culturally.

172
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,880
And that was all done by
asking thousands of people,

173
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,180
hundreds and hundreds of questions
and then grouping them statistically.

174
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,310
So it was atheoretical.

175
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,340
Basically it took computational power
and statistics to find out that these are

176
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,390
how traits group. So I'm an extroverted,

177
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:16,440
people are sociable and happy and
neurotic people experience a fair bit of

178
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,200
negative emotion. So that's the positive
and negative emotion dimensions.

179
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,930
Agreeable people are
maternal and disagreeable,

180
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,140
people are competitive and there's a
fair bit of male female difference.

181
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:28,830
They're conscientious. People are
dutiful and industrious and orderly,

182
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,430
and the open people are creative. And
so those are your basic five dimensions.

183
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,670
Okay? So that's been established and
everyone more or less agrees on it.

184
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,050
Now maybe there's seven dimensions
and we've got a questionnaire that,

185
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,610
that that breaks the five down into
10 that's called understand myself.

186
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,660
Um, but, but basically there's good,

187
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,250
there's good consensus consent,
consensus on the five. Okay,

188
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:55,470
so now as soon as you have
the five basic traits,

189
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:58,080
you can ask some questions like,
well, do men and women differ?

190
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,560
And so what you do is you
just give the questionnaire.

191
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,740
You can either fill it out yourself or
have other people fill it out on your

192
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:08,240
behalf. So, and it could be a teacher,
could be a parent, you know, and,

193
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,303
and that's all being done.

194
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,690
And what you find is there are systematic
differences between men and women.

195
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,100
And the biggest differences are that
women experience more negative emotion and

196
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:20,580
that and that they're more
agreeable than men. So,

197
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:24,660
and that's born out by the
psychiatric evidence because um,

198
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,670
higher levels of negative emotion are
manifested in depression and anxiety and

199
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,600
women are diagnosed with higher levels
of depression and anxiety all around the

200
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:36,090
world. And with agreeableness,

201
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,940
that's also born out by
the clinical literature.

202
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:42,570
In some sense the medical literature
sociomedical literature because

203
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,410
disagreeable people are more likely to
be incarcerated because it's the best

204
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,170
predictor of being incarcerated even
though it's not a very good predictor.

205
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,560
And men are incarcerated at about a 10
to one rate compared to women and are

206
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,820
more likely to be antisocial
and conduct disorder.

207
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,890
So the personality differences are
mirrored in the sociomedical literature.

208
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,040
Okay, so the, so now, so there are
differences, but then there's a question,

209
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,360
are those differences a consequence of
socialization or are they biological?

210
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,850
And the answer to that is tricky because
how much something is social and how

211
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:16,810
much it is biological actually
depends on the social circumstances.

212
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,520
So while here's an example,

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,680
if you have a society where no one has
enough to eat and people are starving,

214
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,540
then there's a huge cultural
effect on people's intelligence.

215
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,390
Let's say that's mediated
by economic factors,

216
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,470
even though it's got a biological
origin, right? That's the starvation.

217
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,210
So the relationship between biology and
culture is actually partly culturally

218
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:42,790
dependent. So it makes it
complicated. But in any case,

219
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,370
here's how the scientists decided
to address this. They thought, well,

220
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,360
why don't we rank order countries by how
egalitarian their social policies are,

221
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,800
which you can do with a fair
degree of reliability. You know,

222
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,790
you put the countries where women are
second class citizens at the bottom,

223
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,920
and you'd put the Scandinavian
countries at the top.

224
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:09,220
You can get good reliability across
Raiders for how you would rate those

225
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:09,970
countries,

226
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,140
and then look at the magnitude of the
differences between men and women by the

227
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,590
egalitarian social policies.
And so then you'll find out,

228
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,510
and here's the hypotheses.
If the differences between
men and women are primary,

229
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,710
primarily social, then as
cultures become more egalitarian,

230
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:30,400
men and women will become more
alike. That's not what happened.

231
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,440
The opposite happened, the
more egalitarian the society.

232
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,740
And it turns out the richer the society
because that's also being discovered.

233
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:41,410
Now the more different
men and women become.

234
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,600
And so the differences are not huge.
So with agreeableness for example,

235
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,630
if you took the average man,

236
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,720
if you took a typical man and a typical
woman out of the population just

237
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:56,620
randomly and you had to bet that the
woman was more aggressive than the man,

238
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,910
you'd be wrong 60% of the time.

239
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,650
So there's quite a bit of overlap, right?
Cause you'd be right 40% of the time.

240
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,840
But the problem is is that a lot of
selection takes place at the extremes.

241
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,890
Maybe you're only concerned
about disagreeable people
when they become violent

242
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,900
and maybe it's only the one in 50 most
disagreeable person who's violent and

243
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,734
they're all men.

244
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,250
So you can have quite a bit of
similarity at the average level and big

245
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:30,610
differences at the extremes. And the
extremes is where people do things like,

246
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,680
like employment selection.

247
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,130
So the biggest difference that's been
discovered between men and women,

248
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,280
and this is the one that gets biggest
in the Scandinavian countries,

249
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,263
is interest.

250
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,980
Men are more interested in things and
women are more interested in people.

251
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,040
And it's a big difference. It's
one full standard deviation.

252
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,740
And so what that means
is that if you are a,

253
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,580
you would have to be more interested
in people than 85% of men to be as

254
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,950
interested in people as the
50th percentile a woman.

255
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,050
And you'd have to be more interested
in things than 85% of women to be as

256
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,690
interested in things as the
typical man. And what do you,

257
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,580
how do you define things?
[inaudible] okay. Gadgets, things.

258
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,030
[inaudible] things. Cars, car fuck.
Yeah, yeah. Tools. You know, technology,

259
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,400
right. STEM fields.

260
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,610
Because the other thing that's happened
is that the more egalitarian the

261
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:30,500
society, the fewer women go into the STEM
fields, the fewer. That's interesting.

262
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,760
Yeah. Okay. So, so now
this unravels in a big way.

263
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,790
It's like this is a hugely a relevant
issue politically because it means that

264
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,560
you cannot have equality of
opportunity and equality of outcome.

265
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,310
At the same time,

266
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,310
it's not possible because as you make
your society more egalitarian and you open

267
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:54,110
up the opportunity for
equality of outcome,

268
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,900
you increase how different men and
women are are and that changes their

269
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,190
occupational choice.

270
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,050
So if men are more interested in things
which they are by a substantial margin,

271
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,570
then way more of them are
going to be engineers.

272
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Wouldn't that possibly support this
idea that an enforced model of,

273
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,320
of, of quality would allow
people to be themselves more?

274
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,210
I mean this is almost what you're
saying. Well that does, that is,

275
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,830
that is the optimistic
viewpoint Loomis. Well look,

276
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,430
it's so funny cause the Swedish foreign
minister told me to go crock clock climb

277
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:35,450
back under the rock that I came out from
under when I was in Scandinavia because

278
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:39,890
I was describing this,
these, this science.

279
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,440
I've read that, but I'm
not exactly sure why. Well,

280
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:45,320
she regards me as misogynist
because I think that there are,

281
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,890
because I think because I'd been putting
forward the evidence that there are

282
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,810
genuine differences between men and women,

283
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,290
but she should be held to accountable
for that because that's just a flippant

284
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,300
thing to say like you,
you, you, you should have,

285
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,640
especially in a position
of power like she's in,

286
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,910
you should have a very specific argument
saying like for a leader to have such

287
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,450
a, a base thing to say. Such
a crude, dumb thing to say.

288
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,670
Crawl back under the rock
that you came through.

289
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,740
I thought she was making
a joke about lobsters,

290
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,320
but I don't think she was the
lobsters go. Going to rocks.

291
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:18,530
I guess they do the growing cracks and
the bigger lobsters have better rocks.

292
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:21,200
That was another very interesting thing
and the GQ thing where the woman was

293
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,070
challenging you on your
neurobiology, your neurochemistry,

294
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,200
your understanding as
well. Hardly, hardly any,

295
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:32,201
hardly any psychologists understand
that serotonin is associated with

296
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,160
hierarchies. It's like a truism.

297
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:37,190
It's been known for 30 years so we can
definitely get back to that. But I, I'm,

298
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:42,191
I'm very curious about this because
this idea of enforced equality,

299
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:42,830
right?

300
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,830
Ensuring that there is such a high
emphasis played or placed on equality,

301
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,880
equality, that you have
the equal amount of men,

302
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:54,600
the equal amount of women
and the opportunities are
absolutely available as much

303
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,610
to women as they are to
men. This is enforced.

304
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,260
This creates an environment
where there's less resistance.

305
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,290
Now in an environment where
there's less resistance,

306
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:09,230
perhaps women don't feel as
compelled to say, I'll show you that.

307
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:13,110
That is what seems to happen. Well,
here's a Nikki look. Here's an example.

308
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,210
So there are fewer women mathematicians
in the, in the higher echelons, okay,

309
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:22,440
but here's something interesting about
mathematical ability. First of all,

310
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,720
it's very rare. So that's the
first thing to keep in mind.

311
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,180
Now it looks like if you look in junior
high that give mathematically gifted men

312
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:33,720
and males and females are
approximately as common. Now,

313
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:36,960
there's a little bit of debate about
that because there is some evidence that

314
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,880
may be at the very upper extremes.

315
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:42,390
There's a male advantage just like
there's a male disadvantage at the low end

316
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,860
because the male distribution
for intelligence might
be flatter and so that's

317
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,620
the greater Mary male
variability hypothesis.

318
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,950
There's been papers putting that
forward that had been retracted as a

319
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,290
consequence of pressure from
politically correct people.

320
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,430
Even though greater
mirror male variability is
actually quite common in the

321
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,260
animal kingdom for a variety of reasons,

322
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,530
men are more expendable that males
are more expendable in some ways.

323
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,060
Or you could say that males are more
likely to Purdue to pursue high risk,

324
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:10,410
high return strategies.

325
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,000
You can look at it either way and it's
certainly possible. In any case, the men,

326
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,810
the males in junior high who happened
to be mathematically gifted are less

327
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,330
likely to also be verbally gifted,

328
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,690
whereas that doesn't seem to
be the case for the females.

329
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,090
And so if you're a male math nerd,

330
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,420
then math is a pretty logical pathway
for you because you don't have as many

331
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:35,280
other options. Whereas if
you're female math nerd,

332
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:38,040
you have other options because
you're, you're less likely,

333
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,950
you're more likely to
also be verbally gifted.

334
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,790
And so that's enough to at
least in principle account
for some of the reason why

335
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,150
there are fewer women mathematicians
than men mathematicians.

336
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,930
They have other options. They have other
options and there's lots of complex,

337
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,540
there's lots of complex reasons like this.

338
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:58,860
And so we have this reflexive idea and
this is very much the case cause this is

339
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:03,861
like the core idea among the feminist
Neo Marxist types is that if there's

340
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:08,850
differences in outcome, that's
that's proof of prejudice.

341
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,120
And that's support for the idea
of the patriarchal tyranny.

342
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:16,680
And that's like the core Axiom of the
radical left is the patriarchal tyranny as

343
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:20,760
far as I'm concerned. That's, that's
God for them. The patriarchal tyranny.

344
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,893
It's like, well,

345
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,830
if it turns out that many
of these differences in
outcome between men and women

346
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:28,650
aren't a consequence of the
patriarchal tyranny, in fact,

347
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:33,651
even get bigger when you
reduce the tyrannical aspect
of the patriarch and even

348
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:35,220
the patriarchal aspect to it,

349
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,390
then it makes that theory not only wrong,

350
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,290
but opposite of the truth, which
is the worst kind of wrong.

351
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,270
And so, you know,

352
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,210
if men are more likely to Purdue
pursue careers in the STEM fields,

353
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:53,020
which seems to be the case under
conditions of optimal freedom for men and

354
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:53,530
women,

355
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,070
then that's going to drive
income disparities because
the STEM fields pay more

356
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,530
and they pay more. Partly
because they're scalable,

357
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,340
like it's really hard to scale
care for people. You know,

358
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,860
like if you work in a daycare, you're
going to care for three infants,

359
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,130
you're not going to care for 50
cause you can't, it's not scalable.

360
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,370
But if you're like a software
designer, it's infinitely scalable.

361
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,480
And so there's,

362
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:18,481
there's a much wider range of possible
of possibility for generating much

363
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:19,684
larger,

364
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,970
much larger income pools and much
larger pools of wealth. You know,

365
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,160
and men are also more
likely to work longer hours.

366
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,520
And if you work 10% longer
hours, you make 40% more money,

367
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,050
there's a nonlinear return on.

368
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,260
That's a good thing for everybody who's
listening to know if you have a job,

369
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,790
you want to be the guy or the woman
who's working that extra 10% because the

370
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,030
return on that is nonlinear. So
that's a really useful thing to know.

371
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,830
Men are more likely to work outside,

372
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,840
they're more likely to work
in dangerous businesses.

373
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,160
They're more likely to run
full time businesses rather
than part-time businesses

374
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,150
and they're more likely to move
in pursuit of their career goals.

375
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,170
And that all contributes to
differences in and and in,

376
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:04,171
in among Uber drivers there they make
7% more money cause they drive faster so

377
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,590
and so anyway. So that's not good though.
Well I'll know but it's a high risk.

378
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,480
The high risk, high return issue,
right? It's a pattern mail. The common,

379
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,261
it's more risk.

380
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:17,410
There's more risk in it so there's more
return as long as you don't get hurt.

381
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,100
And I think that's a pretty common
male pattern is there's more risk,

382
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,250
there's more return as
long as you don't get hurt.

383
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,160
Problems seems to be when
discussing these things in any way,

384
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,250
way a romanticizing or a glorifying
male behavior or putting any emphasis

385
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:39,290
whatsoever on there being
a positive aspect to a lot
of the things that we think

386
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,460
of as being negative, like
aggression or ambition or, or,

387
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,290
or competition and competition
amongst men is fine.

388
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,730
Competition with men against women
is often thought of as cruel. Yeah.

389
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:55,100
Well that, yes. Well and, and,

390
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,520
and there's a certain amount of reason
for that as well because obviously

391
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:03,230
physical competition is, it's
easy for that to border on. Cruel.

392
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,370
This is why we were talking,

393
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,060
we were talking before the show
that instead of calling people,

394
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,790
men and women when referring
to like, cause there's,

395
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,090
there's this very
disturbing, in my opinion,

396
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:19,091
trend of transgender women entering into
these competitions now with women who

397
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:24,430
are biologically female and dominating
them. And that instead of calling people,

398
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,240
men and women dispense with them, you
can be a man or a woman to say, yeah,

399
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,160
you can be a man or
woman. That's your choice.

400
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,370
And you can change it whenever you
want. So you're a man or a woman.

401
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,400
And that's your choice. But
we're going to have a new rule,

402
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:39,970
which is that if you have an X,
Y chromosome, so you're an X,

403
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:44,590
Y person or an X X person, than
if you're an X, X person, X,

404
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,470
Y person, you don't get to engage in
physical combat with an X, Y person,

405
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,370
man or woman X, X person mass.
Yeah. How would that, if you're X,

406
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:55,820
Y you can't engage in
physical combat with X, X, X,

407
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,410
Ys cannot hit X X's. How's
that? And maybe they can't, um,

408
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,940
run in co running contests against them
and maybe they can't play tennis against

409
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:07,670
them, not within. And maybe
that's just reasonable.
