00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:07.466
&gt;&gt;My name is Reese.

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:08.856
I'm ten years old.

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:10.446
I live in Mainer, Texas.

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:12.726
It's a small town right
outside of Austin.

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:17.656
And I like to play baseball
and play Gamestar Mechanic.

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:24.606
&gt;&gt;I really like making
games because you get

00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:26.066
to be really creative with it.

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:28.956
&gt;&gt;Okay, so right now I'm
logging into Gamestar Mechanic.

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.506
It's pretty much the only
platform I make games on.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.686
You can have it be a story game.

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:37.526
You can have it be a blasting game.

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:40.136
You can have it be an
easy game, a hard game.

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:43.056
I mean, really, you
can do almost anything.

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:47.366
"Graveyard Story" is pretty
good; it was my first hit game.

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:52.066
So your goal in this one
is the spooky-monster thing

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:54.136
that can transform into a werewolf.

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:59.066
&gt;&gt;When it has a good story it
comes through to the player just

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.596
like when you're reading a storybook.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:05.146
&gt;&gt;In this one, you're
stranded in this random world

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.586
and you're trying to get out.

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:14.136
Your goal is to find out where
you are and get back home safely.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:18.696
You have to collect all
the points and survive.

00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:22.206
&gt;&gt;Man: It's great that kids who
have a natural affinity for wanting

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:24.126
to make games get to make games.

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.376
It's, you know, like giving
them the tools to paint

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:28.476
or write a book or make music.

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:29.796
It's fantastic to allow them

00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:32.166
to express themselves
in the pure art form.

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.176
What's really interesting though is

00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:35.956
if they understand
the broader context

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:38.516
of how those mechanics can
be used in other areas.

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:43.206
&gt;&gt;Reese: So each time I don't
want it to be exactly the same,

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:46.326
because then you could just toy
with the pattern eventually.

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:50.876
And then that way he's
difficult to get past.

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:55.686
&gt;&gt;Woman: I'd have to say that the
problem-solving skills that he gets

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:59.246
out of this are so
valuable across the board.

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:04.446
Math, physics, all of these
things involve taking a problem

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:07.836
that might seem too difficult
at first and then figuring

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.126
out "Which parts of it can I do?

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.186
I'm gonna start with the
parts that I can do and see

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:14.426
if they give me clues
to the next part."

00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:17.906
And designing games is a lot of that.

00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:25.786
&gt;&gt;Reese: And we'll just make level
two just a little bit harder.

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:28.976
Maybe add some more
enemies that shoot up here

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:33.626
or maybe have the people shoot
faster or maybe have people

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:34.826
who are pacing back and forth.

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:38.456
&gt;&gt;I have thought about the
similarities and differences

00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:39.646
of baseball and video games.

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:43.116
I think that I like games
because they're a challenge,

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:46.836
and I think I also like baseball
because it's a challenge.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.226
&gt;&gt;And they're challenging

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:58.416
in different ways, but
they make you think.

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:03.946
They both make you think about where
you're going to put this next enemy,

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:06.326
where you need to be
for the next play.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.826
And I really like that
about both things.

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:14.796
&gt;&gt;Sometimes I look at the comments
and see what the people have said

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:18.896
and sometimes I go back
to change the games

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:21.316
so that people will
think it's better.

00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:24.266
&gt;&gt;Man: One real key attribute
of Gamestar Mechanic is

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.136
that you have an authentic
audience, right?

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:28.546
So in most classrooms you're building
stuff for your teacher who may

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:29.886
or may not have time
to read your essay

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:31.596
that you wrote just
because it's an essay.

00:03:31.996 --> 00:03:34.046
But Gamestar Mechanic
has a vibrant community

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:36.496
where people are making games
for real people, real audiences

00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:38.296
that have real demands
and expectations.

00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:40.786
So you have to think about "How is
my audience gonna perceive this?

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:41.916
How are they gonna
perceive my message?

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:42.936
What are they gonna
take away from it?"

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:45.396
And Gamestar Mechanic
has that really built in

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:47.156
and so that's really
key for learning.

00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:48.906
It's something we're not
doing in our schools.

00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:58.076
&gt;&gt;Reese: For comments that
say like, "This is terrible.

00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:01.936
Make a better game next time,"
I don't take it personally.

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:06.176
And, actually, I kind of
laugh at those comments

00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:09.776
because they don't help
me make a better game,

00:04:10.026 --> 00:04:11.516
because I don't know what to fix.

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:17.676
But if there was a comment saying,
"I think that you need to have stairs

00:04:17.676 --> 00:04:22.576
up here so that you can get up there
and get this," then I would say,

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:29.046
"Okay, now I know what to fix,"
and I would go and fix it.

00:04:30.926 --> 00:04:33.416
&gt;&gt;For example, on a baseball field,

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.356
a grounder can go right
through your legs.

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:41.996
And if the coach says, "That was
terrible," I don't know what to fix.

00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:47.856
But if he says, for example, "Keep
your head down, keep your glove

00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:52.426
on the ground, and don't be afraid
of the ball," next time I know what

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:56.796
to fix and there's more of a
chance that I'm going to field it

00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:00.006
than if the coach had
said, "That's terrible."

00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:07.656
&gt;&gt;When I get good feedback I feel
like I can improve with that.

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:13.366
I can make a better game and
be a better game designer.

00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:15.606
&gt;&gt;Let's try this out.

00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:21.526
&gt;&gt;Man: Feedback's really
important to learning, we know.

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:23.196
And one of the issues with
schools that we have is

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:26.336
that you generally have twenty kids
going just through a teacher, right?

00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:28.876
And so you-- the teacher
doesn't have enough time

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:30.286
to get in and really dig in.

00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:32.506
Teachers want to, but they really
don't have the time to dig in

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:33.826
and give kids that kind of feedback.

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:35.776
When you have a really
robust community,

00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:37.606
you actually have a
million points of contact.

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:39.926
They can actually jump in and give
each other feedback that's very

00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:43.186
pointed, very much where they
are, and is able to be useful

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:44.116
for them to move forward.

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:46.846
&gt;&gt;But it turns out that
schools are kind of built

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.866
to keep these things out.

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:50.656
You know, our schools are very
much built to keep these twenty

00:05:50.656 --> 00:05:53.726
or thirty people all the same
age, all the same ability area,

00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:57.046
all the same geography, in
one room and not interacting.

00:05:57.046 --> 00:05:59.016
What's great about Gamestar
Mechanic is that it's trying

00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:04.006
to use the compelling idea of
games and the will and inspiration

00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:07.656
to create to kind of burst out
and have a very vibrant community

00:06:07.656 --> 00:06:09.456
where people are getting
together from all walks of life

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:13.036
around building games and
studying how do you become a better

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:14.426
game designer.
