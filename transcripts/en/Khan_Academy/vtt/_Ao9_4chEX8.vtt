00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.380
So we need to find the cube
root of negative 343.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.700
Another way to think about this,
this is the same thing

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.170
as negative 343 to
the 1/3 power.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.510
Or, another way of thinking
about it, if x to the third is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.030
equal to negative 343-- so let
me write if x to the third is

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:34.600
equal to negative 343, then x
is equal to the cube root of

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.740
negative 343.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.120
So these are all ways
of viewing it.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.530
This is essentially saying,
there's some number, when I

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.510
multiply it by itself three
times, I should

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.100
get negative 343.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.390
So let's figure out what
this number is.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.890
And the easiest way I can think
of doing it is to do a

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.660
prime factorization of negative
343, including

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.900
factoring out the negative
numbers or a negative 1.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.960
So if we factor out the negative
1, the first thing we

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.350
get, it's negative
1 times 343.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.430
Let's think what other prime
numbers go into 343.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.430
2 doesn't go into it.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.840
This is an odd number.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.230
3 doesn't go into it.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.200
If you add these numbers,
it adds up to 7.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.590
That's not divisible by 3.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.930
That's a quick test for testing
divisibility by 3.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.920
5 doesn't go into it.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.640
It doesn't end with
a 5 or a 0 here.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.520
7 is the next prime number.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.690
Let's see if it goes into 343.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:35.280
7 goes into 343-- 7 goes
into 34 four times.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.390
4 times 7 is 28.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.480
Subtract.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.780
34 minus 28 is 6.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.640
Bring down the 3.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.090
7 goes into 63 nine times.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.330
9 times 7 is 63.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.060
Subtract.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.780
We have no remainder.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.710
So it goes in exactly
49 times.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.720
So 343 is the same thing
as 7 times 49.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.030
And 49 is 7 times 7.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.790
So we can rewrite this
expression up here.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:15.010
We can rewrite it as the cube
root of negative 1 times 7

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.430
times 7 times 7.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.020
Or another way to think about
it, we could view this as

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.680
being equal to the cube root of
negative 1 times the cube

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.960
root of 7 times 7 times 7.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.770
Now what's the cube root
of negative 1?

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.790
What number to the third power
is equal to negative 1?

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.960
Well, negative 1 to the third
power is negative 1, right?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.280
Negative 1 times negative 1
times negative 1 is equal to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.500
negative 1, right?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.330
This is equal to 1.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.590
Then times negative 1 is equal
to negative 1 again.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.070
So that's negative 1.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.730
And then what's the
second part?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.550
What times itself three times is
equal to 7 times 7 times 7?

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.880
Well 7.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.140
This is literally 7 times
itself three times.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.930
So the second part is 7.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.880
So the answer's going to be
negative 1 times 7, or

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.580
negative 7.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.830
And you can verify
for yourself.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.630
You take negative 7, multiply
it by itself 3 times.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.040
The negative part, you could
view as just negative 1 to the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.500
third power.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.910
We'll end up with a negative.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.490
And then the 7 to the third
power will give you the 343.
