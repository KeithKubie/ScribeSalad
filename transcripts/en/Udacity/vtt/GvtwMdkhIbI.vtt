00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.030
In this case there's not really a right answer because there's

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.750
many, many features that you could identify in a piece of

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.655
software as complex as a, a spreadsheet. So I'm just going

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:11.900
to give you three examples. So one could be the cell merging

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.950
operation. So the operation in which we merge two cells in

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.550
the spreadsheet. Another example could be chart creation, so I might want

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.370
to test the feature that allows you to create charts in

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.310
your spreadsheets. Yet another example could

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.540
be the test of statistical functions,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.350
so the function that allows you to do various statistical calculations on

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.650
the numbers in your cells. And as I said there's many, many

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.900
more example that we could use. But the key thing I want

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.770
to convey here is the fact that there is no way you

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.020
can look at a spreadsheet with all the functionality that it provides

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.160
and just go and test it. The first step, what you need

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.430
to do first, is to identify which ones are the pieces of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.620
functionality that I can test individually. So that's why this is the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.310
first step in black-box testing.
