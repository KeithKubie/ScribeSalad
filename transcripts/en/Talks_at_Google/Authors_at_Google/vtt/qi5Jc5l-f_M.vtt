[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.250
SCOTT MAXWELL: And so
welcome Dr. Starkey.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.910
NATALIE STARKEY: Thank you.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.510
SCOTT MAXWELL: I
know that we want

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.884
to get to the point of talking
about how these things are

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:14.570
going to kill all of us
and we're all doomed,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.960
but before we do that before we
do that, before we get started

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.120
about that, we should talk
a little bit about what

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.550
these things are that
are going to kill us all.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.446
So your book, of course,
is a nonfiction book.

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:25.320
But I couldn't help
thinking while reading it

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.403
that if it were a novel,
the main characters in it

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:28.889
would be comets and asteroids.

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:30.180
So maybe we should start there.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.509
Talk a little bit about what
comets and asteroids are

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.300
and how they are
different from each other.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.216
NATALIE STARKEY: Sure.

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:38.070
So I guess there's a lot
of misunderstanding now

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.520
about what the difference is
between comets and asteroids.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.160
So classically we have
this idea that comets

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.050
formed in the very cold outer
reaches of the solar system.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.840
So when our Sun
first formed, it was

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.807
surrounded by this cloud
of gas and dust and ice.

00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:54.390
And way out in the outer reaches
of the solar system, way past

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.895
where any of the planets are
today, we form the comets.

00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:58.270
And they're
literally just like--

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.750
I describe as like a
scoop of this cloud.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.837
You basically just
take this gas and dust

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:04.920
and ice and kind of bind
it together a little bit.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.690
But they're not very
well, like held together.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.280
They're not very
well consolidated.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.900
So they are almost
like a snowball

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.100
essentially with a
lot of dust in it.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.370
But why they're so important is
that they're exceptionally old.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.500
So they're as old as the
sun, 4.6 billion years old,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.552
and which means they can tell us
a lot about where we came from,

00:01:21.552 --> 00:01:23.510
where everything in our
solar system came from.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.020
SCOTT MAXWELL: They're
sort of primitive objects.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.064
NATALIE STARKEY: Exactly.

00:01:26.064 --> 00:01:27.730
Whereas the asteroids
on the other hand,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.290
they're also very old with
saying probably nearly 4.6,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.980
if not--

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.080
just about 4.5
billion years old.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.030
And we can think
of those as kind

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.822
of the leftover of building
rubble from making the planet.

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:40.530
So they formed in the
inner solar system,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.990
much closer to the sun,
just as the rocky planets

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.780
did, like Earth and
Mercury, Venus and Mars.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.150
And it was just those bits
and pieces of planet that

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.530
didn't get made into a planet.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.680
They just got left out.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.580
And then they collected in the
asteroid belt, which is now

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.530
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.770
So the asteroids are really
important because they preserve

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.470
this history of planet building,
which is really hard to look

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.120
at, because if we
just take earth,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.859
we've had all sorts of evolution
on Earth since it formed.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.650
And we have plate
tectonics, as most people

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.517
know, especially living
in LA, you probably

00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:12.600
know too well-- there was
an earthquake last night

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.850
actually-- that our
plates are moving

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.969
and we create earthquakes
and volcanoes.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.760
And this changes the
surface of our planet.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.885
So if we want to go back
to the beginning of Earth,

00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:23.850
we want to see what it was made
from and how it started out

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.190
and how life got here and
how our water got here,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.540
it's really hard to do.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.900
It's really hard to pick
apart that history's.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900
So asteroids are really
important in that sense.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.864
They can kind of allow
us to glimpse back

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:34.530
at that time, because
they didn't really

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.960
evolve since they formed.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.029
Not a whole lot anyway.

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:38.820
They've sort of preserved
those conditions.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.361
So that's the classic view.

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:42.360
And I think we're going
to come on to, in a bit,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.450
kind of how that view is
maybe not so accurate now.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.540
It's not wholly
wrong, but we've kind

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.820
of updated our view
about these objects.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.521
But we remember that that's
the classical distinction.

00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:55.020
SCOTT MAXWELL: And
I love that image

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.790
of the asteroids as
kind of the leftover

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.196
LEGOs from the solar system.

00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:00.570
You snapped a whole bunch of
things together into planets

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.240
and these are the ones that are
kind of scattered on the floor.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.156
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:04.542
That's right.

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:06.000
SCOTT MAXWELL: And
so because these

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.750
might come into the
picture as well,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.160
can we talk a little about
what meteors and meteorites

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.234
and meteoroids are.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:13.150
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.858
So there's a lot of
confusion about that.

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:17.400
So a meteorite is literally
just a piece of rock

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.885
from space on another planet.

00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:20.760
So on earth, we can go
and collect meteorites

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.990
sitting on the ground.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.490
And it could be a
piece of a planet.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.406
It could be a piece of
a comet or an asteroid.

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:28.470
And what happens is that
collisions happen in space

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.330
and they happened for millennia.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.850
And little pieces of rocks
will get knocked off planets,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.017
if another-- if an asteroid
collides with them,

00:03:35.017 --> 00:03:36.600
and some of this
asteroid might end up

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.980
just floating about in space,
but little pieces of it.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.044
So it's a meteoroid in space.

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:42.960
And then when it comes
through the atmosphere,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.000
it becomes a meteor.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.292
So we had the meteor
shower recently.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.000
You can see little
pieces coming through.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.080
Often that's dust.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.720
When we get a big fireball,
these beautiful scenes

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.670
that we get, that's a larger
piece of rock coming through.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.400
If that rock makes
it to the surface,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.170
if it doesn't explode
in the atmosphere

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.672
and completely disintegrate,
a piece of rock on the surface

00:04:00.672 --> 00:04:01.380
is the meteorite.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.197
So the great thing about them
is that we can collect them.

00:04:04.197 --> 00:04:06.030
Sometimes and we can
actually see them fall.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.970
If you see a fireball, you can
sometimes trace it and then

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.244
find that fresh rock literally
just straight from space

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:13.160
and you can sample it.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.550
Or we get older
falls, where, you

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.329
know, these are called finds,
where they fell a while ago.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.430
It could be millions
of years ago.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.930
And we can then go
and sample them.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.379
And it's great because it
means that we can get samples

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:25.920
from space, because
we don't actually

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.510
go into space very often,
like we go into space a bit.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.560
And when we do, we often
don't collect samples,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.200
because if we want to go out
and collect samples in space,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.490
it's almost like two missions.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.810
You want to-- this is why
we haven't sampled Mars.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.580
And people find that
quite surprising

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.400
when I say we don't have
any samples from Mars.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.650
We've been there a whole lot.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.550
There's loads of
instruments on Mars.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.952
But we haven't brought
back any rocks from there.

00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:49.410
SCOTT MAXWELL: It's
not on purpose.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.010
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.190
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.790
NATALIE STARKEY: So we need
to-- we will be doing it

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.890
in the future, but at the
moment, the only rocks

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.400
we have from Mars
are meteorites.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.860
So that's the only way
we can sample them.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.480
They're free samples,
which is great,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.438
but we don't know exactly
where they came from.

00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:04.740
So if we send a mission
there, we can sample exactly

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.680
in a particular basin
that we're interested in

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.013
and then we can bring that back.

00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:09.800
But that's basically
a second mission

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.810
to launch, relaunch
off another planet

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.360
or an asteroid or a comet.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.700
It's really complicated.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.139
So that's why we haven't
done it very often obviously.

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.430
We have a lot of samples from
the moon, thank goodness.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.110
So that's-- we've done it a
bit, but we need to do it more.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.900
But we have meteorites
in the meantime,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.180
which can really help us out.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.820
SCOTT MAXWELL: So the
asteroids all live--

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.849
well, not all live--
but are mainly

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.390
collected in the
asteroid belt, which

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.930
is this region between the
orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.560
And the asteroid belt, I
learned from your book,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.031
isn't really all one thing.

00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:42.530
There's like an
inner and outer belt

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.130
and there's a distinction
between those two regions.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.580
Do you want to talk
about that a little bit.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.060
NATALIE STARKEY: So when
we studied asteroids

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.410
and asteroid belt,
we kind of initially

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.785
thought they were
all going to be

00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:52.220
the same, just these kind
of rocky objects that look

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.236
a bit like a failed planets.

00:05:55.236 --> 00:05:56.360
And they're all very small.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.110
There are a couple of
large objects there,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.870
but actually when
we look in detail

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.700
from the inner
belt, which is going

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.930
to be the bit that's closer
to Mars, sure enough,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.430
these things do
look like asteroids.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.554
In fact, some of them are
made completely of metal.

00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:10.280
So if you take the core of
Earth, that is made of metal.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.910
We are all probably
aware of that.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.799
But actually, we can sample
a sort of core from a planet

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:16.340
if we sample some
of these asteroids.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.440
And there's a NASA
mission actually going

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.660
in the 2020s called
Psyche and it's

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.800
going to be going to look
at one of these objects.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.027
So we can sample those.

00:06:24.027 --> 00:06:25.610
And they're very
much like we consider

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.820
the classical asteroids.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.580
But as we move out
to the outer belt

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.890
on that kind of Jupiter
side, what we find

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.510
is that they change.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.990
And they actually become
icy, some of these objects.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.080
And they have a lot of
carbonaceous material.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.250
So what I'm saying here is
that we've got organic matter.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.420
Now that's not uncommon.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.850
We have organic matter
in most of the asteroids,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.520
apart from the ones that are
really made of just metal.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.450
This isn't a life.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.090
People get very excited
when we say organic matter.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.673
It's not life.

00:06:49.673 --> 00:06:52.670
It's literally just carbon
hydrogen bonding and oxygen

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.210
and it's organic matter
that is potentially

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.590
the precursor for life.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.870
So it's really exciting
these objects contain

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.510
a lot of organic matter, because
we still don't understand

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.160
how life got to earth.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.514
We're obviously the only planet
we know of that contains life.

00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:08.930
And we don't know
how it got here.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.846
And it's kind of just--
it's ridiculous right.

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:12.650
I always find it quite
funny that we still

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.089
don't know how we are here.

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:16.130
And we're like these very
intelligent beings that

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.560
can do all sorts of amazing
things, but how we've got here

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.610
is a mystery.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.484
So we want to study these
objects to try and understand

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.900
if they could have
delivered life.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.010
So these asteroids on the outer
belt, they also contain ice.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.820
So they look very
much like the comets

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.530
I described at the beginning.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.750
And actually, this is where
this kind of distinction

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.950
between the two objects
breaks down a little bit,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.980
because these actually
might be comets.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.320
When they formed, the
idea is that some of them

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.584
really could have formed
in the outer solar system.

00:07:41.584 --> 00:07:43.250
And then there was a
huge reorganization

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.375
of the solar system after
the large planets formed.

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:47.270
And some of these
comets kind of got

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.520
thrown into the
inner solar system

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.270
and got trapped in
the asteroid belt.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.394
So we actually find that
they're kind of of comets,

00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:54.720
but they are asteroids.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.321
So it's kind of confusing
in that respect.

00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:58.820
But the same happened
the other way.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.280
Some of the asteroids
that formed near the sun

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.020
got ejected out of
the solar system.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.460
Some of them
probably disappeared

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.080
from our solar
system completely.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.590
And others ended up
in one of the homes

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.340
of where the comets live now.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.960
So there's probably
almost certainly

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.980
some objects in what we call the
Kuiper Belt, where Pluto lives,

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.567
which are probably
asteroidal in origin,

00:08:18.567 --> 00:08:20.400
but now they're sitting
somewhere very cold.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.691
So there is a build-- this
is where kind of the overlap

00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:26.022
starts to happen, because the
solar system's kind of crazy.

00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:27.980
SCOTT MAXWELL: I love
that image from your book

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.660
of Jupiter sort of
throwing a tantrum

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.580
and rampaging around the solar
system and kind of throwing

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.350
stuff all over the place and
kind of mixing it all up,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.055
so it's not arranged
in this kind

00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:37.429
of neat, tidy little categories
that we thought at first.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.299
NATALIE STARKEY: I
think that's the thing.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.465
We had this beautiful view,
because the solar system

00:08:40.465 --> 00:08:41.638
is very hard to understand.

00:08:41.638 --> 00:08:43.429
Obviously we need to
visit it to understand

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:44.684
it and we haven't been to--

00:08:44.684 --> 00:08:46.100
I mean, we've been
to a lot of it,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.110
but we still don't know
how the planets formed.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.660
And Jupiter is
enormous, like it really

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.460
controls our solar system.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.440
And it's gravity, if it
decides to move around,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.350
which it did in the
past, can just really

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.390
cause havoc throughout-- it
can just knock planets around

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.020
and particularly small
objects like asteroids.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.140
So that is-- and that period
of our solar system history

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.067
is very, very crazy.

00:09:08.067 --> 00:09:08.900
SCOTT MAXWELL: Yeah.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.240
You talked about swapping the
orbits of Uranus and Neptune.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.760
So Neptune is
further out currently

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.840
and Uranus is closer in, but
they were the other way around.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.510
NATALIE STARKEY: Exactly.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.210
This is what we think.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.440
SCOTT MAXWELL: It's really
reconfigured itself a lot.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.420
NATALIE STARKEY: And these
are massive planets, you know?

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.860
And they have huge gravity.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.385
So it's kind of a crazy thing.

00:09:23.385 --> 00:09:25.010
Obviously it's not
going to happen now,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.070
but what we can do now is look
out to other solar systems,

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.830
around other planet planetary
systems, around other stars.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.150
And we can kind of look
at what is happening now.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.880
So I love that this is not my
field, but this is astronomy

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.170
and it's absolutely fascinating
that we can look out and see--

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.970
we kind of see our
solar system as it

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.710
was billions of
years ago, because we

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.230
can look at other
stars and see actually

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.356
planets forming at
this very time, what

00:09:47.356 --> 00:09:48.480
kind of was happening here.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.750
So this is another way
we can try and figure out

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.340
what happened 4.6 billion
years ago and afterwards.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.630
So it's fascinating.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.800
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right on.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.730
So in much the same
way that there's

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.260
these two regions of
the asteroid belt,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.220
there's kind of two regions of
where the comets live as well.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.020
You talked about the Kuiper
belt, which is the near region,

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.040
then there's also
the Oort cloud,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.300
which is the farther region.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.100
You want to talk about the
distinction between those two

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.180
regions as well?

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:11.720
NATALIE STARKEY: So, yeah.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.040
SCOTT MAXWELL: How
far away they are?

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.640
NATALIE STARKEY:
It's kind of crazy.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.732
So distances in space always--

00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:18.940
I think everyone just goes,
oh yeah, it's really far.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.950
It's like, really far to Jupiter
and it's really far to Pluto.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.200
We know we went to Pluto
with the New Horizons mission

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.750
recently, and it's still
going through the Kuiper belt.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.950
So a couple of years later, I
think was 2015 it met Pluto.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.960
And it's still going
through the Kuiper Belt

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.770
so it is 25 times wider
than the asteroid belt.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.620
And the asteroid belt
was already fairly large.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.920
And it's just-- in terms of
distances, it's not that far.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.450
So it's just past
Neptune, Uranus,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.010
it's kind of just on the
edge of the solar system.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.937
But these objects that
are there, they're icy.

00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:52.520
They're dusty.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.680
They're kind of
mostly fairly small.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.060
And we can see most of them.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.040
So we kind of know
roughly what is there.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.657
But they're sort of bound
to our Sun by the gravity.

00:11:01.657 --> 00:11:03.740
They're not too far that
they're not kind of bound

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.220
to our solar system.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.220
But once you get to the
edge of the Kuiper Belt,

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.170
it sort of becomes
no man's land.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.360
We have a region called
the scattered disk,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.610
which is just some random
objects which are probably

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.750
mostly cometary and they're kind
of on crazy orbits a little bit

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.210
and we don't understand them
a whole lot, but they are--

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.522
we can't see all of them--

00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:23.480
but they're kind of we
know that they're there.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.430
But then we get to
this theoretical phase

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.280
of the solar system,
which is the Oort clouds.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.060
And I was fascinated
to learn when

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.022
I did a few years ago that
the Oort Cloud is not proven.

00:11:33.022 --> 00:11:33.730
It's theoretical.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:33.890
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:34.390
We've never seen it.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.182
It's so far away.

00:11:35.182 --> 00:11:37.640
NATALIE STARKEY: And we always
talk about Oort Cloud comets

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.240
and, neato, we have what we
call long period comets, which

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.500
are these comets that come
into the inner solar system

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.480
and orbit the sun
and they have to have

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.010
orbits of more than 200 years.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.879
So the way we know the
Oort Cloud is there,

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:50.420
partly because we
have to balance out

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.646
the mass of the
solar system somehow.

00:11:52.646 --> 00:11:55.290
So we kind of so guess there
had to be something out there.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.873
But then we get these
comets coming in

00:11:56.873 --> 00:11:59.720
at really random angles
into the-- so basically

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.277
I should probably just
sidestep a little bit.

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:03.860
The solar system,
as most people know,

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.040
all the planets are
on the same plane.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.540
And so is the Kuiper Belt. So
we're sort of all going around

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.750
the sun nicely.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.880
Pluto is doing something
slightly different.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.550
And then we move out
to the Oort Cloud.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.310
And this is literally a
cloud around the whole sun.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.410
So what happens is, is
when one of these comets

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.364
decides to come into
the inner solar system,

00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:22.030
they can come in from
all random angles.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.690
They're not going to be
coming along that plane.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.773
So that's how we sort of
know this cloud is there,

00:12:25.773 --> 00:12:28.160
because these little visitors
from out to solar system

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.390
come in and we can spot them.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.504
But we can't directly see
them if they're there,

00:12:32.504 --> 00:12:33.920
because they're
just too far away.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.240
You know, these objects are
tiny and not too far away.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.634
So this is partly why--

00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:39.050
so when New Horizons
got to Pluto,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.190
we didn't really
know much about it.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.570
Like we just could not
really see it in any detail.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.750
So I'm really excited
sitting next object

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.430
it's going to in
the Kuiper Belt.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.570
And then the Oort
Cloud we just--

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.980
you know, we're never going to
get there in anyone's lifetime.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.570
The spaceships will
continue going,

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.039
but we are not going to know.

00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:57.080
They will have run out of
battery by then anyway.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.455
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right, right.

00:12:57.455 --> 00:12:59.455
So doing the math on the
numbers from your book,

00:12:59.455 --> 00:13:02.030
I got that light
leaves the sun, it

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.270
gets to the near edge of the
Kuiper belt in four hours.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.830
So that's the
Kuiper belt. It gets

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.430
to the near edge
of the Oort Cloud

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.300
in something like
9 and 1/2 months.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.459
So that's the magnitude
of the difference

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.500
that we're talking about.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:13.550
NATALIE STARKEY: Yup.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.925
And then the Oort
Cloud, it would

00:13:14.925 --> 00:13:17.300
take another two years to
cross probably or something

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.020
like that, so--

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.228
SCOTT MAXWELL: Exactly right.

00:13:19.228 --> 00:13:21.815
It's like from one to three
light years of distance.

00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:22.690
NATALIE STARKEY: Yes.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.648
So when you're talking
just space craft speeds,

00:13:24.648 --> 00:13:28.070
I mean, this is going to take
tens of thousands of years,

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.735
I'm guessing.

00:13:28.735 --> 00:13:29.610
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.460
It's something like 40,000 years
or something along those lines.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.200
NATALIE STARKEY:
So it's very far.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:34.700
So I think--

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.630
SCOTT MAXWELL: We
don't have batteries

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:35.810
that will last that long.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.900
NATALIE STARKEY: These objects
at barely bound to our sun.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.870
They are actually influenced
often by, in the galaxy,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.250
the passing of other stars.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.540
They can be knocked out of their
orbit by literally other stars

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.810
nearby, because they're almost
closer to other solar systems

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:51.727
or stars than our one.

00:13:51.727 --> 00:13:53.101
SCOTT MAXWELL:
That was the thing

00:13:53.101 --> 00:13:55.550
I was fascinated-- just a
little factoid I was fascinated

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.610
by from your book, that the
outer edge of the Oort Cloud,

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.290
which is around our
Sun, is actually

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.547
closer to the next star
than it is to our Sun.

00:14:02.547 --> 00:14:04.880
NATALIE STARKEY: But they are
literally within our solar

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.370
system so it's-- yeah, it's kind
of where you define the edge

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.220
of the solar system.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.678
And there are
different definitions

00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:12.620
for where it is when you enter
interstellar space, which is

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.550
the bit in between the stars.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.730
And so yeah, the
Voyager missions,

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.970
which set off here in the 1970s,
they are now in interstellar

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.560
space, but that just means
they are past the Kuiper Belt

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.060
basically.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.036
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:27.410
As long as we're talking about
like, awesome little facts

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.217
from your book,
the asteroid-- this

00:14:30.217 --> 00:14:31.800
is a thing that kind
of blew my mind--

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.980
the asteroid belt,
all the asteroids

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.960
from the asteroid
belt put together,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.614
would have less mass
than Earth's moon.

00:14:37.614 --> 00:14:38.530
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:38.810
SCOTT MAXWELL: Yeah.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.768
Which is very different
from your picture of it

00:14:40.768 --> 00:14:43.340
as you think of the
Millennium Falcon swooping

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.780
through the asteroid belt
and the asteroids are all

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.410
kind of like huge and
close together, yeah,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:47.220
but it's really kind of--

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.410
NATALIE STARKEY: They're
quite scattered out,

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.670
and that's a good
thing, otherwise they

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.260
would collide more
often and we would

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.840
have more issues in the inner
solar system with potentially

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.562
being hit by one.

00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:57.020
So actually it's a good thing
that they're nicely far part.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.519
So you can get
through quite easily.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:00.590
You can find a good route.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.660
SCOTT MAXWELL: Well, that's a
nice little transition for us.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.964
So now that we have a handle
on kind of what all the players

00:15:06.964 --> 00:15:09.130
are-- the comets and asteroids
and the solar system,

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.347
and the meteors, of course,
once they get here--

00:15:11.347 --> 00:15:13.430
let's talk about how they're
going to kill us all.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.000
NATALIE STARKEY: Great.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.685
SCOTT MAXWELL: So
one of the things

00:15:15.685 --> 00:15:17.140
that you talked
about in the book

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.185
is you kind of point out that
comets and asteroids giveth,

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:21.310
but they also taketh away--

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.105
that they might have brought
life to earth, but they also,

00:15:24.105 --> 00:15:25.480
you know, wiped
out the dinosaurs

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.700
and could do the same to us.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.370
I'm a little hesitant
to ascribe properties

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.080
like good and evil to
inanimate objects like that.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.260
Maybe we should talk about
them in helpful or scary.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.757
But how do you think about them?

00:15:36.757 --> 00:15:38.590
Do you think that they're
things that should

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.642
be revered or feared or--

00:15:39.642 --> 00:15:41.350
NATALIE STARKEY: So
I mean, it's probably

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.270
no surprise, as somebody
who has researched

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.775
these objects for quite a
while, that I revere them.

00:15:45.775 --> 00:15:46.900
SCOTT MAXWELL: Fair enough.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.950
NATALIE STARKEY: Because
one of the things about

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.366
it is, yes, they do have the
potential to collide with us.

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.380
And we think we're safe
for about 100 years.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.560
So probably all
of us, unless you

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.435
know how to live a lot
longer than 100 years,

00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:56.690
then you're going to be OK.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.630
But the thing is like, are our
descendants going to be OK?

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.020
And the more we can learn
about these subjects now,

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.292
the better prepared
we are to do something

00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:05.500
about one of them hitting us.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.330
So if we don't
understand our enemy,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.780
then we don't know how
to fight it basically.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.090
So I love these objects
because they can tell us

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.150
a lot about where we came
from, about our past,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.320
and how everything started
out in the solar system.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.620
But yeah, they do really have
the potential to cause havoc.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.590
A large asteroid could
hit us, past that 100--

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.620
I mean, there's a chance one
could hit us within 100 years,

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.030
but it's very unlikely.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.040
Past that, we at the
moment don't know.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.860
It's a kind of a
continuously updated list

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.130
of potentially hazardous
asteroids and comets, which

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.750
astronomers are
studying and they

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.760
need to understand better
how they move on their orbit

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.280
somewhat-- their next orbit
of the sun is going to do

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.490
and if they're going to be
altered by passing Jupiter

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.614
in the future or something.

00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:48.550
So we need to understand
exactly what they're

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.492
doing, how they're
spinning, and then we need

00:16:50.492 --> 00:16:51.700
to know what they're made of.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.890
Because if we don't know
what they're made of, well,

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.960
some ideas, like you
know "Armageddon,"

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.420
if you've seen the
Hollywood movie,

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.910
they actually go and
detonate some explosive

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.340
inside the asteroid
to blow it up.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.089
Well, it depends what
you're dealing with.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.589
If this asteroid is made of
pure metal, that might not work.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.859
You might not even be able
to drill into the thing

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.391
to put some explosive inside it.

00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:12.849
But if we're talking
about a comet,

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.710
well, maybe if it's
coming towards Earth,

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.260
it might just explode on
atmospheric entry anyway.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.653
So it's kind of
like, we need to know

00:17:19.653 --> 00:17:21.069
what we're dealing
with if we want

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:24.186
to go and deflect or destroy
one before it gets here.

00:17:24.186 --> 00:17:25.060
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.768
And you talk about
this some in the book,

00:17:26.768 --> 00:17:28.384
that even blowing
up the asteroid

00:17:28.384 --> 00:17:29.800
might not be good,
because now you

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.690
have a whole bunch of asteroids
that are going to kill you

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.070
instead of one big asteroid--

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.880
NATALIE STARKEY: Exactly.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.338
And I think think
one of the things

00:17:35.338 --> 00:17:39.020
is like, the more advance
notice we get, the better.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.890
So if we can see that an
object is heading for us

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.330
and it's large, say a kilometer
or so, and it's 10 years out,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.340
then we have time
to launch a mission.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.840
This way we need to do a
bit of work in advance,

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.215
because of course, it's not
that easy to launch a mission

00:17:52.215 --> 00:17:53.540
just straight the next day.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.850
So we need a few years
to figure out how

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:55.870
to launch the mission there.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:56.920
It would would be
great if we had

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.878
one ready to go for any
of these objects, which

00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:01.690
are what we're currently working
on and planetary defense.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.270
It's a big topic at
the moment in research.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.130
And governments are
actually interested in this,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.490
which is great, because we
need them to be to support

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.110
the research community.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.630
Launch mission, basically the
longer you have the better.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.760
If you want to deflect
something and it's way off,

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.650
it's going to be a smaller
nudge to deflect it,

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.060
if you just want to
push it out that way

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.768
then if it's right
next to earth already,

00:18:20.768 --> 00:18:23.920
you're going to have to deflect
it a long way for it to miss.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.690
Ideally, we would
want to deflect them.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.080
We just want to put it
on a different course

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:27.900
so it misses our planet.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.733
And we don't care if
it hits another planet,

00:18:29.733 --> 00:18:31.850
but we want to
protect our planet.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.020
We could-- if we're stuck and
we don't have much notice--

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.660
we could explode it in some
way, if we can find a way.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.330
Of course, you might need to use
nuclear weapons, which is not

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.955
going to be fun, if
you're going to get

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.820
the rain of this nuclear weapon
falling down on the planet,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.320
but--

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.230
SCOTT MAXWELL: And it's possibly
in violation of treaties,

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:48.680
although that would
probably be forgiven if you

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.480
were saving the entire planet.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.490
NATALIE STARKEY: I
think if we-- yeah.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.864
So I think nuclear
weapons aren't

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:53.844
allowed to be used in
spaces like in a bad way,

00:18:53.844 --> 00:18:55.510
so I think if we were
saving our planet,

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.719
then we'd probably let it go.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:58.343
And maybe some nuclear
fallout wouldn't

00:18:58.343 --> 00:19:00.160
be as bad as just being
hit by an asteroid.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.500
So we might allow it.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.774
But it sounds like
science fiction,

00:19:03.774 --> 00:19:05.440
and it is science
fiction, but it's also

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.490
now turning into reality.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.140
These are really kind of
what we're thinking of.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.890
There's other crazier
ideas, that we don't

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.189
have to explode these things.

00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:12.730
There's other ideas
that we can spray

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.530
paint one side of this object.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.649
So generally these
objects are very dark.

00:19:16.649 --> 00:19:18.940
And as they go by the sun,
they're obviously heated up.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.330
Now if you can change
one side of the asteroid,

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.566
if you could spray
painted white or metallic,

00:19:23.566 --> 00:19:24.940
it's going to heat
up differently

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.770
as it goes near to
the sun and it all

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.980
starts spinning differently.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.396
And if it spins
differently, it'll

00:19:29.396 --> 00:19:30.730
change its orbit gradually.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.235
So these are very
gentle techniques.

00:19:32.235 --> 00:19:34.360
It sounds a bit mad trying
to spray paint in space,

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.970
but this is literally one of the
things we can do, or cover it

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.520
with something to
kind of change how

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.230
it reacts to the sun's heat.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.760
SCOTT MAXWELL: You know, I never
saw the movie "Armageddon,"

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.340
but I gather what it's about.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:44.460
NATALIE STARKEY:
You haven't seen it?

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:44.890
Wow.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.265
SCOTT MAXWELL: I
haven't seen it.

00:19:46.265 --> 00:19:49.049
I gather what it's about is they
sent basically miners to space.

00:19:49.049 --> 00:19:51.340
NATALIE STARKEY: They sent
Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.490
up there because they
were oil miners, yeah,

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.340
they were drillers.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.630
SCOTT MAXWELL: So
it never occurred--

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.296
like I kind of get that-- but it
never occurred to me that maybe

00:19:58.296 --> 00:20:00.910
what you want to send is
taggers that could spray paint--

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:01.650
NATALIE STARKEY:
That's a good idea--

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:02.010
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right?

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.750
Like maybe they would do it.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.333
They would put a nice mural on
the side that would look pretty

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:07.619
as it passed us by safely.

00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:08.660
We're gonna work on that.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.730
That's your next book.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:10.610
NATALIE STARKEY: I
think I should do that.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.740
I could do the novel.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.573
SCOTT MAXWELL: Yeah.

00:20:12.573 --> 00:20:14.400
The novelization of the--

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.480
NATALIE STARKEY: But
yeah, I mean, of course,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.770
we're not actually
going to send people up.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.960
In reality, what's going to
happen is that we use robots.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.380
And in space, of
course, all the time

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.620
we use robots, just because
they're more expendable.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.360
We don't really care if
we killed the robots.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.730
We care because they cost a lot
and a lot of people's careers

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.605
go into making them--

00:20:28.605 --> 00:20:31.020
SCOTT MAXWELL: Some of us
really fall in love with them.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.270
NATALIE STARKEY: Don't we all?

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.940
But it's not human.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.755
So there's big issues of
sending humans into space.

00:20:37.755 --> 00:20:39.880
If we're going to send them
to land on an asteroid,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.710
well asteroids don't have
an awful lot of gravity,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:42.970
because they're small objects.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.130
So they're going to
have to be tethered on.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.120
I can't remember what
they did in "Armageddon."

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.984
I think they were just
roaming about freely.

00:20:48.984 --> 00:20:51.400
They would probably have floated
off into space, you know.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.430
So it's not easy to send
humans to these objects.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.100
I'm sure it will happen in the
future, way into the future.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.914
But for now, it will be robots,
which again, is not easy,

00:20:59.914 --> 00:21:01.330
because as you
know, you're trying

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.860
to run a robot from Earth
and millions of miles away,

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.740
it has it's issues.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.198
Communication times are tricky
because it takes a long time

00:21:08.198 --> 00:21:09.010
to communicate.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.150
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:09.770
Can't joystick it.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.840
NATALIE STARKEY:
And things go wrong.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.730
Like I ran a lab
instrument for many years

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.470
and I could be in
there tinkering with it

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.594
and if something went wrong,
I could change things.

00:21:16.594 --> 00:21:18.636
But if that instrument is
way off on an asteroid,

00:21:18.636 --> 00:21:19.760
there's nothing you can do.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.510
If it breaks, there's not
really an awful lot you can do.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.220
So yeah, there's lots of issues.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.678
SCOTT MAXWELL: But
we have actually

00:21:25.678 --> 00:21:27.490
sent space missions
to these objects,

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.230
to comets and asteroids before.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:34.541
And I would say it was pretty
evident from reading your book

00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:36.790
that you're a big fan of
both the Stardust and Rosetta

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.250
missions.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.550
NATALIE STARKEY: I am.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:37.760
Yeah.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.860
They got a chapter--

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.859
SCOTT MAXWELL: And speaking
of landing something

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:44.940
on one of those objects,
Rosetta actually did that.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.020
Tell us a little bit
about those missions

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.680
and what they accomplished.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.240
NATALIE STARKEY: I mean,
the NASA Stardust mission

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.870
was like-- it had happened.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.560
It had brought it samples back,
as I was starting my career

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.622
in this area of science.

00:21:55.622 --> 00:21:57.580
So the NASA Stardust was
really groundbreaking.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.163
It was actually quite
a cheap mission,

00:21:59.163 --> 00:22:01.860
and it flew to comet belt II.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.790
And it wanted to
bring a sample back.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.314
But it didn't have enough
money to land on this object

00:22:06.314 --> 00:22:07.230
and come back from it.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.160
So they flew through
the tail of the comet.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.560
So I've mentioned that comets
have a lot of ice and dust

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.167
in them.

00:22:12.167 --> 00:22:14.500
And as they go by the sun,
this material gets heated up.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.465
So sure enough, the ice
streams of the comet

00:22:16.465 --> 00:22:17.710
and takes dust with it.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.940
And that's what
produces the tail, when

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.481
you get in the famous
comets that you

00:22:20.481 --> 00:22:23.840
see all the beautiful images
of, that tail of material

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.644
is literally the gas and dust
coming off of that comet.

00:22:26.644 --> 00:22:28.060
And so what they
did was just flew

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.268
through the tail of this
comet and literally just got

00:22:30.268 --> 00:22:32.025
impacting particles
on this collector.

00:22:32.025 --> 00:22:33.400
And that was their
comet samples.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.140
And they closed up
their little collector

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.580
and jettisoned it back to Earth.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.320
And the rest the
space car carried on.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.080
And we have those
samples back in 2006.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.510
And they were our first
real samples of a comet,

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.810
because it's hard to know
if we've got any meteorites

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.390
or comets, because
as I said earlier,

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.000
they probably explode as
they enter the atmosphere.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.960
So it's hard to know we've
definitely got one on earth.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.624
So this was a real
groundbreaking mission.

00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:57.290
And then it also
really turned the books

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.620
on how we thought comets formed.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.440
And what it showed us was that
actually, we know it's a comet.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.550
It behaves like a comet.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:08.200
We know its orbit, that it
comes from the Kuiper Belt.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.567
And then what we find
is that actually it

00:23:10.567 --> 00:23:11.650
doesn't look like a comet.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.940
When we look at the rocks within
it, they look like an asteroid.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.474
So it doesn't sound
very exciting,

00:23:16.474 --> 00:23:17.890
but you're like,
hold on a minute,

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.440
this thing formed way out
in the outer solar system,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.892
yet it's got components
within it that look exactly

00:23:22.892 --> 00:23:24.350
like the planets,
that look exactly

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.183
like the building blocks
of the planets that

00:23:26.183 --> 00:23:27.380
form very close to the sun.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.260
So how do we get
ice and hot material

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.020
contained within one object?

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.770
So this was why
everything got blown apart

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.240
at this stage and
the scientists--

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.600
you know, and they're
still working on it.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.099
We're still trying
to understand how

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:39.100
we get hot material from
the inner solar system

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.430
out to the comet forming region
to form a comet that then is

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.240
covered in ice and dust all
the normal stuff that we expect

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.550
it to contain.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.280
And there's lots of
different theories,

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.546
but that is still
an ongoing area

00:23:50.546 --> 00:23:51.670
that we need to understand.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.580
So we know that the
story is not as simple

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.430
as it could, as we
would like it to be,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.670
as the textbooks
would have us believe.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.600
SCOTT MAXWELL: Before
we move on, to Rosetta,

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.050
Stardust also brought
us back-- in addition

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.970
to bringing us back the first
sample from a comet, brought us

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.580
back samples of
interstellar particles.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.220
NATALIE STARKEY: It did, yeah.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.690
SCOTT MAXWELL: Turn the detector
around, did it the other way,

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.232
and collected a few
of those as well.

00:24:09.232 --> 00:24:10.148
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:12.580
Basically we have particles
from interstellar space,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.210
which is the space around all
the stars in the solar system.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.150
And these particles are
traveling exceptionally fast.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.480
And we haven't really been
able to sample them before.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.030
So this kind of-- it was called
like a tennis racquet style

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:25.400
collector.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.316
It kind of just came up
out of the spacecraft.

00:24:27.316 --> 00:24:29.050
One side collected
comet particles

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.480
and then the back side collected
interstellar particles.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.220
And they're tiny.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.450
They're like so
tiny that we can't--

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.100
the comet particles are small.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.295
I'm saying like
probably a maximum

00:24:38.295 --> 00:24:39.670
of like the width
of a human hair

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.254
would be the largest particles
we collected, if that.

00:24:42.254 --> 00:24:44.670
The interstellar particles are
10 times smaller than that.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.630
So they're very hard
to see on the collector

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.290
and they're very
hard to analyze.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.621
But there was a whole instrument
built somewhere in LA,

00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:52.746
or somewhere in California.

00:24:52.746 --> 00:24:54.930
I can't remember which
university it's at.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.980
But they basically
made a whole instrument

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.240
to measure these particles,
because we can sample then

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.949
our galaxy, because
we have no other way.

00:25:02.949 --> 00:25:04.823
We haven't been able to
go out to our galaxy,

00:25:04.823 --> 00:25:06.150
but these particles come to us.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.070
So we can actually
start to understand

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.080
what our galaxy looks
like, what it's made of,

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.320
which is fascinating.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.920
So yeah, it just did
so much that mission.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.150
It was fascinating.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.400
SCOTT MAXWELL: There were
there were some other really

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.566
interesting things in there.

00:25:18.566 --> 00:25:22.290
You go into it a lot of
detail about exactly how they

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.922
were able to get some of
those samples out and so on.

00:25:24.922 --> 00:25:26.380
We might want to
come back to that.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.380
But I did want to also give you
a chance to talk about Rosetta

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.295
as well, because
it's fascinating.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:31.170
Such a great mission.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.640
NATALIE STARKEY: So I was
just really well-placed.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.530
See, I'm really
lucky to be where

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.960
I was working when the
Rosetta mission was ongoing.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.640
Now I have to say, I wasn't
in it from the beginning,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.380
because it took 20 years
to plan this mission.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.004
In fact, I think when
it was originally

00:25:42.004 --> 00:25:44.100
being planned, I was
probably still in school,

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.700
like primary kind of
school, very early.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.250
And then it took a long
time to build the mission

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.580
and then it took 10 years for
it to actually-- from launch--

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.570
to get to its comet.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.110
So it had this massive
journey in the solar system

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.370
to catch up with this comet.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:03.639
So this comet called 67P
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:04.930
SCOTT MAXWELL: I can't do that.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.160
I just-- like everybody else,
I just say Cherry Jerry.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.201
NATALIE STARKEY: Oh yeah.

00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:09.480
You can say CG or 67P.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.860
It's a long name.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.176
But it was traveling into
the inner solar system.

00:26:13.176 --> 00:26:14.550
And the idea was
that they launch

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.560
and had to do some decent
gravitational slingshots

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.880
of different planets
to catch up with it,

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.838
get enough speed, because
you can't just launch

00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:21.060
and go directly into a comet.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.720
That's literally
not how it works.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.790
So we have to just
catch up with it.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.810
So got onto an orbit eventually
to catch up with the comet.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.491
Came up on it from behind
and then entered into orbit

00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:31.240
around this thing.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.615
Now we've never
done this before.

00:26:32.615 --> 00:26:35.280
So you know, Stardust just
flew through the tail.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.360
But Rosetta was just amazing.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.810
It got to the comet and it
basically had to do a power--

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.310
it couldn't get
into orbit around it

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.540
because this object is small.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.770
It wasn't a real orbit--

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:44.760
SCOTT MAXWELL: So there's
not enough gravity--

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.510
NATALIE STARKEY: Powered
flight around it.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.690
So these people
doing engineering

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.430
and all this science
for this mission,

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.420
I just am amazed by
how they did this.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.711
But they didn't even know
what this object looked like.

00:26:54.711 --> 00:26:56.430
Before we got there,
we had no idea

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.652
of its shape or its exact size.

00:26:58.652 --> 00:27:00.360
We were expecting it
to be sort of round,

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.430
because we always kind
of envisage these objects

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.849
to be sort of round.

00:27:03.849 --> 00:27:06.390
And we got there and it turned
out to be like a rubber ducky,

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.340
and the thing is, it
caught everyone's attention

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.930
in the media quite a
lot, because it literally

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.971
looks like a rubber duck.

00:27:10.971 --> 00:27:12.850
It's got this head
and this body.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.134
And I can't imagine
how you figure out

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:18.300
how to fly around that thing
without bumping into it

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.480
or whatever.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.600
But we started to get
images back from this comet

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.060
and then mapped 100% of
the surface of the comet,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.240
because they had to pick
somewhere to put a Lander down.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.522
Again, they built this
Lander 20 years previous

00:27:30.522 --> 00:27:32.980
and they didn't know what they
were going to be landing on.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.710
Do you call it candyfloss here?

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.878
The stuff you eat at the fair.

00:27:37.878 --> 00:27:39.051
SCOTT MAXWELL: Cotton candy.

00:27:39.051 --> 00:27:39.550
Thank you.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:39.990
NATALIE STARKEY: Cotton Candy.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.230
So we call it candyfloss.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.690
So one of the scientists
likened it to like they

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.106
didn't know if they were going
to be landing on candyfloss

00:27:45.106 --> 00:27:46.350
or cotton candy or cement.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.349
They had no idea if it's
concrete hard or very soft

00:27:49.349 --> 00:27:50.640
and they were going to sink in.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.540
So they had to build a lander--

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.120
SCOTT MAXWELL: You just have
to build a spacecraft that's

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.860
going to land on something
that you don't know what it--

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.080
NATALIE STARKEY: You
have no idea what it is.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.410
It's easy.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.630
SCOTT MAXWELL: Exactly.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.457
NATALIE STARKEY: So you know,
they let the little lander go.

00:28:03.457 --> 00:28:05.040
And the Lander is
called a [? fili. ?]

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.304
And it just dropped
to the comet.

00:28:07.304 --> 00:28:09.220
But again, remember,
there's not much gravity.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.370
So the comet is not
attracting that thing to it.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.120
The comet is still
rotating in space.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.000
So they have chosen a landing
spot and they're like, yeah,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.375
we're going to
land exactly here.

00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:17.880
And sure enough,
it did initially

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.470
land exactly where
they wanted it

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.570
to go on this object
that's like three by five

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.450
kilometers in size.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.050
So it's no big.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.670
And it all hurtling towards
the sun at the same time.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.530
Unfortunately, some
stuff went wrong.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.810
One of the harpoons
that was meant

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.390
to fire when they landed
in order to kind of hold

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.980
onto the surface
and tether it there,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.080
they already knew when they were
going through their procedures

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.454
before they were
going to release

00:28:38.454 --> 00:28:40.150
fly that it wasn't working.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.900
So they already thought,
what can we do about this?

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.291
There's nothing we can.

00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:45.540
We have to just go for it now.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.331
We have to test it.

00:28:46.331 --> 00:28:48.240
So they did their job right.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.030
They got exactly
where they wanted to.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.080
But the little lander bounced.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.160
And it bounced about
kilometer up into the air.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.700
Now the issue is that it could
have just completely left

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.660
the comet because it
wasn't going to go back.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.660
It didn't bounce quite
high enough that it left.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.070
So it went back down again.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.440
And it took a few hours.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.570
And then it landed again
and had another bounce.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:07.680
So it's kind of hilarious.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.430
It did the kind of
three landings in space

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.360
and they were only
planning to do one.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.880
Unfortunately where it ended
up was not the optimal position

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.590
for the solar panels.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.305
So it was kind of
under a slight cliff,

00:29:18.305 --> 00:29:20.430
but we then learned that
comets have cliffs on them

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.410
and overhanging sections.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.460
It's kind of crazy.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.170
But it did run.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.030
It ran its primary
science sequence

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.250
when it got initially
to the comet.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.280
So we actually ended up
sampling some of the comet gases

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.250
and some of the dust that was
from the initial landing site.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.030
And did some further
science later on.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.180
So we still learn an
awful lot-- so it kind of

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.570
seems like a failure, but
it wasn't a failure at all.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.880
SCOTT MAXWELL: Not at all.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.130
NATALIE STARKEY: It got a
huge amount of science done.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:48.717
And we had-- where I was working
at Open University in the UK,

00:29:48.717 --> 00:29:50.550
we had one of the
instruments on the lander.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.345
So we had a mass
spectrometer that

00:29:52.345 --> 00:29:54.090
could measure some
of the components

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.510
from the gases in there.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.020
So we got to learn
what was on the comet.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.520
SCOTT MAXWELL: And
to your surprise,

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.600
you got samples from
like, three places.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.350
I used to work with this guy,
Ray Arvidsson, great guy, who

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.090
would say all the time,
there's no bad data.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.760
And so just because you
didn't get the exact data

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.770
that you planned to
get doesn't mean you

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.960
didn't get some great stuff.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.800
You got the stuff from--
because it was bouncing,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.430
you got it from like--

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.020
NATALIE STARKEY: We actually
got multiple locations.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.436
And then we still
have the orbiter

00:30:17.436 --> 00:30:20.010
that was still orbiting
around or flying

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.560
around the comet at the
time and doing its own work.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.444
It was measured lots
of other experiments

00:30:24.444 --> 00:30:26.985
and doing lots of other work
and measuring dust coming off it

00:30:26.985 --> 00:30:30.630
and collecting that and looking
at the plasma environment, how

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.190
the comet reacts
to the sun, which

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.680
is very important, because
we don't really know

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.030
how comets react to the sun.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.050
We know that they get heated
up and it all comes off.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.430
But we found out that
actually every time

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.290
this comet, 67P,
went by the sun,

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.600
it loses about a meter of
material off its surface.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.301
So it gets smaller and smaller
because those volatile ices

00:30:49.301 --> 00:30:51.550
and everything get heated
up and blown off the comet--

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.460
SCOTT MAXWELL: They all
have to go somewhere.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.835
NATALIE STARKEY: That dust
that is sitting above it, it's

00:30:54.835 --> 00:30:57.840
that kind of dehydrated layer
on top, and it all comes off.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.554
So you lose a huge
amount of material.

00:30:59.554 --> 00:31:00.970
So it's a very
active environment.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.261
A comet is constantly changing.

00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:04.140
You go, oh yeah, they're
these old objects

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.919
and they preserve the very old
history of our solar system,

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:08.460
but actually if they
come by the sun,

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.830
they're changing all the time.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.730
And we see they have seasons.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.980
We notice that the comet
had different seasons on it

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.990
depending on where
you were on the comet

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.930
and where it was in
relation to the sun.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.360
So and that moves
material around the comet.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.559
We see movement of, you
know, like active processes,

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.850
like you would see on a planet.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:24.350
It's crazy.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:25.183
SCOTT MAXWELL: Yeah.

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:26.980
That's amazing I hadn't
heard that before.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.914
That's really cool.

00:31:28.914 --> 00:31:31.080
So long as we're talking
about these space missions,

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.621
I just want to give
a quick shout out

00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:36.240
to the Dawn mission, which
after 11 years of exploring

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.900
the asteroids Vesta and Ceres is
running out of maneuvering fuel

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.580
kind of middle of next month.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.660
And so it's going to
say goodbye to us.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.410
But just a little
shout out to Dawn

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.081
for a long and
honorable mission,

00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:52.080
increasing our understanding
of the very objects

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.330
that we're talking about here.

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:02.564
So you were talking about--

00:32:02.564 --> 00:32:04.980
we talked about this earlier,
that there isn't necessarily

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.900
a sharp distinction between
these asteroids and comets.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.790
And so now that we've
had these missions

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.494
to kind of look at
asteroids close up

00:32:10.494 --> 00:32:11.910
and look at comets
close up, we're

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.310
kind of learning more
about how like there

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.310
isn't asteroids and comets.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.814
There's more like kind of
attractors in the space

00:32:18.814 --> 00:32:20.730
where there's things
that we would confidently

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.530
call asteroids and things we
would confidently call comets,

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.429
but also a lot of things
kind of in between.

00:32:24.429 --> 00:32:26.220
So what have we learned
from these missions

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.010
that kind of helps us understand
that continuum a little better?

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:29.190
So

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.315
NATALIE STARKEY: We think--

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:32.820
we've learned that-- for me,
I think what I've learned

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.740
is it almost doesn't matter.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.530
So we have objects that sit at
either end of this continuum.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.570
But if we want to
study our solar system,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.820
it really doesn't matter
which ones we study too much.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.319
And the ones in the middle are
probably the most fascinating

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:46.740
because they contain
the primitive material.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.780
So the ones that
contain a lot of carbon

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.450
and a lot of organic matter.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.380
The ice is important,
but actually

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.704
understanding the dust that
came from the beginning

00:32:55.704 --> 00:32:57.870
of the solar system is great
and the organic matter.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.439
And so the next
two missions that

00:32:59.439 --> 00:33:01.980
are going to study these objects
are both going to asteroids.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.630
So we've got a Osiris Rex,
which is a NASA mission.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.720
And there's a Japanese
mission called Hayabusa II.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.385
They did Hayabusa I already
and that collected some sample

00:33:09.385 --> 00:33:10.980
and brought that back.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.314
And so we've had-- it didn't
go completely successfully,

00:33:13.314 --> 00:33:14.938
so they're taking
another try and going

00:33:14.938 --> 00:33:16.320
to do it perfectly this time.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.990
But these two missions have
arrived at the asteroids.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.840
And they're both basically
primitive asteroids.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.240
So they're almost--
they're not cometary-like.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.240
They're still asteroids.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.114
But they have a lot of
primitive material in.

00:33:27.114 --> 00:33:29.390
So we can try and understand
these kind of beginnings

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.380
of the solar system.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.750
So they're both going to
be bringing samples back.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.830
I've forgotten right now what
dates we're talking about,

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.020
but it's kind of within
five years, I think,

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.579
or something like that,
will be returning materials.

00:33:40.579 --> 00:33:42.870
So they've started their
mapping phase of these objects

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.040
and they're going
to be looking where

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.230
they're going to put their
landers down and sampling.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.730
But it's proper
science fiction stuff.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:48.230
I love it.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.185
It's just fascinating
they can do this.

00:33:50.185 --> 00:33:52.560
SCOTT MAXWELL: We are going
to the solar system and like,

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.390
going to visit comets
and asteroids where

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.880
they live and like, bringing
stuff back from there.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.040
Yeah, that's really
amazing stuff.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.310
So we talked a little about how
they're going to kill us all.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.430
And what we would do about it.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.010
So we talked about kind of
like spray painting asteroids

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.699
and things like that.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.860
One of the techniques I
had not heard about before,

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.290
before reading your
book, was gravity tugs,

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.900
which is another interesting
way of diverting asteroids

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.320
or comets off their path.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.810
And it is nice because it works
with unconsolidated things

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.310
as well.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.977
Want to explain how
a gravity tug works?

00:34:25.977 --> 00:34:27.726
NATALIE STARKEY: So
some of these objects,

00:34:27.726 --> 00:34:30.310
even the asteroids, like I said
the comets were not very well

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.059
consolidated, not very
well held together,

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:34.529
because this is a scoop
of cloud kind of thing.

00:34:34.529 --> 00:34:36.570
And some of the asteroids
on the other hand, also

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.080
are unconsolidated.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.690
They might be made
of rocky material.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.940
But imagine just getting
like a load of big pebbles

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.170
and just kind of
sticking them together.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.029
And they're sort of
held there because this

00:34:45.029 --> 00:34:47.630
is a bit of gravity and there's
nothing really acting on them

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.005
in space that would mean that
they wouldn't just all fall

00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:50.520
apart.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.987
So they're sort of
loosely bound together.

00:34:52.987 --> 00:34:55.320
These objects are particularly
dangerous because they're

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.130
hard to move.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.810
If you want to hit
them with something,

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.490
they're probably just
going to break up.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.140
So we have to be very
gentle with them.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.790
If we know one of these
objects is heading towards us,

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.280
it's hard to know how they're
going to behave when they

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.770
come through the atmosphere.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:10.790
So the gravity tractor
thing is almost just

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:14.270
taking a spacecraft up and
using thrusters on one side

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.700
to sort of gently nudge--

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.340
and basically it's the
attraction between that rubble

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.092
pile and that spacecraft,
which isn't very much,

00:35:23.092 --> 00:35:24.800
but if you've got
enough advance warning,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.990
you start doing that
little playing game

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.430
and like, nudging it back
and forth early enough,

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.990
then it will change its orbit.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.329
So essentially you kind of
want to nudge it very gently.

00:35:33.329 --> 00:35:35.120
And it's just that
gravitational attraction

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.786
between the two
objects, which obviously

00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:39.990
happens even if they're small,
there is still something there.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.040
So that would be very useful
if it were a rubble pile

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.462
style asteroid.

00:35:44.462 --> 00:35:45.920
I could work with
other ones, but I

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.710
think that's probably the
safest way to me one of those--

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.535
maybe.

00:35:50.535 --> 00:35:52.910
SCOTT MAXWELL: But you know,
more research needed, right?

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:53.230
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.317
SCOTT MAXWELL: Yeah.

00:35:54.317 --> 00:35:56.150
And that's something
we haven't done before.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.880
We actually have fired
a bullet basically,

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.550
Deep Space One fired a bullet
into the side of a comet,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.230
but we haven't tried these
other techniques at all.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.880
NATALIE STARKEY: So yeah--

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.330
SCOTT MAXWELL: It's all kind
of theoretical at this point.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.620
NATALIE STARKEY: There's a
mission called Deep Impact--

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:06.830
Deep

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:07.310
SCOTT MAXWELL: Impact.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.690
Excuse me.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:08.510
NATALIE STARKEY: Don't confused
it with the movie "Deep

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.820
Impact," and that was
confused in my book,

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.660
because my editor was like,
oh, you've got a mission

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:11.990
called Deep Impact.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.073
There's also a Hollywood
movie called Deep Impact.

00:36:14.073 --> 00:36:16.040
And I was like, yeah,
that's complicated.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.610
So I think I ended up
taking out all references--

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:18.091
SCOTT MAXWELL: Now
they need to do

00:36:18.091 --> 00:36:19.850
a NASA mission
called Armageddon.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.450
NATALIE STARKEY: Yes, that would
be good, just to confuse it.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.790
So yeah, this mission
actually basically pushed

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:29.930
a boulder, fired a boulder into
the side of this comet to see--

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.640
well, basically to see what
would happen, because it's fun,

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.690
but also to excavate
a hole so that we

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:37.210
could see inside the comet.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.960
It was kind of already
a little bit wrong,

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.890
because they created so
much dust from this impact

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.330
that the spacecraft
couldn't then see anything.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.955
There was just so
much dust everywhere.

00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:48.704
But luckily actually
the Stardust mission,

00:36:48.704 --> 00:36:50.694
when it carried on, when
it had got it samples

00:36:50.694 --> 00:36:52.610
and sent those back, the
Stardust next mission

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:53.960
had carried on.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.117
And it managed to
image that hole

00:36:56.117 --> 00:36:57.450
in that crater that was created.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.570
So we got to see
processes happening.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.670
And again, they saw
changes happening over time

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.060
in that crater they created.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.351
So you see, they've got this
kind of active comet thing

00:37:05.351 --> 00:37:07.260
again, which is really cool.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.710
So yes, it's kind of one
space mission did it.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.900
And then we came back
and had another look.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.520
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.146
So we're at just
about 40 minutes here.

00:37:15.146 --> 00:37:17.811
And probably about time to start
kind of mixing in some audience

00:37:17.811 --> 00:37:18.740
questions.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.995
While we're kind of
finding the first victim

00:37:20.995 --> 00:37:24.650
and giving them the
mic, one of the major--

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.620
another major topic in your
book was about mining asteroids

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.490
and comets.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.550
So they actually
contain material that

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.440
would be useful to us on earth.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.980
It's not just organics, but
also nickel and platinum

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.402
and things like that.

00:37:38.402 --> 00:37:40.610
You want to talk a little
bit about mining techniques

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.160
and what the state
of the art there is?

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:42.470
NATALIE STARKEY: Sure.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.310
So of course, again it
sounds like science fiction.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:46.340
It's like, do we really
need to mine in space?

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.560
But you know, those
companies, a lot of them--

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.130
a lot of stuff going on in
California where we want--

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:52.700
there's actually
companies investing

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.430
in this trying to think, can
we go and mine these objects?

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:56.400
We could mine the moon.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.180
There's lots of materials on
the moon that would be useful.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.390
But equally, it might be
easier to mine asteroids.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.460
They can be easier to get to
and they don't have gravity,

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.835
so they're easy
to get back from,

00:38:05.835 --> 00:38:07.460
if we want to launch
a mission back.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.209
And they contain a lot
of precious metals,

00:38:09.209 --> 00:38:11.547
so we all love our
smartphones and everything,

00:38:11.547 --> 00:38:13.130
computers-- obviously
we're in Google.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.697
So we like all these materials
that require precious metals.

00:38:17.697 --> 00:38:20.030
And if we're going to continue
creating new technologies

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.530
in the future, we
need to know we've

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:24.380
got a reliable source of things
like palladium, platinum,

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.827
all these things that
are used in technology.

00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:29.660
We won't be able to
develop new technologies

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.280
if we don't know we've got a
continued source of this stuff.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.980
And on earth, things
like platinum,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.750
well, it's expensive because
there's not much of it.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.958
We find it very hard to mine.

00:38:36.958 --> 00:38:39.440
It's very dispersed throughout
the crust of the earth

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.270
and it's expensive
to mine and often

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.400
not very good to the
environment to get out.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.440
If we go to asteroid,
well, there's tons of it.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.200
Actually there's
probably more platinum

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.636
in some single asteroids
than we've ever mined

00:38:49.636 --> 00:38:50.760
on the whole of the planet.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.819
So we run into
economical issues.

00:38:52.819 --> 00:38:54.860
If we were to mine it and
bring it back to Earth,

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.980
well, we'd crush the market.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.900
And obviously then
it will probably

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.390
be not worth having done
the whole mining thing.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.250
Maybe we store it like
we do with diamonds

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.260
and we release it gradually
and control the market.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.468
Anyway, I'm not an economist.

00:39:04.468 --> 00:39:06.230
But there are issues
to doing that.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.819
It may cost trillions
of dollars--

00:39:07.819 --> 00:39:09.860
literally trillions of
dollars to actually launch

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.735
these missions and go
and mine these objects.

00:39:11.735 --> 00:39:14.150
But the chances you
could actually--

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.890
they could be worth
way more than that.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:19.477
So there is-- I guess if
you have a lot of money

00:39:19.477 --> 00:39:21.560
and you think it will be
fun to go mine asteroids,

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.020
there is the potential you
could make a lot of money.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.470
Of course, we need reusable
rockets, because it's just

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:27.470
too expensive otherwise.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.390
We need to-- so that
obviously a lot of companies

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:30.920
are working on that
right now, being

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.740
able to cheapen getting
stuff into space,

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.660
because it's just
massively expensive.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.520
But if we can find
ways around this--

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.394
and I think progress is
definitely being made

00:39:40.394 --> 00:39:41.240
at the moment--

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.194
we can get to space
cheaply and we can

00:39:43.194 --> 00:39:44.360
start to mine these objects.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.360
But we don't have to bring
all that stuff back to Earth.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.790
It could be useful in space.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.740
And we want to go to Mars.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.350
We want to venture out
further into our solar system.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:53.736
But we need--
first of all, fuel.

00:39:53.736 --> 00:39:55.610
It's very expensive to
bring fuel from earth.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:58.286
If we want to go out into
the solar system, fine.

00:39:58.286 --> 00:39:59.910
We have enough fuel
for a little while.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.159
But then if we want to land
somewhere and go and visit

00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:03.470
somewhere else, we need fuel.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:07.142
And if we launch it from earth,
it's just very, very expensive.

00:40:07.142 --> 00:40:08.850
The more fuel you
take, the more fuel you

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:10.060
need to take that fuel.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.820
And there's an
exponential relationship

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.850
and it just gets crazy.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.370
So if we can find
the fuel in space,

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.980
then sure enough we have water.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.520
If we can split water
into hydrogen, oxygen,

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.310
we can create rocket
fuel in space.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.650
So again, it sounds
like science fiction,

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.810
but we can then also use these
objects to make materials

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:26.310
in space.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:27.794
3D print what we
require, instead

00:40:27.794 --> 00:40:30.210
of taking all our tools from
Earth, which we currently do.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.140
If we go to the
International Space Station,

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.598
we have to take
everything with us.

00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:36.834
And we have to launch
missions just to resupply it.

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.250
Well, we wouldn't
need to do that.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.939
We could just actually
go and 3D print.

00:40:39.939 --> 00:40:42.480
So they're actually testing a
3D printer on the International

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.821
Space Station, and it
sounds crazy, but yeah.

00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:47.070
That is something we could do.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.278
We just mine the asteroid,
get the materials we need,

00:40:49.278 --> 00:40:51.120
and make the tools we
require into space.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.730
So yeah, it's happening.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.325
It seems like-- I think the
first steps in asteroid mining

00:40:57.325 --> 00:40:59.700
are probably going to happen
within the next few decades.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.460
They're very tentative steps, of
like getting there, prospecting

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.650
basically, seeing what
these objects contain,

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.960
and then figuring out
what kind of missions

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.900
we require to maybe tug them
into an orbit where they're

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.040
sort of safe and they're
going to sit quite happily

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.540
so that we can then
launch a mission

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.370
to mine them in some way.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.960
Whether we need humans,
it's unknown at the moment.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.750
This is why people talk about
needing a moon base for lunar

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.790
base for humans to live, and
that they could then mine

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.715
from the moon kind of thing.

00:41:25.715 --> 00:41:27.660
So it's a lot of
unknowns at the moment,

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.940
but there's definitely
progress being made.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:34.770
And like the US has created
laws now about mining in space

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.410
and who owns the
materials they've mined.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:39.640
So any US citizen
theoretically, if they

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.662
mine something in space,
they can own that stuff,

00:41:42.662 --> 00:41:43.620
which is kind of crazy.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.880
And I don't know what
the rest the world

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.213
thinks about this at the moment.

00:41:46.213 --> 00:41:48.714
I think Luxembourg are
following very similar laws.

00:41:48.714 --> 00:41:50.380
I don't know if they've
passed them yet.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.810
But again, Luxembourg is tiny.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:52.740
I don't know if you've
been, but there's not

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.906
many people that live there.

00:41:53.906 --> 00:41:56.520
So I'm not sure how many
people are Luxembourg citizens.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.090
But yeah, is that fair?

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.304
I kind of think, well,
I'm not a US citizen.

00:42:00.304 --> 00:42:01.470
I want to go and mine space.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.095
But I wouldn't be
allowed at the moment

00:42:03.095 --> 00:42:04.980
to own the space that I mine.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.962
So yeah, a lot of issues,
and a lot of global issues,

00:42:08.962 --> 00:42:09.920
I think, that we need--

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.336
SCOTT MAXWELL: But it seems
like they're worth working out

00:42:12.336 --> 00:42:13.470
because there's so much--

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.340
potentially so
much wealth there.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.700
And it it's not just wealth
in terms of making you rich,

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.930
but wealth in terms
of, as you said,

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.460
things like resources
to make smart phones

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.293
and stuff like that.

00:42:21.293 --> 00:42:22.560
NATALIE STARKEY: Exactly.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.850
SCOTT MAXWELL: I never really
thought about this before,

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.184
but asteroids like have all
these resources that we need

00:42:26.184 --> 00:42:28.475
and a whole lot of fuel that
we can use to help further

00:42:28.475 --> 00:42:29.640
explore the solar system.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.260
Asteroids are basically
the convenience stores

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:31.820
of outer space.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.470
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah, I kind of
said they're the gas stations.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.330
You just kind of pop there
and get what you need

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:37.079
and then carry on.

00:42:37.079 --> 00:42:39.450
Of course, it's not
as simple, but yeah, ,

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.509
I kind of like that idea, that
it might happen in the future.

00:42:42.509 --> 00:42:44.800
SCOTT MAXWELL: So I think we
have an audience question.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.600
Is it ready to go?

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.225
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:46.225 --> 00:42:48.700
I was going to ask about
asteroid mining, so--

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.907
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:49.907 --> 00:42:50.740
SCOTT MAXWELL: Good.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.540
I've ruined your question.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.290
I'm sorry, Bryant.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.520
AUDIENCE: I actually
have a question.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.962
Have you ever seen
the movie Melancholia?

00:42:55.962 --> 00:42:56.300
NATALIE STARKEY: No.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.520
AUDIENCE: You ever heard of it?

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.353
NATALIE STARKEY: No.

00:42:58.353 --> 00:42:59.382
AUDIENCE: Check it out.

00:42:59.382 --> 00:43:00.840
Basically the
premise of that movie

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.000
is that a large planet sized
body is heading towards Earth

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.300
about the size of Jupiter.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:07.800
It's huge.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.175
NATALIE STARKEY:
Oh, my goodness.

00:43:09.175 --> 00:43:11.200
AUDIENCE: It's huge,
like just ginormous.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.932
The whole thing is that the
scientific community sees it

00:43:13.932 --> 00:43:15.890
well in advance, like
several years in advance.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.650
NATALIE STARKEY: I mean,
you would see that coming.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.500
AUDIENCE: So they're planning
it and they're releasing

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.680
all this information--

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.850
I don't want to give away
too much of the movie,

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.160
but the premise is
that it basically

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.450
slingshots around the Earth.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.866
And they think
it's going to pass,

00:43:25.866 --> 00:43:27.990
but the slight tug of
gravity from the Earth

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:30.490
is just enough where
it reaches its apex

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:33.870
that it turns around and
comes straight back after it.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.990
So my question would
be like, you're

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.234
kind of doing a theoretical
science around how

00:43:39.234 --> 00:43:40.650
we would deflect
or move something

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:42.120
that is smaller than earth.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:42.660
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.868
AUDIENCE: Is there any
science or theoretical physics

00:43:44.868 --> 00:43:47.700
and science going on about
how we would move something

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.270
that could be much, much--

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:50.104
NATALIE STARKEY: No.

00:43:50.104 --> 00:43:51.478
AUDIENCE: Larger
than the planet.

00:43:51.478 --> 00:43:54.060
NATALIE STARKEY: I think there's
almost 0% chance of anything

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.620
larger than the
Earth hitting Earth,

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.100
because the solar system
has settled down now.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.640
So like I mean 4.5
billion years ago,

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.612
Earth was hit by a
Mars-sized body, we think.

00:44:02.612 --> 00:44:04.320
And that's what actually
formed the moon.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.820
So it collided with the Earth.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.403
We're not sure of
the details of that,

00:44:07.403 --> 00:44:09.780
whether it was a direct impact
or a kind of a side shot,

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.010
but it probably, almost
certainly vaporized the Earth.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.611
And then from that, we formed
our Earth again, but also

00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:16.110
our moon.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.270
So that's the kind of thing
that would happen here.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.769
It would just be completely
obliterated if anything larger

00:44:20.769 --> 00:44:21.810
than Mars were to hit us.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.410
But at this stage, the
solar system is settled

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.860
and, I mean, I think it just
couldn't happen, but I mean,

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:28.756
you never know.

00:44:28.756 --> 00:44:31.380
SCOTT MAXWELL: I'm sure it makes
for a good movie all the same.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.280
Have you seen this
mic by the way?

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.910
This is really cool.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.080
You can just toss it around.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.496
NATALIE STARKEY:
I did wonder what

00:44:35.496 --> 00:44:36.955
it was when it was sat up here.

00:44:36.955 --> 00:44:39.210
AUDIENCE: So I was
fascinated to hear

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:43.160
about the inner and
outer asteroid belt.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.410
And it sounds like they're
materially different.

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.169
I mean, the outer one
has a bit more ice,

00:44:48.169 --> 00:44:49.210
which maybe you'd expect.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:50.293
It's farther from the sun.

00:44:50.293 --> 00:44:53.434
But other than that, are
these different populations?

00:44:53.434 --> 00:44:54.350
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:55.933
AUDIENCE: And so
what segregates them?

00:44:55.933 --> 00:44:59.280
NATALIE STARKEY: So it's just
probably more based on density.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.802
So the inner objects
are denser and formed

00:45:01.802 --> 00:45:04.010
under hotter conditions so
they're more consolidated.

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:05.020
They're rocky.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.119
They're metal-y The ones on
the outer edge probably--

00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:09.910
they probably formed
when the comets formed

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:11.470
and were knocked into there.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:12.670
So they are a lot--

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.090
less dense, so they probably
have a lot of pore space.

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.580
So actually when we got
to the Rosetta comet,

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.850
M67P we were able to
measure its density, which

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.130
is really cool, because
although it's made of rock

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:25.930
and it's made of
ice, it actually

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.450
has a really low
density, because it's

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:29.470
got lots of holes in it.

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:31.780
So they're not big holes,
not like gaping big holes

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.700
in the side of
it, like cavities.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.305
But it's very porous,
very fine scale--

00:45:36.305 --> 00:45:38.430
but very porous, like it's
got a lot of gaps in it.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:40.540
So it's just not very
well pushed together,

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.900
whereas the objects on
the inner asteroid belt

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.080
are very kind of--

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.490
probably no pore
space whatsoever.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.290
So that basically controls it.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:49.840
So these, as you
move on out, you've

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.630
just probably got a
transition gradually

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.457
from the inner to outer.

00:45:54.457 --> 00:45:55.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.320
AUDIENCE: In college.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:07.880
I did something where we had
designed these transmitters

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.950
to put on near-earth objects.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.680
There was a lot of concern
that the smaller objects that

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.660
were harder to detect could
be the thing that does us in,

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.250
instead of the larger objects
that are easier to detect.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:21.740
NATALIE STARKEY: Yep.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.020
AUDIENCE: And it was just--
it was a design class.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.430
We didn't actually deploy it.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:28.880
But is there any movement
in trying to do anything

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.149
to look at near-earth objects?

00:46:30.149 --> 00:46:31.190
NATALIE STARKEY: So yeah.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:34.010
We are currently
tracking basically all

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.517
the near-earth objects
that we can possibly see.

00:46:36.517 --> 00:46:38.600
The ones that are caught
sort of in normal orbits.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.350
They say those ones
because there couldn't

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.320
be some random objects
that are, at the moment,

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.630
far out that are going to
become near-earth objects.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:46.205
But we don't know
they're coming yet,

00:46:46.205 --> 00:46:47.330
because they're very small.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:51.680
So those are kind of the
unknown unknowns, I guess.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.720
But the ones that
we can see and we

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.340
are tracing the
orbits of all the

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.770
time-- so we're
constantly updating

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.420
where we think
they're going and how

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.000
they're spinning, because it's
very important to understand

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.820
how they heated up.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.070
I said earlier about
deflecting them.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.570
If you paint one side
a different color,

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:06.770
it will spin differently.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:08.960
Well, there's two effects
that happen in space.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.360
[? York ?] and Yarkovsky effect.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.070
And that determines
how these things spin

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:14.990
and how it affects
their orbit basically

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.670
as they're heated up by the sun.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.400
So we sort of know most of
them aren't going to hit us,

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.149
but we need to just define
those two phenomena very clearly

00:47:23.149 --> 00:47:25.440
and then we can know exactly
where they're going to go.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.950
So some of these objects are
on sort of a hazardous list,

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:29.180
but we just need
to better define

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.680
exactly where they're
going and then

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.291
they can be removed
from that list.

00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:34.790
But yeah, when we're talking
about the size of these things,

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.415
it's funny, because
even if it was just

00:47:36.415 --> 00:47:37.831
a couple of hundred
meters across,

00:47:37.831 --> 00:47:39.500
it could still cause
a lot of damage,

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.789
depending on it was made of.

00:47:40.789 --> 00:47:42.830
If it's a pure piece of
metal, yeah, sure enough.

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:44.900
It's going to probably
get through the atmosphere

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.560
quite easily.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.100
And wherever that hits, it might
not cause global devastation

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.470
like we saw with the
dinosaurs being killed off,

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:53.930
but it could cause
quite a lot of issues.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.060
And we've had impacts
in the past which

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.500
haven't been
massive, but they can

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.780
create things like nuclear
winters essentially.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.047
You can have years--

00:48:01.047 --> 00:48:03.380
like when you get a massive
volcanic eruption, like it's

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.160
the same kind of thing.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.870
You can change the
climate of the planet

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.610
for a considerable time.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:09.680
And I would suggest
that humans are fairly

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.320
kind of a vulnerable species.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.900
We want clean water.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.470
We require movement around
the planet quite a lot.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.320
And I think if anything
like that happened,

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.130
we could be quite
vulnerable species.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.226
So even if it was
a smallish impact,

00:48:22.226 --> 00:48:23.975
it could just cause
quite a lot of issues.

00:48:23.975 --> 00:48:25.350
But obviously the
larger impacts,

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.220
if we're talking kilometer
sized bodies, a little larger,

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.920
they're going to be
a bigger problem.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.030
So understanding those
kind of small ones

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.280
that are still quite large
is a really important area.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:38.600
Kind of 400 meters across and
so they're pretty dangerous

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.690
and they're hard to see.

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:42.148
So we need to understand those,
especially if they're dark.

00:48:42.148 --> 00:48:44.930
If they're proper like dark,
carbonaceous asteroids,

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.577
they're very hard
to see, because they

00:48:46.577 --> 00:48:47.660
don't give off much light.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.520
So that's what
astronomers rely on,

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.770
these things giving off light.

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:52.430
That's why comets
are easier to see.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.277
They shine.

00:48:53.277 --> 00:48:54.860
Whereas asteroids
can be a bit sneaky.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.000
So we have to be careful.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.500
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the interstellar dust

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.740
that was collected.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.770
It might be outside the
scope of this conversation,

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:11.000
but I was wondering if it gives
us any kind of understanding

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.650
of the original Big Bang
and maybe supporting

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:17.900
the theory of the
Big Bang, or is it

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:21.570
really more like stuff
that's 4.6 million years old

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:23.381
and is very localized dust?

00:49:23.381 --> 00:49:25.130
NATALIE STARKEY: So
I'm going to have say,

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.130
I don't know to that,
actually, because I've not

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.690
kept up with that
interstellar stuff very well.

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:32.150
But I know that it's
basically allowing us

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.510
to look into our local galaxy.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.667
And I don't exactly know
when that dust was formed.

00:49:37.667 --> 00:49:39.500
But what they've been
able to do is actually

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.470
measure the isotopes of the
elements of that material,

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:44.420
and that allows us
to understand a lot

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:46.430
about our local
environment, like what

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:48.420
our solar system formed from.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.570
And obviously we expect
that different galaxies

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:53.420
are going to be different
compositions, because they

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.034
formed at different times maybe.

00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:57.200
I mean, we still don't
really understand all of that

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.797
because we haven't been
able to sample it or look

00:49:59.797 --> 00:50:02.130
at it very clearly because
these things are so far away.

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:05.330
So it's kind of understanding
a little bit further back

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.340
in our history what is in there.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:11.120
But yeah, I'd have
to say I'm not sure.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.010
AUDIENCE: So recently
there was big news

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:17.410
about this asteroid from
outside the solar system that

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:18.270
blitzed through.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:19.550
NATALIE STARKEY: I'm so
glad you mentioned this.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:20.675
We hadn't mentioned it yet.

00:50:20.675 --> 00:50:21.530
So yeah.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:22.340
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:27.320
Is that something that was
a 1 in 100 year event or was

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.400
that a question of our
sensors are getting better

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.400
and we can expect to see
more of them the more--

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.090
NATALIE STARKEY: Exactly.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:32.660
The latter.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.240
So we think-- so I'll just
backtrack a little bit.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.420
So this object came
through our solar system.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.370
We actually think now
it was probably a comet,

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.450
but we're not 100% sure.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:43.825
We weren't able to measure it
very well because we didn't

00:50:43.825 --> 00:50:46.160
know it was coming, but so
it wasn't on the normal orbit

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.380
that all the other comets and
asteroids and planets are on.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.713
It just literally came zipping
through our solar system.

00:50:50.713 --> 00:50:52.400
It was so fast
that it didn't even

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.170
get caught into the
gravity of our sun.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:55.390
It just zipped by.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.470
And it came from some
other star system.

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:58.680
We have idea where.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.550
And it's probably been some like
interstellar travel forever.

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:04.020
Who knows when it formed?

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.980
It came from very far away.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.700
So it's been going for at
least billions of years.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.457
And it just zipped through.

00:51:10.457 --> 00:51:11.790
So we don't know a lot about it.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:12.840
We just know that it's--

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.640
I think called Mu--

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.480
is it called Mu-ama?

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.857
Like I think it's Hawaiian for--

00:51:16.857 --> 00:51:18.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I didn't
know how to pronounce it.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.398
NATALIE STARKEY:
Amua-mua, I think.

00:51:20.398 --> 00:51:23.160
And I think that's Hawaiian for
something like distant traveler

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.329
or something like this.

00:51:24.329 --> 00:51:25.620
I probably pronounced it wrong.

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.000
I don't know Hawaiian.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.670
But basically if we knew
one of these was coming,

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.050
we could launch
a mission, again,

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:33.150
to go and sample it, because
this would be fascinating.

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:34.650
We'd learn about
that star system

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.530
that it came from, which could
be completely different to what

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:38.280
we're seeing here.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.595
Probably would be.

00:51:39.595 --> 00:51:40.470
It could be the same.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.920
Who knows?

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.270
But we know it came
from somewhere else.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:44.145
And we just haven't seen
one of these before.

00:51:44.145 --> 00:51:46.050
I think probably other
objects like that

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:47.610
have gone through
the solar system,

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:48.980
but we haven't spotted them.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:49.920
They go very fast.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.470
I think it was just chance
that it was seen as well.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:53.810
But it is fascinating.

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.020
And I would love to have
some sample of that comet.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.270
It would be so cool to analyze.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.259
But yeah, I'm hoping--
you know, in the future

00:52:00.259 --> 00:52:02.550
as we get better at seeing
these things coming-- again,

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.494
it wasn't very big.

00:52:03.494 --> 00:52:04.910
It was also really
weirdly shaped.

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:07.334
It was like a cigar shape,
really long and kind of

00:52:07.334 --> 00:52:09.375
like-- you know, maybe
it's some alien spaceship.

00:52:09.375 --> 00:52:10.614
Who knows?

00:52:10.614 --> 00:52:12.030
SCOTT MAXWELL: So
basically you're

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.216
saying we're being visited
by cigars and rubber ducks?

00:52:14.216 --> 00:52:15.132
NATALIE STARKEY: Yeah.

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:17.950
SCOTT MAXWELL: Groucho
Marx would be so happy.

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.890
So we just have a
couple of minutes left

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:22.842
and I wanted to ask you
if European Space Agency

00:52:22.842 --> 00:52:24.550
or NASA or somebody
came to you and said,

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:26.400
hey, we'd like you to be the
principal investigator that

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.100
is the top science person for
the next space mission that's

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.890
going to go and maybe
explore one of these objects,

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.098
what would you want it to be?

00:52:32.098 --> 00:52:33.860
What would you do
with that mission?

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.760
NATALIE STARKEY: Well, I
wouldn't be able to choose.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.840
At the moment, we've got
these missions Osiris Rex--

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.160
SCOTT MAXWELL: Well, they're
not giving you two missions.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.570
Just one.

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:44.740
NATALIE STARKEY: So I would want
to go and explore the Kuiper

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.376
Belt better, get samples of it.

00:52:46.376 --> 00:52:48.000
I'd want to explore
more of the comets.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.025
But equally, some of the really
exciting scientific things

00:52:51.025 --> 00:52:52.900
happening right now are
Enceladus and Europa.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.400
Now this isn't
comets and asteroids,

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.370
but this is potentially finding
life in our solar system.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:59.520
These are moons of
Jupiter and Saturn

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.162
and they have liquid oceans
beneath their icy crust.

00:53:03.162 --> 00:53:04.620
And there's a really
high potential

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.750
that they could have life--
probably not intelligent life,

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:09.000
but there could be life there.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.390
And for me at the moment,
I'm just fascinated by that.

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:13.034
And I-- we are going to one.

00:53:13.034 --> 00:53:13.950
We're going to Europa.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:14.880
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.740
My wife is working
on Europa lander.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.030
NATALIE STARKEY: So
that's going to be soon.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:19.946
And we will hopefully
go to the Europa clipper

00:53:19.946 --> 00:53:21.990
mission, Enceladus.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:24.799
Unfortunately, we found that
Enceladus had this liquid ocean

00:53:24.799 --> 00:53:27.340
as well after they've already
planned this mission to Europa.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.714
But it might actually be a
better place to look for life.

00:53:29.714 --> 00:53:32.614
It might-- it doesn't have quite
the same horrible radiation

00:53:32.614 --> 00:53:33.780
environment that Europa has.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.890
So I can't choose.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:37.770
I literally can't choose.

00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:39.380
Pluto is also fascinating.

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:40.320
We've flown by it.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.170
We've learned a lot
by just flying by it.

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.420
But it's a Kuiper Belt object.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.003
SCOTT MAXWELL: Yeah,
who knew that was

00:53:45.003 --> 00:53:46.310
going to be so fascinating?

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:47.040
NATALIE STARKEY:
But there's probably

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.290
other really fascinating
objects in the Kuiper Belt

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.290
that we need to look at.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:52.290
So we just haven't
explored it enough.

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:53.520
And it's just too far away.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.550
So yeah, I need to kind of
speed up time, time travel,

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.370
and then come back
and get some samples.

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:00.210
But yeah--

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:03.550
SCOTT MAXWELL: It's wonderful
to have so many good choices,

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:04.110
right?

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:05.430
NATALIE STARKEY: That's true.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.140
SCOTT MAXWELL: Dr.
Starkey, thank you.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.723
This has been a
terrific conversation.

00:54:07.723 --> 00:54:08.600
Thank you so much.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.270
NATALIE STARKEY: Thank
you for having me.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:11.040
SCOTT MAXWELL: The book--
absolutely, our pleasure--

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.330
the book is "Catching Stardust--

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:14.490
Comets, Asteroids, and the
Birth of the Solar System."

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.200
And all the stuff we talked
about and so much more

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:16.700
is in it.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.169
I encourage you to read it.

00:54:18.169 --> 00:54:20.460
Please join me in thanking
our guest today, Dr. Natalie

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:20.960
Starkey.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.210
[APPLAUSE]
