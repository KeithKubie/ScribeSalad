00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.300
Alright.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.860
With the recent popularity of Blade and your recent disappointment with...Steel...

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.000
I really thought Shaquille O'Neal was going to be the next Mark Wahlberg!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.920
It just makes sense to discuss who will get what going forward.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.700
Yeah, that dark stuff with Blade worked pretty well. We're going to try some of that.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.040
Nope! Our next seven movies are going to be cashing in on the dark stuff,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.820
destined to all be hits!

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.220
But all we got is light-hearted crap coming up!

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.100
Well, that's why you have the Caped Crusader.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.960
After Batman &amp; Robin?!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.480
Nobody's going to want to see
 another Batman movie in years!

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.960
Hey, we're switching it up too. We've got a colorful and corny Spider-Man movie coming out,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240
from the director of Evil Dead.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.140
Yeah, it's probably not going to break any records,
 but it should be a huge hit with the kids.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.120
Fine, I guess we'll do another Batman movie,
 even though there's no money in it.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.420
Christ. Years from now everyone's going to associate Marvel with dark and gritty,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.200
and DC with bright and playful.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.700
Right?!

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.960
Well then, there should be no problem signing this television contract.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900
Wait, this is affecting our shows too?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.460
Oh, yes.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.020
You see, all your shows will be upbeat and positive,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.580
while all of ours are going to be depressing and harsh.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.940
It'll make you want to kill yourself.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.520
But what if we end up completely misunderstanding our audiences and we end up doing the exact opposite?

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.380
It's OK, our animation departments will fill in the blanks.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.540
We'll keep ours goofy and harmless while you keep yours complex and intriguing.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.960
With some exceptions.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.100
But what if somehow DC's material for children ends up doing more adult work than our material for adults?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.620
[ Laughter ]

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.480
Yeah, and they're gonna do a cartoon version of 
The Killing Joke with a hard R rating.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.200
That was bizarrely specific.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.700
Yeah.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.900
So, anything else?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.000
One more thing, are you sure you don't want any of your shows to be tied to this Netflix format that's getting a lot of buzz?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.040
Yeah, like anything's going to kill cable!

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440
No, you guys can handle that.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.640
Besides, we don't want to be known as those guys that always copy Marvel.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.320
That is a very valid point.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.580
So, anything else?

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.860
Yeah, what are our plans in terms of comics?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.820
Phhht, who gives a shit?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.680
Yeah.

[♫ Intro ♫]

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.200
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.180
Comic book movies have had a lot of ups and downs over the years.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.820
Sometimes they were on top of the world,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.620
and sometimes they were Daredevil.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.640
But when comic books films were seen at their most unpopular,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.100
one little kickass movie came along and said:

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.780
"Hey, not only am I gonna be awesome,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.020
but people are gonna completely overlook me when they say Deadpool was the first R-rated comic book flick!"

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.840
How do you sleep at night, Internet?! 
How do you sleep at night?!

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.980
I am, of course, talking about the late-90's hit, Blade!

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.880
When people talk about influence in recent comic book films, they usually go to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.500
The Dark Knight or Avengers.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.800
But many forget this did play a big part in not only getting popularity back to the genre,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.200
but also creating a ton of tropes still used in comic book movies today.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.460
Written by David S. Goyer and directed by Stephen Norrington...

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.660
Two people you thought were gonna be comic book gods...

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.660

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.120
While also being about as 90's as a commercial where "Kids Rule!"

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.440
Does the Classic Coolness overrule the Dated Silliness?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.580
Well, let's see if this vampire spectacle sucks in a good way or bad way.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.580
This is "Blade".

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.800
We open up with Blade's birth, seeing his mother slowly bleed to death.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.080
Always a pleasant start.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.500
The credits roll as you can tell already this movie has a bad case of the 90's simply by its sped-up footage.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.440
It was a simpler time, when we were so blown away by the Fast Forward Button.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.760
We see a woman driving her date to apparently a hot nightclub.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.320
Man: So where we going?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.160
Woman: It's a surprise, baby.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Man: Yeah, I like surprises.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.860
Man: Yeeaah!

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.980
NC: "I'm just here to die or be saved.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.160
Character Tool all the way!!"

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.340
They enter a club playing music that sounds like your Atari's trying to throw a rave...

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.440
...When we come across an effect even better than speeding up the footage...

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.880
...speeding up the footage with a white flash!

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.780
Whoa! Our 90's minds can't handle this!

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.760
You're blowing us away with what we hit our computers for doing today!

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.020
NC: But our midnight snack is about to get a surprise when he finds he's stumbled into a literal bloodbath.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.020
Man: No! No!

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.680
NC: I guess this is supposed to be scary,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.300
But nowadays, you'd probably just see this at any goth club.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.980
"Dude, the blood is supposed to rain at 4.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.940
Right now, you're supposed to be dangling the rubber gimps. "

NC: He finds all of them have vampire fangs...

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.380
Again, a usual non-scary occurrence at a goth club...

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.340

NC: The vampires try their hardest to wave their fingers at him,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.800
but it doesn't work as he partakes in some pretty kickass fight scenes here.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.140
NC: Damn! I'm possessed.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.820
Wonder if I can play the accordion too!

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.440
NC: Oh, yeah, gun. That...usually wins over swinging hooks.

Resulting in tons of people either getting killed or maimed.

Blade: Okay, I'm leaving. I'm really leaving this time.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.840
Karen: Hillburn Clinic.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.380
Blade: So where are you taking it?

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.380
Cop: I don't know what you're talki--ARGH!

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:21.580
NC: Hmm...Does nobody care that a guy with a sword is slamming a cop's head into a car?

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.340
NC: I mean, never forget NWA,

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.520
but I think at least someone would at least raise an "Umm..."

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.780
NC: He escapes, though, causing Blade and Karen to follow him through Fast Forward Lane.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.780
Cop: Get me Pearl!

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.240
Cop: I got a delivery for Frost here and I just had a run-in with Blade!

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.640
Cop: Gotta clear out that clinic on Hillburn now!

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.680
NC: Okay, if you wanna do pointless speedy footage, that's fine.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.160
But at least have them talk the way they're supposed to talk.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.660
NC (As Cop with very squeaky and fast voice): "Calling all cars, calling all cars!

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.080
I just had a run-in with Blade!

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.640
Send in all cars,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.160

Me, I want A HULA-HOOP!"

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.680
Blade: Vampire Anatomy 101: Crosses and running water don't do dick,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.420
so forget what you've seen in the movies.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.720
You use a stake, silver or sunlight.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.280
NC (As Blade): "Yeah, forget all that stuff you've seen in the movies.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.440
Concentrate on this stuff, like in the movies."

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.440
NC: So while the vampires sit around partying...

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.140
Watching Mortal Kombat...

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.740
Yeah, you vampires are gonna find a lot of blood in that movie.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.400
...the cop tells Frost of his run-in with Blade.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.080
Cop: Don't worry about it, it's no problem. We can still get the girl.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.420
NC (As Cop): "Um, am I fired or is this a promotion?

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.880
As a guy who wants to be a vampire, I genuinely don't know."

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.520
NC: In case you forgot, that bat means that they're vampires.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Symbolism!

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.660
NC: Blade and Karen come across the person who keeps track of all the archives and *laughs* okay...

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.420
Even for a movie about a guy who chases vampires, that's pretty Silly.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.300
NC (As Jabba the Hutt) "Bring me Solo and the Wookiee."

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.560
NC: Good thing he's not a woman, or else that would suddenly be indecent.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.920
NC: They get captured by Quinn and his gang, but it looks like Blade has backup.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.380
Whistler: Catch you fuckers at a bad time?

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.380
NC: As long as you don't have a copy of "A Star is Born", then no.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.440
NC: They escape into the subway that just happens to be connected to the vampire archives...

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.040
Odd design work...

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.600
As they wait for the longest train ever to pass and then end up literally catching a ride on it.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.960
Karen: Oh my God!

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.700
NC: *makes indecisive noise*

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.860
Yeah, OK.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.120
NC: So Whistler reveals why Blade seems to have all the vampire strengths and few of their Weaknesses.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.860
Whistler: Blade's mother was attacked by a vampire while she was pregnant.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:47.300
She died, but he lived. He can withstand garlic, silver, even sunlight.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.500
NC (As Whistler) "He also obtained an aversion to taxes as well."

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.760
NC: I'd like to point out I waited this long to make a tax joke, I think I did pretty well.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.620
NC: Karen consoles Blade during his all-important wall watching,

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.740
While Frost and his goons apparently kidnap the leader of the vampires to kill him.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.960
NC: They should probably all fry up,

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.340
but it's okay because the other vampires have sunblock and helmets.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.280
NC: Was Marceline's sun hat not available?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.920
NC: Karen uses her doctor know-how to figure out how to make vampire heads explode...

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.000
Science!

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.800
NC: When Whistler makes a discovery about her.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.160
Whistler: You don't look so good.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.420
NC(As Whistler): "I mean, the studio won't let you look bad, so this is what we count as 'not good.'"

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.740
Whistler: I guess we didn't catch it in time.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.820
NC: So it looks like she's still gonna turn into a vampire in a day or two.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.580
But that doesn't get in the way of a meeting between Blade and the now helmet-less Frost.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.260
So wait a minute...

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
If he have enough sunblock, the day doesn't bother you?

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.640
'Cause if so, being a vampire is literally a day at the beach.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:53.820
Frost: Easy.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.440
Frost: Wouldn't want our friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton, now would we?

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.860
NC: But Blade sees saving people as more of a secondary thing ...

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.260
And tries to shoot Frost, causing him to toss the child.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.440
NC: Dead!

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.960
NC: Oh, I mean, uh, no scratch on her whatsoever.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
She must be wearing a lot of sunblock, too.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.800
Blade: Go home!

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.160
NC: What the hell do you think this guy is talking about?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.960
NC (As Guy): "I mean, I know we just saw a man fly into the street, save a kid,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.500
And we're all just going to ignore it.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.880

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.600
It affects your work, so no one takes you seriously.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.720
Malcolm (As Blade): That's just a sugar coated topping...that YOU can control.

Try Davides-Goyer!

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.340
Davides-Goyer seems effective at first, like the miracle you've always been looking for.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.660
But then on closer inspection, you realize it might not be as effective as you thought.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.880
Your denial will tell you it's doing a good job, but after a while you can't ignore the pain it's causing.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.380
It's not as bad as it was before,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.380
but it's still really bad.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.180
People will like your work at first because they see you have Goyer attached to it.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.780
But then they'll wake up and realize that most of it was dumb luck, surviving on the talent of others.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.940
Doug: Everybody says the techniques were great, but the product was overall shit.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.120
Malcolm (As Blade): You'll not only realize it did less than you thought,

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.240
but is actually slowing you down compared to other successful medicines.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.120
Tamara: At first, I thought it worked great.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.280
But now I see it's just a bigger placebo than Dumbo's Magic Feather.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.980
Blade: Experts agree: "It's not the WORST thing out there."

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.760
"It did some good things, I think...though maybe that was other people."

Yeah, they're surprisingly kinda laid back about It.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.540
But Frost also discovers Blade's hideout *offscreen*...

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.660
You know, It's good to show and don't tell, but when you don't do neither you have neither.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.180
...and tries to capture them.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.760
NC: Stop aiming at the rails and maybe you'll hit something!

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:41.620
NC: Blade comes home to see what happened as he gives one hell of an emotional, breathtaking,

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.660
Oscar-caliber reaction to his fatherly mentor being destroyed.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.180
Blade: *sigh*

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.940

Darth Vader: I am your father!

That sucks.

NC: Whistler still has a few breaths left in him, as he tells Blade where they took Karen

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.480
Whistler: Frost is trying to...

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.200
Figure out...

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.520

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.640
I can see why you brought a doctor into your home.

Whistler: Gimme your gun.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.540
Whistler: Now walk away.

just to die again in another sequel.

It's a well-planned-out future that lies ahead for me."

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.480

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.760
He turns some vampires' heads into Bob the Tomato.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.360
Or Bob the Ketchup.

Blade's Mom: Eric?

You'd think someone would've used that bombshell a little earlier.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.740
Frost: You spent your whole life looking for the vampire who bit your mother. Well, here I am.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.520

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:56.020
Karen: If it works, you lose your strength and your ability to regenerate. You'll be completely human.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.520
NC: Huh.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.960
So the cure is totally freaking useless.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.320
NC: Don't get me wrong. I know she uses it on herself, but from a story perspective, what happens?

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.900
She gets bitten, they say they didn't get to it in time, so she makes a cure.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:16.700
If you...just cut out them not getting to it in time, which adds nothing to the plot at all,

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.180
the cure is entirely not needed.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.800
But it's okay, because if you love pointless, drawn-out moments,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.540
You're gonna love what's coming up next.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.000
NC: So, here's the setup:

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.140
Frost needs to lay out 12 of the vampire council in this ancient temple with Blade's blood,

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.820
combining with them this one night because through Comic Book Mumbo Jumbo,

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.820
it'll make him a vampire god.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.500
Silly, but whatever.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.500
Sounds kinda fun, there's possibilities with it.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.100
The downside is, where it took me only a few seconds to say all that, it takes the movie ten minutes

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.900
to do it. Yeah.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:56.320
They just kinda sit around, talk, laugh, talk, talk and laugh, laugh and talk.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.900
All I wanna see is the action, but it takes for-friggin-ever with detours.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:07.160
But I know what you're thinking. Through all of this, what ever happened to Karen's doctor friend?

Well, we're gonna spend a lot of time on it anyway.

Because, hey.

You do the math on that one.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:28.880

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.600
Sure, and vampires sparkle, too.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.260
But who cares about that, because who cares about all of this?

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:42.620
It's literally just ten minutes of slow, boring filler, and it feels like an eternity.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.620
Vampire Woman: You're afraid we're gonna steal your soul?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.280
Your pureblood spirit?

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.580
Vampire Woman: You should be. Read the prophecy.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.040
It's time you fffffucks contributed something to the cause.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.640
Other Council Vampire: Even if Frost is right, you really think he cares about you? You're gonna die.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.320
NC:  Well, I guess he wasn't needed for the ceremony.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.800
What, did they just bring him along because he looks like William Fitchner?

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.540
Because to be fair, every movie needs more William Fitchner.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.920
NC: After the ceremonial ripping open up the shirt...

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.540
Very necessary...

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.180
Karen escapes and tells Blade to suck her blood to get his strength back.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.960
All while the temple is turned into a human plasma ball.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.180
*Screaming*

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.840
NC: Of course! All vampire skeletons have...

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.920
tiny skeletons inside of them just trying to get out.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.000
With wings!

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.100
How long do we have to wait again?

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.100
OK, OK, OK...

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.940
NC: Blade does Freud proud by penetrating his mother with a long, hard bone...

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.160
resulting in him finally jumping in to get revenge.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.000
Quinn: I got two new hands, Blade.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I don't know which one to use to kill you with!

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.740
NC (As Blade): "Well, doesn't matter what I do now.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.540
I am never topping that throughout the rest of the film."

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.540
NC: From here, it's all the cool stuff you wanted to see.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:22.420
Amazingly flippable guards, ripping out a guy's throat just to throw it at another guy,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.560
being launched in the air via nut kick.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.280
Even the stuff that's kinda stupid is really awesome.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.000
Like how Karen continues to hit everything except what she's supposed to hit.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.980
This weird scene where they keep kicking the air for some reason.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:39.840
NC (As Blade and the Soldier): "Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. "

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.340
NC (As Blade): "Gotcha!"

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.060
NC (As Soldier): "Ow! That Hurt!"

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.020
NC: And the fact that even though there's weapons that can clearly kill vampires,

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.440
nobody ever thinks of using them on Blade.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.320
What do you got there? A plank of wood?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.640
Oh, yeah, that'll take him down.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.040
Oooh! A shovel!

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.580
That has to be his undoing.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.340
"Blade destroyed by deadly shovel."

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.400
You guys really thought you'd be gods?

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.800
You're using wood!

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.460
Unless it's the...aliens from "Signs", it's not gonna do much.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.760
Oh, who cares?

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.960
Because it's still kickass gory amazingness, all building up to the final boss.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.600
Frost: Hey, Blade. Let's do this.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.740
[♫ Ninja Gaiden Music ♫]

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.480
NC: But it looks like his blood is made from pizza cheese as well as some other cartoony extras.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.960
Frost: My turn!

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.320
NC (As Frost): "Finally, the time has come for me to stop doing those stupid eBay commercials."

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.280
NC: But Blade finds the serum that makes vampires go boom and he unloads them on Frost,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.940
resulting in him saying his big finishing line.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.240
Blade: Some motherfuckers are always trying to ice skate uphill.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.300
NC: ...That is a really weird note to go out on.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.320
NC: To this day, I can't figure out if that was really clever

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.360
or one of the dumbest lines ever said by a comic book character.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.560
NC: What do you think the other variations were?

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.880
"Some mothertruckers are always trying to put diesel in their SUVs."

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.780
"Some peanut M&amp;Ms are always trying to melt in your hand but not in your mouth."

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.080
"Some sushi patrons are always trying to mix their soy sauce with wasabi."

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.240
"Some fast food lovers are always ordering Little Caesars without the crazy bread."

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.360
"Some vacationers are always trying to go to Disney World at peak times

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.360
when it's obvious that mid-November through mid-December is the best time to go.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.660
I mean, seriously. Just bring a sweater and you'll be fine.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.700
And don't forget to take advantage of those hotel villages with free shuttle bus service.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.700
Full price for their monorail access resorts?

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.240
I don't think so, Mouse!"

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.020
NC:  He kicks the last needle into his head, finishing him off.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.540
NC (As Tetsuo): KANEDAAA!!!

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.260
NC: Huh...

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.380
So, I guess, he can't put himself together after that.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:55.900
Being a god just means being slightly less destructible than you already were.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.860
Good to know that the ancient gods of old can't compete with head blow-y up science.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.600
So...we all know the drill...

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.620
Blade and Karen kiss in a romantic embrace, even though they have very little in common--

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.120
Karen: I need to get back to the lab.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.500
Blade: It's not over.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.400
There's still a war going on, and I have a job to do.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.200
NC: Uhh...

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.000
NC: I don't think you know how this works.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.860
He's a dude. You're a chick.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.180
You have to end up together, even if you have no chemistry at all.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.200
It's...

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:26.800
Like...

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.300
A law.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.720
Blade: You want to help? Make me a better serum.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.580
NC: Wow...

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.500
NC: Really?

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.500
NC: They...don't get together?

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.600
There is such a thing as a man and a woman working together in an action film

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.300
and they don't have to hook up?

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.640
Quickly, Tumblr! Rewrite this ending so that not only do they get together,

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.500
but they have 20 children, all with different sexual Identities.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.020
If 20 sexual identities don't exist, make them up! You're good at that.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.320
NC: We travel to Moscow for really no reason except to get this cool shot.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.020
And we end with him hunting vampire ass once more.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.460
And that was Blade!

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.460
An overlooked comic book staple, and...

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.500
To be honest, still pretty damn cool.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.880
Ok, the writing's not always good and there's a lot of 90's cheese, but

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.380
there's just a style and creativity to it that still makes it really enjoyable.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.380
It's not too mopey that it can't be fun,

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.400
but it's not too silly that it can't be serious.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.200
It's visually awesome, its characters are entertaining,

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.000
and the action is still Impressive and gets you sucked in.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.640
It got people saying comic book movies could be cool

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.180
at a time when they were being seen as box office Pearl Harbors.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.460
This is one of the films that helped get movies like Dark Knight and Iron Man into the spotlight again.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.300
So if you want something that rarely makes sense but is still a pretty rocking good time,

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.480
this is definitely one to take a look at.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.780
NC: I'm the Nostalgia Critic,

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.540
and some Fruit by the Foots are always a few inches short.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.120
YYYAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
