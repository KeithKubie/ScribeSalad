today's generation of scientists is
 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.160
today's generation of scientists is
tackling science and see science in

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170
tackling science and see science in
 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.450
tackling science and see science in
fairly substantially different ways in

fairly substantially different ways in
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.970
fairly substantially different ways in
the previous generation first and

discipline is limiting is not impossible
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.280
discipline is limiting is not impossible
and is not without value but to not be

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290
and is not without value but to not be
 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.549
and is not without value but to not be
capable of connecting other disciplines

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559
capable of connecting other disciplines
 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.250

and so I think the capabilities of
 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.830
and so I think the capabilities of

for scientists so that all scientists

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890
for scientists so that all scientists
 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.730
for scientists so that all scientists
have some sort of unification some core

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740
have some sort of unification some core

think that scientists now see the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180
think that scientists now see the
 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.630
think that scientists now see the
connection of their work to society at

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640
connection of their work to society at
 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.380
connection of their work to society at
large they see how their work can be

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390
large they see how their work can be
 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.420
large they see how their work can be
misused and misinterpreted they see that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430
misused and misinterpreted they see that
 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.690
misused and misinterpreted they see that
the funding for their research is coming

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700
the funding for their research is coming
 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.390
the funding for their research is coming
in many cases from taxpayers and so

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400
in many cases from taxpayers and so
 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.000
in many cases from taxpayers and so
there's a natural desire and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
there's a natural desire and
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.110

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.730
responsibility correlate responsibility
in the part of scientists to have

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740
in the part of scientists to have
 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.380
in the part of scientists to have
transparency and find ways of

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390
transparency and find ways of
 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.120
transparency and find ways of
communicating and I think that the fact

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130
communicating and I think that the fact
 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.310
communicating and I think that the fact
that more scientists are blogging right

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320
that more scientists are blogging right
 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.730
that more scientists are blogging right
now or are blogging right now are is a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740
now or are blogging right now are is a
 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.790
now or are blogging right now are is a
sign of new ways of kind of bypassing

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800
sign of new ways of kind of bypassing
 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.620
sign of new ways of kind of bypassing
traditional media outlets to create this

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
traditional media outlets to create this
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.660
traditional media outlets to create this
direct communication channel with the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670
direct communication channel with the
 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.370
direct communication channel with the
general public and it's allowing the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380
general public and it's allowing the
 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.400
general public and it's allowing the
public to connect with scientists and

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410
public to connect with scientists and
 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.900
public to connect with scientists and
scientists connect with the general

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910
scientists connect with the general
 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.090
scientists connect with the general
public and very very very powerful ways

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100
public and very very very powerful ways
 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.080
public and very very very powerful ways
I think science is also a more global

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090
I think science is also a more global
 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.250
I think science is also a more global
enterprise today and so there is value

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260
enterprise today and so there is value
 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.460
enterprise today and so there is value
in being able to understand how to

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470
in being able to understand how to
 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.560
in being able to understand how to
connect and how to navigate across

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570
connect and how to navigate across
 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.400
connect and how to navigate across
cultures and languages and geographic

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410
cultures and languages and geographic
 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.520

boundaries science has always been a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530
boundaries science has always been a
 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.250
boundaries science has always been a
borderless enterprise but today more so

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260
borderless enterprise but today more so
 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.060
borderless enterprise but today more so
than ever before and when you look at a

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070
than ever before and when you look at a
 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.449
than ever before and when you look at a
project like the Human Genome Project

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459
project like the Human Genome Project
 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.160
project like the Human Genome Project
that brought together you know 29

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170
that brought together you know 29
 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.530
that brought together you know 29

project which is employing half the
 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.500
project which is employing half the
particle physicist in the world coming

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510
particle physicist in the world coming
 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.180

globalization and so I think that

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
globalization and so I think that
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.949
globalization and so I think that
creates a new lifestyle yeah for being a

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959
creates a new lifestyle yeah for being a
 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.630
creates a new lifestyle yeah for being a
scientist so all of those things are

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640
scientist so all of those things are
 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.020
scientist so all of those things are
making scientists more

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030
making scientists more
 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.240
making scientists more
I'm engaged in global citizens
