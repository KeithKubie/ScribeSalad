00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.850
So we said we're going to
focus on what we do online.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.939
So let's dig deeper into it.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.430
What that we do online should
be considered private?

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.625
Okay, so what is private?

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:16.035
And I think we're really talking
about either data that is going to be

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:21.541
stored in digital form in computers,
or some activity that we do and

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:26.007
record of that activity is
what we're talking about.

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.516
So financial statements,
we do online banking,

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:33.526
credit card statements,
all these financial records,

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:37.550
we would say, that should be private,
for two reasons.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.440
It's no one's business how I spend my
money or how much of it I have, but

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.040
if they gain access to these,
of course, they can do identity theft.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.333
Health medical conditions,
health information is obviously

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.390
highly sensitive and
we don't want that to be made public.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.570
Legal matters they're attorney client
privileges, and things like that.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.807
Well, most people would view that as
something that is private information.

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:06.858
If it's online in email messages or
certain files that are stored in

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:12.100
a computer, of course, you would
view them as private information.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.540
Biometrics, fingerprints for

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.130
example, which could be used for
gaining access to certain information.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.390
You would think your fingerprints
shouldn't be arbitrarily collected,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.720
shared, be made public and
things like that.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.460
So you would say this
is private as well.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.810
Your political beliefs,
what party you belong to.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.510
Well, you can always find out from
what button someone's wearing or

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.770
what party they contribute to but

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.830
it's no one's business if I
don't want to make it public.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.460
Remember, it's your ability to control,
and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.540
when you making a contribution or when
you are putting a button of supports

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.260
on a certain candidate, to do that.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.070
So the ability to control is
what is privacy is all about.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.720
So my political belief,
unless I want to disclose it,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.710
there's no reason why someone
should find out about it.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.290
Although we didn't talk about
privacy related laws, but

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.500
in the US there are laws
that cover some of these.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.220
Health, for example, HIPAA.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.910
Financial, there is Sarbanes-Oxley and
things like that.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.990
So, the privacy laws, not only this
information is private, considered

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.790
private, but those who thwarted privacy,
there could be sanctions against them.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.240
Well, if we go on school records,
your employment record is private.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.590
Most of us would want to
keep our annual evaluations,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.610
won't want them out in the public.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.000
School records, how you do your
grades are actually covered again

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.100
as regulation, and things like that.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.400
And more interestingly,
our web browsing habits.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.870
What do we search?

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.910
What websites do we visit?

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.570
What kind of websites?

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.410
If somebody knew, then maybe they'd know
your political beliefs, for example.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.010
So what we do online,
you would think that's private.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.940
Communication that's not public.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.430
Emails that you send or
phone calls that you make and so

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.260
on, you would think that is private.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.640
Our [INAUDIBLE] and we've been talking a
lot about metadata and stuff like that.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.560
And a lot of people are upset and
surprised and some maybe not because

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.420
we did think phone calls,
we had control in a sense that

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.740
we knew that the government wouldn't
collect information about those.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.230
So communication is certainly a thing
that you would consider private.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.040
And if you sort of keep going down
this line, what we do in cyberspace,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.948
what about stuff that's about us
that can be seen by others online.

00:03:31.948 --> 00:03:34.000
Going back to whenever.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.370
What about past history?

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.654
So the interesting are the right to be
forgotten this thing in the EU now that

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:42.105
we have, and
we'll explore it a bit more.

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:47.260
It says if there's information about me
that's irrelevant I don't want Google

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.822
to actually return that as a result
of a search that somebody performs.

00:03:51.822 --> 00:03:56.502
So if there's information out there
that was collected and made public or

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.390
made available to somebody,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.400
is that forever or do I have
the right to remove it at some point.
