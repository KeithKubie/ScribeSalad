00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:02.985
The global life expectancy is 74.1 years

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:06.495
but in the US it's a bit higher at 78.6

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:09.715
This amounts to 28,689 days

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.120
or 2478700000 seconds

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.160
alive on Earth. So

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.880
what can happen in that time?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.360
You produce 0.4 millilitres of saliva per minute

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:24.325
and 0.15 - 1 liter per day.

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:26.965
That means in a life time you can fill anywhere between

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:30.025
180 to 360 bath tubs full of spit

00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:32.735
Men cry an average of 1 time per month

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:35.625
and women 2.7 times, giving you an

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:38.755
average of 1745 good cries per lifetime

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.585
The average adult is not getting their

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.625
10000 steps in as the average US adult takes 5100

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:47.605
steps per day. But in a lifetime it ends up being a

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:50.865
pretty impressive 146801 steps.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.265
If the average stride length is 0.71 metres

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:57.385
then you'll walk around the length of the equator around 2.6 times.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:00.365
Men are continually  making new sperm

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.295
producing 10 to 10 trillion sperm cells in a lifetime

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:06.815
and people generally start having sex around age 16 to 17

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:10.255
The baby boomers have had an average of 11 sexual partners

00:01:10.255 --> 00:01:13.105
but milleannias are only excpected to have

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:16.425
around 8 sexual partners throughout their lives.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:19.975
From the ages 20 to 60, it's estimated to learn 1 to 2 new words per day

00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:23.335
with an average total of 42 thousand words.

00:01:23.335 --> 00:01:25.555
This number declines as we age

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:28.625
and is likely related to our brain decaying at a rate of 5% per decade

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.555
after the age of 40.

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:34.625
The average person 15 years or older in the US works 7.9 hours

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:37.565
per day and with the average day of retirement

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.525
being 63, you'll spend around 16 years in total

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:41.525
at the office.

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:45.255
But are you really working or just looking at memes?

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:48.485
One study found that young adults use their phones 5 hours per day

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:51.465
and check their phone at 30 second burst

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:54.745
85 times per day. when you do the maths that adds up to about 13 years

00:01:54.745 --> 00:01:58.025
on your phone. That doesn't even include Netflix where

00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:00.425
subscribers upwards of 500 hours

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:03.655
per year streaming content, which means at this rate you'd spend

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:06.345
around 4.5 years watching Netflix.

00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:09.165
In your lifetime you might be a millionaire with the average bachelor degree

00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:12.045
holder earning 1.8 million and those with a collage

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:15.105
degree earning 1.1 million. Of your fortune

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:17.365
alcohol consumption accounts for about 0.9%

00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:20.175
of annual income with 515 spent

00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:23.445
on alcohol per year. Per day men sleep about

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:26.455
496.4 minutes and women sleep for 507.6 minutes

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:29.335
on average a statistically

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:32.485
significant 11 minutes more than men which means

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.695
more than a third of your life is spent snoozing.

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:38.895
But even when you're awake we spend 10% of our day with our eyes closed

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:41.665
as the average person blink 28,800 times

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:44.685
per day or 15 to 20 blinks per minute.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:47.820
By the age of 30 you'll likely get the flu twice every decade.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.800
The incidence may decrease as medicine continues to improve

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.740
but may also increase because of the amount of time indoors

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.360
A study in the journal of nichore

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.360
found that we spend 87% of our lives indoors and 6% in a vehicle

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.500
The Earth, which you are currently standing on will travel 73 billion 800 hundred 84 million kilometres in your lifetime.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.860
So no mater what happens, you've  travelled billions of kilometres through space

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.440
and that's pretty cool.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.420
Thank you so much for watching

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.000
now you know what happens in 1 lifetime,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.200
you can also find out what happens in 1 minute

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.060
in the end of the video which we will link to over there

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.260
it is equally as fun.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.040
And is actually 1 minute long.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.520
Literally

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.520
