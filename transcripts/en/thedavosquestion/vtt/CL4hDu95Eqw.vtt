00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:03.270
&gt;&gt;I'm Andrew Ross Sorkin for the New York
Times here in Davos,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.250
Switzerland, on day two of the World Economic
Forum's annual meeting.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.910
You know, one of the issues that keeps coming
up, and we're hearing it

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.081
over and over again is this question about
capitalism, this question is

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.090
about free market, especially as so many world
leaders, politicians,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.440
executives, regulators from around the world
look at the experience of

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.849
the United States and the financial crisis
in particular.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.649
You know, a CEO from India said to me the
other day, you know, for the

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.319
past 20, 30 years we looked at the U.S. as
the bastion of capitalism,

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:36.040
the example that we hoped to be.
And we made that bet, as he said, he took

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.950
all that -- he said his
country took of its chips and moved them from

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.910
black to red on the
roulette table.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.160
But now we're looking at the experience you
had in the U.S., and we're

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.730
saying, maybe we made the wrong bet.
I've heard the same thing from executives

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.570
and regulators in China, the
same thing from executives and regulators

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.940
in Europe.
I think it's a question that's going to go

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.130
much beyond this conference
here into conversation that's going to continue

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.680
at least for the next
several years.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.590
I'm Andrew Ross Sorkin from the New York Times.
We're on NYTIMES.com/Davos, we've used throughout

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.470
the week.
Thanks so much.
