Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
European History. So, as you’ll recall from

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.720
our previous episode, a declining European
population due to disease and war in the 14th

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.580
century meant that labor had become much more
valuable, which shifted long-held beliefs

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.840
about how society should be organized.
Amid all this upheaval, and to some extent

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.609
because of it, the Florentine author Francesco
Petrarca, aka Petrarch, was unleashing his

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:31.019
critique of 14th century life. “Living,”
he lamented, “I despise what melancholy

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.780
fate/ has brought us wretches in these evil
years.”[i]

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.910
Oh, Petrarch, are you sure you weren’t writing
about now? It’s almost like people always

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.530
feel like they live in the worst possible
time.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.650
At any rate, not happy with the state of things
in Europe, he turned to Plato, Cicero, and

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.930
other ancient writers, whom he thought of
as residents of the Old Age.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.570
In fact, Petrarch gave the era in which he
lived its name--calling them the “middle

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:08.220
ages” just as his writing and research helped
usher in a New Age that we now call the Renaissance.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.030
[Intro]
According to Renaissance author Leonardo Bruni

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.069
in the early fifteenth century, “Francesco
Petrarch was the first with a talent sufficient

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:27.020
to recognize and call back to light the ancient
elegance of the lost and extinguished style.”

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.189
The Renaissance, meaning revival or renewal,
harkened back to what was seen as the bright

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.990
light of classical antiquity, which had then
been obscured in the dark and ignorant Middle

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.420
Ages.
But in some ways, the Middle Ages existed

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.790
simultaneously with the Renaissance. Like
just as scholars were reviving translations

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.450
of Plato and integrating knowledge from the
Islamic world, the bubonic plague went on

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.840
killing people;
and in Petrarch’s hometown, ordinary people

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.750
like the Ciompi were vigorously protesting
living conditions. Which brings us to an old

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.409
question here at Crash Course: Was the Renaissance
really a thing? Was it in fact just a continuation

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.380
of the medieval world? Or was it the dramatic
change that Renaissance thinkers believed

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.670
it to be?
The writers and thinkers of the Renaissance

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.140
scoured monasteries for ancient works, initially
written or at least influenced by Roman writers.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.990
It was from this manuscript-hunting--especially
for works by Cicero, and Tacitus, and Quintilian--that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.610
Renaissance scholars began to focus on so-called
humanism. That is to say, they became more

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.640
interested in worldly and human concerns.
And because the Renaissance really was a revival,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.760
this new thought was based on learning about
old or ancient ways, especially in the study

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.650
of the “humanities”. The three liberal
arts of grammar, rhetoric, and logic, led

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.030
to the so-called sciences of theology, philosophy,
laws, and medicine.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.390
The study of the humanities as developed by
the ancients focused not on the heavens or

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.430
saints but on human speech or rhetoric, human
logic, and the correct use of language. And

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.260
by language, of course, they mostly meant
Latin--being able to write in Latin and even

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.140
perform Latin orations was seen as key to
a fully educated life, as every high school

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.530
Latin teacher will be happy to tell you.
Competence in these fields was seen as crucial

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.040
to developing the self and a prerequisite
for joining Florentine or Venetian elites.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.090
Like, Venetian youth Lauro Quirini, for example,
studied the humanities at the University of

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.120
Padua and then was sent to work in a Venetian
enterprise on Crete, fully prepared for his

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.490
new job as a commodities trader, although
he also worked as a translator and a writer.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.210
You might say he was a real Renaissance Man.
I’m sorry.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.330
The Italian city-states were the heartland
of the early Renaissance. In these prosperous

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.740
cities, artists, composers, writers, and scholars
thrived along with the commerce that paid

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.920
for everything.
Urban merchants and manufacturers built a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.310
brisk business that brought in products and
ideas from around Afroeurasia. And some families

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.260
achieved immense wealth, which allowed them
to support the world of Renaissance thinkers

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.820
and artists in a system called patronage.
I would like a phenomenally wealthy patron

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.940
like Lorenzo Medici. If any of you are out
there, I am available. And I would like all

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.120
your ducats.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.620
at any rate, banking institutions also sprang
up, and bankers funded civic events and the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.040
construction of lavish cathedrals.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.780
Bankers also backed or personally paid for
the building of masterworks in the classical

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.310
style--that is, in the style of the restrained,
stately design of the pre-Christian Roman

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.560
Empire.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.400
Did the Globe open?
Is there a neoclassical piggy bank in the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.540
center of the world? There is!
You know all those white statues of the renaissance

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.990
that take their whiteness from the white statues
of the ancient Greeks and Romans? Yeah, they

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.190
were not white!
They were painted. Like, here are some of

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.500
our best guesses of what actual classical
statues looked like, and as you can see, not

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.180
very much like neoclassical white piggy banks.
Nonetheless, the idea of unpainted marble,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.130
or porcelain, or whatever has proven so powerful
that even though we now know that ancient

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.650
statues were painted, we still don’t paint
our neoclassical ones.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.880
Bankers also financed artists needing funds
to complete their works, including Botticelli

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.420
and Michelangelo.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.030
And city governments themselves were also
important patrons of the Renaissance,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.330
while individual leaders often spent as much
as six percent of their personal income on

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.020
the arts.
Why? Well, largely for the same reason rich

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.980
people fund art and buildings today--for status,
for recognition, and maybe even for the love

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.080
of beauty. But also, funding public art and
cathedrals and the like served to legitimize

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.080
the wealth of these families. The Church could
not very well condemn merchant wealth if it

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.210
was used to build churches, nor could the
governments that came to depend on it. We

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.290
see this again and again throughout history--wealth
supports institutions that in turn legitimize

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.190
that wealth
Regardless, in these artworks, you can see

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.650
the paradoxes of the Renaissance-- paganism
is combined with Christianity, as it often

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.130
had been throughout Christian history. Profit-oriented
bankers financed the Church, which was run

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:27.120
by priests who’d taken a vow of poverty,
and founded by a figure who in the gospels

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.200
overturns the tables of moneylenders in the
temple.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.450
Also, In these city-states, access to a more
humanistic educational approach helped boost

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.690
economic growth and fueled the creation of
much art and architecture that is still really

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.410
influential.
Now, many city states participated in this

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:50.600
humanist revival, but its headquarters was
undoubtedly Florence. Let’s go to the Thought

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.990
Bubble.
1. Artists of the time were following ancient

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.100
styles and taking them further.
2. Visual artists, like Sandro Botticelli

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.100
and Michelangelo,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.320
3. focused on human dignity and realistic
details.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.910
4. Botticelli’s portraits of Florentine
citizens display the distinct features of

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.910
his subjects,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.630
5. while his depictions of religious individuals
show, for example, a plump infant Jesus realistically

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.490
reaching for his mother’s garments.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.449
6. Botticelli’s portrait of the long-dead
Dante similarly displayed his long, thin,

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:20.449
and pointed nose

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.900
7. rather than some idealized, formulaic hero.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.889
8. And Michelangelo’s “David” presents
truly human characteristics

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.310
9. even as it sought to copy ancient sculptural
styles.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.670
10. Across the spectrum of Renaissance art,
anatomical accuracy flourished,

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.250
11. which you can see in Michelangelo’s
sculptures

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.690
12. and also in the work of fellow Florentine
Leonardo da Vinci--

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.080
13. both artists, incidentally, were able
to render the human form in part because they

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.500
both dissected cadavers.
14. And nature, as a setting for humans and

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.740
thus humanism, was also glorified in Renaissance
art,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.980
15. as you can see in the Birth of Venus.
Botticelli’s painting focuses on the mythical

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.639
goddess from the classical world

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:04.410
16. but at the same time she’s about to
be clothed in the flowers found in the natural

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.750
world of the countryside.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.720
17. In short, the artists of the Renaissance
focused on situating a realistically depicted

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720
human body

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.910
18. in both its natural environment and its
civic setting.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:21.229
Thanks, Thought Bubble. But amid this prosperity
and cultural revival, Florentine history was

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:27.830
marked by a succession of economic and natural
shocks, class divisions, corporate rivalries,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:33.130
party struggles, conflicts with the church,
and especially political crises.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:38.729
And those arose from threats of external invasion
as well as internal tyranny and discontent

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:42.279
among the lower classes.
Like Venice, Florence took great pride in

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:48.270
being a Republic, although it was a bit different
from contemporary republics and exceedingly

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.240
unstable.
Like, there weren’t really elections; instead,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.460
names of members of Florence’s guilds would
basically be drawn out of a large leather

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.020
bag, and if your name was drawn, you got to
serve on the Signoria, which ran the city.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.590
And if you weren’t psyched about the job,
no worries--new Signorias were chosen every

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.980
two months, which might make it seem like
lots of people were able to participate in

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.830
civic life, but 1. In order to be a member
of a guild, you needed to be debt-free and

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:21.160
male and well-connected,
and 2. in truth the lotteries were often rigged,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.300
with wealthy families tending to win places
on the signoria.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.730
Also, there were frequent coups and countercoups,
and the Republic would often cease to be republican

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:35.180
and at times become downright Monarchical.
It was all quite Games of Thronesy--one might

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.620
even say that it was a bit Machiavellian.
And no wonder--the political theorist Niccolo

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.720
Machiavelli did live in Florence.
We’ll discuss him more next week, but for

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.310
now, it’s important to know that he saw--and
suffered through--much of this turmoil, including

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:56.930
the rise and fall and rise again of the Medici
family. The Medicis were tremendously powerful

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.260
in Florence, although contrary to what you
might read they weren’t the only important

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.500
family in the Renaissance.
But they did make huge sums in banking and

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.670
investing, and were important patrons to artists--in
fact Michelangelo carved one of their tombs.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.550
Cosimo Medici and his grandson Lorenzo dominated
the second half of the fifteenth century,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.120
in Florence, while successive members of the
family perpetuated its power and patronage

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.340
by serving as popes in the next centuries.
Machiavelli argued that the Florentine Renaissance’s

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:32.270
Golden Age ended with the death of Lorenzo
de Medici in 1492 and the invasion of the

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.450
“barbarians.”
Of course, “Barbarians” mostly means “Not

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.120
Us” throughout history--in fact the word
itself comes from a feeling that the language

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.040
of Barbarians sounded like bar bar bar bar
bar. Anyway, these particular Barbarians were

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.610
French, so I guess it sounded like Bar. I
wasn’t very good at High School French.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:58.400
And so we return at last to the old question:
Were there really broad shifts away from the

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.720
religiofication of all aspects of European
life toward the human and the secular in the

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:10.390
Renaissance? Like, Michelangelo sculpted David,
but he also painted the ceiling of the Sistine

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.050
Chapel.
Perspective matters when you ask these questions--something

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:20.550
important and new was happening in 14th century
Florence (and Venice and Milan and so on)

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.410
among merchants and intellectuals. But the
lives of average people, especially peasants,

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.730
were not much transformed by this humanist
thinking--at least not in the short run.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.610
But in other ways, ordinary people did also
have a Renaissance--ancient authors were translated

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.910
into Italian and French, which allowed those
without access to Latin to read Cicero and

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.899
the like. But of course most Italian peasants
couldn’t read anything.

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:49.350
Historians also debate whether women experienced
a Renaissance. Women were among the patrons

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.269
of the arts: Isabella d’Este sponsored musical
events and loved Petrarch’s poems so much

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:58.530
that she had music composed for them. She
also sponsored painters, maintaining contacts

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.830
with Leonardo da Vinci.
But, Isabella d’Este and her similarly accomplished

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:08.269
sister Beatrice are often seen as the exception.
In general men, according to fifteenth century

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.709
writer Laura Cereta, discounted women’s
intellectual worth.

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:15.930
Deliberately following Petrarch’s path as
he had followed Cicero’s, Cereta wrote a

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.730
famous letter to one misogynist that read
in part: “I cannot tolerate your having

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:26.670
attacked my entire sex. . . . With just cause
I am moved to demonstrate how great a reputation

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:32.540
for learning and virtue women have won by
their inborn excellence, manifested in every

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.180
age as knowledge. . . .”[ii]
Also, the rise of Roman legal thinking meant

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:42.330
the rise of the Pater Familias. The idea that
the father is the center of every family,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.519
and also the center of power.
All of which is to say that the Renaissance

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:51.680
saw tremendously important developments in
the intellectual and cultural life of Italian

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.910
city-states, developments that would soon
be exported to other communities.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:01.840
But we have to be able to shift perspectives--to
the Medicis, the Renaissance was a thing.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.120
To many peasants, it was not. We remember
the Renaissance today partly because it’s

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.740
helpful for historians to periodize history
to frame their analyses, and partly because

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.510
so much Renaissance thinking shapes our thinking.
And I think it’s worth remembering how the

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:23.260
ideas of the Renaissance continue to resonate
for us today. Consider, for example, the feeling

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:29.209
that the current age is so full of corruption
and destruction that we must return to the

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:35.839
purity of some bygone era of greatness. That
Renaissance thinking seems very relevant,

00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:39.279
indeed. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you
next time.
