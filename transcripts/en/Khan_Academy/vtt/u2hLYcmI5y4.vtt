00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.806
Brandon ate 5 slices
of apple-- of pie.

00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:05.180
I'm just assuming
it's apple pie.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.410
They didn't tell me that.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.940
Gabriela ate 3 slices.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.670
If there were
originally 9 slices,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.950
what fraction of
the pie was eaten?

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.750
So let me see if I can
draw this thing out.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.160
So let me draw the pie.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.460
I will draw the pie
in a yellowish color.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.870
So let me try my best.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.620
So let's see how good
I am at drawing a pie.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.200
So I'll just draw it from
the top view as a circle.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.330
And there're 9 slices.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.050
I think it's a
reasonable assumption

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.920
to say that they're
9 equal slices.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.970
So we have 9 equal
slices of pie.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.870
And I'll just make sure they're
initially 9 equal slices.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.350
What fraction of
the pie was eaten?

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.030
So let's first divide
this into 9 sections.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.000
So one way I could do that, I
could divide it into 3 sections

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.980
first, so it looks
like a peace symbol.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.450
It actually looks more
like the Mercedes emblem.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.940
So I'll draw it into
3 sections first.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.670
Then I'll do each of those into
3 sections, and I'll have 9.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.500
So let's see, I'll draw
like that and like that.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.280
Keep in mind, I'm trying to
make these as equal as possible.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.470
So bear with me if they
don't look 100% equal,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.780
but I'm trying.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.660
I am trying my best.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.910
So 9 equal slices-- so that
looks pretty respectable.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.750
So here's our pie that
initially had 9 equal slices.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.460
Now, they tell us that
Brandon ate 5 slices of pie.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.540
So Brandon eats-- he seems
like a hungry young man--

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.850
so he eats 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.981
You could say that he
ate 5/9 of the pie.

00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:49.730
But that's not it.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.280
That's not what they're asking.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.488
It's saying total, not just
how much did Brandon eat,

00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:57.230
but how much was eaten total
between Brandon and Gabriela.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.100
And they tell us
Gabriela ate 3 slices.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.220
So she ate 1-- sounds
like they didn't really

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.030
eat dinner-- 1, 2, 3.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.419
So now let's answer
their question.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.430
What fraction of
the pie was eaten?

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.680
Well, we know that there was a
total of 9 equal slices of pie.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.180
What fraction was eaten?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.095
Well, as we see, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:30.490
8/9 of the pie was eaten.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.100
So let's actually type that in.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.725
And then we will do
it right over here.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.040
We'd say 8, and we use
that little slash symbol

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.290
on your computer like this.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.180
8 over 9 or 8 divided by 9
or 8/9 of the pie was eaten.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.690
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.720
Ishaan ate 2 slices of pizza.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.830
Omar ate 3 slices.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.760
If there were
originally 8 slices,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.800
what fraction of the
pie is remaining?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.880
So this is interesting.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.230
Actually, let me
copy and paste this

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.590
so that I can do it on my
little notepad right over here.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.980
So let's do it right over--
trying to find some space.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.255
There you go.

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:15.070
Let me put that in here.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.240
So the same thing,
we have-- well,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.510
this is a pizza now, not a pie.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.480
And so pizza I
will draw in brown.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.930
It has 8, and we can assume
it's initially 8 equal slices.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.440
So it's actually a little bit
easier to draw 8 equal slices,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.940
since 8 is an even number.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.190
So let's see.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.960
That is my best attempt
at drawing a circle.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.845
And let's see, first I can
divide the pizza into 2 slices,

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:45.040
then I can divide
it into 4 slices.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.920
And I'm going to try to make
them look as equal as possible.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.455
And now I'm going to--
with two more cuts,

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:55.620
I should be able to get 8 so--
and one more just like this.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.610
So there you have it, a pizza
that has 8 equal slices.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.470
Now, they tell us Ishaan
ate 2 slices of pizza.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.580
So he eats 1, 2 slices of pizza.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.830
Omar ate 3 slices.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.310
Omar ate 3.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:21.836
So he eats 1, 2, 1,
2, 3 slices of pizza.

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:23.460
Now, you might
immediately say, oh, OK,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.250
the answer to this
must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.300
It must be that they
ate 5 slices of pizza

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.240
over a total of 8
slices of pizza.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.620
So they ate 5/8 of the pizza.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.510
You would be right in saying
that they ate 5/8 of the pizza,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.450
because they ate 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 out of a total of 8 pieces.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.360
But that's not what
this question is asking.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.370
They are asking, what fraction
of the pizza is remaining?

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.030
So what's left over
after Ishaan and Omar

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.720
had their go at the pizza?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.520
Well, what's remaining
is 1, 2, 3 slices.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.790
So what's remaining is 3 out
of the original 8 equal parts

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.420
or 3/8 of the
pizza is remaining.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.270
So let's input that.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.890
So we could go right here.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.870
And we would say 3 over
8, 3/8, is remaining.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.300
So let's check our answer,
and we got it right.
