00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.530
Welcome to the presentation
on quadratic inequalities.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.450
I know that sounds very
complicated, but hopefully

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.140
you'll see it's actually
not that difficult.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.830
Or at least, maybe the problems
we're going to work on

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.170
aren't that difficult.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.890
Well, let's get started with
some problems and hopefully

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.730
you'll see where this is kind
of slightly different

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.050
than solving regular
quadratic equations.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.730
So let's say I had the
inequality x squared plus

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.480
3x is greater than 10.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.970
And remember, whenever you
solve a quadratic or I guess

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.640
you would call it a second
degree equation-- I guess

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.500
this is an inequality.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.460
I shouldn't use the
word equation.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.680
It's tempting to sometimes do
it the same way you'd do a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.470
linear equation, kind of
getting all the x terms

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.070
on one side and all the
constants on the other.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.950
But it never works because you
actually have an x term and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.570
then you have an
x squared term.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.950
So you actually want to get it
in kind of what I would call

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.750
the-- I don't know if it's
actually called this-- the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.730
standard form where you
actually have all of the terms

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.710
on one side and then a
0 on the other side.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.030
And then you can either
factor it or use the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.910
quadratic equation.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.200
So let's do that.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.410
Well this is pretty easy.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.890
We just have to subtract 10
from both sides and we get x

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:22.040
squared plus 3x minus
10 is greater than 0.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.920
Now let's see if
we can factor it.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.050
Are there two numbers that when
you multiply it become negative

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.190
10 and when you add it
become positive 3?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.840
Well, yeah.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.670
Positive 5 and negative 2.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.510
And once again, at this point I
think you already know how to

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.450
do factoring, so this should
be hopefully, obvious to you.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:53.060
So it's x plus 5 times x
minus 2 is greater than 0.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.840
Now this is the part where it's
going to become a little bit

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.810
more difficult than just your
traditional factoring problem.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.650
We have two numbers, I
guess you could view it.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.670
We have x plus 5.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.850
I view that as one number.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.490
Or I guess we have
two expressions.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.300
We have x plus 5 and
we have x minus 2.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.320
And when we're multiplying
them we're getting

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.020
something greater than 0.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.910
Now let's think about
what happens when you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.460
multiply numbers.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.980
If they're both positive and
you multiply them, then

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.320
you get a positive number.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.710
And if they're both negative
and you multiply them, then you

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.610
also get a positive number.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.590
So we know that either both of
these expressions are the same

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.870
sign, that they're both greater
than 0, they're both positive.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.650
Or we know that they're
both negative.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.240
And I know this might be a
little confusing, but just

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.840
think of it as-- if I told you
that-- I'll do something

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.530
slightly separate out here.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.330
If I told you that a times b is
greater than 0 we know that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.470
either a is greater than 0
and b is greater than 0.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.420
Which just means that
they're both positive.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.230
Or a is less than 0
and b is less than 0.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.700
Which means that
they're both negative.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.200
All we know is that they both
have to be the same sign in

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.400
order for their product
to be greater than 0.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.270
Now we just do the
same thing here.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.140
So we know that either both of
these are positive, so x plus

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:30.890
5 is greater than 0 and x
minus 2 is greater than 0.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.240
Or-- now this is a little
confusing, but if you work

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.190
through these problems it
actually makes a lot of sense.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.750
Or they're both negative.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:50.170
Or x plus 5 is less than 0 and
x minus 2 is less than 0.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.350
I know that's confusing, but
just think of it in terms of we

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.350
have two expressions: they're
either both positive or

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.700
they're either both negative.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.110
Because when you multiple
them you get something

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.450
larger than 0.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.440
Well, let's solve this side.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.880
So this says that x is
greater than negative 5

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.640
and x is greater than 2.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.560
We just 2 both sides
of this equation.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.540
Or, and if we solve this side--
x is less than negative

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.820
5 and x is less than 2.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.520
I just solved both of these
inequalities right here.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.530
Now we can actually simplify
this because here we say that

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.860
x is greater than negative
5 and x is greater than 2.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.600
So in order for x ti be greater
than negative 5 and for x to be

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.450
greater than 2, this just
simplifies as saying, well,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.000
x is just greater than 2.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.870
Because if x is greater
than 2, it's definitely

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.230
greater than negative 5.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.710
So it just simplifies to this.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.370
And we'd say or-- and here we
said x is less than negative

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.530
5 or x is less than 2.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.330
Well, we know if x is less
than negative 5, then x is

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.920
definitely less than 2.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.850
So we could just simplify it to
or x is less than negative 5.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.710
So the solutions to this
problem is x could be greater

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.760
than 2 or x could be
less than negative 5.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.500
And so let's just think
about how that looks

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.510
on the number line.

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:28.080
So if 2 is here, x could
be greater than 2.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.190
So it's all of these numbers.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.585
And if this is negative 5--
I shouldn't have done it

00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:37.250
so close to the bottom.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.610
x is less the negative 5.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.250
So these are the numbers
that satisfy this equation.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.460
And I'll leave it up to you
to try out to see that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.920
they actually work.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.370
Let's try another one
and hopefully, I can

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.520
confuse you even more.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:07.070
Let's say I have minus x
times 2x minus 14 is greater

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.410
than or equal to 24.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.580
Well, the first thing we want
to do is just manipulate this

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.430
so it looks in the
standard form.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:21.980
So we get negative 2x squared
plus 14x-- I'm just

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.050
distributing the minus x-- is
greater than or equal to 24.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.895
I don't like any coefficient it
front of my x squared term,

00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:32.910
so let's divide both sides of
this equation by negative 2.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.220
So we get x squared--
we divided by negative

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.440
2-- minus 7x.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.630
And remember, when you divide
by a negative number you switch

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.130
the sign on the inequality, or
you switch the direction

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.170
of the inequality.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.800
So we're dividing by negative
2, so we switched it.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.245
We went from greater than
or equal to, to less

00:06:50.245 --> 00:06:51.120
than or equal to.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.780
And then 24 divided by
negative 2 is minus 12.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.250
And now we can just bring this
minus 12 onto the left-hand

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.850
side of the equation.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.920
Add 12 to both sides.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:09.560
We get x squared minus 7x plus
12 is less than or equal to 0.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.670
And then we can just factor
that and we get, what is that?

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:21.680
It's x minus 3 times x minus 4
is less than or equal to 0.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.230
So now we know that when we
multiply these two terms

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.150
we get a negative number.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.350
So that means that these
expressions have to be

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.780
of different signs.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.370
Does that make sense?

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.030
If I tell you I have two
number and I multiply them,

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.830
I get a negative number.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.030
You know that they have to
be of different signs.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:45.040
So we know that either x minus
3 is less than or equal to 0

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.380
and x minus 4 is greater
than or equal to 0.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.750
So that's one case.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.780
And the other case is x minus 3
is greater than or equal to 0,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.040
which means x minus
3 is positive.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.690
And x minus 4 is less
than or equal to 0--

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:05.740
oh, I went to the edge.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.900
So let's solve this and
hopefully it'll simplify more.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.040
So this just says that x is
less than or equal to 3.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.340
And this says x is greater
than or equal to 4.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.915
So both of these things have to
be true. x has to be less than

00:08:20.915 --> 00:08:26.030
or equal to 3 and x has to be
greater than or equal to 4.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.350
Well, let me ask
you a question.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:32.390
Can something be both less than
or equal to 3 and greater

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.490
than or equal to 4?

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.110
Well, no.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.520
So we know that this
situation can't happen.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.150
There's no numbers that's
less than or equal to 3 and

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.560
greater than or equal to 4.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.700
So let's look at
this situation.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.580
This says x is greater than
or equal to 3 and x is

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.770
less than or equal to 4.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.460
Can this happen?

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:51.870
Sure.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.930
That just means that x is
some number between 3 and 4.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.380
If we were to draw this on the
number line, we would get--

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.690
if this is 3, this is 4.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.750
And it's greater than or
equal to so we fill it in.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.250
And less than or equal
to so we'd fill it in.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.580
And it would be any number
between 3 and 4 would

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.485
satisfy this equation.

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:14.730
And I'll leave it up
to you to try it out.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.240
I know this is confusing at
first, and this is actually

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.160
something that they normally
don't teach really well, I

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.420
think, in most high schools
until 10th or 11th grade.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.510
But just think about you're
multiplying two expressions.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.630
If the answer is negative
then they must be

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.390
of different signs.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.360
If the answer is positive
they must be the same sign.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.020
And then you just work
through the logic.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.700
And you say, well, no number
can be less than 3 and greater

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.900
than 4, so this doesn't apply.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.490
And then you do this side
and you're like, oh, this

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.410
situation does work.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.580
It's any number
between 3 and 4.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.090
Hopefully that gives you
a sense of how to do

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.110
these type of problems.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.000
I'll let you do the
exercises now.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.540
Have fun.
