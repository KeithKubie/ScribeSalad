00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:06.679
(Clapping) "Five, six, seven, eight."

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.828
(Music)

00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:34.400
Student 1: I am a junior here at Princeton
in the art history department.

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.256
Student 2: I’m a molecular biology major.

00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:38.624
Student 3: I’m a senior
in the anthropology department.

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:40.618
Student 4: I’m studying psychology with certificates
in theater and dance.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.295
Student 5: I’m thinking of majoring
in molecular biology.

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.781
Student 6: I’m interested in chemistry
and neuroscience.

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:47.519
Student 7: I’m studying electrical engineering.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:54.068
Stuart Singer: My name is Stuart Singer. 
I am here at Princeton

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:58.825
re-staging Bill T. Jones and Arnie Zane's
"Continuous Replay."

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:04.094
... Essentially what begins as a very dry,
formal set of still images

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:07.049
becomes a much wilder moving picture.

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:11.848
Student 8: It's an emotional, physical, mental,
full-body commitment.

00:01:12.382 --> 00:01:16.189
Student 1: There's a section of 48 movements
and a section of 22 ...

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:21.021
Student 8: I’m mostly trained in classical ballet
so Stuart will have to remind me

00:01:21.277 --> 00:01:23.805
to relax my pointed feet.

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.503
Student 1: You have to go all out and, like, hiss. 
(Hissing)

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.122
Stuart Singer: We're in a room with some 
very intelligent young minds,

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.052
some very ambitious young minds.

00:01:33.308 --> 00:01:38.129
This challenges them in a way, in that
there's no easy right answer.

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:42.289
The right answer is to be you.

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:49.531
Brian Reeder: I’m Brian Reeder, I'm an 
independent freelance choreographer.

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:54.086
Student 3: We have this idea that ballet is 
a bunch of people dancing around

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.963
in little pink tutus, and it is
very far from that.

00:01:56.518 --> 00:02:01.840
Brian Reeder: You can take this balletic sensibility
and stretch it out, and twerk it, and twist it

00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:03.301
and go in different directions.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.224
I have a couple dancers up en pointe, 
not the entire cast.

00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:10.991
I like to merge the two together: the 
sock dance, the barefoot, and pointe work.

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:17.210
Jimena Paz: My name is Jimena Paz, I'm actually 
teaching a dance that I learned

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:19.791
when I was the students' age.

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.204
I'm thinking of the dancers as 
who they are, and

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:27.886
thinking of their bodies as content
rather than as instruments.

00:02:28.334 --> 00:02:33.049
I asked the dancers to think of 
some words that define them.

00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:35.342
Student 9: Mine was glass bottle.

00:02:37.902 --> 00:02:41.059
Jimena Paz: I call them "anchors," they 
anchor the movement.

00:02:41.357 --> 00:02:44.451
Student 4: Every day the dance changes, 
but it changes on you, in your body.

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:46.648
It's the fact that we're allowed
to make mistakes,

00:02:47.064 --> 00:02:50.594
and sometimes mistakes
end up being in the number!

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:52.941
Jimena Paz: They're tired, but they're wonderful.

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:56.471
I actually thought all of them
were art majors, which they are not.

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.893
Dean Moss: My name is Dean Moss.

00:03:02.893 --> 00:03:06.978
I am putting a piece that's already made
on them, with some caveats.

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:12.046
Student 7: He brought in one of the boards. 
Dean Moss: So the boards look like this.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.136
Student 7: It's quite large, so it takes some
getting used to.

00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:20.657
Student 5: The board keeps slipping out of my hands,
I can't get it to transfer ...

00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:24.369
Student 7: How to hold it, how to move it without it
hitting into yourself,

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:29.520
And then you switch your hands,
I think --- wait ...

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.265
Dean Moss: Working with the Princeton students, 
they're smart, they're enthusiastic,

00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:43.365
they have a kind of brilliance about them.

00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:54.172
Vicky Shick: I’m Vicky Shick 
Eva Karczag: And I’m Eva Karczag
from the Trisha Brown Company,

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:59.061
and we were both in the original cast
of "Set and Reset."

00:04:02.197 --> 00:04:07.028
Vicky Shick: They're not just learning material, but
they're actually learning a process.

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:12.159
Student 10: The movement is definitely not
virtuosic, as you might think of it,

00:04:12.383 --> 00:04:17.268
but it's very specific and requires
so much precision.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:26.131
Loni Landon: My name is Loni Landon and I'm creating
a piece for the Princeton Dance Festival.

00:04:26.622 --> 00:04:32.307
Each week I've given them a different task
with movement, or a phrase of movement I've taught them.

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:36.584
It's really inspiring to me and
motivating, so I want to challenge them

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:39.154
to go further, physically.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.429
Student 2: You'll discover and move in new ways
that you didn't know possible.

00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:47.751
Student 11: It's more about organic movement
and isolating different body parts.

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:52.508
Student 2: So where something is usually really
physical, it kind of became gestural.

00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:10.619
Dancers: That's All!
Stuart Singer: Not bad, not bad.
