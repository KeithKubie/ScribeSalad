00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.540
Let's look at some other fun
use cases for sequence models.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.830
Remember, we've seen that one of the
most entertaining aspects of deep models

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.170
is that you can play Legos with them.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.070
You can mix them and
attach them together, and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.470
then you can use back prop to optimize
the whole thing directly end to end.
