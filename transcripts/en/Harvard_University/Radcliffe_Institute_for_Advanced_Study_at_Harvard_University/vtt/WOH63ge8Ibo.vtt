00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.150
- Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.510
I want to give a
particular shout out

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.230
to people who are
watching us on the web.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.220
We've got quite an audience.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.350
Everything from people who are
local, here in Massachusetts,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.030
to--

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.650
let me let me read
some of them--

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.430
Corpus Christi, Texas,
Norman, Oklahoma.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.430
And we've also got
international viewers in Lima,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.010
in Rio, Geneva, Montreal, Corfu,
Greece, Queretaro, Mexico,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.600
Zagreb, Croatia, and
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.310
So welcome to all of you.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.730
Our next speaker
is Kevin Esvelt,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.550
who's an assistant professor
of the MIT Media Lab, where

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.190
he leads the Sculpting
Evolution Group in exploring

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.280
evolutionary and
ecological engineering.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.740
He helped pioneer the
development of CRISPR,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.840
which you may know as
a powerful new method

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.510
of genome engineering.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.430
In 2013, he was the first
to identify the potential

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.850
for CRISPR gene drive, which
you'll learn about, to alter

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.519
wild populations of organisms.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.290
With island communities
in Nantucket

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.270
and Martha's Vineyard,
they're advancing

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.580
the Mice Against
Ticks Project, which

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.700
aims to prevent tick-borne
disease, such as Lyme.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.550
An outspoken advocate of
freely sharing research

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.340
plans to accelerate
discovery and improve safety,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.440
Dr. Esvelt seeks
to use gene drive

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.160
as a catalyst to reform
the scientific ecosystem.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.985
Please join me in
welcoming Kevin Esvelt.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:36.370
- All right, thank you
so much for the kind

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.990
introduction and the
invitation to speak today.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.430
So how many of you here today
have been bitten by a tick?

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.260
Please raise your hand.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.060
Yeah-- see, I'm
from the west coast,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.770
so I find this horrifying.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.652
I mean, up in
Washington State, you

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.110
wander around in
the forest all day

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.680
and you'll never get
bitten by a tick.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.554
There won't be any
attached to your clothing.

00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:57.777
In fact, I never saw
one, growing up there.

00:01:57.777 --> 00:01:59.860
And so you come out here
and it's just take a walk

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.500
in the woods and they're
crawling and it's-- ugh.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.837
But that is bad
enough, of course.

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:06.670
I mean, and there are
mosquitoes everywhere.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.610
But with ticks, of course,
they can give you disease.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.960
Now mosquitoes can too, but here
in the United States, at least,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.860
tick-borne disease is actually
the number one vector-borne

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.520
disease--

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.290
specifically, it's Lyme disease.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.506
Please raise your
hand if you had Lyme.

00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:23.730
Yeah, quite a few--

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.970
too many.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.790
So tick-borne
disease is a problem

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.112
that we have, to some
extent, brought on ourselves.

00:02:30.112 --> 00:02:31.570
The CDC now estimates
that there is

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.916
upwards of 300,000 cases in
the United States a year.

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:36.790
And when I say we've
brought it on ourselves,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.998
it's because we have engineered
the local environment

00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:42.140
to maximize the incidence
of tick-borne disease.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.460
How have we done that?

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.200
Well, we love forests.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.910
We like trees.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.470
So we plant trees.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.080
And in fact, around here,
it's actually more forested

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.880
than it's been in a long time.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.410
But we also build
roads and houses,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.900
of course, so we can get
around in our lovely forests,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.530
and that means we've maximized
the forest perimeter.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.870
And forest perimeter favors
deer, and white-footed mice.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.270
Now every deer, every
adult deer, has typically,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.130
2,000 to 5,000 ticks
attached to it.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.940
And every adult female tick will
lay a couple of thousand eggs.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.130
So every deer is a million
ticks in the next generation.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.290
So we've maximized
the number of deer.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.510
The only effective predator
these days is the automobile,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.910
and that means we've
maximized the number of ticks.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.240
But even worse, ticks
bite three times,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.120
and usually, it's small
mammals, small mammal--

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.020
deer.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.380
Now of the small mammals,
the white-footed mouse

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.060
is the best reservoir for every
form of tick-borne disease.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.609
That is, tick bites a mouse,
if the tick's infected,

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.400
the mouse pretty much
always gets infected,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.510
if it's a white-footed mouse.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.600
That's not true for the other
things that ticks might bite,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.450
and the same is true when a
infected mouse gets bitten

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.622
by an uninfected tick.

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:07.080
The tick pretty much always
gets infected with the pathogen

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.150
that causes Lyme.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.915
So we have maximized
the number of mice

00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:12.540
and the number of
ticks, and therefore,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.400
the number of infected
ticks, and this is a problem

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.070
that we created.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.760
That's why 100 years
ago, you people really

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.600
hadn't heard of
tick-borne disease.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.440
It's not because it wasn't
there, it was just very rare.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.560
So this is why we
have a problem.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.720
It's not just Lyme
disease, of course--

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.720
Borrelia burgdorferi is
the cause of Lyme disease.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.630
There are other
forms of Borrelia.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.780
There's also Babezia and
Anaplasma and Ehrlichia.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.750
And there's even a couple
of viruses, namely Powassan,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.760
which is truly terrifying.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.400
But they're all passed
between white-footed mice

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.060
and the black-legged ticks.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.180
It's an ecological cycle, back
and forth between the two.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.000
And we would not care,
except for the fact

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.900
that an infected tick can, of
course, bite us and give us

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.420
disease and our pets disease.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.320
Incidentally, our pets have
a vaccine and we don't.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.990
How fair is that?

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.650
It used to be on the
market for humans,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.120
but it was withdrawn at the very
beginning of the vaccine scare.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.300
And now there is no vaccine
for humans for Lyme disease,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.460
and there was never one,
and there is not one

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.390
in development for
any of the others.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.930
And the incidence of all
them, of course, is rising.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.471
And the others are actually more
dangerous than Lyme disease,

00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:26.990
for the most part.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.570
So we have this
simple idea of what

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.130
would happen if we built
a shield around the mice.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.830
What if the mice could
not become infected?

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.950
Well, you would disrupt
this ecological cycle

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.070
of transmission and you'd
have fewer ticks, fewer

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.480
infected ticks and fewer
cases of human disease--

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.370
probably, given the importance
of the mice, a lot fewer.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.430
This is the premise
behind Mice Against Ticks.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.360
We want to enlist
the mice to fight

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.290
ticks and tick-borne disease.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.260
So it says here it's
a community effort

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.510
to prevent tick-borne disease.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.760
And this is based around
a simple question--

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.640
how do you engineer
a wild population

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.080
of white-footed mice?

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.400
There's a lot of
mice in the woods.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.920
How are you going
to immunize them?

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.461
You're going to
catch them one-by-one

00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:26.950
and jab them with a needle?

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.600
This is clearly
not going to fly.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.050
You need something else.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.800
We need to actually
engineer their DNA

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.250
so that they are immune
and can pass that immunity

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.500
onto future generations of
mice, because we don't want

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.940
to release hundreds
of thousands,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.181
or millions of mice in
the woods every season.

00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:46.180
Because they have five
or so generations a year.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.157
The solution is you
look at an island,

00:06:53.157 --> 00:06:55.490
because there's probably a
billion mice on the mainland,

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:02.420
but on say, Martha's Vineyard,
there's maybe 100,000, at most,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.660
in the spring, at
the end of winter.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.690
There is maybe 800,000 at
the beginning of winter.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.670
That's how much it fluctuates.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:20.320
So if you introduced, say,
100,000 mice in the spring,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.190
then you'd be introducing
as many mice as are there.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.884
And if these introduced
mice had resistance genes,

00:07:26.884 --> 00:07:29.050
then they would pass them
down to future generations

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.110
and most future mice
would inherit one.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.500
And because it's an island, you
don't have this constant influx

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.930
and interbreeding of wild mice.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.320
And the same goes for Nantucket.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.300
But of course, if
you're proposing

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.700
to do anything like this,
not only are you proposing

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.510
to genetically engineer a
wild population, which is,

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.690
I understand, a little
bit controversial.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.220
But you really are
doing a different kind

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.590
of research than pretty
much anything else,

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.220
with the arguable
exception of public health,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.760
just because you are changing
the shared environment.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.820
That is, your research is
intended to affect everyone.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.400
So please raise your hand if
you don't have a smartphone.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.660
Yes, there are a few people.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.430
It is possible to live
without a smartphone.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.790
You can opt out of
having a smartphone,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.340
but you cannot opt out
of breathing the air,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.270
or drinking the water,
consuming the fruit of the land.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.730
And this is why people are
sensitive about these things.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.970
Because if you are proposing to
develop a technology intended

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.640
to alter that, it will
necessarily affect everyone,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.740
and they cannot opt out.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.490
And that means if you do this
work behind closed doors,

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.950
as virtually all
science is done,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.290
then you are denying
them a voice in decisions

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.770
that will affect them.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.440
We have fought long and hard
for some form of representation

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.530
in government.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.940
And yet now, because technology
is allowing us to do things

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.220
like this, scientists
are undertaking

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.710
projects that will affect
people as much as legislation

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.239
passed by duly-elected
representatives.

00:09:09.239 --> 00:09:11.530
And they're doing it in
secret, where the people cannot

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.930
possibly have a voice
in those decisions.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.100
So we decided OK, if we're
even going to consider this,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.850
we need to do it differently.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.950
We need to not only
cherry-pick our problems, which

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.534
is one reason why we're
looking at tick-borne disease.

00:09:26.534 --> 00:09:28.700
You want to address something
that people care about

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.802
and it's obviously
an issue to everyone.

00:09:31.802 --> 00:09:33.760
But you want to share
your proposals before you

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.194
do anything in the lab.

00:09:35.194 --> 00:09:36.610
Before you do
anything at all, you

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.750
want to go to the communities
and say, all right,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.910
we think this is a problem.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.440
But you're the
ones who live here.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.870
Do you think it's a problem?

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.080
And here are the different
ways that we think

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.020
we might be able to address it.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.840
Ideally, lay out several
of them, and say,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.430
what do you think of these?

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:59.550
We want to hear from everyone,
including vocal skeptics.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.650
I love vocal skeptics
because they're not

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.269
afraid to stand up and tell
me that is a terrible idea.

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:06.810
And as long as
they're willing to say

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.250
why that's a
terrible idea, that's

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:13.050
fantastic because there's always
a chance, often a good chance,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.930
that they may have thought of
something that none of us has.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.930
And that means that we
have a chance of fixing it

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.250
before we actually do it.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.174
In fact, before we
even develop anything.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:24.840
You don't want the
public comment period

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.210
to be at the end of the
technology development cycle.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.835
You want it at the
very, very beginning

00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:32.460
so you can address
things from the get-go.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.130
So you not only want
to invite concerns,

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.900
you want to invite
community guidance.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.360
And in fact, we decided
to go further than this.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.450
We decided that the communities,
it's their environment.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.080
They need to be in control.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.030
They need to govern the project.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.210
They need to have the power
to say 'no' at any point,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.820
and then we walk away.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.370
That is, we are just
the technical hands.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.660
They are in the driver's seat.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.630
And by the way, we can
be the technical hands,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.940
but we can't be the
technical assessors,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.590
because we're biased, right?

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.680
Who's the last person
you want to test

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.420
a scientific hypothesis?

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.170
It's the person who proposed it.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.400
They're the single most biased
individual in the entire world.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.057
Why do we do science
the way we do, again?

00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:19.265
Oh right, apparently no one
thought that one through.

00:11:19.265 --> 00:11:21.080
But the same is
true of technology.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.472
You don't want me to evaluate
whether this is a good idea,

00:11:24.472 --> 00:11:26.930
looking at the field trial data
and so on, because I cannot

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.770
help but be biased.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:28.610
I am human.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.961
This is how we are built.

00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:32.210
You need independent assessors
to take a look at this.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.420
And so, this is what we're
going to have to have.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.280
The communities are
going to contract

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.100
with an independent group, maybe
the American Academy of Arts

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.910
and Sciences down the road,
maybe the National Academies,

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.550
to, essentially, appoint a
group of independent researchers

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.160
to evaluate this step-by-step
and give the report

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.860
to the communities, who then
will eventually vote on whether

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.410
or not to move forwards.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.570
So how would it work?

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:01.020
Well, if you take mice,
we then immunize them

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.880
against various
things using vaccines,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.060
just by exposing them to ticks--

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.597
bunch of different
ways of doing it.

00:12:07.597 --> 00:12:09.180
And if you do this
to a bunch of mice,

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.670
then you will get
mice, some mice,

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.990
that are resistant to
whatever you expose them to.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.570
Their immune systems
will evolve and produce

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.250
antibodies that can bind, and
are protective against whatever

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.290
we expose them to.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.156
We can then do b-cell sorting--

00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:27.530
there's a few
other methods, too,

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:28.988
but this is the
one we settled on--

00:12:28.988 --> 00:12:32.600
to identify antibody-encoding
genes produced

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.270
by those individual
resistant mice.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.150
We can then make those
antibodies in the lab

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:43.440
and test them, both in the
dish and in the animals,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.080
verify that they actually
are protective against what

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.310
we want, and then
we can encode them.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.570
This is the neat trick.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.660
We can encode those genes
taken from some mice

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.810
into the germline
genome, that is,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.150
the cells that will lead the
sperm and egg production,

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.240
so that those genes
taken from a few mice

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.620
will be passed on to
future generations.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.820
This is not something that our
immune systems normally do.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.587
That is, we get a cold.

00:13:10.587 --> 00:13:12.420
Sadly, our kids are not
immune to every cold

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.410
we've ever gotten.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.380
That would be lovely,
that's not how it works.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.720
But in the lab now, that
we have tools like CRISPR,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.090
we can actually do that.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.450
So we can make mice
that are born secreting

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.712
protective antibodies.

00:13:25.712 --> 00:13:27.420
We're looking at doing
it from the liver,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.295
because the liver secretes
all sorts of stuff

00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:30.220
in your bloodstream.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.320
So they just have
these extra copies

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.028
of antibody-encoding
genes that the liver

00:13:33.028 --> 00:13:36.760
would secrete from birth,
providing resistance.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.190
And then once you
have these mice

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.980
and they look resistant to
whatever we're immunizing them

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.500
against them in the lab,
and that it's heritable,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.830
then you need to test it, and
that involves a field trial

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.190
on a small, probably
mostly uninhabited island,

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.820
off the coast somewhere.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.230
And then you have the assessment
over a couple of years.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.020
Look at everything people think
of that they're afraid might go

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.190
wrong in the ecosystem, and a
few things that they haven't.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.910
And the independent assessor
team delivers a report.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.570
And on the basis of that,
the communities vote--

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.650
good old New England town
hall democracy-style--

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.490
propose a warrant at the
town meeting, and they vote.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.180
And on the Vineyard, of course,
because mice will move all over

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.120
the island, presumably, all
six towns have to vote 'yes.'

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.630
Nantucket will be
just the one vote.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.660
And then that would involve
releasing hundreds of thousands

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.420
of, potentially, of
genetically-engineered mice

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.040
on the Nantucket Vineyard.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.220
I bet none of you ever
thought you might see that.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.580
But there are rules
when you are working

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:48.140
with biology, because
evolution likes complexity.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.114
If you make sure
that things connect

00:14:50.114 --> 00:14:51.530
to lots of other
different things,

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.970
then you're very evolvable.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.580
A lot of potential mutations
can change things and then

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.720
be adaptive, and so that's why
evolution seems to like this.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.111
But it makes it bloody
difficult to engineer,

00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:02.860
because you tweak one
thing and it changes

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.560
a bunch of other things.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.240
And if this is true
within an organism,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.820
within a cell, how much
worse is it in an ecosystem?

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.910
So the general
rule is be humble.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.537
But that's not a
very useful rule.

00:15:14.537 --> 00:15:16.120
We need to be more
specific than that.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.980
So I have-- you should
try to make the smallest

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.230
possible change that can
solve whatever problem you're

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.000
interested in, and
you need to start

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.930
local and small, small-scale.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.020
See if it works, and only
then scale up if warranted.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.320
And so that's-- this is
why we do field trials.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.190
Now what is the
problem in this case?

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.800
What are we going to
immunize the mice against?

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.591
And here is where
there's different options

00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:40.190
and different ways
of going about it.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.290
Option number one
is, say, Lyme disease

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.940
is the most common problem.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.610
We can immunize them
against the Lyme pathogen,

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:52.530
just like the vaccine does, and
they will generate antibodies.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.440
We can then make
those inheritable

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.920
and protect all the mice against
Lyme disease, specifically,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.450
and therefore, us.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.085
That would be minimally--

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.585
that would be a
minimal intervention

00:16:02.585 --> 00:16:04.251
because we don't think
Lyme disease does

00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:07.830
much-- ecologically-speaking it
wouldn't effect anything else.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:12.020
The other option is to immunize
the mice against the ticks.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.430
That is, the tick
has to suppress

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.846
the mouse's immune
system in order

00:16:14.846 --> 00:16:19.800
to remain attached to its
host for several days.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.730
If you immunize the
organism against

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.151
the tick's
immunosuppressive proteins,

00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:28.900
which is sort of its
invisibility shield--

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.380
if you say that the
immune system, hey,

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.880
you might get bitten by a tick,
and if so, they have this neat

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.740
invisibility shield
that they'll construct,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.510
but if you catch it early,
here's what it looks like--

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.080
and then the immune system
attacks and destroys

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.670
that key
immunosuppressive protein.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.640
And then it can see the
tick, and in what can only be

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.760
described as a miracle, this
molecular-level immune response

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.090
can somehow make
the mouse taste bad,

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.450
and so the ticket will fall off,
like it's bitten into some--

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.770
I don't know-- habanero sauce.

00:17:02.347 --> 00:17:04.180
So we asked the communities
what they wanted

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.880
and the pretty much
universal answer--

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.390
there were a bare handful of
people in the couple of percent

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.329
that said one or the other--

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:15.130
but virtually,
everybody said, look,

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.440
if you're going to do
it at all, just do both.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.790
Throw the kitchen sink at 'em.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.400
Because people said the problem
is not just Lyme disease,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.319
it's all of the other diseases.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.300
And option one wouldn't
do anything for those.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.780
But above all else, we are sick
of having so bloody many ticks

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.190
in the woods.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.110
If you can reduce
the number of ticks

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:36.160
back to the way it was 50
years ago, that would be great.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.900
And so they want to do both.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.360
However, there is a caveat--

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.650
no matter how much you
tell people that you know--

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.690
raise your hand if you
ate beef in the last week?

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.130
Please, everyone.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.935
Did you know that the
cow genome is 25% snake?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.570
It's true.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.530
Gene transfer event,
probably tick-mediated,

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.760
about a million or
so years ago, spread

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.600
a virus that included a jumping
gene from snakes that then

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.230
replicated in the
[? oroc ?] genome,

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.050
and it was inherited by cows.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.990
So cows are 25% snake.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.960
Genes move between
species all the time.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.380
Specie is an arbitrary concept.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.510
But that doesn't
matter because people

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.300
are leery of moving
DNA between species.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.240
And it's their environment,
so they're in control.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.090
So they said, don't
use any foreign DNA.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:31.740
Which we can still do, remember,
because that mouse-adaptive

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.440
immune response produces
resisting-antibodies

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.110
in the mice.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.620
So now the project is run
by a steering committee,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.160
one for each island appointed
by the boards of health.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.960
And in the lab, we now
have anti-Lyme antibodies

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.720
from white-footed mice,
and we've immunized

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.570
mice against the tick protein.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.630
And next, we need to verify
that all of these antibodies

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.880
work, and the tests to
develop genome editing,

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.440
because no one's done
that in white-footed mice.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.011
The steering committees,
on behalf of the islands,

00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:03.760
are going to apply for
regulatory approval

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.800
for field trials, which is
going to be a novel approach.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.670
It's not going to
the scientists,

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.530
it's going to be
the communities.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.080
And hopefully, we will
identify suitable small islands

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:12.580
for trials.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.470
There's a bunch of
candidates and people

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.270
are very interested in that.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.540
So to be clear though,
this is many years away.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.010
The earliest possible release
on Nantucket or the Vineyard

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.390
would be 2024.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:28.257
But that doesn't
help most of you.

00:19:28.257 --> 00:19:30.590
Some of you may well live on
Nantucket, in the vineyard.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.131
I don't know.

00:19:31.131 --> 00:19:34.240
But probably most of you don't,
even if you may visit there.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.290
So how do you alter a
population of mainland mice.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.190
There's like a billion
of them, right?

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.856
You're just not going
to rear that many.

00:19:40.856 --> 00:19:43.420
You got to spread those
antibody genes somehow.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.700
And here is where
gene drive comes in.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.920
So CRISPR is a molecular
scalpel that we

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.460
can use to cut and
therefore, edit

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.100
pretty much any gene
in any organism where

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.720
we can get the DNA in.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.970
So you introduce
CRISPR, but you actually

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:03.310
encode the CRISPR system
for doing genome editing

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.410
into the genome
itself, along with,

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.180
in this case, the antibodies.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.900
So then CRISPR cuts the
target, copies itself in.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.030
You now have a resistant mouse.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.370
But you also have
a mouse that knows

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.380
how to make the CRISPR
system, and so it

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.470
will cut the other
chromosome, copy itself over.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.180
So now this mouse
has two copies,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.360
which means that when it
mates, all of its offspring

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.420
are going to inherit.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.300
And in those offspring,
genome editing

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.519
is going to happen again.

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:36.560
It's going to cut the wild
type version inherited

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.440
from the other parent, and
it's going to copy itself over.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.640
Meaning when those mice
mate, the next generation--

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.560
everybody's going to
inherit, and the next

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.780
and the next and the next.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.750
So we pointed out that this
could be done with CRISPR,

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.600
I guess, three years
ago now, publicly.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.384
And it was pretty
obvious that this

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:01.800
could save millions of lives
because tick-borne disease is

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.466
one thing, it's what
we care about here.

00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:06.430
But obviously, we've heard about
much more terrible epidemics,

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.950
and the most obvious
one is malaria.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.950
So in the time that
I've been speaking,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.100
malaria has killed
probably 10 children

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.410
and infected 5,000 people.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.660
So conceivably,
one could use this

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:26.470
to immunize all of the malarial,
the major malaria vectors,

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.220
particularly in Africa.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.150
That raises a lot
of moral issues.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.250
But it's not just malaria.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.820
Schistomiasis also has infected
even more people, possibly

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.300
6,000 to 7,000 people,
and has killed somewhere

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.880
between two and five, probably.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.350
We're not quite sure.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.480
This is true even
though you have

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.130
praziquantel, which is a
perfect cure that costs pennies.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.750
The problem is this
bad even though we

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.375
have a perfect cure
that costs pennies,

00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:58.035
because people just
get re-infected.

00:21:58.035 --> 00:21:59.910
But with the gene drive,
we could potentially

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.390
target and eliminate
[? schistosomes ?]

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.690
responsible directly.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:11.250
But nothing is ever easy.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.320
Again, should we be
doing this in secret?

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.847
This is way worse than
just making resistant mice,

00:22:15.847 --> 00:22:18.180
where you have to release
hundreds of thousands of them.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.490
This is something
where you release a few

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.040
and it effects on an
entire wild population.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.510
Should we be doing
this in secret?

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.160
I mean, we thought, no.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.010
So we pretty much flew in the
face of scientific tradition

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.520
and said, hey, we
we've been working

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.310
with CRISPR for a while, we
know this is going to work.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.690
It's the same mechanism.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.273
Here's how it could
work, and we think

00:22:35.273 --> 00:22:38.650
we should tell people before
we actually try it in the lab.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.740
So that's what we did.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.370
And since then, we have
been pre-registering

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.110
all of our experiments.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.390
That is, we detail what
we're going to do and why,

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.160
and what safeguards
we're using in advance

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.410
so that people have time to
comment before we actually

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.700
do them.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.090
And this approach strikes
people as reasonable.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.850
I have yet to encounter anyone
who says, oh, no, that's

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:00.660
a horrible idea.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.592
You shouldn't do that.

00:23:02.592 --> 00:23:04.800
And the National Academies
had a report on gene drive

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.826
that agreed that the
best course of action

00:23:06.826 --> 00:23:08.700
is to ensure that those
who would be affected

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.680
have an opportunity to
have a voice, of course.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.380
And yet somehow, they
didn't quite draw that--

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.990
you connect the
dots to this means

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.740
that research needs
to be done in the open

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.210
so that people can have a voice.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.370
Because that would be
inconvenient, you see.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.380
That would require researchers
to do something different.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.850
That would require you to
share your brilliant idea

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.220
with everybody else,
and thereby run the risk

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:35.500
that someone else might publish
it first and harm your career.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.220
Never mind, are people likely
to trust us to even develop

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.020
this technology and
potentially use it

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.510
if we're doing it in
secret because we're

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.695
concerned for our careers?

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.840
Color me a little bit skeptical.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.150
And despite the fact
that everybody publicly

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.380
agrees that this is
probably what we should do,

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.424
It's one of those cases where
nobody actually does anything

00:23:57.424 --> 00:23:58.090
to support this.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.280
They just all voice
support and then

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.564
hope that maybe somebody
else will do something.

00:24:03.564 --> 00:24:04.980
And even the
scientists would love

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.500
to live in a different world
where we weren't punished

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.380
for sharing what we're doing,
but systems are hard to change.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.960
So we're trying.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.080
There's four main levers
over scientific practices--

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.789
IP, journals, funders,
and policymakers.

00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:22.080
Problem is, journals, funders,
and policymakers are all

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.130
collective action problems.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.588
Nobody wants to do anything
unless everybody else does too,

00:24:25.588 --> 00:24:26.940
at the same time.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.760
So I'm interested in this
concept of ethical licensing,

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.370
and this will only happen if
the universities are brave,

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.420
specifically, your
local universities.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.630
So if you have ties
to Harvard or MIT,

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.610
guess who has a lot
of patents involving

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.980
CRISPR and CRISPR gene drive?

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.710
So we're talking to them and
to the Broad, for example,

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.060
in Berkeley about--

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.490
can we perhaps use
those to say, we'll

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.490
give anybody who wants
it, a research license

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.520
to use these technologies
to develop gene drive

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.440
systems for free.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.820
But only if you preregister,
only if the work

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.080
is done in the open.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.270
That's the requirement.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.150
That's the idea.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.150
Hopefully, it'll work.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:14.450
But people often ask me,
well, why do you care?

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.850
Now there's a great
webcomic written by a guy

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.750
from Somerville, Randall
Munroe, called xkcd,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.369
and this came out last week.

00:25:21.369 --> 00:25:22.910
And it pretty much
explains very well

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.380
why I, in particular, care.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.710
So this plots different
fields of research by the risk

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.210
that your research will be used
by a super villain for world

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.632
domination, by the risk
of the thing you're

00:25:32.632 --> 00:25:34.340
studying breaking free
from your facility

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.710
and threatening the
local population.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.570
And my laboratory works
in the areas up here,

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.072
so this is why I'm concerned.

00:25:43.072 --> 00:25:45.530
And I think we can all agree
that if genetic engineering is

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:50.750
there on the plot, gene drive is
somewhere up and to the right.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:51.890
So that's what I do.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.090
This is why I'm concerned.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.770
But more generally,
I have to say,

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.800
I think the world would
be a better place if all

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.070
researchers-- if we all held
ourselves morally responsible

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.040
for all the consequences
of our work, all of it--

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.512
intended and unintended.

00:26:06.512 --> 00:26:07.970
And we can't
anticipate everything,

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.760
so we should be
inviting everyone

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.090
to tell us how we might be
wrong, because science doesn't

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.040
work by some magic method.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.680
Science works by setting up
the incentives for other people

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.450
to prove us wrong,
and that should not

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.290
be limited to
professional scientists.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:28.100
The real problems, though,
are invasiveness and trust.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.470
We've done some simulations
led by Chuck Noble.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.740
If you introduce a gene drive
into one population that's

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.340
connected to others, it takes
a very, very low migration rate

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.020
for it to spread.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.230
And this is driven home by if
you simulate the worst gene

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.360
drive system published
to date, if you introduce

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.910
a handful of organisms into
a population a few dozen,

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.730
say, fruit flies, that carry
this worst possible gene

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:55.710
drive described to date, it
takes off in a new population.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:00.380
So first of all, if
this thing gets out--

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:05.690
laboratory accident-- it starts
turning an entire species

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.009
around the world into GMOs.

00:27:09.009 --> 00:27:10.550
You think people
are going to support

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.920
using this against malaria?

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.590
Are Africans really going
to vote in favor of that?

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:20.790
If we accidentally edit
all the fruit flies, say?

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.260
So we tried to prevent this.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.560
Unfortunately, no matter
how much publicity you get,

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.560
there's always some
scientists who don't see it.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.020
And we were very afraid that
someone might independently

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.430
decide hey, wouldn't
it be cool that insert

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.740
CRISPR into the genome
because then we can knock out

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.580
both copies at once.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.288
That'd be a great
laboratory tool, right?

00:27:39.288 --> 00:27:41.720
And not even think
about the possibility

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.310
that it might
spread in the wild.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.935
And sure enough,
exactly that happened,

00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:47.750
into something
horrific, to boot.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.810
But we got together with them
and a bunch of other people

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.840
and agreed on necessary
laboratory safeguards.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.120
And as best we can tell,
there's didn't get out.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.280
So I think we're OK.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.560
But the real problem
is that there also

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.020
means there is no such
thing as a safe field trial.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:08.060
You cannot start local
and scale up if warranted.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:12.870
You cannot know what the effect
is going to be of your actual

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.526
gene drive system of this kind,
because you try it anywhere,

00:28:16.526 --> 00:28:18.900
and the odds are it's going
to spread to every population

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.430
of that species in the world.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.770
And you can talk about
your very isolated island

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.740
hosting only a military
installation all you want.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.360
But Australia was testing a
rabbit hemorrhagic disease

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.849
and it got off of their island
and it spread in Australia.

00:28:32.849 --> 00:28:34.890
And then New Zealand said
no, we don't want that.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.223
You didn't study it well enough.

00:28:36.223 --> 00:28:38.400
And New Zealand farmers
smuggled it in any way

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.470
through the tightest
biosecurity in the world.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.670
Do you think that people
won't move organisms

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.380
around the world?

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.980
Let's look at history.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.730
And of course, that also means
that every nation harboring

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.030
the target species must
agree in advance to do this.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.400
Now there is a great
organization, Target Malaria,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.490
led by Austin Burt,
who first proposed

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.540
using gene drive to combat
malaria, in particular.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.520
And they're doing their best.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.860
They are working with
multiple African countries

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.700
and scientists on the
ground, and trying

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.750
to ensure that Africans can
lead the development and testing

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.380
of non-drive equivalence.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.710
But they need to get
everybody to agree,

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.240
and that's a tough one.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.630
It might be possible
for malaria,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.310
almost certainly not
for schistosomiasis

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.200
unless the malaria goes first.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.750
And for [INAUDIBLE] that
spread dengue and Zika,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.460
and Chikungunya yellow fever--

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.980
forget about it.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.380
More than 100 country's
harboring more than 4 billion

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.590
people live with
those mosquitoes,

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.680
and they would all be
affected, so no way.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.550
So what can you do?

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.800
I'm running out of
time, but we need

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.840
to make a local drive system.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.374
One that does not
spread forever.

00:29:54.374 --> 00:29:56.540
And since the problem is
it has everything it needs,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.010
you need to split up
those drive components

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.610
so that they are limiting.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.300
So the idea is you
separate this into what

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.269
we call a Daisy-chain
drive, because

00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:07.810
these different
components are spread

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.680
across different chromosomes.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.540
And they're related
to each other.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.730
So say C causes B to be copied.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.520
That is, B only drives
in the presence of C,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.330
and A only drives in
the presence of B.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.840
But C is a normal
engineered gene.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.890
It's inherited
normally, which means

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.800
if you have an organism that
has two copies of C and B

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.604
and A of the drive,
and it mates, then

00:30:31.604 --> 00:30:33.270
since there's two
copies of all of them,

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.930
all the offspring inherit.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.475
But some of them
only inherit one--

00:30:36.475 --> 00:30:38.100
but of course, then
we inherit one copy

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.860
and then C doesn't drive.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:46.340
So this organism doesn't have
C. Note that the daisy chain is

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.050
shorter.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:53.280
And when it mates,
some of it's offspring

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.120
no longer have B, which
means in the next generation,

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.020
you actually have
descendants that don't

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.420
inherit the primary change.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.200
So this means that it's local.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.590
Every daisy link in this chain
is like a form of genetic fuel.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:14.340
They will run out over time,
just due to normal inheritance,

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.240
until it stops.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.870
And it's a built-in limit.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.670
There's only so many.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.400
And if you give them more,
it will be more powerful.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.780
It will spread for
longer before it stops.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.130
And that's useful
because we don't

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.560
want to have to release
that many organisms.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.910
That's costly and we
are resource-limited.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.456
So if you have a
90% homing drive,

00:31:36.456 --> 00:31:38.080
which is on the low
end for mosquitoes.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.240
Most mosquito drives
worked better than this.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.000
Then you'd have to release
one edited mosquito say,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.620
per 50 wild ones within your
town, which is not too bad.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.780
If you have 98% copying
efficiency, which

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.930
is on lines with the African
malarial mosquito experiments

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:58.990
today, then, it's one per
500, which is even better.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.230
But what if, say,
Cambridge wanted

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.090
to do this and
Somerville didn't,

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.237
in terms of immunizing
mice now, I'm thinking.

00:32:06.237 --> 00:32:07.320
How do you deal with that?

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.486
How do you teach the mice
not to go across the line?

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.850
Well, the answer is you
teach the genes to vote.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.610
So specifically, you
invoke natural selection

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.610
to favor whichever is in the
majority, either engineered

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:22.420
or wild-type.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.961
And we think we can do this in
the context of the daisy drive

00:32:24.961 --> 00:32:26.630
by introducing
this quorum effect.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.260
So the idea is you release
your daisy drive organisms

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.950
in the center of town.

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.390
It spreads out to affect
the local town population,

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.110
and there it's in the majority.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.200
And so when the daisy
elements run out,

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.080
the quorum effect
causes it to be selected

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.840
for against the wild-type.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.090
But outside of town,
engineered is in the minority

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.760
and so natural selection
acts to eliminate them.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.300
So then selection will
actually reinforce

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.379
our arbitrary invisible
political boundaries,

00:32:55.379 --> 00:32:56.920
because they'll
actually be reflected

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.440
in the genetic frequency.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.570
This is super theoretical.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.724
It looks good in the models.

00:33:03.724 --> 00:33:05.890
It looks pretty good in
some of the very preliminary

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.060
experiments.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.980
But it's very theoretical.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.550
But this is our best
attempt at getting

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.310
this technology in a form
where it might actually

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:19.870
be useful without having to get
everybody to agree in advance.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:23.714
And this is why I
think it's important

00:33:23.714 --> 00:33:25.630
that we have projects
like Mice Against Ticks,

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:29.880
because the other problem is
that public perception issue.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.232
On Nantucket and the Vineyard,
a lot of people have PhDs.

00:33:34.232 --> 00:33:36.690
More importantly, that just
means that pretty much everyone

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.260
knows someone who they trust who
has enough technical expertise

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.030
to assess what we're doing.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.975
It's much harder
working with people

00:33:43.975 --> 00:33:45.600
who don't speak your
language and don't

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.890
have that kind of background.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.620
And especially when
you have a legacy

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.150
of things like colonialism--

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:57.140
overcoming that is difficult.
So if the people who

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.500
have the education and the
power and the privilege

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.780
are willing to use it and
publicly support it and go

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:10.270
first, then that, I think,
is a more viable path

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:15.139
forwards than going to
where, frankly, it's

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:19.250
needed most in terms of sheer
human lives and suffering.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:22.639
So finally, thank you so
much for the invitation,

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.340
for the organizers, and
especially to my group

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.409
because I'm at
the MIT Media Lab.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.750
We're rewarded for being
controversial and provocative

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.020
and all that jazz.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.370
So I can come up here and bash
the current way science is done

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.092
and call for change, and
that gets me bonus points.

00:34:37.092 --> 00:34:39.050
It doesn't matter how
many scientists I offend.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.920
My tenure committee
will love that.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.530
But my students really
are putting their careers

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.770
on the line by sharing
their best ideas in the open

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.860
and risking getting
scooped and having they're

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.060
promising careers destroyed.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.040
So they are the
real heroes, here.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.517
And so please give them
a round of applause.

00:34:58.517 --> 00:35:00.008
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:08.947 --> 00:35:10.280
So thank you for your attention.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.530
I'd be happy to take questions.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:13.640
- Great, thank you.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.560
Wow.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.090
My head is spinning.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.650
This is such brave work.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:19.600
Thank you very much.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.400
So we are going
to take questions.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.560
If you can line up at the
mic, what I think we will do

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.510
is take a couple of questions,
maybe two or three in a row,

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:34.330
and let Kevin sort
of put them together.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.970
And we've got about
I think still--

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.740
looks like about 12
minutes for questions.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.972
So I'm sure we're full of them.

00:35:41.972 --> 00:35:43.940
Great.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.405
- Hi, my name is Ned Bacon.

00:35:45.405 --> 00:35:47.080
I really enjoyed the talk.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.750
Can you just make a few
brief remarks on progress

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.420
on specificity and
off-target edits with CRISPR?

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.560
Thank you.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.970
- My name is Marci Wells.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.636
And the first thing
that came to my mind

00:36:01.636 --> 00:36:04.450
is why can't you give
the ticks birth control?

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.080
- Hi, my name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.640
And being in
Massachusetts, we're

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.470
at the home of
compulsory immunisations,

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.820
founded in 1905 in Jacobsen
versus Massachusetts.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.040
I'm just wondering, with
your nuanced approach

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.520
to getting community buy-in, if
we were able to go back in time

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.110
and change the way
that we approached

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.810
immunizations, and done it in a
similar approach to what you're

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.750
doing, do you think we'd have a
higher or a lower immunization

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.136
rate today?

00:36:32.136 --> 00:36:33.495
- [EXHALES]

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.780
- My name's Ethel Jackson and
I wonder if you could just give

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.650
us a quick update on where
things stand with the release

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:47.300
of gene drive-edited mosquitoes?

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.650
I know there's been a lot
of effort along those lines,

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.350
and I'd just like to
know where that stands,

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.720
in terms of
environmental release?

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.421
- OK, so initially,
off-target effects on CRISPR--

00:37:01.421 --> 00:37:03.920
So CRISPR is, of course, being
looked at for a lot all sorts

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.310
of things.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:05.780
Its biggest impact
is on research,

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.446
just because it makes
everything that we

00:37:07.446 --> 00:37:09.035
do in the lab so much easier.

00:37:09.035 --> 00:37:10.910
But it's also being
looked at therapeutically

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:11.990
for gene therapy and the like.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.198
And one obvious concern is
you want to program CRISPR

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:16.280
to cut a particular
gene and no other genes,

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.194
because if you accidentally cut
a tumor suppressor, that's bad.

00:37:19.194 --> 00:37:21.110
If you're doing gene
therapy on a lot of cells

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.180
in a lot of patients,
you need to be sure

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.134
that you're very, very accurate.

00:37:25.134 --> 00:37:26.550
So there's been a
lot of research,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.420
particularly in the
Boston area, by groups

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.090
working to make CRISPR
even more specific.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:36.790
And the best versions now are--

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.830
the off-target rate is
pretty close to undetectable.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.520
And that's great,
but just because you

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.664
can't detect it doesn't
mean it doesn't exist.

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:48.330
And so if you were
to roll out something

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.330
to, say, 50 million
people and you're

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:55.060
altering a billion
cells per person, which

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.740
is a tiny fraction of the
cells in an individual's body,

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.350
we can't test that many.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:04.730
So that's why CRISPR will be
great for medical problems

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:09.140
where you're willing to take a
tiny risk of cancer in exchange

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.570
for solving an actual problem.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.690
But it's not going to be useful
for but what one might call

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:18.370
a 'recreational' gene therapy.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:23.980
Tick birth control-- the
preferred form of birth control

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.640
is kill them.

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.280
So we have lots of-- we
have lots of chemicals

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.330
we use to kill ticks.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.510
And they're are concentrated,
of course, on deer.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.870
So there are these four poster
devices where you feed the deer

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:42.300
and it basically rubs
pesticides on the deer

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.010
to kill the ticks on them.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.600
There are also these
tubes where you

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.850
have Permethrin-treated
cotton balls in the tubes.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.840
You leave them out.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.519
The local mice grab them and
use them for nesting material,

00:38:51.519 --> 00:38:53.310
and then burrow into
them in the Permethrin

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.837
kills all the ticks on them.

00:38:54.837 --> 00:38:57.420
I'm not aware of anyone working
on actual tick contraceptives,

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.720
however every couple of
months, I get an email

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.940
from someone in
the world, usually

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.250
from somewhere in the
United States, who says,

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.040
why are you mucking
around with mice?

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.590
Just use a suppression
gene drive.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.570
Standard version affects
the entire species

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.237
to eliminate all the ticks.

00:39:16.237 --> 00:39:18.570
Which you might say, well,
how can a gene drive do that?

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.278
Well, there's a couple
of different ways.

00:39:20.278 --> 00:39:22.114
The obvious one is
suppose the gene

00:39:22.114 --> 00:39:24.030
you're transmitting turns
them all into males?

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.615
So I'm skeptical
that you can actually

00:39:28.615 --> 00:39:30.240
go all the way to
extinction, certainly

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.620
not with a single
drive system, due

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.270
to likelihood of
resistance, et cetera.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:36.060
But one could conceivably
do that except that the tick

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.346
generation time is two years.

00:39:37.346 --> 00:39:38.970
So if you're willing
to wait a century,

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.136
we might be able to do that.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.260
Let's see, next question was
vaccines and immunization

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.730
history.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.890
And if we have--

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.590
I don't really know on that one.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.652
I know that genetic
engineering in general,

00:39:56.652 --> 00:39:58.610
had we started with
something that was actually

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.600
a problem that's obvious to
ordinary people as opposed to--

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.420
or even played up that
recombinant insulin

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.860
is recombinant.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:12.420
Everyone, raise your hand
if you take insulin--

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:12.920
anyone?

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.860
So that insulin, of course,
comes from engineered microbes.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.940
It's recombinant DNA.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.100
It's genetic engineering.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.510
It's GMO.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:26.460
But most people don't
think of it that way.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.350
We think about
genetic engineering

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.810
in the context of Monsanto.

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.550
And what do you
all those products

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.870
do for the people who
buy them in the market?

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.870
a couple of cents cheaper?

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.620
That's just not enough.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.480
So that one I know
would be different.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.590
But vaccines, that
was a long time ago

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.570
and it's hard to argue
with government control.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.350
And so I really don't know
the answer to that one.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:55.580
I think that the more we
invite people's voices,

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.170
the better off we will be
because things will be safer

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.070
and, I think, more acceptable to
people, if people have a voice.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.860
But beyond that, I
couldn't really say.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.410
And as for mosquito
gene drive systems,

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:09.570
there are a number of
laboratories working on them.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.450
There may be some
that I don't know of.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.750
The current status is that
the things that you see

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:19.100
that are published are not--

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:23.770
most of the latest advances
have not been published.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:26.410
And most of the work,
in fact, everything

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.280
other than our
collaborators and my lab--

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.170
collaborators
particularly at Harvard

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:35.020
and Flaminia Catteruccia
and George Church's group

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.350
in particular.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.920
And we're working with Paul
Brindley at George Washington

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:44.260
University on schistosomiasis
and with Pirbright University,

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:50.790
Luke Alphey in the UK, and
University of Otago [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.350
in New Zealand on rats.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.460
Those are the only projects
that are completely open.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.200
There's a bunch
of mosquito ones.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.930
Target Malaria has results
showing that-- where

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:04.220
they have solved the problem
of the drive system acting

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.840
after fertilization.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.141
And this is important if you're
doing the suppression drive

00:42:10.141 --> 00:42:12.390
that they're looking for to
reduce the population just

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.780
because you need to ensure
that your offspring inherit

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.300
one functional copy of a gene.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.930
That's important for fertility.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.530
So if you cut that copy
just after fertilization,

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:23.710
it doesn't work.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:24.905
And that's been the huge--

00:42:24.905 --> 00:42:27.030
it also reduces the efficiency
of the drive system,

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.580
so that's been the
number one hurdle.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.250
That one seems to have been
solved in the main malaria

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.910
vector species and [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:39.270
Other problems include to
make it evolutionarily stable,

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:42.450
you have to program CRISPR
to cut many, many sites.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.970
That problem is still
being worked out.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.080
It's one that we're working on.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.380
Once you solve that and
put those two together,

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:54.810
they have enough target
genes that it should work.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:55.870
What I don't know--

00:42:55.870 --> 00:43:01.810
so I think the social side of
'will every African country be

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:02.850
able to agree?'

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:04.434
is going to be the
limiting factor.

00:43:04.434 --> 00:43:06.850
There are people working on
that form of gene drive system

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.380
and Aedes aegypti.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.360
I think it's a terrible idea.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.194
But, yeah, there's nothing I
can do about that beyond urge

00:43:14.194 --> 00:43:16.610
them to be a little bit more
open than what they currently

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:17.480
are.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.720
And see if we can maybe get
the universities around here

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.180
to agree to a patent pool
for ethical licensing

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.389
to ensure that that work
and all other work is open.

00:43:25.389 --> 00:43:26.796
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:31.017 --> 00:43:33.930
- Kevin, thank you very much.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.330
Will you join me in thanking
Kevin for this [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.480
[APPLAUSE]
