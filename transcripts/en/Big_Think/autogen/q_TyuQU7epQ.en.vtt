getting conscious and so on what do I

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
getting conscious and so on what do I

think

I think consciousness is both irrelevant

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
I think consciousness is both irrelevant
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.979
I think consciousness is both irrelevant
and incredibly important let me explain

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

heat-seeking missile it's completely
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.369
heat-seeking missile it's completely
irrelevant to you whether this

irrelevant to you whether this
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560
irrelevant to you whether this
heat-seeking missile is conscious

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
heat-seeking missile is conscious
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.000
heat-seeking missile is conscious
whether it's having a subjective

whether it's having a subjective
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.590

because all you care about is what the

because all you care about is what the
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.760
because all you care about is what the
heat-seeking missile does not how it

heat-seeking missile does not how it
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.700
heat-seeking missile does not how it
feels and that shows that it's a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
feels and that shows that it's a
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.010
feels and that shows that it's a
complete red herring to think that

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020
complete red herring to think that
 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.100
complete red herring to think that
you're safe from future AI if it's not

on the other hand there is a way in

on the other hand there is a way in
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.350
on the other hand there is a way in
which consciousness is incredibly

which consciousness is incredibly
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.249
which consciousness is incredibly
important I feel and there's also a way

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
important I feel and there's also a way
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.080

they're gonna move exactly in this shape
of a parabola and you give you all the

why the Apple was red and hazelnut was

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
why the Apple was red and hazelnut was
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.679
why the Apple was red and hazelnut was
brown or why the Apple was soft and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
brown or why the Apple was soft and

that seemed him beyond science and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
that seemed him beyond science and
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260
that seemed him beyond science and
science back 40 years ago could only

really say sensible things about this

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070

with motion then came the Maxwell

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
with motion then came the Maxwell
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.950
with motion then came the Maxwell
equations and told us all about light

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
equations and told us all about light
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.859
equations and told us all about light
and colors and that became within the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
and colors and that became within the
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.810
and colors and that became within the
realm of science then we got quantum

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
realm of science then we got quantum
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.289
realm of science then we got quantum
mechanics that told us why the Apple is

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299
mechanics that told us why the Apple is
 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.270
mechanics that told us why the Apple is
softer than the hazelnut and all other

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
softer than the hazelnut and all other
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.140
softer than the hazelnut and all other
properties of matter and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150
properties of matter and
 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.850
properties of matter and
science is gradually conquered more and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
science is gradually conquered more and
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.440
science is gradually conquered more and
more of the natural phenomenon if you

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
more of the natural phenomenon if you
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.600
more of the natural phenomenon if you
asking now what science can do it's

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
asking now what science can do it's
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.690
asking now what science can do it's
actually a lot faster to describe what

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
actually a lot faster to describe what
 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.370
actually a lot faster to describe what
little it is that science cannot talk

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
little it is that science cannot talk
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.320
little it is that science cannot talk
about sensibly and I think the final

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
about sensibly and I think the final
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.900
about sensibly and I think the final
frontier actually is consciousness

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910
frontier actually is consciousness
 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.950
frontier actually is consciousness
people mean a lot of different things by

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960
people mean a lot of different things by
 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.590
people mean a lot of different things by
that word I simply mean subjective

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600
that word I simply mean subjective
 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.750
that word I simply mean subjective
experience experience of colors sounds

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760

emotions and so on but it feels like

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
emotions and so on but it feels like
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.010
emotions and so on but it feels like
something to be me which is quite

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
something to be me which is quite
 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.750
something to be me which is quite
separate from my behavior which I could

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
separate from my behavior which I could
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.340
separate from my behavior which I could
have even if I were a zombie and didn't

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
have even if I were a zombie and didn't
 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.860
have even if I were a zombie and didn't
experience anything at all potentially

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
experience anything at all potentially
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.200
experience anything at all potentially
so why should you care about that I care

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210
so why should you care about that I care
 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.250
so why should you care about that I care
about it first of all because

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260
about it first of all because
 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.410
about it first of all because
fundamentally that's the basic thing

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
fundamentally that's the basic thing
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.300
fundamentally that's the basic thing
they know about the world my experiences

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310
they know about the world my experiences
 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.860
they know about the world my experiences
and I would love to understand

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
and I would love to understand
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.530
and I would love to understand
scientifically why that is and not just

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
scientifically why that is and not just
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.850
scientifically why that is and not just
leave it to philosophers and second it's

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860
leave it to philosophers and second it's
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.240
leave it to philosophers and second it's
incredibly important also in terms of

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
incredibly important also in terms of
 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.820
incredibly important also in terms of
purpose and meaning in the laws of

there's no equation for it and I feel

there's no equation for it and I feel
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.750
there's no equation for it and I feel
that we shouldn't look for our universe

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
that we shouldn't look for our universe
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.510
that we shouldn't look for our universe
to give meaning to us because it's us

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520
to give meaning to us because it's us
 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.370
to give meaning to us because it's us
who give meaning to our universe because

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380
who give meaning to our universe because
 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.140
who give meaning to our universe because
we are conscious and experiencing things

we are conscious and experiencing things
 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.930
we are conscious and experiencing things
right our universe didn't used to be

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
right our universe didn't used to be
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.310
right our universe didn't used to be
conscious that used to be just a bunch

these incredibly complicated patterns
got arranged into our brains we woke up

we have galaxies out there they're
incredibly beautiful why are they

incredibly beautiful why are they
beautiful because we are consciously
