my work is just a byproduct of of some
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.100
my work is just a byproduct of of some
rigorous development of work that

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110
rigorous development of work that
 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.510
rigorous development of work that
responds to the world that we're in and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
responds to the world that we're in and
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.110

I feel like the more honest and earnest
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.189
I feel like the more honest and earnest
and that that work is the more innately

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
and that that work is the more innately
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.080
and that that work is the more innately
beautiful it will be without me having

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
beautiful it will be without me having
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910

and I think um hopefully a byproduct
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300
and I think um hopefully a byproduct
