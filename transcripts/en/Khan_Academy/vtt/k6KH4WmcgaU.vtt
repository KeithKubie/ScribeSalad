00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.781
- [Voiceover] In the last video
we looked at this RC circuit

00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:06.510
and we gave it a step
input with a step source,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.576
a step from V nought up to V S,

00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:12.214
with a sharp change right
here at T equals zero.

00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:14.188
And we sort of took an intuitive guess

00:00:14.188 --> 00:00:17.118
at what this voltage looks like here.

00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:18.368
That's V and T.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:20.563
And in this video we're going to develop

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:22.503
a precise expression for what happens here

00:00:22.503 --> 00:00:25.184
to this voltage across the capacitor.

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:27.750
And as we said, this is a
very very common circuit,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.036
there's millions and millions
of these types of circuits

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:32.908
inside every computer, so it really pays

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:35.729
to understand this one quite well.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.721
Because this is a function of time,

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:39.385
because we have a function of time here,

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:42.021
this is going to end up
needing some techniques

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.325
from calculus to really
figure out properly.

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:47.239
So this is going to be a place

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.060
where our calculus skills
are really necessary.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.352
And I'm also going to
assume that you've listened

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:56.042
to the video on RC natural response

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:57.619
where we worked out the expression

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.944
for the natural response when
there was no voltage here,

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:03.252
where this was zero.

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:05.702
The natural response looks like

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:06.869
V equals V not

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:10.785
E to the minus T over RC.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.854
And there's a video on Khan
Academy about natural response

00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:19.022
and there's also an
article you can read too.

00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:21.678
So let's get back here,
let's analyze this fourmulae.

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:24.175
And one of the things we can do is, well,

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:28.418
first thing we always do is
we always label the quantities

00:01:28.418 --> 00:01:31.436
that we want in here, and
I'll put, there's the current,

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:34.603
and here we'll call this voltage of R,

00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:39.606
and if I've used a
lowercase letter V or I,

00:01:39.606 --> 00:01:41.971
that means that quantity
is changing with time

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:45.242
and if I use a big, a
capital letter V here,

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:47.934
that means that those values
don't change with time.

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:49.851
So that's why notation.

00:01:50.742 --> 00:01:53.144
And when we analyze the
circuit, a good thing to do

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:56.298
is just to look at what
are the compound equations

00:01:56.298 --> 00:01:57.449
for this thing.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:00.431
So let's talk about Ohm's
Law for this resistor here.

00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:01.764
We know that V R

00:02:03.225 --> 00:02:04.558
equals I times R

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:08.611
Or another way that we can write that is

00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:09.444
I equals

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:11.796
V R over R

00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:16.447
So the other expression that I could write

00:02:16.447 --> 00:02:18.808
for the capacitor is the
capacitor of I equation

00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:20.233
which is I

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:21.400
equals C DV DT

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:27.877
and this means the slope of the voltage

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:30.016
or the rate of change of the voltage

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.821
times C is equal to the current.

00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:34.848
Alright, so far so good.

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:36.004
I have one I.

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.022
There's actually only
one I in this circuit.

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:42.052
So this I here is equal to this one here,

00:02:42.052 --> 00:02:45.126
that's a good relationship for us to know.

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:46.980
Oh and we also have two
different V variables,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.658
we have regular V that's
across the capacitor

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:51.543
and we have V sub R.

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:53.545
So let me see if I can write V sub R

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:54.712
in terms of V.

00:02:55.927 --> 00:02:58.015
And one thing I can
tell from this circuit,

00:02:58.015 --> 00:02:59.848
this point right here,

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:02.237
this is V S.

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:05.213
This point right here

00:03:05.213 --> 00:03:06.213
this is V C.

00:03:07.457 --> 00:03:08.957
So I can write V R

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:11.774
equals V S

00:03:14.362 --> 00:03:15.195
minus V C.

00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:20.051
Alright, that's going
to be useful. Alright.

00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:21.439
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.661
to set these two I's equal to each other

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.308
and at the same time I'll

00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:28.620
plug in this expression V S minus V C

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.599
for V R up here. It will go in right here.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.849
So we can write

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.406
C DV DT equals

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:44.251
one over R times V R

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.900
V R is V S minus V C.

00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:55.092
I shouldn't write V C, I'll just write V.

00:03:56.852 --> 00:03:57.813
I'll take that out there

00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:01.226
because we don't need that subscript.

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:05.226
And multiply through by
one over R et on, we get

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:07.866
C DV DT

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:11.836
equals one over R V S

00:04:15.418 --> 00:04:16.918
minus one over R V

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.165
and we'll get

00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:22.998
C DV DT

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:28.454
minus one over R

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:31.199
times V

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:33.137
equals V S

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.111
Alright so now we have, this
is our differential equation.

00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:43.304
It's a differential equation

00:04:43.304 --> 00:04:44.940
because it has derivatives in it.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.009
In particular this is called

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.426
a non-homogeneous

00:04:56.383 --> 00:04:59.465
ordinary differential equation.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.277
It's ordinary because
there's a first derivative,

00:05:02.277 --> 00:05:04.927
the first derivative
has a power of one here,

00:05:04.927 --> 00:05:06.309
that's the ordinary.

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.979
It's a differential equation
because it has a derivative

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.999
and it's called non-homogeneous

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:14.499
because this side over here, this is not V

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.368
or a derivative of V.

00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:19.702
So this equation is sort of mixed up,

00:05:19.702 --> 00:05:21.452
it's non-homogeneous.

00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:24.938
When we did the natural response analysis,

00:05:24.938 --> 00:05:27.293
this term right here was zero

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:31.460
in that equation, so we were
able to solve this rapidly.

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.750
So we're going to develop
a new strategy here

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.338
for solving this kind of equation

00:05:36.338 --> 00:05:39.336
this kind of non-homogeneous ODE.

00:05:39.336 --> 00:05:41.033
So this equation is a little tricky

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:43.956
to solve because this
is not zero over here.

00:05:43.956 --> 00:05:45.894
We have a mixture of things going on here.

00:05:45.894 --> 00:05:47.508
This side of the equation represents

00:05:47.508 --> 00:05:48.679
the forcing function.

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:51.610
This is what the circuit
is being driven to

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.679
by that step response
input voltage source.

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:57.020
And this side here we're
going to get tied up

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.739
with the initial conditions

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:00.335
that that capacitor has,

00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:02.457
so there's sort of two
things going on here,

00:06:02.457 --> 00:06:04.135
that make this a little more complicated

00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:05.559
than usual to solve.

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:09.726
And so what our strategy is,
we take on a strategy here.

00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:16.749
We break the problem down into two pieces.

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:17.990
This is always what engineers do

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.047
when they're faced with something

00:06:19.047 --> 00:06:20.949
that is a little
complicated, is you try to

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:22.794
break it into bits and pieces.

00:06:22.794 --> 00:06:25.061
So what we're going to
do is, our strategy is

00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:29.061
to figure out what we
call the natural response.

00:06:34.158 --> 00:06:36.309
And we're going to figure
out something called

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:37.976
the forced response.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.508
And then we're going to add those together

00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:46.218
with a plus sign, and that's going

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:49.341
to be equal to what we
call the total response.

00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:52.674
So this is what the circuit really does.

00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:56.353
Alright so we got two new words here.

00:06:56.353 --> 00:06:58.753
One is the forced response,
and one's the total response.

00:06:58.753 --> 00:07:02.282
And if we remember before,
the natural response

00:07:02.282 --> 00:07:05.079
was what the circuit did
when nothing was forcing it.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:07.483
We just put in some initial
energy, some charge,

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:09.014
and let the circuit sort of sag

00:07:09.014 --> 00:07:10.873
toward wherever it was going.

00:07:10.873 --> 00:07:12.653
That's the natural response.

00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:14.695
The forced response is going to be

00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:17.982
what the input source
forces the circuit to do.

00:07:17.982 --> 00:07:20.200
And when we take those two
things and add them together

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.853
we'll get what the circuit
is going to do altogether.

00:07:22.853 --> 00:07:27.020
And this is another good
application of super position.

00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:36.367
We're going to take two
things that the circuit does

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:38.192
and analyze them separately

00:07:38.192 --> 00:07:40.645
and then add them
together, superimpose them,

00:07:40.645 --> 00:07:42.812
to get the total response.

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:45.892
So they way we do this, the strategy is

00:07:45.892 --> 00:07:47.975
for the natural response,

00:07:49.707 --> 00:07:53.340
basically we take for
the initial conditions,

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.801
that's the charge on the capacitor,

00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:56.796
we'll take whatever we get.

00:07:56.796 --> 00:08:00.963
We'll take the initial Q
and the initial V W, V not.

00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:05.940
And when we look at the inputs,

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:10.226
we'll set the inputs to zero.

00:08:10.226 --> 00:08:12.097
So that's how we analyze,
that's the conditions

00:08:12.097 --> 00:08:13.934
for the natural response.

00:08:13.934 --> 00:08:16.926
And when we take the forced response

00:08:16.926 --> 00:08:18.093
we do the opposite, what we do is

00:08:18.093 --> 00:08:20.146
we set the initial conditions to zero,

00:08:20.146 --> 00:08:21.890
simplify the circuit down

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.039
and we use the inputs that
are actually applying.

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:27.084
In this case, it was V of S.

00:08:27.084 --> 00:08:29.938
And then you get the total response,

00:08:29.938 --> 00:08:32.291
we add those together, with a plus sign.

00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:34.874
So then for the total response,

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:41.785
you get the initial conditions,
which is Q and V not,

00:08:42.749 --> 00:08:46.057
and you get V S, all together.

00:08:46.057 --> 00:08:47.503
So that's our strategy.

00:08:47.503 --> 00:08:50.185
And by turning it into
two simpler problems,

00:08:50.185 --> 00:08:52.723
basically we make this
differential equation

00:08:52.723 --> 00:08:54.942
a little bit simpler to solve two times

00:08:54.942 --> 00:08:58.634
than trying to solve it
all together at once.

00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:01.193
We'll stop here now and in the next video,

00:09:01.193 --> 00:09:02.826
we'll follow through on the strategy

00:09:02.826 --> 00:09:06.993
of combining the forced response
with the natural response.
