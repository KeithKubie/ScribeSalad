if you look at our current technological

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100
if you look at our current technological
 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.980
if you look at our current technological
systems they're obviously nowhere near

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990
systems they're obviously nowhere near
 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.240
systems they're obviously nowhere near
where our minds are they're very

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250
where our minds are they're very
 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.100
where our minds are they're very
different and one of the biggest

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110
different and one of the biggest
 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.480
different and one of the biggest
questions for me is what's the

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490
questions for me is what's the
 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.249
questions for me is what's the
difference between where we are now and

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259
difference between where we are now and
 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.660
difference between where we are now and
where we need to be if you want to build

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670
where we need to be if you want to build
 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.370
where we need to be if you want to build
mines if you want to build systems that

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380
mines if you want to build systems that
 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.200
mines if you want to build systems that
are generally intelligent and

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210
are generally intelligent and
 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.830
are generally intelligent and
self-motivated and maybe self-aware and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840
self-motivated and maybe self-aware and
 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.210
self-motivated and maybe self-aware and
of course the answer to this we don't

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220
of course the answer to this we don't
 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.950
of course the answer to this we don't
know because if he knew we already done

it but there are basically several

it but there are basically several
 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.250
it but there are basically several
perspectives on this one is our minds as

perspectives on this one is our minds as
 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.590
perspectives on this one is our minds as
general learning systems that are able

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600
general learning systems that are able
 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.509
general learning systems that are able
to model arbitrary things including

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519
to model arbitrary things including
 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.669
to model arbitrary things including
themselves and if they are this they

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679
themselves and if they are this they
 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.529
themselves and if they are this they
probably need a very distinct set of

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539
probably need a very distinct set of
 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.790

motivations needs things that they want

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800
motivations needs things that they want
 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.770
motivations needs things that they want
to do and I think that humans get their

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780
to do and I think that humans get their
 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.660
to do and I think that humans get their
specifics due to their particular needs

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670
specifics due to their particular needs
 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.459
specifics due to their particular needs
we have cognitive and social and

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469
we have cognitive and social and
 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.649
we have cognitive and social and
physiological needs and they turn as an

who we are our motivations determine
what where we put our attention to and

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620
what where we put our attention to and
 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.500
what where we put our attention to and
what we learn and what we actually do in

what we learn and what we actually do in
 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.809
what we learn and what we actually do in
the world what we model how about we

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819
the world what we model how about we
 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:03.579
the world what we model how about we
perceive what are you conscious of and

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589
perceive what are you conscious of and
 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.370
perceive what are you conscious of and
in a similar sense it might be that it's

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380
in a similar sense it might be that it's
 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.840
in a similar sense it might be that it's
sufficient to build a general learning

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850
sufficient to build a general learning
 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.940
sufficient to build a general learning
architecture and combine this there's a

architecture and combine this there's a
 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.830
architecture and combine this there's a
good motivational system and we are not

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840
good motivational system and we are not
 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.270
good motivational system and we are not
there yet that we've built a general

there yet that we've built a general
 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.160
there yet that we've built a general
learning architecture for instance our

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170
learning architecture for instance our
 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.110

minds can learn and create new

minds can learn and create new
 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.970
minds can learn and create new
algorithms they can be used to write

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980
algorithms they can be used to write
 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.160
algorithms they can be used to write
code and invent code programming code

to build a shop and run that shop if you

to build a shop and run that shop if you
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.490
to build a shop and run that shop if you
are a shopkeeper which is some kind of

are a shopkeeper which is some kind of

don't know how to build a system that is
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.640
don't know how to build a system that is
able to do this yet it involves for

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650
able to do this yet it involves for
 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.720
able to do this yet it involves for
instance that we have systems that are

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730
instance that we have systems that are
 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.360
instance that we have systems that are
able to learn loops and we have some

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370
able to learn loops and we have some
 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.070
able to learn loops and we have some
techniques to do this for instance a

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080
techniques to do this for instance a
 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.750
techniques to do this for instance a
long short term memory and a few other

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760
long short term memory and a few other
 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.730
long short term memory and a few other
tricks but they're nowhere near of what

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740
tricks but they're nowhere near of what

clear how much work needs to be done to
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.100
clear how much work needs to be done to
extend these systems and to what people

extend these systems and to what people
 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.600
extend these systems and to what people
can do it could be that it's very simple

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610
can do it could be that it's very simple
 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.190
can do it could be that it's very simple
it could be that it's going to take a

it could be that it's going to take a
 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.220
it could be that it's going to take a
lot of research the dire view is what's

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230
lot of research the dire view is what's
 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.780
lot of research the dire view is what's
more the traditional view is that human

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790
more the traditional view is that human
 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.280
more the traditional view is that human

complexity that we need to build a lot

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090
complexity that we need to build a lot
 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.840
complexity that we need to build a lot
of functionality into it like an Minsky

society of mind to get to all the tricks

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820
society of mind to get to all the tricks
 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.059

that people are up to and if that is the

that people are up to and if that is the
 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.820
that people are up to and if that is the
case then it might take a very long time

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
case then it might take a very long time
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.979
case then it might take a very long time
and we have created all these different

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989
and we have created all these different
 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.440
and we have created all these different
functional mechanisms but I don't think

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450
functional mechanisms but I don't think
 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.970
functional mechanisms but I don't think
that it's going to be so dire because

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980
that it's going to be so dire because
 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.740
that it's going to be so dire because
our genome is very short and most of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750
our genome is very short and most of
 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.080
our genome is very short and most of
that codes for a single cell very little

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090
that codes for a single cell very little
 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.940
that codes for a single cell very little
of it codes for the brain and I think a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950
of it codes for the brain and I think a
 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.559
of it codes for the brain and I think a
cell is much more complicated than a

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569
cell is much more complicated than a
 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.600
cell is much more complicated than a
brain a brain is probably largely

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610
brain a brain is probably largely
 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.460
brain a brain is probably largely
self-organizing and built not like

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470
self-organizing and built not like
 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.149
self-organizing and built not like
clockwork

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.699

but like a cappuccino so you mix the

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709
but like a cappuccino so you mix the
 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.289
but like a cappuccino so you mix the
right ingredients and then you let it

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299
right ingredients and then you let it
 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.030
right ingredients and then you let it
percolate and then forms a particular

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040
percolate and then forms a particular
 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.490
percolate and then forms a particular
kind of structure so I do think because

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500
kind of structure so I do think because
 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.350
kind of structure so I do think because
nature pulls it off pretty well in most

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360
nature pulls it off pretty well in most
 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.140
nature pulls it off pretty well in most
of the cases that even though brain

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150
of the cases that even though brain
 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.630
of the cases that even though brain
probably needs more complexity than a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640
probably needs more complexity than a
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.819
probably needs more complexity than a
cappuccino dramatically more it's going

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829
cappuccino dramatically more it's going
 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.309
cappuccino dramatically more it's going
to be much simpler than building a very

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319
to be much simpler than building a very
 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.770
