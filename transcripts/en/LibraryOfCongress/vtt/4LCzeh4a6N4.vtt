00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.970
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker AKA Professor
Horn: Thank you so much.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.270
Can you hear me OK on this?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.880
OK, good. It's a real
pleasure to be here today.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.680
It's-- I've been here
doing research at times

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.670
at the Houdini Library and
I-- it's nothing like it.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.190
So, it's wonderful to be here.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.010
Punch and Judy is somewhat of
an esoteric subject matter here

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.560
in America and I could
talk about it for hours.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.040
And if anybody has their
doubts, just ask my poor wife.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.030
OK? Now, a few important things.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.120
Some homework first.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.820
We have a tremendous amount
of information to cover

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.460
and in order to keep things
interesting and moving along,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.120
I need to compress
tons of information

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.030
into an allotted time slot.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.500
So, if there are any questions,
I would just say speak to me

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.140
at the very end of the
program and I'll be happy

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.740
to talk to you about that.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.510
So, exactly what
is Punch and Judy?

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.540
In its simplest form, Punch is
a nonsensical slapstick comedy

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.990
puppet show about
a misfit family.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.160
Think in terms of the
cartoon show the Simpsons,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.440
but in our case, however,
it's Marge, Homer, Bart,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.780
and Lisa Simpson meet Tom and
Jerry and The Three Stooges.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.020
Much like the move Napoleon
Dynamite, the show has no plot,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.710
but somehow it still works.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.490
While the show itself has a very
loose structure, no two Punch

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.690
and Judy shows are the same.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.280
And much like-- much of the
play is left to the imagination

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.850
of the showman and that's
what makes it both interesting

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.150
and fun.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.920
You can still see versions
of the puppet show performed

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.300
in countries around the world.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.380
I'm kind of new at this-- let's
see here-- let me just try this.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.680
There we go.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.490
OK. And here it is, some
great examples of that.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.040
What is not shown
here is, in Russia,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.110
Punch is known as Petrushka.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.100
In Germany, it's Kasperle.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.670
France, it's Polichinelle.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.630
Italy, it's Pulcinella.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.540
And of course here in the U.S.
and England it's known as Punch.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.050
So the $64,000 question
is how did one

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.670
of the oldest folk dramas begin.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.350
It took several hundred years
for the dramatis persona

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.070
to emerge and evolve into
the puppet show it is today.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.820
There we go.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.890
For this lecture, though,
we're going to begin

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.370
at about the middle
of the 16th century

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.300
with a character
known as Pulcinella.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.580
He was just one of many comical
stock characters appearing

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.980
in a repertoire of plays put
on by a group of actors known

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.160
as the commedia dell'arte.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.470
The theater of skills.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.540
Pulcinella had a large nose,
he wore a floppy white costume

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.240
with a pointed hat, and
although he was witty back then,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.230
he was somewhat of an
idiot and a coward.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.720
Over the years, this
traveling group

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.450
of minstrels toured the
surrounding areas presenting

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.810
their plays and so
popular was the character

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.330
that the puppeteers of the day
added him to their puppet shows.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.680
And so it was just a matter

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.430
of time before they
traveled throughout Europe.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.180
And we know that one
of these shows was seen

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.350
in England on May ninth of 1662.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.690
Was anybody there to see that?

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.220
I was just checking.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.980
OK. OK. And the reason we know
that is there was a man named--

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.600
that's right-- Samuel Pepys.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.970
He was a government minister.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.170
He kept a diary and in
his journal he noted

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.460
that he had been at an
alehouse in Covent Garden

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.880
and he was there looking at
a painting and as he came

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.550
out he noticed this pretty
Italian puppet play, Pulcinella.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.410
Now, it wasn't a puppet show per
se, but it was a puppet play.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.880
And he was so taken
by the performance

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.180
that he told his wife and
his servants to go see it.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.890
The name of the performer
was Pietro Gimonde

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.600
and because he was from Bologna,
which is in northern Italy,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.200
he was called Signor Bologna.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.500
Makes sense to me.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.050
OK. He was travelling throughout
Europe and he happened

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.960
to make a stop in England where
he stayed for many months.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.150
And everywhere he went,
the show was noted

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.420
for its chief character,
a hooknose clown

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.870
with a black half mask
and a squeaky voice.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.170
In October of that year,

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.790
Signor Bologna gave
a royal performance--

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.860
command performance-- for King
Charles II and the monarch was

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.860
so impressed with him that
he gave him a gold chain

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.750
and a medal as a way of
showing his appreciation.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.050
Let me try to get this here.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.350
Boo. There we go.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.690
OK. This is Martin Powell.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.600
This is about 1709 and
that's Punch and Mrs. Punch.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.370
Now, I should point out
that the puppet shows

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.390
at that particular time,
they were marionettes.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.210
That's puppets with strings.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.280
Several puppeteers were needed
in order to present these shows

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.200
on these large makeshift stages.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.960
Each puppet was probably
about three feet high.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.880
Other Italian performers
heard of Bologna's success

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.210
and before long they headed to
England where the popularity

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.390
of the marionette was
rapidly being established.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.310
Now, many of the shows
started working large fairs,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.040
such as Bartholomew Fair,
Norridge, and all over England.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.410
The shows, however,
were a bit tacky.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.920
You had to go into a marquee
and stand in the dark.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.300
And there were prostitutes,
pickpockets, and all sort

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.180
of things going on
in the darkness.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.330
During the next 100 years,
the people of England grabbled

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.230
with the name of this character

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.210
and eventually his name was
shortened from Pulcinella

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.540
to Punchinello and
eventually Punch.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.130
Other characters
began to emerge.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.540
One of the earliest
characters was the devil,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.220
who fought Mr. Punch at
the very end of the story.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.120
By the 1700's, Mr. Punch's wife
was introduced to the show.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.970
And at that time
her name was Joan.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.380
And because it was
pronounced through a swazzle--

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.830
that's a little device that
the performer puts in his mouth

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.720
that gives Punch
the squeaky voice.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.690
But when he would call her
name, he would call Joan,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.620
but he would call her
Joanie and people heard that

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.420
and thought he was saying Judy,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.230
so eventually that's how it
became known as Punch and Judy.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.110
Now, as time passed by, these
marionette shows started

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.840
to play themselves out.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.100
One of the main reasons was
that the overhead costs.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.250
Some of the marionette
shows required four

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.280
or more entertainers to
erect a large puppet theater

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.770
and perform the show.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.200
That's a lot of people to feed,
especially when you're busking,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.930
which means you're
working for tips.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.300
Here we go.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.880
Here we go.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.180
All right.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.020
Yeah. About 1779, Punch
evolved into a hand puppet,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.550
which was much more viable
than the old marionette shows.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.730
One man could now operate the
puppets behind this portable

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.740
stage and it's-- although
it's not shown here,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.640
but in many instances his
partner would stand in front

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.620
of the puppet theater, he'd
bang a drum and play panpipes

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.360
in order to attract a crowd
so they could collect money.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.980
It was a very short show.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.340
If you look at this
copper engraving,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.310
you'll notice how tall the
puppet stage is compared to some

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.890
of the other people
standing near it.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.000
What you don't see is behind the
curtain a performer is holding

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.100
the puppets above his
head, and that was

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.970
so that people could see
it from a greater distance.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.510
Now, all the action took
place on a small puppet stage

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.640
and often times the
puppets collided

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.120
when they came together.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.050
Since Punch was a hand puppet,
he could now pick up a stick

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.310
and belabor anyone who stopped
him from having his own way.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.530
That meant the law,
his wife, the devil.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.300
No doubt one day the wooden
baby puppet fell off the stage,

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.630
it got a laugh, and
other performers

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.670
of the day added
it to their show.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.500
Punch's costume was
originally all white,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.990
but through the years he
acquired the red, yellow,

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.800
and green motley colors
of the Elizabethan jester.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.590
Lots of English puns and sense

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.180
of humor began creeping
into the show.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.450
Soon it became a very
funny puppet play.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.150
Punch would ridicule
people in high places,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.620
deflate the pompous,
and to some people

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.430
of the time, he was
on their side.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.350
And in a day when they would
hang you for stealing a loaf

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.060
of bread, when Mr. Punch was
confronted by the hangman,

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.960
Jack Ketch, and Punch
tricked the hangman

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.580
into putting his own noose--

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.920
I mean his own head into
the noose, audiences thought

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.070
that was a wonderful achievement
and Punch became a folk hero.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.170
Now, an important point
to remember is that up

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.570
until this time the shows
were never written down.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.400
Once an entertainer learned
a show, he learned how

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.710
to present it, he
passed that knowledge

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.430
on to either his son
or an apprentice.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.980
And in many respects, that's how

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.130
that tradition continues
to this day.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.660
Matter of fact, that's
exactly how I learned the show,

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.850
which you'll hear about
a little bit later.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.670
The structure of
the play, however,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.920
became formally established
in 1828

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.130
when the first recorded
script was captured

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.670
in a book called the
tragical comedy or comic--

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.550
comical tragedy of
Punch and Judy.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.050
It was written by a
journalist, John Payne Collier,

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.990
and the book had
wonderful illustrations

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.290
by George Cruikshank.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.450
And I actually have some of
those that are on display here.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.820
Through text and drawings, the
book captured a performance of

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.500
yet another Italian
showman, Giovanni Piccini.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.890
The book was later
reprinted, adapted,

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.060
and expanded countless times.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.570
In fact, versions of that book
are still reprinted to this day.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.460
Now, a few interesting things

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.660
about the performer
and the author.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.270
OK. That's one of the
Cruikshank drawings.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.860
Piccini was one of the best
known Punchmen of the period.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.730
For nearly 50 years he had
been amusing lords, dukes,

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.680
princesses, squires, and
vagabonds throughout England.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.020
And it was said that
everyone knew him

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.700
and they would stop
and watch his show.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.860
As for John Payne Collier,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.570
some of his works were labeled
forgeries and toward the end

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.750
of his life he more or less
admitted that everything

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.710
about his life had been a lie.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.630
And there's no doubt that parts

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.060
of the Piccini script
were embellished.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.880
It was a very verbose script
and could never be said

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.800
with Mr. Punch speaking all
those words through a swazzle.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.510
However, whatever the arguments
are about Collier's honesty,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.200
it is still felt that that
publication is what the French

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.200
call [foreign word],
a turning point,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.220
because it provided a foundation

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.790
for everything else
that followed.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.770
All right.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:03.080
Here is a typical Punch and
Judy show from Piccini's time.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.000
This is Punch or Mayday, 1829,
and this painting belongs

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.650
to the Tate Gallery in London.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.270
Several interesting
things happened

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.810
between the mid to--
mid to late 1800's.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.260
The railways came about

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.850
and eventually they
started making excursions

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.520
to the seaside.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.550
With a greater number of people
now able to travel to the beach,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.670
masses of people started
traveling there and soon Punch

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.110
and Judy followed them, along
with a printologist [phonetic],

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.470
oyster vendors, quack
doctors, and donkey rides.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:43.700
So, while you were taking-- so
while you were taking a paddle

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.840
in the ocean, you could
now watch a live Punch

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.140
and Judy show.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.590
In the very early days,

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.620
Punch and Judy shows were
originally attended--

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.790
intended for adult audiences
because they were the ones

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.200
that were paying
to watch the show.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.310
Things started to change though
during the Victorian times.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.030
The Victorians began to
invite Punch and Judy men

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.690
into their parlors to entertain
middle class drawing rooms

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.400
and at children's parties.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.860
This is circa 1850.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.260
Because of this, the street
showmen started to clean

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.040
up their act, so to speak, and
so Punch and Judy's image began

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.590
to soften and slowly evolve into
acceptable family entertainment.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.330
During these Victorian times,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.880
puppet characters were still
being added and deleted.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.670
About 1860, the crocodile, one
of the more exciting characters

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.120
in the show, first
appeared and he's been

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.860
in the show ever since.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.420
I thought you'd like this.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.720
This is a great one.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.680
You'll notice there's a dog
sitting up on the playboard.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.150
And a dog is--

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.830
he was occasionally seen
in some performances.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.880
In today's show, it's
usually he's just a puppet,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.480
but back then he did
appear in some shows

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.410
and usually it was a
small terrier and it was--

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.700
belonged to the showman, it was
his pet, and he would travel

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.540
with him from town to town.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.770
The dog was always called Toby
and he wore a colorful ruff

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.620
around its neck and sat on the
playboard during the sequences.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:20.040
Mr. Punch would get the dog to
stand up on its two hind legs

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.010
and at times the dog would
get into a fight with Punch

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.550
and bite his noose--
I mean bite his nose.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.020
It is interesting, a couple--
before, when I was coming in,

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.750
somebody was talking to me about
the dog-- and this is true--

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.930
that some of the dogs
would actually smoke a pipe

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.500
or a cigarette.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.720
And-- anyway.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.360
But today you rarely
see a live dog,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.690
although you will see
a dog puppet in shows.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:50.540
Now, there's a reason
why I included this.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:56.260
This is what's known as a
saucy seaside British postcard.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.640
I needed to get your attention

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.140
so that you would remember
three important things

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.440
about Punch and Judy.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.790
And here they are.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:08.140
Joey the clown, a slapstick,
and audience participation.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.390
These three elements came
about through a unique form

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.630
of British entertainment
called pantomimes

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.870
or pantos [phonetic] for short.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.010
Pantomimes are unique to England

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.710
and they have nothing
to do with mimes.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.420
They are outlandish
musicals based

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.660
on well-known children's
stories, such as Peter Pan,

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.150
Jack and the Beanstalk,
Sleeping Beauty, et cetera.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.680
This type of entertainment has
been taking place in England

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.260
for several hundred years

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.900
and always take place
around Christmastime.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.550
There was a famous English
actor comedian known

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.440
as Joseph Grimaldi.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.450
He played the part of a
clown and he was so popular

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.970
in these pantomimes that Punch

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.590
and Judy men added
him into their shows.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.850
In fact, clowns today are
still known as Joeys and that's

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.740
in honor of Joseph Grimaldi.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.090
Grimaldi and other characters
in the pantomime used

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.630
to hit each other with a wooden
slapstick, which is two pieces

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.160
of wood that when they hit
together they make a slapping

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.340
noise without causing
any real pain.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.500
In fact, this is where the word
slapstick comedy comes from.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.500
So, Punch and Judy performers
added slapstick comedy--

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.380
I mean the slapstick
to their shows.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.900
And finally, the most
important part take

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.910
from British pantomimes is
the audience participation.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.250
If you were in England
today attending a--

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.170
or around Christmastime--
attending a British pantomime

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.020
and a character said
oh, no, I didn't,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.950
the entire audience would
automatically respond

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.140
and say oh, yes, you did.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.360
Yeah. Well, thank you,
somebody has been there.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.810
It's just a theatrical
tradition that's been handed

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.270
down from generation
to generation.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.090
When the bad guy comes
out, everybody just boos.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.550
I mean it's-- it's a sight
to see, it really is.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.650
Over in England, Punch and Judy
is probably more popular now

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.950
than it's ever been.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.220
It's estimated that
there are about 300 Punch

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.600
and Judy performers in England.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.860
I would say here in
America we're lucky

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.100
if we have about 50, you know.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.840
Now, I've jumped around
a bit and there's a--

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.000
but I've given you a general
overview of Punch and Judy

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.240
in England, so now I'd like to
talk a little bit about America.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.400
We know that Punch was
here, at least by 1742.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.430
A Philadelphia newspaper
advertisement announced the

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.210
performance of Punch and Joan.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.150
See, didn't evolve yet.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.810
Since the notice said the
figures were two feet high,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.230
I think it's safe to say
that they were marionettes.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:48.050
Not that long ago, I discovered
a 1902 book called Maryland

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.440
as a Palatinate and it
notes that there was a Punch

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.220
and Judy show in Annapolis,

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.420
Maryland before the
American Revolutionary War.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.850
Per his own accounting records,

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.120
George Washington purchased a
ticket to a Punch and Judy show.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.730
It wasn't long before
these Punch

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.860
and Judy shows began
popping up like mushrooms

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.130
after a good rainstorm.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.880
Right after John Payne Collier's
book was released in England

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.240
in 1828, unauthorized editions
began-- were sold here.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.320
Let's see, what do we got here.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.970
OK. Now, if you have an interest
in Punch and Judy in America,

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.160
I highly recommend this book.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.440
It's written by Ryan Howard.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.990
It's Punch and Judy in
19th Century America.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.440
Mr. Howard is a professor
emeritus of art history

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.130
at Moreland State University.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.840
Years back, I was in the
early stages of writing a book

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.960
about the history of
Punch and Judy in America

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.660
when Mr. Howard contact
me and I told him

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.740
that I was writing a
book on the same subject.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.360
Since he already had
a 15-year head start,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.860
I thought it was a
good idea to just work

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.160
with him on the project.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.890
I think my wife was
happy about that too.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.800
But, truth be told, Mr.
Howard had already completed a

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.900
tremendous amount of work
and research on Punch

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.270
and Judy in the United States.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.990
At one time there--
and this is true--

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.360
all this is true [laughs].

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.790
Why would it not be true?

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.840
I have a bad habit
of saying that.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.140
This is true.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.440
I don't know why I do that.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.440
At one time there were
hundreds-- and I mean hundreds--

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.450
of Punch and Judy shows
barnstorming across America.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.750
Some performers emigrated
from England

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.970
and other European countries.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.920
Most Punch and Judy performers
were not full-time entertainers.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.190
Many were part-time
magicians, ventriloquists,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.700
and they learned how to
perform Punch and Judy

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.130
from other Punch
and Judy performers.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.910
And I'm sure some operators
did what they had to do

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.760
in order to make a living.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.220
Because of the diverse
American population at the time,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.100
many of the early Punch
shows included racial

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.910
and ethnic characters,
dialect, and humor.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.520
So, where did all these
shows take place in America?

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.820
They were everywhere.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.920
They were performed at
parks, fairs, theaters,

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.770
and some venues that
no longer exist.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.610
As an example, in the
late 1800's, some Punch

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.830
and Judy shows were
seen in concert saloons,

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.030
which were low-class
drinking establishments

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.120
that provided cheap
entertainment

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.370
and female companionship
to attract customers.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.300
There were also variety
theaters.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.620
The majority of Punch and
Judy show performers, however,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.010
found employment at circus
side shows, dime museums,

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.480
and the Chautauqua circuit.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.740
Oh, get that here.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.260
OK. Ha, ha, ha.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.560
Here we go.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.830
This is probably one of the most
famous Punch and Judy performers

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.890
to work circus side shows
and it was none other

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.710
than the legendary
Harry Houdini.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.950
Of course, he was very young at
the time and this is when he was

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:08.280
with the Welsh Brothers
Circus circus-- circa 1895.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.680
It was said that Houdini carved
his own Punch and Judy puppets.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.030
Now-- but sometime during
the 1970's, I guess it was

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:20.750
about 1975, I had a phone
call and someone was talking

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.230
to me about these puppets.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.500
They either had them,
they knew where they were,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.980
or they were selling them,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.420
but I wasn't performing
Punch and Judy back then.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.010
And I wish I could
remember more,

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.870
but I don't know how much you
can remember from phone calls,

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.640
you know, 40, 50 years ago.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.640
Dime museums were
popular institutions

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.430
in the U.S. by the late 1800's.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.590
They were designed as
centers for entertainment

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.920
and moral education
for the working class.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.250
P. T. Barnum opened a dime
museum in New York back in 1842.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.730
Eventually, some of the
museums featured Punch

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:06.540
and Judy shows along with other
types of variety entertainment.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.560
The picture here is Gus White.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.270
He's from Orange
County, New York.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.790
And while he performed at many
county fairs, he also performed

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.570
for years at museums, some
of which were dime museums.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.260
He was on a circuit and
traveled to Boston, Cleveland,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.180
Coney Island, and
many other places.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.170
I mentioned before
that most Punch

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:31.480
and Judy performers also did
other things to make a living.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.730
Gus White was an
exceptional artist

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.390
and made a decent
living as a sign painter.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.280
You should also note that he
was also an expert wood carver

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.690
and he made all his own puppets.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.680
Just look at some
of the expressions

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.610
on the faces of those puppets.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.470
At one time he had 32
characters that he could inject

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.620
into his show at any given time.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.380
Since he was an amazing artist,

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.340
one of his features was
having Punch come up on stage

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.640
with a notepad and a crayon and
he would sketch out an image

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.720
of the president or
someone from the audience.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.510
About 23 of his puppets survived
and they were auctioned off

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.300
in 1992, a New York comic
collector bought them

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.420
for $45,000.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:22.920
OK. Then came Chautauqua.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.830
This was a big adult education
movement from the late 1800's

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.930
to the mid-late 1920's.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.440
Chautauqua assemblies brought in
all types of speakers, teachers,

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.590
musicians, and entertainers.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.820
Their main purpose was to
bring entertainment, education,

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.830
and culture into
communities across America.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.590
This is a picture of
Professor Will Smith.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:49.710
He was originally from England
and he came from a long line

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.720
of Punch and Judy performers.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.150
In 1921, he was performing
at a Chautauqua event

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.360
in Talbot County, Maryland.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.680
I'll admit he looks a bit
scary dressed as Mr. Punch.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:09.130
You know? This next
performer came later,

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.380
but there's a reason why
I'm highlighting him.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.230
His name is George Prentice--

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.770
his real name was Michael
Zilka [assumed spelling]

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.560
and he is considered
a legend in the annals

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.090
of Punch and Judy history.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.520
Even until today, the
Punch and Judy professors

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.360
over in England still talk
about him as if he were a god.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.880
He performed in Vaudeville
and between 1931

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.950
and 1932 he performed 231 Punch
and Judy shows on Broadway

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:44.670
and a play called Laugh Parade
that starred comedian Ed Wynn.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.980
In 1934, he was invited to
entertain the Duke of Windsor

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.360
at this royal wedding party.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.380
Can you imagine that?

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.470
He stayed in England and
performed it for two years.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:57.940
Some of his performances were

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.320
at the prestigious
London Palladium.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.030
After appearing in
another Broadway show,

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.720
he toured Europe for six years.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.630
His list of accomplishments
just go on and on.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:13.630
He entertained the servicemen at
USO camps during World War II.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.940
He performed in Vegas, many
popular shows of the day.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.390
The man was everywhere.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.750
One of his most prestigious
bookings was performing Punch

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.800
and Judy at Radio
City Music Hall.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.710
That's a 6,200-seat theater.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.670
One reviewer said his puppets
were a little hard to see,

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.330
but his comedy was universal.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:40.570
It got laughs practically
all the way.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.600
So, you might ask how
did I become interested

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.900
in Punch and Judy.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.910
And if you don't ask
that, I'll ask it.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:50.180
OK. It actually-- it dates
back to-- it's kind of weird,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.850
but it actually goes back
to 1897 in Baltimore.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:25:00.310
This is a photo here, a 1940
photo, of James Edward Ross.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.730
He was known as Professor
Rosella and he first performed

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:08.410
at Pat Harris' dime museum
in Baltimore in 1897.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.360
He would later go on
to perform his show

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.350
at Young's Million Dollar
Pier in Atlantic City

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:16.870
and for years he was featured--
he was a featured attraction

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:22.270
at a now defunct Baltimore
amusement park called Riverview.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.190
One of his greatest
testimonials came

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.600
from President Theodore
Roosevelt

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.420
after watching one
of his performances.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.940
Per Mrs. Roosevelt,

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.250
the president enjoyed Rosella's
Punch and Judy show more

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.450
than any child in the audience.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:44.150
So, again, how did I become
interested in Punch and Judy?

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.770
This is a picture of George Horn
when he was a young magician.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.650
He was a ventriloquist.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.120
He met Rosella.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.070
In fact, he was a
frequent visitor

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.280
to Riverview Amusement Park

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.280
where he watched
Rosella perform the show.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.220
And George Horn performed
the show

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.910
in Baltimore for
nearly 60 years.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.530
One of his strangest bookings--
George Horn's bookings--

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.070
was behind a two-way mirror at
a slanky [phonetic] night club

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.040
in Baltimore called
Club Charles.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.010
The audience never
saw George Horn

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:22.050
and he worked there every night
for six night-- for six years.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:26.500
His Punch and Judy puppets would
interact with audience members,

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.310
play musical instruments,

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.040
and again all behind
a two-way mirror.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.490
If a regular person came in--

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.680
I mean a regular came in
with a new lady friend,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.370
one of the puppets
would say, hey, Joe,

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.040
that's not the same lady you
brought in here the other night.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.780
And all the bar flies
would laugh, you know.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.160
So, when I was about
10 years old,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.170
I saw George Horn perform Punch
and Judy and I never forgot it.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.470
Or his name.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.750
And as a child, I remember
calling him up on the phone

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.760
and telling him that I
was going to visit him--

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.440
and I did, 20, 25 years later.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.600
Although I was performing
as a magician,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.050
I hired him to entertain at
my niece's birthday party

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.120
and the children's reaction
to that show as amazing.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.780
It was unlike anything
I had ever heard before.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.270
He was in his late 80's and
since his wife had died,

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.720
we just became good friends

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.470
and for years I visited
him once a month

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.700
and would always take
him out to dinner.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.000
In a nice way, I told him I'd
like to take over the show

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.740
if he ever decided that
he wanted to retire

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:31.980
and then one day he called
me up and told me that.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.530
I studied under him for
years and was a pallbearer

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:39.340
at his funeral and he
died at the age of 98.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:44.770
For a while, I actually thought
he was going to outlive me.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.120
As of this year, I've been
performing a modified version

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.970
of the Rosella Horn
show under the banner

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.180
of Professor Horn for 25 years.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.050
And that's my story.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.850
Thank you.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:03.680
[ Applause ]
