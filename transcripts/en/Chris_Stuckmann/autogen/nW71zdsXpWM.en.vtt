00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
to see now obviously the biggest spoiler
 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.700 align:start position:0%
to see now obviously the biggest spoiler
is<00:06:16.340><c> that</c><00:06:16.610><c> Sir</c><00:06:16.940><c> Patrick</c><00:06:17.210><c> is</c><00:06:17.690><c> actually</c><00:06:18.110><c> Ares</c><00:06:18.530><c> and</c>

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 align:start position:0%
is that Sir Patrick is actually Ares and
 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.770 align:start position:0%
is that Sir Patrick is actually Ares and
hiding<00:06:19.160><c> this</c><00:06:19.610><c> really</c><00:06:20.000><c> could</c><00:06:20.150><c> have</c><00:06:20.240><c> gone</c><00:06:20.270><c> south</c>

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 align:start position:0%
hiding this really could have gone south
 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.510 align:start position:0%
hiding this really could have gone south
because<00:06:21.020><c> there's</c><00:06:21.380><c> a</c><00:06:21.470><c> lot</c><00:06:21.650><c> of</c><00:06:21.800><c> CG</c><00:06:22.160><c> in</c><00:06:22.370><c> this</c>

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of CG in this
 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.100 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of CG in this
finale<00:06:22.820><c> which</c><00:06:23.120><c> is</c><00:06:23.240><c> to</c><00:06:23.390><c> be</c><00:06:23.480><c> expected</c><00:06:23.510><c> it's</c>

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 align:start position:0%
finale which is to be expected it's
 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.990 align:start position:0%
finale which is to be expected it's
Wonder<00:06:24.440><c> Woman</c><00:06:24.740><c> she</c><00:06:24.920><c> is</c><00:06:25.010><c> not</c><00:06:25.250><c> a</c><00:06:25.280><c> normal</c><00:06:25.850><c> person</c>

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
Wonder Woman she is not a normal person
 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.900 align:start position:0%
Wonder Woman she is not a normal person
as<00:06:26.330><c> I</c><00:06:26.420><c> said</c><00:06:26.660><c> in</c><00:06:26.840><c> my</c><00:06:27.430><c> non-spoiler</c><00:06:28.430><c> review</c><00:06:28.460><c> she</c>

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 align:start position:0%
as I said in my non-spoiler review she
 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
as I said in my non-spoiler review she
is<00:06:29.030><c> a</c><00:06:29.180><c> superhero</c><00:06:29.810><c> and</c><00:06:30.050><c> so</c><00:06:30.260><c> there's</c><00:06:30.500><c> going</c><00:06:30.590><c> to</c>

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 align:start position:0%
is a superhero and so there's going to
 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
is a superhero and so there's going to
be<00:06:30.710><c> CG</c><00:06:31.190><c> but</c><00:06:31.790><c> there's</c><00:06:31.940><c> a</c><00:06:32.030><c> lot</c><00:06:32.210><c> of</c><00:06:32.330><c> it</c><00:06:32.650><c> gratefully</c>

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 align:start position:0%

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.010 align:start position:0%
be CG but there's a lot of it gratefully
because<00:06:34.520><c> the</c><00:06:34.730><c> film</c><00:06:34.940><c> took</c><00:06:35.240><c> so</c><00:06:35.510><c> much</c><00:06:35.660><c> time</c><00:06:35.960><c> to</c>

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 align:start position:0%
because the film took so much time to
 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.590 align:start position:0%
because the film took so much time to
set<00:06:36.440><c> up</c><00:06:36.470><c> the</c><00:06:36.680><c> characters</c><00:06:37.400><c> it</c><00:06:37.760><c> didn't</c><00:06:38.480><c> bother</c>

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
