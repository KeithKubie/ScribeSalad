okay so we hit here today to talk about

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
okay so we hit here today to talk about
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.929
okay so we hit here today to talk about
the Android transitions API

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
the Android transitions API
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.880
the Android transitions API
we've got a lot to cover so we're just

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
we've got a lot to cover so we're just
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.410
we've got a lot to cover so we're just
going to jump straight into the topic

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
going to jump straight into the topic
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.590
going to jump straight into the topic
and get going so first up transitions

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
and get going so first up transitions
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.870
and get going so first up transitions
what are they the basic idea of the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
what are they the basic idea of the
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.060
what are they the basic idea of the
transitions API is to help you and teach

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
transitions API is to help you and teach
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619
transitions API is to help you and teach
and whenever there's a change in the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
and whenever there's a change in the
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.780
and whenever there's a change in the
scene where scene is basically a view

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
scene where scene is basically a view
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.959
scene where scene is basically a view
hierarchy on screen so the idea is that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
hierarchy on screen so the idea is that
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330
hierarchy on screen so the idea is that
when a scene changes my animation

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
when a scene changes my animation
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.660
when a scene changes my animation
doesn't work properly ironically and we

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
doesn't work properly ironically and we
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.520
doesn't work properly ironically and we
perform a transition so transition being

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
perform a transition so transition being
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799
perform a transition so transition being
look at what has changed and then

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
look at what has changed and then
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.160
look at what has changed and then
animate that difference so the API for

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
animate that difference so the API for
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.990
animate that difference so the API for
the transition is it's pretty simple it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
the transition is it's pretty simple it
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.650
the transition is it's pretty simple it
just exactly this thing what has changed

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660
just exactly this thing what has changed
 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.750
just exactly this thing what has changed
firstly there'll be two callbacks into

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
firstly there'll be two callbacks into
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.399
firstly there'll be two callbacks into
your transition which is capture start

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
your transition which is capture start
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.609
your transition which is capture start
values and capture end values and

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619
values and capture end values and
 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.780
values and capture end values and
passing in this object this transition

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
passing in this object this transition
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.480
passing in this object this transition
values object so this object has the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
values object so this object has the
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.280
values object so this object has the
view and you can look at the view and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
view and you can look at the view and
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.840
view and you can look at the view and
capture properties about it and save it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850
capture properties about it and save it
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370
capture properties about it and save it
into some kind of map in the transition

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
into some kind of map in the transition
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350
into some kind of map in the transition
values and so you do that in a start

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
values and so you do that in a start
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.469
values and so you do that in a start
state and the end state and then we'll

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
state and the end state and then we'll
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.289
state and the end state and then we'll
call the create animator method giving

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
call the create animator method giving
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.569
call the create animator method giving
those those two states and you create

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
those those two states and you create
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.520
those those two states and you create
animators to you know animate the change

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
animators to you know animate the change
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.580
animators to you know animate the change
between those two states cool so that's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
between those two states cool so that's
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.670
between those two states cool so that's
the very basic API covered off there's a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
the very basic API covered off there's a
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890
the very basic API covered off there's a
bunch of transitions which come in the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
bunch of transitions which come in the
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.270
bunch of transitions which come in the
android framework which you can and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
android framework which you can and
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.100
android framework which you can and
absolutely should use so let's have a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
absolutely should use so let's have a
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.330
absolutely should use so let's have a
quick survey of what they are so you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
quick survey of what they are so you
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.800
quick survey of what they are so you
know what these learned primitives you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
know what these learned primitives you
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.889
know what these learned primitives you
can build with are the first and super

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
can build with are the first and super
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.389
can build with are the first and super
handy one to know about is and the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
handy one to know about is and the
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219
handy one to know about is and the
change bounds transition so this will

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
change bounds transition so this will
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.260
change bounds transition so this will
help you out whenever you are moving or

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
help you out whenever you are moving or
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.899
help you out whenever you are moving or
resizing a view and it will animate the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
resizing a view and it will animate the
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399
resizing a view and it will animate the
top left and bottom right properties to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
top left and bottom right properties to
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.550
top left and bottom right properties to
help you move it around and crucially

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
help you move it around and crucially
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.800
help you move it around and crucially
this change bounds also helps suppress

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
this change bounds also helps suppress
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539
this change bounds also helps suppress
layout so you don't want to be calling

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
layout so you don't want to be calling
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.980
layout so you don't want to be calling
request layout repeatedly because that's

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
request layout repeatedly because that's
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.330
request layout repeatedly because that's
going to be bad for performance whereas

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
going to be bad for performance whereas
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.410
going to be bad for performance whereas
change bounds will do this in a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
change bounds will do this in a
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.860
change bounds will do this in a
performant way for you secondly and is a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
performant way for you secondly and is a
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.880
performant way for you secondly and is a
fade transition we

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
fade transition we
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.250
fade transition we
as the name suggests helps fade things

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
as the name suggests helps fade things
 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.690
as the name suggests helps fade things
in and out so anytime an object's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
in and out so anytime an object's
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.760
in and out so anytime an object's
visibility changes or get added or

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770
visibility changes or get added or
 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.350
visibility changes or get added or
removed from the hierarchy you can run a

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
removed from the hierarchy you can run a
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.949
removed from the hierarchy you can run a
fade to ease that change and lastly this

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
fade to ease that change and lastly this
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.720
fade to ease that change and lastly this
is awesome little guy called the Auto

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
is awesome little guy called the Auto
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.250
is awesome little guy called the Auto
transition which will put some of those

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260
transition which will put some of those
 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.350
transition which will put some of those
things together so when the hierarchy

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360
things together so when the hierarchy
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.240
things together so when the hierarchy
changes it will fade new and newly

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250
changes it will fade new and newly
 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.010
changes it will fade new and newly
arriving things in it will move and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020
arriving things in it will move and
 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.290
arriving things in it will move and
resize items which remaining or changing

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300
resize items which remaining or changing
 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.699
resize items which remaining or changing
position and then fade out anything

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
position and then fade out anything
 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.360
position and then fade out anything
which is disappearing very handy in API

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370
which is disappearing very handy in API
 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.370
which is disappearing very handy in API
21 a lollipop and the transitions API

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380
21 a lollipop and the transitions API
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.500
21 a lollipop and the transitions API
got a bunch of new and exciting and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
got a bunch of new and exciting and
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.199
got a bunch of new and exciting and
additions first up was the slide so you

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209
additions first up was the slide so you
 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.300
additions first up was the slide so you
can anytime anything's entering or

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
can anytime anything's entering or
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.500
can anytime anything's entering or
exiting the scene you can like do so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510
exiting the scene you can like do so
 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.790
exiting the scene you can like do so
from an edge you know kind of like nice

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
from an edge you know kind of like nice
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.640
from an edge you know kind of like nice
stack at a Manor and then it's in a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
stack at a Manor and then it's in a
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.250
stack at a Manor and then it's in a
bunch of transforms for whenever you're

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
bunch of transforms for whenever you're
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.420
bunch of transforms for whenever you're
changing the bounds so you can actually

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
changing the bounds so you can actually
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.949
changing the bounds so you can actually
just clip the mounds of something

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
just clip the mounds of something
 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.740
just clip the mounds of something
changing size or if you doing a change

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750
changing size or if you doing a change
 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.170
changing size or if you doing a change
transform which will affect the rotation

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
transform which will affect the rotation
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.030
transform which will affect the rotation
and scale of a view or if you're doing

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
and scale of a view or if you're doing
 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.070
and scale of a view or if you're doing
an image say you're changing from one

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
an image say you're changing from one
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.720
an image say you're changing from one
scale type to another scale type and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
scale type to another scale type and
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.430
scale type to another scale type and
this will help animate the changes to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440
this will help animate the changes to
 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440
this will help animate the changes to
the matrix of the image view and to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450
the matrix of the image view and to
 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.170
the matrix of the image view and to
change between those scales their

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180
change between those scales their
 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.819
change between those scales their
transitions object itself got some

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829
transitions object itself got some
 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.729
transitions object itself got some
upgrades in 21 and so firstly it got

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739
upgrades in 21 and so firstly it got
 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.680
upgrades in 21 and so firstly it got
this thing called path motion which

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
this thing called path motion which
 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.970
this thing called path motion which
basically allows you to control the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980
basically allows you to control the
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.460
basically allows you to control the
movement and along a path so here for

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
movement and along a path so here for
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.110
movement and along a path so here for
example we're looking a and transition

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
example we're looking a and transition
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.850
example we're looking a and transition
which is a shared element and we can

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860
which is a shared element and we can
 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.590
which is a shared element and we can
control the path that it follows when it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600
control the path that it follows when it
 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.420
control the path that it follows when it
moves from one state to the other don't

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430
moves from one state to the other don't
 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.640
moves from one state to the other don't
actually do this kind of horrible loopy

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650
actually do this kind of horrible loopy
 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.110
actually do this kind of horrible loopy
thing this is exaggerated for effect

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120
thing this is exaggerated for effect
 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.350
thing this is exaggerated for effect
please don't do that and the classes

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360
please don't do that and the classes
 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.430
please don't do that and the classes
you'll probably want to look at and when

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440
you'll probably want to look at and when
 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.870
you'll probably want to look at and when
doing this kind of and controlling the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880
doing this kind of and controlling the
 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.400
doing this kind of and controlling the
path is called arc motion and pattern

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410
path is called arc motion and pattern
 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.900
path is called arc motion and pattern
path motion and we'll return to those

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910
path motion and we'll return to those
 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.220
path motion and we'll return to those
later and lastly the transitions API got

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230
later and lastly the transitions API got
 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.020
later and lastly the transitions API got
this new and ability to control the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030
this new and ability to control the
 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.390
this new and ability to control the
propagation and epicenter so what these

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400
propagation and epicenter so what these
 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.490
propagation and epicenter so what these
two properties that you do and is to

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500
two properties that you do and is to
 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.930
two properties that you do and is to
choreograph the way they're group of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940
choreograph the way they're group of
 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.729
choreograph the way they're group of
views are going to move easiest shown

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739
views are going to move easiest shown
 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.140
views are going to move easiest shown
with an example so in this example here

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150
with an example so in this example here
 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.880
with an example so in this example here
when I click on an item see how the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890
when I click on an item see how the
 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.830
when I click on an item see how the
views around the grid all move out

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840
views around the grid all move out
 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.090
views around the grid all move out
together this is called an explode

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100
together this is called an explode
 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.460
together this is called an explode
transition but basically this and by

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
transition but basically this and by
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.020
transition but basically this and by
passing in the epicenter which would be

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
passing in the epicenter which would be
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.759
passing in the epicenter which would be
the view you touched on you can then

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769
the view you touched on you can then
 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.500
the view you touched on you can then
like set the start delays on the other

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510
like set the start delays on the other
 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.969
like set the start delays on the other
views which are exiting as well in order

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979
views which are exiting as well in order
 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.159
views which are exiting as well in order
to have this coordinated movement so

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169
to have this coordinated movement so
 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.170
to have this coordinated movement so
these are the kind of API is to look for

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180
these are the kind of API is to look for
 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.430
these are the kind of API is to look for
if you're trying to build this kind of

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440
if you're trying to build this kind of
 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.089
if you're trying to build this kind of
them transition yourself so that's

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099
them transition yourself so that's
 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.900
them transition yourself so that's
transitions it turns out that and

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910
transitions it turns out that and
 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.130
transitions it turns out that and
quite frequently when you're changing

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140
quite frequently when you're changing
 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.080
quite frequently when you're changing
scenes and if want to perform an

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090
scenes and if want to perform an
 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.870
scenes and if want to perform an
animation on those changes is activity

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880
animation on those changes is activity
 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.310
animation on those changes is activity
boundaries so when you're going from one

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320
boundaries so when you're going from one
 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.980
boundaries so when you're going from one
activity to another so API 21 added a

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990
activity to another so API 21 added a
 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.500
activity to another so API 21 added a
whole bunch of new api's to help do this

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510
whole bunch of new api's to help do this
 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.970
whole bunch of new api's to help do this
kind of thing and which we call window

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980
kind of thing and which we call window
 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.460
kind of thing and which we call window
transitions there's two main types and

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470
transitions there's two main types and
 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.890
transitions there's two main types and
the first type is a Content transition

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900
the first type is a Content transition
 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.490
the first type is a Content transition
so that's when a window exits or new

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500
so that's when a window exits or new
 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.870
so that's when a window exits or new
window enters you have an opportunity to

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880
window enters you have an opportunity to
 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.880
window enters you have an opportunity to
run an animation on the content coming

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890
run an animation on the content coming
 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.710
run an animation on the content coming
in so in this example here if we go from

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720
in so in this example here if we go from
 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.090
in so in this example here if we go from
the grid and we launched into like a

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100
the grid and we launched into like a
 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.010
the grid and we launched into like a
details type screen wearing an enter

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020
details type screen wearing an enter
 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.500
details type screen wearing an enter
animation on the views coming in and the

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510
animation on the views coming in and the
 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.760
animation on the views coming in and the
details where they're sliding in from

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770
details where they're sliding in from
 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.490
details where they're sliding in from
the bottom from the bottom the second

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500
the bottom from the bottom the second
 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.760
the bottom from the bottom the second
type is a shared element transition so

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770
type is a shared element transition so
 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.570
type is a shared element transition so
this is where I went to further go back

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580
 
 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.300
 
okay a shared element is where when you

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310
okay a shared element is where when you
 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.460
okay a shared element is where when you
tap on one view the element transitions

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470
tap on one view the element transitions
 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.040
tap on one view the element transitions
smoothly from one activity into the

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050
smoothly from one activity into the
 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.600
smoothly from one activity into the
second activity and as you just had a

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610
second activity and as you just had a
 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.310
second activity and as you just had a
sneak peek of there those two things

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320
sneak peek of there those two things
 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.080
sneak peek of there those two things
aren't mutually exclusive you can of

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090
aren't mutually exclusive you can of
 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.540
aren't mutually exclusive you can of
course run a shared element and the

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550
course run a shared element and the
 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.030
course run a shared element and the
content and transition as well so here

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040
content and transition as well so here
 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.680
content and transition as well so here
we are sharing a view and also sliding

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690
we are sharing a view and also sliding
 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.610
we are sharing a view and also sliding
in the unshared content as well now a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620
in the unshared content as well now a
 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.670
in the unshared content as well now a
note on shared element views like a

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680
note on shared element views like a
 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.380
note on shared element views like a
shared element transitions excuse me you

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390
shared element transitions excuse me you
 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.390
shared element transitions excuse me you
can't actually share a view between two

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400
can't actually share a view between two
 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.680
can't actually share a view between two
activities you can't pick up an image

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690
activities you can't pick up an image
 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.360
activities you can't pick up an image
view from one activity and supplant it

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370
view from one activity and supplant it
 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.550
view from one activity and supplant it
into the other one and so what we do as

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560
into the other one and so what we do as
 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.580
into the other one and so what we do as
many animation things API is do is kind

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590
many animation things API is do is kind
 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.530
many animation things API is do is kind
of like fake it allow you to give the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540
of like fake it allow you to give the
 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.520
of like fake it allow you to give the
appearance of what that's what's

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530
appearance of what that's what's
 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.990
appearance of what that's what's
happening while still you know

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000
happening while still you know
 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.460
happening while still you know
maintaining your even one activity or

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470
maintaining your even one activity or
 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.590
maintaining your even one activity or
the other so the way we do it is when

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600
the other so the way we do it is when
 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.330
the other so the way we do it is when
you click on an image in the source

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340
you click on an image in the source
 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.970
you click on an image in the source
activity we record some information

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980
activity we record some information
 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.040
activity we record some information
about that view and a small amount of

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050
about that view and a small amount of
 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.540
about that view and a small amount of
information like the position and bounds

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550
information like the position and bounds
 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.340
information like the position and bounds
and a few other things and then we pass

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350
and a few other things and then we pass
 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.050
and a few other things and then we pass
that information over and to the

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060
that information over and to the
 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.990
that information over and to the
destination activity so we then launch

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000
destination activity so we then launch
 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.580
destination activity so we then launch
the destination activity but don't show

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590
the destination activity but don't show
 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.690
the destination activity but don't show
anything just yet

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700
anything just yet
 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.960
anything just yet
and then we layout and measure and all

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970
and then we layout and measure and all
 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.490
and then we layout and measure and all
the views in the destination activity

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500
the views in the destination activity
 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.110
the views in the destination activity
and work out where that shared view

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120
and work out where that shared view
 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.810
and work out where that shared view
wants to end up then we do something a

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820
wants to end up then we do something a
 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.790
wants to end up then we do something a
bit sneaky we actually we've applied

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800
bit sneaky we actually we've applied
 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.860
bit sneaky we actually we've applied
transforms to the shared element in the

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870
transforms to the shared element in the
 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.110

to appear so then we simply run

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870
to appear so then we simply run
 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.650
to appear so then we simply run
animations to move the share element

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660
animations to move the share element
 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.170

looks like you share the view from one

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030
looks like you share the view from one
 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.240
looks like you share the view from one
activity to the other that it hasn't so

activity to the other that it hasn't so
 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.100
activity to the other that it hasn't so
this is important to remember that

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110
this is important to remember that
 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.080
this is important to remember that
everything happens in the destination

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090
everything happens in the destination
 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.900
everything happens in the destination
activity you're never actually changing

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910
activity you're never actually changing
 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.100
activity you're never actually changing
the view in the source activity other

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110
the view in the source activity other
 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:15.070
the view in the source activity other
than hiding it so shared element and

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080
than hiding it so shared element and
 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.350
than hiding it so shared element and
content transitions can run and a number

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360
content transitions can run and a number
 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.270
content transitions can run and a number
of points so there's a kind of a life

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280
of points so there's a kind of a life
 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.890
of points so there's a kind of a life
cycle to think about here so when you go

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900
cycle to think about here so when you go
 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.090
cycle to think about here so when you go
from one screen to the other so when you

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100
from one screen to the other so when you
 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.650
from one screen to the other so when you
call startactivity you have the

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660
call startactivity you have the
 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.810
call startactivity you have the
opportunity to run and transitions on

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820
opportunity to run and transitions on
 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.360
opportunity to run and transitions on
the exiting source activity and on the

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.370
the exiting source activity and on the
 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.550
the exiting source activity and on the
entering destination activity and then

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560
entering destination activity and then
 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.350
entering destination activity and then
on the way back you can also then

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360
on the way back you can also then
 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.020
on the way back you can also then
animate on the return and re-enter so

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.030
animate on the return and re-enter so
 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.100
animate on the return and re-enter so
these are the four points you can hook

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110
these are the four points you can hook
 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.770
these are the four points you can hook
into and it's worth noting that these

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:38.780
into and it's worth noting that these
 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.200
into and it's worth noting that these
kind of come in pairs and such that if

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210
kind of come in pairs and such that if
 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.180
kind of come in pairs and such that if
you were to set an exit transition from

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190
you were to set an exit transition from
 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.620
you were to set an exit transition from
the source activity so you know do

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:44.630
the source activity so you know do
 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.700
the source activity so you know do
something with the views on the way out

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:45.710
something with the views on the way out
 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.890
something with the views on the way out
well by default if you don't specify a

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:47.900
well by default if you don't specify a
 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.750
well by default if you don't specify a
different reenter and it will just run

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:49.760
different reenter and it will just run
 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.659
different reenter and it will just run
the same transition and in Reverse so

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:52.669
the same transition and in Reverse so
 

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:53.770
the same transition and in Reverse so
you but worth bearing in mind that's

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:53.780
you but worth bearing in mind that's
 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.100
you but worth bearing in mind that's
what's going on there so that's in a

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.110
what's going on there so that's in a
 

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.870
what's going on there so that's in a
nutshell what the transitions API is

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:58.880
nutshell what the transitions API is
 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.630
nutshell what the transitions API is
trying to do to give you an example of

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:00.640
trying to do to give you an example of
 

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.190
trying to do to give you an example of
how to do it Ben's going to walk you

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:03.200
how to do it Ben's going to walk you
 

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.840
how to do it Ben's going to walk you
through an example application that

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:04.850
through an example application that
 

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.820
through an example application that
implements these API

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:06.830
implements these API
 

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.870
implements these API
Thank You Nick so as you saw we had a

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:10.880
Thank You Nick so as you saw we had a
 

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.870
Thank You Nick so as you saw we had a
couple of transitions going on there and

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:12.880
couple of transitions going on there and
 

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.210
couple of transitions going on there and
let's see what we're going to claim it

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:15.220
let's see what we're going to claim it
 

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.490
let's see what we're going to claim it
we will have an application having a

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:18.500
we will have an application having a
 

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.219
we will have an application having a
master activity and a detail activity

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:20.229
master activity and a detail activity
 

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:23.200
master activity and a detail activity
and once you tap on one of the items it

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.210
and once you tap on one of the items it
 

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.540
and once you tap on one of the items it
will move the image and perform a couple

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:25.550
will move the image and perform a couple
 

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.909
will move the image and perform a couple
of other transitions so let's get

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919
of other transitions so let's get
 

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:31.180
of other transitions so let's get
started we have the app we have our app

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:31.190
started we have the app we have our app
 

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.360
started we have the app we have our app
we are before we actually got started

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:34.370
we are before we actually got started
 

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.760
we are before we actually got started
with the with the transitions this is

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:36.770
with the with the transitions this is
 

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.500
with the with the transitions this is
what the system gives us we type of

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:38.510
what the system gives us we type of
 

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.839
what the system gives us we type of
phone and we use and the detail

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:40.849
phone and we use and the detail
 

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:42.790
phone and we use and the detail
activities slides and fades in pretty

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800
activities slides and fades in pretty
 

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.940
activities slides and fades in pretty
cool but in order to do the transitions

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:45.950
cool but in order to do the transitions
 

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.950
cool but in order to do the transitions
use the transitions API what we want to

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:47.960
use the transitions API what we want to
 

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.800
use the transitions API what we want to
do is we first enable the window

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:50.810
do is we first enable the window
 

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.240
do is we first enable the window
activity transitions within our app

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.250
activity transitions within our app

that material on lollipop and plus so

00:09:05.689 --> 00:09:05.699
that material on lollipop and plus so
 

00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:07.910
that material on lollipop and plus so
once we got this we can go through the

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920
once we got this we can go through the
 

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.710
once we got this we can go through the
next step and do it the shared element

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720
next step and do it the shared element
 

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.230
next step and do it the shared element
transition for the image view in order

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240
transition for the image view in order
 

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.840
transition for the image view in order
to do this we set a transition name on

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:14.850
to do this we set a transition name on
 

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.730
to do this we set a transition name on
both the starting and the target view

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.740
both the starting and the target view
 

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.180
both the starting and the target view
and remember those have to be or should

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:20.190
and remember those have to be or should
 

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.559
and remember those have to be or should
be at least unique for the view

00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:21.569
be at least unique for the view
 

00:09:21.569 --> 00:09:23.180
be at least unique for the view
hierarchies in order to avoid a couple

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.190
hierarchies in order to avoid a couple
 

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.439
hierarchies in order to avoid a couple
of issues that we will cover later on

00:09:26.439 --> 00:09:26.449
of issues that we will cover later on
 

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:30.590
of issues that we will cover later on
after we have taken a look into this we

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600
after we have taken a look into this we
 

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.420
after we have taken a look into this we
need to tell the system how to actually

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:32.430
need to tell the system how to actually
 

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.819
need to tell the system how to actually
deal with the shared element because as

00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:34.829
deal with the shared element because as
 

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:35.480
deal with the shared element because as
we just learned

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:35.490
we just learned
 

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.460
we just learned
Sharyn key element is something that

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.470
Sharyn key element is something that
 

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.439
Sharyn key element is something that
happens within the receiving Zoar the

00:09:39.439 --> 00:09:39.449
happens within the receiving Zoar the
 

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:41.360
happens within the receiving Zoar the
detail activity so we have to tell the

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:41.370
detail activity so we have to tell the
 

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.030
detail activity so we have to tell the
system that at the point where we

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040
system that at the point where we
 

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.460
system that at the point where we
actually started a new activity that a

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.470
actually started a new activity that a
 

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.139
actually started a new activity that a
couple of things have changed we do this

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:48.149
couple of things have changed we do this
 

00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:50.360
couple of things have changed we do this
by calling the make scene transition

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.370
by calling the make scene transition
 

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.329
by calling the make scene transition
animation pass it the image that we want

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339
animation pass it the image that we want
 

00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:55.460
animation pass it the image that we want
to share as well as the identifier for

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:55.470
to share as well as the identifier for
 

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.139
to share as well as the identifier for
tag of view so the name that we just

00:09:57.139 --> 00:09:57.149
tag of view so the name that we just
 

00:09:57.149 --> 00:09:59.360
tag of view so the name that we just
said on that pretty cool pretty

00:09:59.360 --> 00:09:59.370
said on that pretty cool pretty
 

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.439
said on that pretty cool pretty
straightforward and awesome to use after

00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:03.449
straightforward and awesome to use after
 

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:06.259
straightforward and awesome to use after
that we add the exiting transition for

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:06.269
that we add the exiting transition for
 

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:08.059
that we add the exiting transition for
the grid which is the explode that we

00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:08.069
the grid which is the explode that we
 

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:10.960
the grid which is the explode that we
just saw which is probably one of the

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:10.970
just saw which is probably one of the
 

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.730
just saw which is probably one of the
things that you should think about if

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740
things that you should think about if
 

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.620
things that you should think about if
you actually want to do it because it

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:15.630
you actually want to do it because it
 

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.480
you actually want to do it because it
can confuse users it can be very handy

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.490
can confuse users it can be very handy
 

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.100
can confuse users it can be very handy
as well on the other hand so make sure

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.110
as well on the other hand so make sure
 

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.960
as well on the other hand so make sure
that you don't just throw explodes in

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:20.970
that you don't just throw explodes in
 

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.949
that you don't just throw explodes in
everywhere because it can be not helpful

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959
everywhere because it can be not helpful
 

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:27.559
everywhere because it can be not helpful
on the other hand as well so to do this

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:27.569
on the other hand as well so to do this
 

00:10:27.569 --> 00:10:29.780
on the other hand as well so to do this
we create a transition and get

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:29.790
we create a transition and get
 

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.420
we create a transition and get
transitions folder called grid exit and

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:32.430
transitions folder called grid exit and
 

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.180
transitions folder called grid exit and
we just say explode and that's it from

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:35.190
we just say explode and that's it from
 

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.730
we just say explode and that's it from
the Declaration of the transition pretty

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740
the Declaration of the transition pretty
 

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.160
the Declaration of the transition pretty
straightforward again we then set that

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:40.170
straightforward again we then set that
 

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.009
straightforward again we then set that
in we then have to declare the window

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:43.019
in we then have to declare the window
 

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:45.230
in we then have to declare the window
exit transition within our homes

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240
exit transition within our homes
 

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.100
exit transition within our homes
activity home activities theme and as we

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.110
activity home activities theme and as we
 

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.540
activity home activities theme and as we
just learned this will be replayed

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:50.550
just learned this will be replayed
 

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.240
just learned this will be replayed
reversed on the way back in when the

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.250
reversed on the way back in when the
 

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.809
reversed on the way back in when the
activity has its reenter transition when

00:10:56.809 --> 00:10:56.819
activity has its reenter transition when
 

00:10:56.819 --> 00:10:59.920
activity has its reenter transition when
we press back on from the do tha video

00:10:59.920 --> 00:10:59.930
we press back on from the do tha video
 

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.019
we press back on from the do tha video
let's go and take the next step for the

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:03.029
let's go and take the next step for the
 

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.389
let's go and take the next step for the
detail activity we also want the content

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399
detail activity we also want the content
 

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.550
detail activity we also want the content
that is not shared

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560
that is not shared
 

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.280
that is not shared
we slide to slide in from the bottom you

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.290
we slide to slide in from the bottom you
 

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.310
we slide to slide in from the bottom you
don't jet you can't just create the

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320
don't jet you can't just create the
 

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.960
don't jet you can't just create the
transitions from XML but you also can do

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:13.970
transitions from XML but you also can do
 

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.670
transitions from XML but you also can do
this directly within code so let's take

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680
this directly within code so let's take
 

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.400
this directly within code so let's take
a look how you can do that we just

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:18.410
a look how you can do that we just
 

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.890
a look how you can do that we just
create a new slide transition we want to

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:20.900
create a new slide transition we want to
 

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.360
create a new slide transition we want to
slide have the content slide in from the

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:22.370
slide have the content slide in from the
 

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.070
slide have the content slide in from the
bottom and we want to have it ax enter

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:24.080
bottom and we want to have it ax enter
 

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.019
bottom and we want to have it ax enter
at full speed and then ease in all the

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:26.029
at full speed and then ease in all the
 

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:27.850
at full speed and then ease in all the
way up until it reaches a resting point

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:27.860
way up until it reaches a resting point
 

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.030
way up until it reaches a resting point
to do this we inflate an interpolator to

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040
to do this we inflate an interpolator to
 

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.780
to do this we inflate an interpolator to
do exactly that

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:31.790
do exactly that
 

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.840
do exactly that
then on the window of productivity we

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:34.850
then on the window of productivity we
 

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.730
then on the window of productivity we
set the enter transition to be the

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:36.740
set the enter transition to be the
 

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.160
set the enter transition to be the
transition we just created this can be a

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:39.170
transition we just created this can be a
 

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.840
transition we just created this can be a
lot more complex than this if you want

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:40.850
lot more complex than this if you want
 

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.940
lot more complex than this if you want
to but to get started just adding one

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:42.950
to but to get started just adding one
 

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.200
to but to get started just adding one
transition seeing if you actually got

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.210
transition seeing if you actually got
 

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.120
transition seeing if you actually got
the right things and in place works

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.130
the right things and in place works
 

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.030
the right things and in place works
pretty well since we are already in the

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040
pretty well since we are already in the
 

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.950
pretty well since we are already in the
motion of getting things feel more

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:50.960
motion of getting things feel more
 

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.780
motion of getting things feel more
natural by having them enter it very

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:52.790
natural by having them enter it very
 

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.269
natural by having them enter it very
quickly let's take a look at another

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279
quickly let's take a look at another
 

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.560
quickly let's take a look at another
thing that Nick already mentioned it's

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:56.570
thing that Nick already mentioned it's
 

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.320
thing that Nick already mentioned it's
curved motion so usually you have just

00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.330
curved motion so usually you have just
 

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.300
curved motion so usually you have just
one linear motion of the shared element

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.310
one linear motion of the shared element
 

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.550
one linear motion of the shared element
view but we want to have this motion in

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560
view but we want to have this motion in
 

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.990
view but we want to have this motion in
the end so that it feels while you go

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000
the end so that it feels while you go
 

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.360
the end so that it feels while you go
out while the active while the well well

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.370
out while the active while the well well
 

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.519
out while the active while the well well
the views growing it should also have a

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:09.529
the views growing it should also have a
 

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.140
the views growing it should also have a
curved path that it follows to make it

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:11.150
curved path that it follows to make it
 

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.510
curved path that it follows to make it
feel more natural let's take a look at

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:13.520
feel more natural let's take a look at
 

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.220
feel more natural let's take a look at
one of the transitions that we use there

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:15.230
one of the transitions that we use there
 

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.750
one of the transitions that we use there
we have a transition set which is a

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760
we have a transition set which is a
 

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.010
we have a transition set which is a
which is a collection of different

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:21.020
which is a collection of different
 

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.660
which is a collection of different
transitions that will be run at a point

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:22.670
transitions that will be run at a point
 

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.840
transitions that will be run at a point
in the animation and we basically just

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:25.850
in the animation and we basically just
 

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.520
in the animation and we basically just
have to do this on the set bounds we

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:27.530
have to do this on the set bounds we
 

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.500
have to do this on the set bounds we
just say we want to add an arc motion to

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:29.510
just say we want to add an arc motion to
 

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.680
just say we want to add an arc motion to
that pretty straightforward again and it

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:32.690
that pretty straightforward again and it
 

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.990
that pretty straightforward again and it
helps to get exactly this this done you

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000
helps to get exactly this this done you
 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.300
helps to get exactly this this done you
can also set maximum minimum angles on

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.310
can also set maximum minimum angles on
 

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.590
can also set maximum minimum angles on
that to make sure that the user actually

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600
that to make sure that the user actually
 

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.570
that to make sure that the user actually
sees what's going on

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:40.580
sees what's going on
 

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.540
sees what's going on
you shouldn't exaggerate like like Nick

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:43.550
you shouldn't exaggerate like like Nick
 

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.060
you shouldn't exaggerate like like Nick
earlier said so but for development

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.070
earlier said so but for development
 

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.290
earlier said so but for development
purposes this can be pretty handy so

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:50.300
purposes this can be pretty handy so
 

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.940
purposes this can be pretty handy so
those are all built-in transitions

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:51.950
those are all built-in transitions
 

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.560
those are all built-in transitions
let's take a look at a thing that we can

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:53.570
let's take a look at a thing that we can
 

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.949
let's take a look at a thing that we can
do with getting into custom transitions

00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959
do with getting into custom transitions
 

00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:58.750
do with getting into custom transitions
we also want to share the detail text so

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760
we also want to share the detail text so
 

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.180
we also want to share the detail text so
the title is the author of the picture

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.190
the title is the author of the picture
 

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.490
the title is the author of the picture
and we did a couple of things there

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:03.500
and we did a couple of things there
 

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.160
and we did a couple of things there
other than just growing just just

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.170
other than just growing just just
 

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.160
other than just growing just just
sharing that we also grow it and to do

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.170
sharing that we also grow it and to do
 

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.829
sharing that we also grow it and to do
this from the declaration point of view

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839
this from the declaration point of view
 

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:13.660
this from the declaration point of view
we just go back to the transition that

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:13.670
we just go back to the transition that
 

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.610
we just go back to the transition that
we already had add another transition

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:15.620
we already had add another transition
 

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.400
we already had add another transition
add a target to both of the transition

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:18.410
add a target to both of the transition
 

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.020
add a target to both of the transition
to

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.030
to
 

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.570
to
have the initial transitions that only

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:21.580
have the initial transitions that only
 

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.720
have the initial transitions that only
target the photo that we already shared

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:23.730
target the photo that we already shared
 

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:28.440
target the photo that we already shared
then we go and add a second transition

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:28.450
then we go and add a second transition
 

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.110
then we go and add a second transition
set targeting the author that we want to

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120
set targeting the author that we want to
 

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.410
set targeting the author that we want to
share as well and add a text resize

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.420
share as well and add a text resize
 

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.540
share as well and add a text resize
transition to that which is a custom

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:36.550
transition to that which is a custom
 

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.000
transition to that which is a custom
transition that George will cover in a

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.010
transition that George will cover in a
 

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.200
transition that George will cover in a
minute and then of course we need to

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.210
minute and then of course we need to
 

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.700
minute and then of course we need to
tell the system what's going on on that

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:44.710
tell the system what's going on on that
 

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.800
tell the system what's going on on that
things have changed so far we changed we

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:46.810
things have changed so far we changed we
 

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.270
things have changed so far we changed we
shared the image and it's Hargett

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:48.280
shared the image and it's Hargett
 

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.950
shared the image and it's Hargett
directly if you only have one share

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:49.960
directly if you only have one share
 

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.290
directly if you only have one share
element this is the right is a good way

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:52.300
element this is the right is a good way
 

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.750
element this is the right is a good way
to actually get started without it to

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:54.760
to actually get started without it to
 

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.420
to actually get started without it to
share this information with the detail

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:57.430
share this information with the detail
 

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.240
share this information with the detail
activity if you have multiple share

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.250
activity if you have multiple share
 

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.910
activity if you have multiple share
elements though you want to have pairs

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920
elements though you want to have pairs
 

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.680
elements though you want to have pairs
which can be created in separate ways

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:04.690
which can be created in separate ways
 

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.270
which can be created in separate ways
but this is one of the ways you just

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:06.280
but this is one of the ways you just
 

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.680
but this is one of the ways you just
create a pair which basically all

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:07.690
create a pair which basically all
 

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:08.820
create a pair which basically all
contains the same information it

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:08.830
contains the same information it
 

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.310
contains the same information it
contains the detail we the the starting

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320
contains the detail we the the starting
 

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.130
contains the detail we the the starting
new as well as the target transition

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.140
new as well as the target transition
 

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.840
new as well as the target transition
name and then instead of having this

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:17.850
name and then instead of having this
 

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.460
name and then instead of having this
Sonia here you just passed those two

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:20.470
Sonia here you just passed those two
 

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.550
Sonia here you just passed those two
pairs in here and start the activity as

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560
pairs in here and start the activity as
 

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.770
pairs in here and start the activity as
is and after all this is done this is

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:28.780
is and after all this is done this is
 

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.040
is and after all this is done this is
the nice transitions that you get and

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:31.050
the nice transitions that you get and
 

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:36.150
the nice transitions that you get and
with that let's take a look behind the

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160
with that let's take a look behind the
 

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.640
with that let's take a look behind the
curtain all right how's that fire hose

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:38.650
curtain all right how's that fire hose
 

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.820
curtain all right how's that fire hose
everyone good let's let's drink some

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:41.830
everyone good let's let's drink some
 

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.460
everyone good let's let's drink some
more all right let's talk about some

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:44.470
more all right let's talk about some
 

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.650
more all right let's talk about some
making your own transitions now we saw

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:46.660
making your own transitions now we saw
 

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.140
making your own transitions now we saw
the built-in ones change bounds change

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.150
the built-in ones change bounds change
 

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.030
the built-in ones change bounds change
transform those ones those are great

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040
transform those ones those are great
 

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.370
transform those ones those are great
basic transitions but if you want to

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:53.380
basic transitions but if you want to
 

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.560
basic transitions but if you want to
change the text size for example it's

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:55.570
change the text size for example it's
 

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.180
change the text size for example it's
not built-in we have to do that

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:57.190
not built-in we have to do that
 

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.070
not built-in we have to do that
ourselves so let's see how we go about

00:14:59.070 --> 00:14:59.080
ourselves so let's see how we go about
 

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.110
ourselves so let's see how we go about
making it let's make this resize text

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120
making it let's make this resize text
 

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.860
making it let's make this resize text
transition all right so we need to

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:04.870
transition all right so we need to
 

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.380
transition all right so we need to
capture some data right and we need of

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:07.390
capture some data right and we need of
 

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.450
capture some data right and we need of
course the font size that's obvious

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:09.460
course the font size that's obvious
 

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.530
course the font size that's obvious
right we need to capture the font size

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:10.540
right we need to capture the font size
 

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.700
right we need to capture the font size
at the beginning caption the font size

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:11.710
at the beginning caption the font size
 

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.380
at the beginning caption the font size
at the end and we also need some other

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:13.390
at the end and we also need some other
 

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.580
at the end and we also need some other
data but when we return the data set

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:17.590
data but when we return the data set
 

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.650
data but when we return the data set
that we're going to track in our

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:19.660
that we're going to track in our
 

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.660
that we're going to track in our
transition we only want we only care

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:21.670
transition we only want we only care
 

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.070
transition we only want we only care
about the font size because if the other

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:23.080
about the font size because if the other
 

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.600
about the font size because if the other
stuff changes Relays the balance changes

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:24.610
stuff changes Relays the balance changes
 

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.180
stuff changes Relays the balance changes
only on your text view we're not going

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:27.190
only on your text view we're not going
 

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.500
only on your text view we're not going
to do any transition on that

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:28.510
to do any transition on that
 

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.420
to do any transition on that
we're only transitioning when the text

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:30.430
we're only transitioning when the text
 

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.639
we're only transitioning when the text
size changes so we just ignore the rest

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:32.649
size changes so we just ignore the rest
 

00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:34.530
size changes so we just ignore the rest
data we still want to capture it so

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:34.540
data we still want to capture it so
 

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.720
data we still want to capture it so
that's why we have those those pieces of

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:36.730
that's why we have those those pieces of
 

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.280
that's why we have those those pieces of
information that tag that we're going to

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:38.290
information that tag that we're going to
 

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.309
information that tag that we're going to
use in our transition values but we just

00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319
use in our transition values but we just
 

00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:43.199
use in our transition values but we just
don't want to keep that for the

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:43.209
don't want to keep that for the
 

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:45.780
don't want to keep that for the
transition API for the transition

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:45.790
transition API for the transition
 

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.199
transition API for the transition
framework so when we capture our start

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:49.209
framework so when we capture our start
 

00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:50.759
framework so when we capture our start
values and then values you remember this

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:50.769
values and then values you remember this
 

00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:53.009
values and then values you remember this
from what Nick said we want to capture

00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:53.019
from what Nick said we want to capture
 

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:54.929
from what Nick said we want to capture
them and we said this is the same thing

00:15:54.929 --> 00:15:54.939
them and we said this is the same thing
 

00:15:54.939 --> 00:15:56.249
them and we said this is the same thing
and both the start in the end we have a

00:15:56.249 --> 00:15:56.259
and both the start in the end we have a
 

00:15:56.259 --> 00:16:00.389
and both the start in the end we have a
common function to do and first thing we

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399
common function to do and first thing we
 

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:01.889
common function to do and first thing we
have to do is we can just throw away

00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:01.899
have to do is we can just throw away
 

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:03.239
have to do is we can just throw away
anything that's not in text view right

00:16:03.239 --> 00:16:03.249
anything that's not in text view right
 

00:16:03.249 --> 00:16:05.819
anything that's not in text view right
we're only animating text views so

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:05.829
we're only animating text views so
 

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:08.220
we're only animating text views so
anything else we just ignore of course

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:08.230
anything else we just ignore of course
 

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.569
anything else we just ignore of course
we want to capture the font size the

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:09.579
we want to capture the font size the
 

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:11.970
we want to capture the font size the
text size here and we also want to

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:11.980
text size here and we also want to
 

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.290
text size here and we also want to
capture some other data and I just stuck

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:13.300
capture some other data and I just stuck
 

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.540
capture some other data and I just stuck
this all in its own class and to kind of

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:15.550
this all in its own class and to kind of
 

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.639
this all in its own class and to kind of
hide that information but it's basic

00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:17.649
hide that information but it's basic
 

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:19.230
hide that information but it's basic
things like the bounds of the text view

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240
things like the bounds of the text view
 

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.400
things like the bounds of the text view
because we're gonna need that for the

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:20.410
because we're gonna need that for the
 

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.980
because we're gonna need that for the
animation all right when you animate

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:22.990
animation all right when you animate
 

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.160
animation all right when you animate
texts what do we do are we gonna animate

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:26.170
texts what do we do are we gonna animate
 

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.980
texts what do we do are we gonna animate
the font size well if we do that we're

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:28.990
the font size well if we do that we're
 

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.439
the font size well if we do that we're
gonna thrash our font cache right every

00:16:31.439 --> 00:16:31.449
gonna thrash our font cache right every
 

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:33.239
gonna thrash our font cache right every
font size between the start and the end

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:33.249
font size between the start and the end
 

00:16:33.249 --> 00:16:35.069
font size between the start and the end
is going to be used and created in our

00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079
is going to be used and created in our
 

00:16:35.079 --> 00:16:36.689
is going to be used and created in our
font cache and we're gonna have like

00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:36.699
font cache and we're gonna have like
 

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:40.829
font cache and we're gonna have like
font size 26 point two eight one and you

00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839
font size 26 point two eight one and you
 

00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:42.119
font size 26 point two eight one and you
know we're never gonna use that again

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:42.129
know we're never gonna use that again
 

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:43.829
know we're never gonna use that again
it's just gonna thrash our font cache we

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839
it's just gonna thrash our font cache we
 

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:45.179
it's just gonna thrash our font cache we
don't want to do that so what we're

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:45.189
don't want to do that so what we're
 

00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:46.350
don't want to do that so what we're
gonna do is we're going to capture a

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.360
gonna do is we're going to capture a
 

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.059
gonna do is we're going to capture a
bitmap at the start and a bitmap at the

00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:48.069
bitmap at the start and a bitmap at the
 

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:51.419
bitmap at the start and a bitmap at the
end and we're gonna animate so here if

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:51.429
end and we're gonna animate so here if
 

00:16:51.429 --> 00:16:53.850
end and we're gonna animate so here if
we if we animate just the start it looks

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:53.860
we if we animate just the start it looks
 

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.460
we if we animate just the start it looks
pretty terrible right you see that thing

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:56.470
pretty terrible right you see that thing
 

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.489
pretty terrible right you see that thing
blown up from the beginning and also if

00:16:59.489 --> 00:16:59.499
blown up from the beginning and also if
 

00:16:59.499 --> 00:17:00.809
blown up from the beginning and also if
you animate just from the large size

00:17:00.809 --> 00:17:00.819
you animate just from the large size
 

00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:03.689
you animate just from the large size
down you end up with a little bit of

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:03.699
down you end up with a little bit of
 

00:17:03.699 --> 00:17:06.269
down you end up with a little bit of
kerning error in the final text view and

00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:06.279
kerning error in the final text view and
 

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:07.799
kerning error in the final text view and
you might not see it here on this on

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:07.809
you might not see it here on this on
 

00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:09.569
you might not see it here on this on
this slide but you're definitely going

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:09.579
this slide but you're definitely going
 

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.069
this slide but you're definitely going
to see it when you're looking at the

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079
to see it when you're looking at the
 

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.480
to see it when you're looking at the
phone and you really don't want to see

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:12.490
phone and you really don't want to see
 

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.939
phone and you really don't want to see
your user user to see that that effect

00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:14.949
your user user to see that that effect
 

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:17.730
your user user to see that that effect
you want to see a perfect transition so

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:17.740
you want to see a perfect transition so
 

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.870
you want to see a perfect transition so
instead of this what we're going to do

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880
instead of this what we're going to do
 

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.110
instead of this what we're going to do
is we're gonna animate piecewise so we

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120
is we're gonna animate piecewise so we
 

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.730
is we're gonna animate piecewise so we
animate a little bit from the start and

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:23.740
animate a little bit from the start and
 

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.189
animate a little bit from the start and
you don't really see that blown up image

00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199
you don't really see that blown up image
 

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:29.130
you don't really see that blown up image
right and then we're going to swap it

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.140
right and then we're going to swap it
 

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.230
right and then we're going to swap it
out for the final image just scale down

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240
out for the final image just scale down
 

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.180
out for the final image just scale down
and then we're gonna animate the rest of

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.190
and then we're gonna animate the rest of
 

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.450
and then we're gonna animate the rest of
the way and because it's done during the

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:36.460
the way and because it's done during the
 

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.360
the way and because it's done during the
motion nobody will see that animation

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:39.370
motion nobody will see that animation
 

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.039
motion nobody will see that animation
that change that swapped there in the

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:41.049
that change that swapped there in the
 

00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:44.840
that change that swapped there in the
middle okay let's see how we do that

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:44.850
middle okay let's see how we do that
 

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.120
middle okay let's see how we do that
okay when we create our animator first

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.130
okay when we create our animator first
 

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.740
okay when we create our animator first
thing we have to do of course is to

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:48.750
thing we have to do of course is to
 

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.810
thing we have to do of course is to
capture that we use our start values and

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820
capture that we use our start values and
 

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.169
capture that we use our start values and
end values but here we are checking this

00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179
end values but here we are checking this
 

00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:56.029
end values but here we are checking this
start values it's or null what does no

00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039
start values it's or null what does no
 

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:58.419
start values it's or null what does no
mean it means the view didn't exist

00:17:58.419 --> 00:17:58.429
mean it means the view didn't exist
 

00:17:58.429 --> 00:18:00.590
mean it means the view didn't exist
difficut exists at the beginning or at

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600
difficut exists at the beginning or at
 

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.950
difficut exists at the beginning or at
the end we don't want to animate sighs

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960
the end we don't want to animate sighs
 

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.060
the end we don't want to animate sighs
that's for fade right that's for the

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.070
that's for fade right that's for the
 

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.130
that's for fade right that's for the
other transitions okay next thing we

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140
other transitions okay next thing we
 

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.720
other transitions okay next thing we
have to do of course is capture the

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:11.730
have to do of course is capture the
 

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.880
have to do of course is capture the
start bitmap right so we just capture

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:13.890
start bitmap right so we just capture
 

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.409
start bitmap right so we just capture
that bitmap that's where that extra data

00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419
that bitmap that's where that extra data
 

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:17.690
that bitmap that's where that extra data
is useful and we also have to capture

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700
is useful and we also have to capture
 

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.810
is useful and we also have to capture
the end state bitmap and then of course

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820
the end state bitmap and then of course
 

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.590
the end state bitmap and then of course
we have to say don't text you don't draw

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600
we have to say don't text you don't draw
 

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.570
we have to say don't text you don't draw
yourself set yourself to transparent all

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580
yourself set yourself to transparent all
 

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.149
yourself set yourself to transparent all
that text stuff make it transparent we

00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159
that text stuff make it transparent we
 

00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:30.980
that text stuff make it transparent we
don't want you to draw it because what

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:30.990
don't want you to draw it because what
 

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.279
don't want you to draw it because what
we're gonna do is create a drawable with

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:34.289
we're gonna do is create a drawable with
 

00:18:34.289 --> 00:18:35.720
we're gonna do is create a drawable with
those bitmaps that we just captured

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:35.730
those bitmaps that we just captured
 

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.950
those bitmaps that we just captured
that's gonna do the swapping for us all

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960
that's gonna do the swapping for us all
 

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.720
that's gonna do the swapping for us all
right so we need to animate some things

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:41.730
right so we need to animate some things
 

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.399
right so we need to animate some things
on that drawable one of them is the font

00:18:43.399 --> 00:18:43.409
on that drawable one of them is the font
 

00:18:43.409 --> 00:18:45.260
on that drawable one of them is the font
size we're gonna have this font size

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:45.270
size we're gonna have this font size
 

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.430
size we're gonna have this font size
that we're gonna animate on the drawable

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440
that we're gonna animate on the drawable
 

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.320
that we're gonna animate on the drawable
and we also have to animate those other

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:48.330
and we also have to animate those other
 

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.610
and we also have to animate those other
things that all that other data I

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620
things that all that other data I
 

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.110
things that all that other data I
captured but we need to know that stuff

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120
captured but we need to know that stuff
 

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.750
captured but we need to know that stuff
so we we get property values holders for

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760
so we we get property values holders for
 

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.460
so we we get property values holders for
those and then we create the animator

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:55.470
those and then we create the animator
 

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.399
those and then we create the animator
right and then we're all set to return

00:18:58.399 --> 00:18:58.409
right and then we're all set to return
 

00:18:58.409 --> 00:19:02.750
right and then we're all set to return
right everyone not quite remember what

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760
right everyone not quite remember what
 

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.240
right everyone not quite remember what
we just did we set it to be invisible

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.250
we just did we set it to be invisible
 

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.960
we just did we set it to be invisible
they no no text when the animation is

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:08.970
they no no text when the animation is
 

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.549
they no no text when the animation is
done we want it to go back to the normal

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559
done we want it to go back to the normal
 

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:12.320
done we want it to go back to the normal
state so we set the text color back to

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:12.330
state so we set the text color back to
 

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.600
state so we set the text color back to
normal and we remove that overlay we

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.610
normal and we remove that overlay we
 

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.560
normal and we remove that overlay we
just added all right so we're all set

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:18.570
just added all right so we're all set
 

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.750
just added all right so we're all set
our transition looks great we're all set

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760
our transition looks great we're all set
 

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.539
our transition looks great we're all set
let's put it in an activity transition

00:19:22.539 --> 00:19:22.549
let's put it in an activity transition
 

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:27.039
let's put it in an activity transition
all right what does it look like

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:27.049
 
 

00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:33.049
 
holy-moly did you do this all right no

00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059
holy-moly did you do this all right no
 

00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:34.010
holy-moly did you do this all right no
no okay

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020
no okay
 

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.720
no okay
remember what happened what what Nick

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:35.730
remember what happened what what Nick
 

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.330
remember what happened what what Nick
was saying about this the values are

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340
was saying about this the values are
 

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.529
was saying about this the values are
captured in the destination activity and

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:41.539
captured in the destination activity and
 

00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:43.250
captured in the destination activity and
when the values are captured in

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260
when the values are captured in
 

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.399
when the values are captured in
destination activity textview doesn't

00:19:46.399 --> 00:19:46.409
destination activity textview doesn't
 

00:19:46.409 --> 00:19:48.140
destination activity textview doesn't
have the text size of the source

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.150
have the text size of the source
 

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.930
have the text size of the source
activities text so it doesn't even know

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940
activities text so it doesn't even know
 

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.520
activities text so it doesn't even know
that it was there it doesn't know what

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:52.530
that it was there it doesn't know what
 

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.950
that it was there it doesn't know what
that font size was so what we have to do

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960
that font size was so what we have to do
 

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.600
that font size was so what we have to do
is send that along as extra data now

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:57.610
is send that along as extra data now
 

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.750
is send that along as extra data now
the activity activity transitions system

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760
the activity activity transitions system
 

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.970
the activity activity transitions system
will send the basic stuff for you it'll

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:02.980
will send the basic stuff for you it'll
 

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.890
will send the basic stuff for you it'll
send you position size and image scale

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:07.900
send you position size and image scale
 

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.060
send you position size and image scale
right because those are very common

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:09.070
right because those are very common
 

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.170
right because those are very common
things and those are the things that are

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:10.180
things and those are the things that are
 

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.820
things and those are the things that are
built into the system those transitions

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:11.830
built into the system those transitions
 

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.320
built into the system those transitions
are built into the system but the other

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:13.330
are built into the system but the other
 

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.060
are built into the system but the other
stuff anything that you need to animate

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.070
stuff anything that you need to animate
 

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.240
stuff anything that you need to animate
you're gonna have to send along as well

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:17.250
you're gonna have to send along as well
 

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.450
you're gonna have to send along as well
so we put those in as intent extras

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460
so we put those in as intent extras
 

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.450
so we put those in as intent extras
that's easy enough and then we get that

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:24.460
that's easy enough and then we get that
 

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.870
that's easy enough and then we get that
intend extra in the target activity and

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880
intend extra in the target activity and
 

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.870
intend extra in the target activity and
we get the our font size and then we

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880
we get the our font size and then we
 

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.880
we get the our font size and then we
call this shared element callback the

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:32.890
call this shared element callback the
 

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.380
call this shared element callback the
shared element callback is where you put

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.390
shared element callback is where you put
 

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:38.310
shared element callback is where you put
all the really complex part of your

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320
all the really complex part of your
 

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.720
all the really complex part of your
activity transition this is a callback

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:39.730
activity transition this is a callback
 

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.180
activity transition this is a callback
that has lots of extra stuff for you to

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.190
that has lots of extra stuff for you to
 

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.920
that has lots of extra stuff for you to
hook into to do the little tweaking that

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:43.930
hook into to do the little tweaking that
 

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.910
hook into to do the little tweaking that
you need to do and during the start what

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:47.920
you need to do and during the start what
 

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.290
you need to do and during the start what
we would have to do of course is capture

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:49.300
we would have to do of course is capture
 

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.140
we would have to do of course is capture
the the transition the text size of the

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.150
the the transition the text size of the
 

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.290
the the transition the text size of the
current textview and then set it to the

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:55.300
current textview and then set it to the
 

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.030
current textview and then set it to the
one that we want it to be in the start

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.040
one that we want it to be in the start
 

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.580
one that we want it to be in the start
and in the end of course we have to

00:20:59.580 --> 00:20:59.590
and in the end of course we have to
 

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.440
and in the end of course we have to
reset the text size back to what it was

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.450
reset the text size back to what it was
 

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.450
reset the text size back to what it was
before otherwise you just animate to the

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:03.460
before otherwise you just animate to the
 

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.620
before otherwise you just animate to the
little tiny font from the start so what

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:07.630
little tiny font from the start so what
 

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.230
little tiny font from the start so what
happens now you end up with a beautiful

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240
happens now you end up with a beautiful
 

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.340
happens now you end up with a beautiful
transition from activity to activity

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:13.350
transition from activity to activity
 

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.830
transition from activity to activity
nice and smooth now misc I'm gonna come

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840
nice and smooth now misc I'm gonna come
 

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.970
nice and smooth now misc I'm gonna come
back I show this really awesome

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:17.980
back I show this really awesome
 

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.910
back I show this really awesome
transition that he made up I you guys

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:20.920
transition that he made up I you guys
 

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.750
transition that he made up I you guys
have to see this thanks whew

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760
have to see this thanks whew
 

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.210
have to see this thanks whew

cool transitions we've looked at so far

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.040
cool transitions we've looked at so far
 

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.560

one of my favorite things in the updated

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:31.570
one of my favorite things in the updated
 

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.270
one of my favorite things in the updated
motion guidelines in the material spec

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280
motion guidelines in the material spec
 

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.190
motion guidelines in the material spec
is it's like a section on transforming

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200
is it's like a section on transforming
 

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.080
is it's like a section on transforming

about material design about how things

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:47.470
about material design about how things
 

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.410
about material design about how things
are you know sheets of digital paper and

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:49.420
are you know sheets of digital paper and
 

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.000
are you know sheets of digital paper and
so on and that they can transform from

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.010
so on and that they can transform from
 

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.340
so on and that they can transform from
one thing to another this transition in

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:53.350
one thing to another this transition in
 

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.170
one thing to another this transition in
particular caught my eye which is

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:55.180
particular caught my eye which is
 

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.150
particular caught my eye which is
transitioning transforming sorry a

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:57.160

floating action button this circular fab

00:21:59.130 --> 00:21:59.140
floating action button this circular fab
 

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.270
floating action button this circular fab
into a different sheet of material and I

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280
into a different sheet of material and I
 

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.470
into a different sheet of material and I
thought this is pretty cool and I wanted

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480
thought this is pretty cool and I wanted
 

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.360
thought this is pretty cool and I wanted
to use this in a open source app which I

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:06.370
to use this in a open source app which I
 

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.390
to use this in a open source app which I
built called called plaid and I wanted

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400
built called called plaid and I wanted
 

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.389
built called called plaid and I wanted
to transform from this fab here

00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:11.399
to transform from this fab here
 

00:22:11.399 --> 00:22:12.950
to transform from this fab here
into this and this bottom sheet which is

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960
into this and this bottom sheet which is
 

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.459
into this and this bottom sheet which is
essentially a linear layout so unlike

00:22:16.459 --> 00:22:16.469
essentially a linear layout so unlike
 

00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:17.690
essentially a linear layout so unlike
the transitions we've looked at so far

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700
the transitions we've looked at so far
 

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.700
the transitions we've looked at so far
which are pretty much acting on the same

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:19.710
which are pretty much acting on the same
 

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.560
which are pretty much acting on the same
kind of view so transitioning an image

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:21.570
kind of view so transitioning an image
 

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.969
kind of view so transitioning an image
viewer in one window to an image view

00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:22.979
viewer in one window to an image view
 

00:22:22.979 --> 00:22:24.799
viewer in one window to an image view
another or text view to a text view for

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:24.809
another or text view to a text view for
 

00:22:24.809 --> 00:22:26.810
another or text view to a text view for
example this is like pretty different

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820
example this is like pretty different
 

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.279
example this is like pretty different
right we're gonna go from a floating

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:28.289
right we're gonna go from a floating
 

00:22:28.289 --> 00:22:29.979
right we're gonna go from a floating
action button basically an image button

00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:29.989
action button basically an image button
 

00:22:29.989 --> 00:22:33.469
action button basically an image button
to a linear layout essentially so how do

00:22:33.469 --> 00:22:33.479
to a linear layout essentially so how do
 

00:22:33.479 --> 00:22:36.799
to a linear layout essentially so how do
we do that so it's really really

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:36.809
we do that so it's really really
 

00:22:36.809 --> 00:22:38.359
we do that so it's really really
important to remember as we've talked

00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:38.369
important to remember as we've talked
 

00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:39.950
important to remember as we've talked
about before that everything happens in

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960
about before that everything happens in
 

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.690
about before that everything happens in
the destination window so in the window

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700
the destination window so in the window
 

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.969
the destination window so in the window
with this kind of bottom sheet here so

00:22:43.969 --> 00:22:43.979
with this kind of bottom sheet here so
 

00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:45.950
with this kind of bottom sheet here so
as with most animation things we do some

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960
as with most animation things we do some
 

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.839
as with most animation things we do some
tricks to make it look like that one

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:47.849
tricks to make it look like that one
 

00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:50.539
tricks to make it look like that one
thing is transforming into the other so

00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:50.549
thing is transforming into the other so
 

00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:52.639
thing is transforming into the other so
what we do is in the destination window

00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:52.649
what we do is in the destination window
 

00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:55.639
what we do is in the destination window
we use set translation X&amp;Y

00:22:55.639 --> 00:22:55.649
we use set translation X&amp;Y
 

00:22:55.649 --> 00:22:58.369
we use set translation X&amp;Y
to basically Center the dialogue on the

00:22:58.369 --> 00:22:58.379
to basically Center the dialogue on the
 

00:22:58.379 --> 00:22:59.899
to basically Center the dialogue on the
web the coordinates of the fab so where

00:22:59.899 --> 00:22:59.909
web the coordinates of the fab so where
 

00:22:59.909 --> 00:23:02.019
web the coordinates of the fab so where
it started from just translation X&amp;Y and

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:02.029
it started from just translation X&amp;Y and
 

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:04.759
it started from just translation X&amp;Y and
then we use the view overlay again so if

00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:04.769
then we use the view overlay again so if
 

00:23:04.769 --> 00:23:05.959
then we use the view overlay again so if
you haven't used the view overlay this

00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:05.969
you haven't used the view overlay this
 

00:23:05.969 --> 00:23:07.789
you haven't used the view overlay this
is a the ability to add like draw balls

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799
is a the ability to add like draw balls
 

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:10.820
is a the ability to add like draw balls
on top of and the view so we add a solid

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:10.830
on top of and the view so we add a solid
 

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.820
on top of and the view so we add a solid
and color drawable as well as an icon on

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:13.830
and color drawable as well as an icon on
 

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.320
and color drawable as well as an icon on
top of the view and locate that sits in

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:15.330
top of the view and locate that sits in
 

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.690
top of the view and locate that sits in
the center and then we run some

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700
the center and then we run some
 

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.299
the center and then we run some
animations on this entire view so first

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:20.309
animations on this entire view so first
 

00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:23.539
animations on this entire view so first
we we fade out the color and the icon we

00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:23.549
we we fade out the color and the icon we
 

00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:25.519
we we fade out the color and the icon we
run a circular reveal animation so that

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:25.529
run a circular reveal animation so that
 

00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:27.619
run a circular reveal animation so that
applies a circular clipping mask and we

00:23:27.619 --> 00:23:27.629
applies a circular clipping mask and we
 

00:23:27.629 --> 00:23:29.839
applies a circular clipping mask and we
start from the the size of the fab and

00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:29.849
start from the the size of the fab and
 

00:23:29.849 --> 00:23:32.239
start from the the size of the fab and
then we animate that clip mask out to

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:32.249
then we animate that clip mask out to
 

00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:36.079
then we animate that clip mask out to
and you show the whole dialog and at the

00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:36.089
and you show the whole dialog and at the
 

00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:38.539
and you show the whole dialog and at the
same time we move along a curved path

00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:38.549
same time we move along a curved path
 

00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:41.869
same time we move along a curved path
using this motion thing so when we run

00:23:41.869 --> 00:23:41.879
using this motion thing so when we run
 

00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:43.489
using this motion thing so when we run
all of those animations at the same time

00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:43.499
all of those animations at the same time
 

00:23:43.499 --> 00:23:45.139
all of those animations at the same time
you get this effect it looks like you're

00:23:45.139 --> 00:23:45.149
you get this effect it looks like you're
 

00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:47.029
you get this effect it looks like you're
transforming from the fab to the

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039
transforming from the fab to the
 

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:49.969
transforming from the fab to the
dialogue and so can we see how we build

00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:49.979
dialogue and so can we see how we build
 

00:23:49.979 --> 00:23:54.200
dialogue and so can we see how we build
this yeah before we do you have to let's

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:54.210
this yeah before we do you have to let's
 

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.519
this yeah before we do you have to let's
think about what information we need to

00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:55.529
think about what information we need to
 

00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:57.259
think about what information we need to
build it so in order to build this

00:23:57.259 --> 00:23:57.269
build it so in order to build this
 

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:59.359
build it so in order to build this
transition we need to know the positions

00:23:59.359 --> 00:23:59.369
transition we need to know the positions
 

00:23:59.369 --> 00:24:01.519
transition we need to know the positions
like where the fab was to where the

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:01.529
like where the fab was to where the
 

00:24:01.529 --> 00:24:03.409
like where the fab was to where the
dialogue is we need to know the color

00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419
dialogue is we need to know the color
 

00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:05.570
dialogue is we need to know the color
it's going to and the icon because as

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580
it's going to and the icon because as
 

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.709
it's going to and the icon because as
we've talked about whether we keep on

00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:06.719
we've talked about whether we keep on
 

00:24:06.719 --> 00:24:08.570
we've talked about whether we keep on
hammering on about it all happens in the

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580
hammering on about it all happens in the
 

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.070
hammering on about it all happens in the
destination window so the sheet doesn't

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080
destination window so the sheet doesn't
 

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.279
destination window so the sheet doesn't
know anything about the fab right so how

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:13.289
know anything about the fab right so how
 

00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:18.709
know anything about the fab right so how
do we get all this information so the

00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:18.719
do we get all this information so the
 

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:20.779
do we get all this information so the
position is pretty easy as George said

00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:20.789
position is pretty easy as George said
 

00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:22.369
position is pretty easy as George said
the position is one of the few things

00:24:22.369 --> 00:24:22.379
the position is one of the few things
 

00:24:22.379 --> 00:24:24.169
the position is one of the few things
that actually does get passed through so

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179
that actually does get passed through so
 

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:25.460
that actually does get passed through so
we can just in the

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:25.470
we can just in the
 

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.620
we can just in the
capture star and capture in bounds we do

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:27.630
capture star and capture in bounds we do
 

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.390
capture star and capture in bounds we do
the same thing we just call capture

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400
the same thing we just call capture
 

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.620
the same thing we just call capture
values and we put those bounds into the

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:33.630
values and we put those bounds into the
 

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.659
values and we put those bounds into the
value transition values map and we'll

00:24:35.659 --> 00:24:35.669
value transition values map and we'll
 

00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:37.490
value transition values map and we'll
get access to those a bit later on so we

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500
get access to those a bit later on so we
 

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.690
get access to those a bit later on so we
have the bounds of the fab and the

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700
have the bounds of the fab and the
 

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.000
have the bounds of the fab and the
dialogue so for the color and the icon I

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.010
dialogue so for the color and the icon I
 

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.500
dialogue so for the color and the icon I
basically created a and a couple of

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:45.510
basically created a and a couple of
 

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.390
basically created a and a couple of
constructors each you can use so just

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:47.400
constructors each you can use so just
 

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.510
constructors each you can use so just
like views and transitions can have can

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520
like views and transitions can have can
 

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.159
like views and transitions can have can
be inflated from XML so when we looked

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:52.169
be inflated from XML so when we looked
 

00:24:52.169 --> 00:24:53.840
be inflated from XML so when we looked
at the XML translation sets that then

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:53.850
at the XML translation sets that then
 

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.450
at the XML translation sets that then
we're showing you before and you can

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460
we're showing you before and you can
 

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.760
we're showing you before and you can
define your own transitions as we did

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:58.770
define your own transitions as we did
 

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.649
define your own transitions as we did
with the text resize but you can also

00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659
with the text resize but you can also
 

00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:02.510
with the text resize but you can also
add your own attributes so here's an

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520
add your own attributes so here's an
 

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.100
add your own attributes so here's an
example where we're doing and you know

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.110
example where we're doing and you know
 

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.080
example where we're doing and you know
context sort of tame style attributes

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.090
context sort of tame style attributes
 

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.580
context sort of tame style attributes
just as you would in a custom view and

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:07.590
just as you would in a custom view and
 

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.310
just as you would in a custom view and
you can define your own declare styler

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320
you can define your own declare styler
 

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.870
you can define your own declare styler
balls and pull them out that attribute

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880
balls and pull them out that attribute
 

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.520
balls and pull them out that attribute
so we could pass in the color and the

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:13.530
so we could pass in the color and the
 

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.510
so we could pass in the color and the
icon three attributes and just a quick

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520
icon three attributes and just a quick
 

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.970
icon three attributes and just a quick
note and we're setting the path motion

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980
note and we're setting the path motion
 

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.200
note and we're setting the path motion
here so this is what we talked about

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:21.210
here so this is what we talked about
 

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.210
here so this is what we talked about
before adding a path motion to control

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220
before adding a path motion to control
 

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.890
before adding a path motion to control
the path which is going to move along

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900
the path which is going to move along
 

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.210
the path which is going to move along
later and we'll come back to using that

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220
later and we'll come back to using that
 

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.690
later and we'll come back to using that
in a second but as an alternative and I

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700
in a second but as an alternative and I
 

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.419
in a second but as an alternative and I
also added a dynamic way of determinist

00:25:32.419 --> 00:25:32.429
also added a dynamic way of determinist
 

00:25:32.429 --> 00:25:34.250
also added a dynamic way of determinist
because there's actually different entry

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260
because there's actually different entry
 

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.470
because there's actually different entry
points I have into this screen so I

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480
points I have into this screen so I
 

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.390
points I have into this screen so I
can't couldn't statically declare in the

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400
can't couldn't statically declare in the
 

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.600
can't couldn't statically declare in the
details activity what color and icon it

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:41.610
details activity what color and icon it
 

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:42.710
details activity what color and icon it
was going to come from because it can

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720
was going to come from because it can
 

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.180
was going to come from because it can
come from multiple places into that

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:44.190
come from multiple places into that
 

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.700
come from multiple places into that
screen and so I added a constructor

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:46.710
screen and so I added a constructor
 

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.490
screen and so I added a constructor
which will pass in and the color and the

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500
which will pass in and the color and the
 

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.270
which will pass in and the color and the
I plan to use and so we can do and the

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:53.280
I plan to use and so we can do and the
 

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.260
I plan to use and so we can do and the
technique which George talked about

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:54.270
technique which George talked about
 

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.570
technique which George talked about
earlier of using an intent extras to

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580
earlier of using an intent extras to
 

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.980
earlier of using an intent extras to
pass this information to details

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:57.990
pass this information to details
 

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.990
pass this information to details
activity but here's the pattern which I

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000
activity but here's the pattern which I
 

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.850
activity but here's the pattern which I
found really helpful for implementing

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860
found really helpful for implementing
 

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.169
found really helpful for implementing
this this isn't part of the transitions

00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179
this this isn't part of the transitions
 

00:26:03.179 --> 00:26:04.880
this this isn't part of the transitions
API contract but it's just a pattern I

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:04.890
API contract but it's just a pattern I
 

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.549
API contract but it's just a pattern I
found useful so I added a and the static

00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559
found useful so I added a and the static
 

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:09.320
found useful so I added a and the static
method on to the transition object

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:09.330
method on to the transition object
 

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.470
method on to the transition object
itself and called add extras so you can

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480
itself and called add extras so you can
 

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.630
itself and called add extras so you can
call this from the source activity from

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640
call this from the source activity from
 

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.250
call this from the source activity from
the activity which has the fab and knows

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260
the activity which has the fab and knows
 

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.399
the activity which has the fab and knows
about the icon of the color so passing

00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:19.409
about the icon of the color so passing
 

00:26:19.409 --> 00:26:20.990
about the icon of the color so passing
those things in a static method and it

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000
those things in a static method and it
 

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.880
those things in a static method and it
will add them to the extras for you and

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:22.890
will add them to the extras for you and
 

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.610
will add them to the extras for you and
then a corresponding and set up method I

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620
then a corresponding and set up method I
 

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.779
then a corresponding and set up method I
call it which you would call from the

00:26:26.779 --> 00:26:26.789
call it which you would call from the
 

00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:28.250
call it which you would call from the
destination activity so from the

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260
destination activity so from the
 

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.870
destination activity so from the
activity with the bottom sheet which

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880
activity with the bottom sheet which
 

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.039
activity with the bottom sheet which
will then pull those activity those

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:33.049
will then pull those activity those
 

00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:35.690
will then pull those activity those
parameters out of the intent extra

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700
parameters out of the intent extra
 

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.210
parameters out of the intent extra
fields

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:37.220
fields
 

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.370
fields
and then it will actually create an

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:39.380
and then it will actually create an
 

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.470
and then it will actually create an
instance of this transition object which

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480
instance of this transition object which
 

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.169
instance of this transition object which
I called fab transform itself and set

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:44.179
I called fab transform itself and set
 

00:26:44.179 --> 00:26:46.750
I called fab transform itself and set
the target and then set it on the window

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760
the target and then set it on the window
 

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.120
the target and then set it on the window
as a shared element enter the reason I

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:49.130
as a shared element enter the reason I
 

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.470
as a shared element enter the reason I
like this pattern is it because it means

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480
like this pattern is it because it means
 

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.899
like this pattern is it because it means
it keeps the the keys and so on private

00:26:52.899 --> 00:26:52.909
it keeps the the keys and so on private
 

00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:53.980
it keeps the the keys and so on private
to the transition you don't have to

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:53.990
to the transition you don't have to
 

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.330
to the transition you don't have to
worry about exposing that it kind of

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:55.340
worry about exposing that it kind of
 

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.899
worry about exposing that it kind of
keeps it nicely encapsulated notice here

00:26:58.899 --> 00:26:58.909
keeps it nicely encapsulated notice here
 

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:01.210
keeps it nicely encapsulated notice here
that we're using set shared enter and

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:01.220
that we're using set shared enter and
 

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.880
that we're using set shared enter and
element transition but if you remember

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:03.890
element transition but if you remember
 

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.380
element transition but if you remember
from the animation it goes both from the

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:05.390
from the animation it goes both from the
 

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.149
from the animation it goes both from the
fab to the sheet as well as animating

00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159
fab to the sheet as well as animating
 

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:09.039
fab to the sheet as well as animating
from the sheet back down so what that

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:09.049
from the sheet back down so what that
 

00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:12.010
from the sheet back down so what that
means is the element the so the shared

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:12.020
means is the element the so the shared
 

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.350
means is the element the so the shared
and transition was going to get used on

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360
and transition was going to get used on
 

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.470
and transition was going to get used on
the return transition as well so bear

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480
the return transition as well so bear
 

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.310
the return transition as well so bear
that in mind it's going to become

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320
that in mind it's going to become
 

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.710
that in mind it's going to become
important in a second all right so we

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720
important in a second all right so we
 

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.029
important in a second all right so we
have all the information we've created

00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039
have all the information we've created
 

00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:24.159
have all the information we've created
the transition objects itself how do we

00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:24.169
the transition objects itself how do we
 

00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:26.169
the transition objects itself how do we
actually create the animators to to run

00:27:26.169 --> 00:27:26.179
actually create the animators to to run
 

00:27:26.179 --> 00:27:27.990
actually create the animators to to run
this transition to make it all happen

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000
this transition to make it all happen
 

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.490
this transition to make it all happen
first off we grab out their bounds that

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:30.500
first off we grab out their bounds that
 

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.399
first off we grab out their bounds that
we saved into the transitions values map

00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:32.409
we saved into the transitions values map
 

00:27:32.409 --> 00:27:35.740
we saved into the transitions values map
and hold onto those I then do something

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:35.750
and hold onto those I then do something
 

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.630
and hold onto those I then do something
where I just check basically which of

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640
where I just check basically which of
 

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.860
where I just check basically which of
those is wider it's maybe not the most

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:40.870
those is wider it's maybe not the most
 

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.789
those is wider it's maybe not the most
sophisticated method but that's how I

00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799
sophisticated method but that's how I
 

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:44.590
sophisticated method but that's how I
work out if I'm going from the fab to

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600
work out if I'm going from the fab to
 

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.090
work out if I'm going from the fab to
the dialogue or from the dialogue to the

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:46.100
the dialogue or from the dialogue to the
 

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.070
the dialogue or from the dialogue to the
fab I'll basically use that billion

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080
fab I'll basically use that billion
 

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.149
fab I'll basically use that billion
later on to set up the appropriate

00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159
later on to set up the appropriate
 

00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:53.110
later on to set up the appropriate
animation so for example if you're going

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120
animation so for example if you're going
 

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.450
animation so for example if you're going
from the FAFSA sheet you do in expanding

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:55.460
from the FAFSA sheet you do in expanding
 

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.250
from the FAFSA sheet you do in expanding
circular reveal or if you're going from

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:57.260
circular reveal or if you're going from
 

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.690
circular reveal or if you're going from
the sheet to the fab you do a

00:27:58.690 --> 00:27:58.700
the sheet to the fab you do a
 

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.149
the sheet to the fab you do a
contracting circular reveal circular

00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159
contracting circular reveal circular
 

00:28:01.159 --> 00:28:08.020
contracting circular reveal circular
hide don't know so and next up the view

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.030

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.000
hide don't know so and next up the view
is always the end values of view so even

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.010
is always the end values of view so even
 

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:11.140
is always the end values of view so even
though you give me the start values and

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.150
though you give me the start values and
 

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.250
though you give me the start values and
the end values you're always acting on

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:12.260
the end values you're always acting on
 

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.649
the end values you're always acting on
the end values of view and something

00:28:14.649 --> 00:28:14.659
the end values of view and something
 

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:15.820
the end values of view and something
that took me a little while to get my

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:15.830
that took me a little while to get my
 

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.580
that took me a little while to get my
head around was that view is always in

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:18.590
head around was that view is always in
 

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.250
head around was that view is always in
the state that it ends up in which is to

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:21.260
the state that it ends up in which is to
 

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.430
the state that it ends up in which is to
say when we were going from the fab to

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440
say when we were going from the fab to
 

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.500
say when we were going from the fab to
the dialogue it was already laid out and

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:26.510
the dialogue it was already laid out and
 

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.210
the dialogue it was already laid out and
positioned in the dialogues position and

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:28.220
positioned in the dialogues position and
 

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.340
positioned in the dialogues position and
then we reversed it by setting those

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:30.350
then we reversed it by setting those
 

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.169
then we reversed it by setting those
translations and so forth to put it back

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:32.179
translations and so forth to put it back
 

00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:34.360
translations and so forth to put it back
into the tabs position right so it's

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:34.370
into the tabs position right so it's
 

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.340
into the tabs position right so it's
already in this an end state well the

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:36.350
already in this an end state well the
 

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.039
already in this an end state well the
same is true when I'm going back so what

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:39.049
same is true when I'm going back so what
 

00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:40.690
same is true when I'm going back so what
that means is when I'm about to do the

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:40.700
that means is when I'm about to do the
 

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.580
that means is when I'm about to do the
animation from the dialogue back to the

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:42.590
animation from the dialogue back to the
 

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.130
animation from the dialogue back to the
fab the dialogues actually laid out like

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:45.140
fab the dialogues actually laid out like
 

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.169
fab the dialogues actually laid out like
this just in the exact same bounds as

00:28:47.169 --> 00:28:47.179
this just in the exact same bounds as
 

00:28:47.179 --> 00:28:50.139
this just in the exact same bounds as
the as the fab and so what you need to

00:28:50.139 --> 00:28:50.149
the as the fab and so what you need to
 

00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.890
the as the fab and so what you need to
do

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:50.900
do
 

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.160
do
to manually call measure and layout on

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.170
to manually call measure and layout on
 

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.780
to manually call measure and layout on
to the dialog in order to put it back

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:55.790
to the dialog in order to put it back
 

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.250
to the dialog in order to put it back
into the position that you want to

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:57.260
into the position that you want to
 

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.080
into the position that you want to
animate from so it may sound

00:28:59.080 --> 00:28:59.090
animate from so it may sound
 

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.520
animate from so it may sound
counterintuitive at first that you have

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:00.530
counterintuitive at first that you have
 

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.890
counterintuitive at first that you have
to call layout and measure yourself but

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:02.900
to call layout and measure yourself but
 

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.180
to call layout and measure yourself but
this is just how the system works that

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:04.190
this is just how the system works that
 

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.770
this is just how the system works that
it's already in that same state it was

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:05.780
it's already in that same state it was
 

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.090
it's already in that same state it was
easy for us on the way in we have to do

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:07.100
easy for us on the way in we have to do
 

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.740
easy for us on the way in we have to do
a little bit more work on the way back

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:10.750
 
 

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.510
 
and then I just want to highlight the

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520
and then I just want to highlight the
 

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.950
and then I just want to highlight the
translation as well so this is how we

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960
translation as well so this is how we
 

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.690
translation as well so this is how we
use that path motion so we set a path

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:16.700
use that path motion so we set a path
 

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.520
use that path motion so we set a path
motion on the on in the constructor

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:18.530
motion on the on in the constructor
 

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.560
motion on the on in the constructor
early on and here I'm using one of the

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:20.570
early on and here I'm using one of the
 

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.270
early on and here I'm using one of the
overloads of object animator which will

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:22.280
overloads of object animator which will
 

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.100
overloads of object animator which will
actually animate two properties at once

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:24.110
actually animate two properties at once
 

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.780
actually animate two properties at once
so here I'm animating the translation

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:25.790
so here I'm animating the translation
 

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.420
so here I'm animating the translation
X&amp;Y of the dialogue and we get hold of

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:28.430
X&amp;Y of the dialogue and we get hold of
 

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.280
X&amp;Y of the dialogue and we get hold of
that path motion again and call get path

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:30.290
that path motion again and call get path
 

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.770
that path motion again and call get path
passing it in the start and x and y and

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:32.780
passing it in the start and x and y and
 

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.510
passing it in the start and x and y and
the end x and y and that will generate

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:34.520
the end x and y and that will generate
 

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.220
the end x and y and that will generate
the curved path and animate the

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:36.230
the curved path and animate the
 

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.520
the curved path and animate the
translation along the curve but for us

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:38.530
translation along the curve but for us
 

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.530
translation along the curve but for us
we do some more and animators for the

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:41.540
we do some more and animators for the
 

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.780
we do some more and animators for the
circular reveal and the fade and so on

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:43.790
circular reveal and the fade and so on
 

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.400
circular reveal and the fade and so on
and we put them in a set and return that

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:45.410
and we put them in a set and return that
 

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.160
and we put them in a set and return that
and that gives you that entire animation

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.170
and that gives you that entire animation
 

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.380
and that gives you that entire animation
so that's how it's done and this is all

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:50.390
so that's how it's done and this is all
 

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.490
so that's how it's done and this is all
open source as well so there'll be a

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:51.500
open source as well so there'll be a
 

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.900
open source as well so there'll be a
link at the end you can go have a look

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:52.910
link at the end you can go have a look
 

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.130
link at the end you can go have a look
if you want to go into all the

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:54.140
if you want to go into all the
 

00:29:54.140 --> 00:30:02.659
if you want to go into all the
nitty-gritty details that was awesome

00:30:02.659 --> 00:30:02.669
 
 

00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:05.359
 
all right so let's talk about a few

00:30:05.359 --> 00:30:05.369
all right so let's talk about a few
 

00:30:05.369 --> 00:30:06.799
all right so let's talk about a few
things that I think you guys will find

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:06.809
things that I think you guys will find
 

00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:09.619
things that I think you guys will find
really useful here transition names now

00:30:09.619 --> 00:30:09.629
really useful here transition names now
 

00:30:09.629 --> 00:30:12.649
really useful here transition names now
if you do things well with transition

00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:12.659
if you do things well with transition
 

00:30:12.659 --> 00:30:14.960
if you do things well with transition
names the system will work for you and

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:14.970
names the system will work for you and
 

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:18.379
names the system will work for you and
that will help you a lot for example we

00:30:18.379 --> 00:30:18.389
that will help you a lot for example we
 

00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:20.509
that will help you a lot for example we
have a an animation here transition to

00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519
have a an animation here transition to
 

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:22.399
have a an animation here transition to
go from this little guy to a big ticket

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:22.409
go from this little guy to a big ticket
 

00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:24.080
go from this little guy to a big ticket
for the big thing man active activity

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.090
for the big thing man active activity
 

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.119
for the big thing man active activity
transition like that and what's

00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:26.129
transition like that and what's
 

00:30:26.129 --> 00:30:27.710
transition like that and what's
happening in our activity transition is

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720
happening in our activity transition is
 

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.499
happening in our activity transition is
of course we call start act make scenes

00:30:30.499 --> 00:30:30.509
of course we call start act make scenes
 

00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:32.419
of course we call start act make scenes
transition animation and we have this

00:30:32.419 --> 00:30:32.429
transition animation and we have this
 

00:30:32.429 --> 00:30:34.340
transition animation and we have this
view and it my view doesn't have a

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:34.350
view and it my view doesn't have a
 

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.639
view and it my view doesn't have a
transition name here or please don't do

00:30:37.639 --> 00:30:37.649
transition name here or please don't do
 

00:30:37.649 --> 00:30:37.849
transition name here or please don't do
this

00:30:37.849 --> 00:30:37.859
this
 

00:30:37.859 --> 00:30:39.799
this
you call view set transition name right

00:30:39.799 --> 00:30:39.809
you call view set transition name right
 

00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:41.989
you call view set transition name right
here in this call oh don't do that okay

00:30:41.989 --> 00:30:41.999
here in this call oh don't do that okay
 

00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:45.799
here in this call oh don't do that okay
and I'll show you why we have our

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:45.809
and I'll show you why we have our
 

00:30:45.809 --> 00:30:49.279
and I'll show you why we have our
activity here we launched a new one and

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:49.289
activity here we launched a new one and
 

00:30:49.289 --> 00:30:51.440
activity here we launched a new one and
then we are a change the orientation of

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:51.450
then we are a change the orientation of
 

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.859
then we are a change the orientation of
the phone what happens now that's right

00:30:54.859 --> 00:30:54.869
the phone what happens now that's right
 

00:30:54.869 --> 00:30:58.129
the phone what happens now that's right
our activity gets rebuilt but further

00:30:58.129 --> 00:30:58.139
our activity gets rebuilt but further
 

00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:00.019
our activity gets rebuilt but further
the thing underneath that gets rebuilt

00:31:00.019 --> 00:31:00.029
the thing underneath that gets rebuilt
 

00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:03.139
the thing underneath that gets rebuilt
too so even if you called vue de set

00:31:03.139 --> 00:31:03.149
too so even if you called vue de set
 

00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:05.960
too so even if you called vue de set
transition name you just lost that it's

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:05.970
transition name you just lost that it's
 

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.229
transition name you just lost that it's
gone so now when the view goes cut tries

00:31:09.229 --> 00:31:09.239
gone so now when the view goes cut tries
 

00:31:09.239 --> 00:31:12.590
gone so now when the view goes cut tries
to come back it has no idea which is the

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600
to come back it has no idea which is the
 

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.009
to come back it has no idea which is the
share element the transition name is

00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:16.019
share element the transition name is
 

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:18.889
share element the transition name is
used to identify which it you know going

00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899
used to identify which it you know going
 

00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:20.720
used to identify which it you know going
from the source to the target and so it

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:20.730
from the source to the target and so it
 

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.729
from the source to the target and so it
can map those two and if it loses that

00:31:22.729 --> 00:31:22.739
can map those two and if it loses that
 

00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:24.519
can map those two and if it loses that
transition name it won't know what to do

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:24.529
transition name it won't know what to do
 

00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:27.200
transition name it won't know what to do
you course can fix that up for it if you

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:27.210
you course can fix that up for it if you
 

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.129
you course can fix that up for it if you
want and we'll talk about that a little

00:31:28.129 --> 00:31:28.139
want and we'll talk about that a little
 

00:31:28.139 --> 00:31:30.169
want and we'll talk about that a little
bit later but the transition name is

00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179
bit later but the transition name is
 

00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:34.039
bit later but the transition name is
your friend so in a system like this

00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:34.049
your friend so in a system like this
 

00:31:34.049 --> 00:31:35.629
your friend so in a system like this
where you have a recycler view for

00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639
where you have a recycler view for
 

00:31:35.639 --> 00:31:39.169
where you have a recycler view for
example when you bind your view that's

00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179
example when you bind your view that's
 

00:31:39.179 --> 00:31:42.529
example when you bind your view that's
when you set your transition name and it

00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539
when you set your transition name and it
 

00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:44.180
when you set your transition name and it
should be a unique name that you have

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:44.190
should be a unique name that you have
 

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.549
should be a unique name that you have
for that item and it can be a URL or

00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559
for that item and it can be a URL or
 

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:48.259
for that item and it can be a URL or
whatever you want it's fine it's as long

00:31:48.259 --> 00:31:48.269
whatever you want it's fine it's as long
 

00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:50.210
whatever you want it's fine it's as long
as the string that's unique now here I

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220
as the string that's unique now here I
 

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.099
as the string that's unique now here I
bound it to the position and my view

00:31:52.099 --> 00:31:52.109
bound it to the position and my view
 

00:31:52.109 --> 00:31:55.310
bound it to the position and my view
holder of position is unique whatever or

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320
holder of position is unique whatever or
 

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.680
holder of position is unique whatever or
then it'll plug for data binding you can

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:57.690
then it'll plug for data binding you can
 

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.239
then it'll plug for data binding you can
do it right in the layout too if you're

00:31:59.239 --> 00:31:59.249
do it right in the layout too if you're
 

00:31:59.249 --> 00:32:01.729
do it right in the layout too if you're
using data binding all right that's

00:32:01.729 --> 00:32:01.739
using data binding all right that's
 

00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:03.590
using data binding all right that's
awesome by the way I know some guy who

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600
awesome by the way I know some guy who
 

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.879
awesome by the way I know some guy who
works on that let's talk about changing

00:32:07.879 --> 00:32:07.889
works on that let's talk about changing
 

00:32:07.889 --> 00:32:10.310
works on that let's talk about changing
the shared elements that means we have a

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320
the shared elements that means we have a
 

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.359
the shared elements that means we have a
different shared element than you

00:32:11.359 --> 00:32:11.369
different shared element than you
 

00:32:11.369 --> 00:32:14.180
different shared element than you
originally thought here I have a view an

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:14.190
originally thought here I have a view an
 

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.099
originally thought here I have a view an
activity it launches another one and

00:32:16.099 --> 00:32:16.109
activity it launches another one and
 

00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:16.490
activity it launches another one and
then we

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500
then we
 

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.350
then we
scroll in the detailed view and when we

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360
scroll in the detailed view and when we
 

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.240
scroll in the detailed view and when we
go back we want to go back to a

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:20.250
go back we want to go back to a
 

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.570
go back we want to go back to a
different share element right now that's

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580
different share element right now that's
 

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.220
different share element right now that's
a transition system of course it's going

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:25.230
a transition system of course it's going
 

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.480
a transition system of course it's going
to try to go back to the same one you

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:26.490
to try to go back to the same one you
 

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.090
to try to go back to the same one you
had before we have to tell it something

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100
had before we have to tell it something
 

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.800
had before we have to tell it something
else

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:29.810
else
 

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:33.530
else
step one when you launch the activity

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:33.540
step one when you launch the activity
 

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.530
step one when you launch the activity
ask for which shared element is coming

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:36.540
ask for which shared element is coming
 

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.700
ask for which shared element is coming
back so you start activity for a result

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:39.710
back so you start activity for a result
 

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:44.570
back so you start activity for a result
okay step two before you go back set the

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580
okay step two before you go back set the
 

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.040
okay step two before you go back set the
result tell it what shared element it's

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.050
result tell it what shared element it's
 

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.320
result tell it what shared element it's
gonna come back to you here I have an ID

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:48.330
gonna come back to you here I have an ID
 

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.800
gonna come back to you here I have an ID
that I'm gonna send back as a result

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:50.810
that I'm gonna send back as a result
 

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:55.160
that I'm gonna send back as a result
step three in on activity reenter not on

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.170
step three in on activity reenter not on
 

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.530
step three in on activity reenter not on
activity result now I've gotten bitten

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:57.540
activity result now I've gotten bitten
 

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.330
activity result now I've gotten bitten
by this just yesterday I think it was

00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340
by this just yesterday I think it was
 

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.490
by this just yesterday I think it was
what I was writing a demo on activity

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500
what I was writing a demo on activity
 

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.710
what I was writing a demo on activity
reenter that's a new thing just for

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720
reenter that's a new thing just for
 

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.620
reenter that's a new thing just for
activity transitions here it will be

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:09.630
activity transitions here it will be
 

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.810
activity transitions here it will be
called before the shared element comes

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820
called before the shared element comes
 

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.880
called before the shared element comes
back and this is where you can do some

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:13.890
back and this is where you can do some
 

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.980
back and this is where you can do some
tweaking here I'm going to get the data

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:15.990
tweaking here I'm going to get the data
 

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.040
tweaking here I'm going to get the data
get the shared element okay and that's

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.050
get the shared element okay and that's
 

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.260
get the shared element okay and that's
gonna come back to me all that data is

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:21.270
gonna come back to me all that data is
 

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.060
gonna come back to me all that data is
coming back to me and then we can also

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:23.070
coming back to me and then we can also
 

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:26.060
coming back to me and then we can also
called a shared element exit callback so

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:26.070
called a shared element exit callback so
 

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.410
called a shared element exit callback so
if they share the share element callback

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:27.420
if they share the share element callback
 

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.390
if they share the share element callback
for the exit now the exit is used for

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:29.400
for the exit now the exit is used for
 

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.880
for the exit now the exit is used for
the exiting on also for the reenter it's

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:31.890
the exiting on also for the reenter it's
 

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.430
the exiting on also for the reenter it's
the same callback used for both okay and

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440
the same callback used for both okay and
 

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.380
the same callback used for both okay and
this is where we can switch up our

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:36.390
this is where we can switch up our
 

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.470
this is where we can switch up our
activity our shared elements we can set

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480
activity our shared elements we can set
 

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.840
activity our shared elements we can set
our shared element to whatever we want

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:41.850
our shared element to whatever we want
 

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.520
our shared element to whatever we want
in our view hierarchy so here I've just

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:43.530
in our view hierarchy so here I've just
 

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.280
in our view hierarchy so here I've just
I used the ID I just had got before from

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:46.290
I used the ID I just had got before from
 

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.070
I used the ID I just had got before from
the on activity we enter and I used it

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080
the on activity we enter and I used it
 

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.500
the on activity we enter and I used it
right now for my share to change my sure

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:51.510
right now for my share to change my sure
 

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.610
right now for my share to change my sure
element and now it works perfectly let's

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620
element and now it works perfectly let's
 

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.500
element and now it works perfectly let's
talk about overlays shared elements

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:57.510
talk about overlays shared elements
 

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.930
talk about overlays shared elements
often go into the overlay if it'll just

00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940
often go into the overlay if it'll just
 

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.000
often go into the overlay if it'll just
go right into the overlay unless we

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.010
go right into the overlay unless we
 

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.880
go right into the overlay unless we
specifically tell it not to now the

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:04.890
specifically tell it not to now the
 

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.050
specifically tell it not to now the
great thing about this is it's drawn on

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:06.060
great thing about this is it's drawn on
 

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.180
great thing about this is it's drawn on
top of everything right because you

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:08.190
top of everything right because you
 

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.379
top of everything right because you
don't want to have your shared element

00:34:09.379 --> 00:34:09.389
don't want to have your shared element
 

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:10.700
don't want to have your shared element
drawn underneath something over there

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:10.710
drawn underneath something over there
 

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.950
drawn underneath something over there
right and it's also not clipped by the

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960
right and it's also not clipped by the
 

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.800
right and it's also not clipped by the
parent and that's really important but

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:15.810
parent and that's really important but
 

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.930
parent and that's really important but
the problem is is drawn on top of

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940
the problem is is drawn on top of
 

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.360
the problem is is drawn on top of
everything I'm going to start on top of

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:20.370
everything I'm going to start on top of
 

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.260
everything I'm going to start on top of
everything there's a little bit of a

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:21.270
everything there's a little bit of a
 

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:26.240
everything there's a little bit of a
problem and it

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:26.250
 
 

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:34.110
 
and it's also not clipped by the parents

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:34.120
and it's also not clipped by the parents
 

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.750
and it's also not clipped by the parents
Cove it all right yeah yeah yeah here's

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760
Cove it all right yeah yeah yeah here's
 

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.730
Cove it all right yeah yeah yeah here's
a real example I had of this issue it is

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:38.740
a real example I had of this issue it is
 

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.550
a real example I had of this issue it is
in this screen again from plaid and when

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560
in this screen again from plaid and when
 

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.310
in this screen again from plaid and when
you click on a you know a list item I

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320
you click on a you know a list item I
 

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.290
you click on a you know a list item I
wanted to have this expand and grow out

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:46.300
wanted to have this expand and grow out
 

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.240
wanted to have this expand and grow out
so I wanted to have a shared element

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:48.250
so I wanted to have a shared element
 

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:49.740
so I wanted to have a shared element
where the bat the background was

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:49.750
where the bat the background was
 

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.330
where the bat the background was
actually one of the shared elements so

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:51.340
actually one of the shared elements so
 

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.649
actually one of the shared elements so
if your kids transition this to share

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:52.659
if your kids transition this to share
 

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:53.550
if your kids transition this to share
that's going on here

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560
that's going on here
 

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.230
that's going on here
there's an image going from one position

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240
there's an image going from one position
 

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.370
there's an image going from one position
to over but also the background

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:56.380
to over but also the background
 

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.490
to over but also the background
transitions to give that growing effect

00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.500
transitions to give that growing effect
 

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.230
transitions to give that growing effect
so this is all well and good but if you

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240
so this is all well and good but if you
 

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.090
so this is all well and good but if you
were to use the overlay to do the

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:03.100
were to use the overlay to do the
 

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.860
were to use the overlay to do the
transition if you put the background

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:04.870
transition if you put the background
 

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.140
transition if you put the background
into the overlay it's going to be on top

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:07.150
into the overlay it's going to be on top
 

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.190
into the overlay it's going to be on top
of everything else right so you get this

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.200
of everything else right so you get this
 

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.720
of everything else right so you get this
horrible effect where it kind of grows

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:09.730
horrible effect where it kind of grows
 

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.550
horrible effect where it kind of grows
up and you don't see any content and it

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560
up and you don't see any content and it
 

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.440
up and you don't see any content and it
snaps in right that's not what we want

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:13.450
snaps in right that's not what we want
 

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.790
snaps in right that's not what we want
we actually want the content to be able

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800
we actually want the content to be able
 

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.170
we actually want the content to be able
to kind of come in on top of the

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:16.180
to kind of come in on top of the
 

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.480
to kind of come in on top of the
background so hopefully we can control

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:18.490
background so hopefully we can control
 

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.240
background so hopefully we can control
that George yeah we can well oh if do to

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:21.250
that George yeah we can well oh if do to
 

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.710
that George yeah we can well oh if do to
make the share amount do something

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720
make the share amount do something
 

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.840
make the share amount do something
different is tell it not to and so we

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:24.850
different is tell it not to and so we
 

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:28.560
different is tell it not to and so we
just set this value in your in your

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:28.570
just set this value in your in your
 

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.200
just set this value in your in your
styles but you might end up with a

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:31.210
styles but you might end up with a
 

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:35.880
styles but you might end up with a
little bit of a problem I think it was

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:35.890
little bit of a problem I think it was
 

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.020
little bit of a problem I think it was
you you did it right

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.030
you you did it right
 

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:42.300
you you did it right
no well the problem is this let's see

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:42.310
no well the problem is this let's see
 

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:44.400
no well the problem is this let's see
what's going on here the shared element

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.410
what's going on here the shared element
 

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.160
what's going on here the shared element
is of course popped into the new

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:47.170
is of course popped into the new
 

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.220
is of course popped into the new
activity and when that happens it's

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:50.230
activity and when that happens it's
 

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.530
activity and when that happens it's
being clipped by its parent and it's

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:52.540
being clipped by its parent and it's
 

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.990
being clipped by its parent and it's
only visible when the cherem it slides

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000
only visible when the cherem it slides
 

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.620
only visible when the cherem it slides
into the parent view so what we can do

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:58.630
into the parent view so what we can do
 

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.870
into the parent view so what we can do
of course is tell the parent don't clip

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880
of course is tell the parent don't clip
 

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.990
of course is tell the parent don't clip
it so you say tell the parents a clip

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000
it so you say tell the parents a clip
 

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.150
it so you say tell the parents a clip
children to falls and also set clip to

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160
children to falls and also set clip to
 

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.170
children to falls and also set clip to
padding false as well now this is might

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:10.180
padding false as well now this is might
 

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.370
padding false as well now this is might
cause you a little bit of a problem with

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:11.380
cause you a little bit of a problem with
 

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.990
cause you a little bit of a problem with
the drawing so be careful with this and

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000
the drawing so be careful with this and
 

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.850
the drawing so be careful with this and
also it's a performance issue you might

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:14.860
also it's a performance issue you might
 

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.400
also it's a performance issue you might
consider doing this only during your

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.410
consider doing this only during your
 

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.100
consider doing this only during your
transition but you can't do it just on

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.110
transition but you can't do it just on
 

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.750
transition but you can't do it just on
the parent of the view of the shared

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760
the parent of the view of the shared
 

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.310
the parent of the view of the shared
element you have to go all the way up

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:23.320
element you have to go all the way up
 

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.860
element you have to go all the way up
because the grandparent can also clip

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:25.870
because the grandparent can also clip
 

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.750
because the grandparent can also clip
the child and clip your share element

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760
the child and clip your share element
 

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.120
the child and clip your share element
that's no good the other option is to do

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:30.130
that's no good the other option is to do
 

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:32.640
that's no good the other option is to do
as nicked it in his is to put it right

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:32.650
as nicked it in his is to put it right
 

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:34.260
as nicked it in his is to put it right
into the root into the root of his

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.270
into the root into the root of his
 

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.050
into the root into the root of his
layout as a child of that and now it's

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.060
layout as a child of that and now it's
 

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.130
layout as a child of that and now it's
not gonna be clipped by anything because

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:38.140
not gonna be clipped by anything because
 

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.539
not gonna be clipped by anything because
the root of course owns the whole window

00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:39.549
the root of course owns the whole window
 

00:36:39.549 --> 00:36:44.009
the root of course owns the whole window
it's fine all right let's take a look at

00:36:44.009 --> 00:36:44.019
it's fine all right let's take a look at
 

00:36:44.019 --> 00:36:46.529
it's fine all right let's take a look at
it now that it has no clipping it comes

00:36:46.529 --> 00:36:46.539
it now that it has no clipping it comes
 

00:36:46.539 --> 00:36:50.130
it now that it has no clipping it comes
in instead of like a flash comes in on

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:50.140
in instead of like a flash comes in on
 

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:55.069
in instead of like a flash comes in on
top just like we want all right then

00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079
top just like we want all right then
 

00:36:55.079 --> 00:37:02.309
top just like we want all right then
cool so as you may have seen within some

00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319
cool so as you may have seen within some
 

00:37:02.319 --> 00:37:03.990
cool so as you may have seen within some
of these transitions and in general if

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000
of these transitions and in general if
 

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.509
of these transitions and in general if
you work with transitions you also have

00:37:06.509 --> 00:37:06.519
you work with transitions you also have
 

00:37:06.519 --> 00:37:08.940
you work with transitions you also have
access to the window decorations those

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:08.950
access to the window decorations those
 

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:10.380
access to the window decorations those
basically status bar and the navigation

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:10.390
basically status bar and the navigation
 

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.289
basically status bar and the navigation
bar backgrounds so let's take a look at

00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:13.299
bar backgrounds so let's take a look at
 

00:37:13.299 --> 00:37:15.599
bar backgrounds so let's take a look at
what you can do is you just say define a

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:15.609
what you can do is you just say define a
 

00:37:15.609 --> 00:37:18.809
what you can do is you just say define a
slider transition and what will happen

00:37:18.809 --> 00:37:18.819
slider transition and what will happen
 

00:37:18.819 --> 00:37:20.220
slider transition and what will happen
with that is that it slides all the

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:20.230
with that is that it slides all the
 

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.029
with that is that it slides all the
content in as we highlighted the status

00:37:24.029 --> 00:37:24.039
content in as we highlighted the status
 

00:37:24.039 --> 00:37:26.490
content in as we highlighted the status
bar here to show you what's going on so

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:26.500
bar here to show you what's going on so
 

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.319
bar here to show you what's going on so
it slides the status bar in as well but

00:37:28.319 --> 00:37:28.329
it slides the status bar in as well but
 

00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:30.779
it slides the status bar in as well but
we actually don't want to do this and as

00:37:30.779 --> 00:37:30.789
we actually don't want to do this and as
 

00:37:30.789 --> 00:37:32.130
we actually don't want to do this and as
you can see on the bottom under

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.140
you can see on the bottom under
 

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.720
you can see on the bottom under
navigation bar there's also flash and in

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:33.730
navigation bar there's also flash and in
 

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.549
navigation bar there's also flash and in
the last moment of that it still it

00:37:35.549 --> 00:37:35.559
the last moment of that it still it
 

00:37:35.559 --> 00:37:38.250
the last moment of that it still it
slides up as well so in order to avoid

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:38.260
slides up as well so in order to avoid
 

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.990
slides up as well so in order to avoid
this there's a couple of ways you can do

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000
this there's a couple of ways you can do
 

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.960
this there's a couple of ways you can do
this but what you want to do is you want

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:42.970
this but what you want to do is you want
 

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.880
this but what you want to do is you want
to exclude both the status bar

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:44.890
to exclude both the status bar
 

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:46.950
to exclude both the status bar
background and the navigation bar

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960
background and the navigation bar
 

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.569
background and the navigation bar
backgrounds so we provided IDs as well

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:48.579
backgrounds so we provided IDs as well
 

00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:50.970
backgrounds so we provided IDs as well
as transition names for those so you can

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:50.980
as transition names for those so you can
 

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.609
as transition names for those so you can
work with them that is one of the ways

00:37:53.609 --> 00:37:53.619
work with them that is one of the ways
 

00:37:53.619 --> 00:37:54.960
work with them that is one of the ways
that you can do it obviously you can do

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:54.970
that you can do it obviously you can do
 

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.150
that you can do it obviously you can do
this not just in XML as we showed you

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160
this not just in XML as we showed you
 

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.789
this not just in XML as we showed you
before but also when you do this within

00:37:59.789 --> 00:37:59.799
before but also when you do this within
 

00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:01.170
before but also when you do this within
your within your codes

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:01.180
your within your codes
 

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.849
your within your codes
you basically just say on this

00:38:02.849 --> 00:38:02.859
you basically just say on this
 

00:38:02.859 --> 00:38:06.120
you basically just say on this
transition exclude the target and set

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.130
transition exclude the target and set
 

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:10.410
transition exclude the target and set
those values to true but you can also do

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:10.420
those values to true but you can also do
 

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.630
those values to true but you can also do
something a little bit more nifty you

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640
something a little bit more nifty you
 

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.519
something a little bit more nifty you
can add this to the shared element

00:38:14.519 --> 00:38:14.529
can add this to the shared element
 

00:38:14.529 --> 00:38:16.529
can add this to the shared element
transitions so you could have three

00:38:16.529 --> 00:38:16.539
transitions so you could have three
 

00:38:16.539 --> 00:38:18.660
transitions so you could have three
colors in there or just fade out stuff

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:18.670
colors in there or just fade out stuff
 

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.450
colors in there or just fade out stuff
when you want or fade them out within a

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:21.460
when you want or fade them out within a
 

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.569
when you want or fade them out within a
shadow roman transition this is an order

00:38:24.569 --> 00:38:24.579
shadow roman transition this is an order
 

00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:25.799
shadow roman transition this is an order
to do this you basically go all the way

00:38:25.799 --> 00:38:25.809
to do this you basically go all the way
 

00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:27.450
to do this you basically go all the way
up in the view hierarchy you get the

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:27.460
up in the view hierarchy you get the
 

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.880
up in the view hierarchy you get the
décor view of your window then you find

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:29.890
décor view of your window then you find
 

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:33.299
décor view of your window then you find
views by ID you create the pairs this is

00:38:33.299 --> 00:38:33.309
views by ID you create the pairs this is
 

00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:35.099
views by ID you create the pairs this is
the second way you can create pairs so

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:35.109
the second way you can create pairs so
 

00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:36.749
the second way you can create pairs so
in other and it's another way into

00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:36.759
in other and it's another way into
 

00:38:36.759 --> 00:38:41.430
in other and it's another way into
calling that and then adding them to the

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440
calling that and then adding them to the
 

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.069
calling that and then adding them to the
shared element transition to actually

00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079
shared element transition to actually
 

00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:46.980
shared element transition to actually
have the system being aware of exactly

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:46.990
have the system being aware of exactly
 

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.289
have the system being aware of exactly
that and then you get the desired

00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:49.299
that and then you get the desired
 

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:51.420
that and then you get the desired
behavior of not no flashes no

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.430
behavior of not no flashes no
 

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.520
behavior of not no flashes no
exploding or just moving out of the way

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:53.530
exploding or just moving out of the way
 

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:58.220
exploding or just moving out of the way
status bar or navigation bar background

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:58.230
status bar or navigation bar background
 

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:02.730
status bar or navigation bar background
and with that we actually have a little

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:02.740
and with that we actually have a little
 

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.319
and with that we actually have a little
room for questions so you can start

00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:04.329
room for questions so you can start
 

00:39:04.329 --> 00:39:05.579
room for questions so you can start
lining up if you have questions about

00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:05.589
lining up if you have questions about
 

00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:08.280
lining up if you have questions about
six minutes thank you very much for

also Topeka out there and another sample

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:31.510
also Topeka out there and another sample
 

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.440

called our streets you can take we

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:34.450
called our streets you can take we
 

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.180
called our streets you can take we
looked through the training that we have

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:36.190
