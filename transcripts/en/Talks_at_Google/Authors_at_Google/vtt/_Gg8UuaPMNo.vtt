00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.130
MALE SPEAKER: Hello, and
welcome everyone to a very, very

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.590
special event today.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.990
We have a very
special guest here.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.340
He greeted me in my mother
tongue when he met me.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.780
He's traveled all
over the place.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.730
And not only that, he
has a lot of insights

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.720
that he's gathered
from different places,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.200
different events in
history and time,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.870
as well as distilled these
insights into some bestselling

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.110
books.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.410
Eric Weiner is the author
of "The New York Times"

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.805
bestseller "The
Geography of Bliss,"

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:37.930
as well as two other books.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.500
He's here to discuss his latest,
"The Geography of Genius."

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.470
It's been called smart,
funny, and utterly delightful.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.800
Some people have said
this is his best book yet.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.750
The book has-- the earlier
book, "The Geography of Bliss,"

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.150
has been translated
into 20 languages.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.100
A number of high
schools and universities

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.050
have incorporated the
book into their curricula.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.070
I remember personally
when I read the book,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.480
I was so moved I wrote about it.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.870
And it was just a
fantastic phenomenal read

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.630
about different
places in the world,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.570
and what is their
connection to bliss

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.680
and their idea of happiness?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.110
I think in terms of
introducing Eric,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.730
I feel that the best-- he's
best introduced perhaps

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.180
in his own words.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.040
So let me just quote
something that he's written.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.380
He says, "I'm an
author, speaker,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.190
and a former
correspondent for NPR.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.920
But I prefer to think of myself
as a philosophical traveler.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.580
My interest-- my
obsession, really--

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.330
is the intersection
of places and ideas.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.400
It is at this
intersection, I believe,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.030
where the most fascinating
aspects of life unfold.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.250
[INAUDIBLE] our
search for happiness,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.530
spiritual fulfillment,
or creative expression."

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.112
With that, for you, sir.

00:01:58.112 --> 00:01:59.070
ERIC WEINER: Thank you.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.028
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:00.028 --> 00:02:02.060
Thank you for that
very nice introduction.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.210
I appreciate that.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.620
I'm delighted to be here.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.770
And I want to
begin with a story,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.280
because who doesn't
love a story?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.440
This is about a place
where a lot of brilliance

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.170
was happening in a
very concentrated area.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.495
Incredible innovation.

00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:24.830
And no, I'm not talking
about Silicon Valley.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.730
I am talking about
Florence in the year 1489.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.200
So let's time travel back there.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.890
And the place is practically
run by one very wealthy family

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.150
known as the Medici.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.100
The Medici were great
patrons of the arts,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.300
and there were powerful.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.370
And the big cheese
in the year 1489

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.900
was Lorenzo Medici, who went
by Lorenzo the Magnificent.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.210
I don't know if he called
himself that or others did.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.470
Maybe it was on
his business card.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.905
But he was quite impressive.

00:02:56.905 --> 00:03:01.360
He was a poet and a diplomat
and a great patron of the arts.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.192
And one day he's walking
outside the palace grounds

00:03:04.192 --> 00:03:06.735
and he notices this
young stone cutter

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:09.705
who can't be more
than 14 years old.

00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:11.480
And the kid's pretty good.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.700
He's working on a statue
of a fallen Roman god,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.130
except the teeth
aren't quite right.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.800
It's an older
statute, an older god,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.660
but the teeth are
all new and perfect.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.500
And Lorenzo says, kid.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.866
It's not an accurate
representation of reality.

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:31.685
Look, old men like me
have decayed teeth.

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:34.210
The next day, Lorenzo
comes back and notices

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.800
the kid has taken his advice
and put in some gum decay

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.880
and made it look very realistic.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.400
And Lorenzo was
blown away by this.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.590
And what does he do?

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.800
He invites the kid into
his home to live almost

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.330
like a member of his family.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.590
Gives him the best teachers
and the best materials

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.420
in the world.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.810
In other words, he invests
heavily in this kid.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.155
And it was a wise investment,
because today the kid

00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:04.257
is known by his first
name, Michelangelo.

00:04:04.257 --> 00:04:06.590
And the point of the story,
which we'll come back to-- I

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.080
want to set it aside for
a moment-- the point--

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.490
the question, rather, that
I'd like you to ask yourself

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.950
is, who was the genius?

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.480
Was it Michelangelo
who is certainly

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.589
a well known name and one
we associate with genius?

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.630
Or was it Lorenzo the
Magnificent, a lesser known

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.740
name, but someone who
perhaps without his involved

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.960
and his investment, we wouldn't
know the name Michelangelo?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.940
Or another possibility.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.390
Was the true genius
the city of Florence?

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.880
Was it the place?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.810
Genius.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.250
What do I mean by genius?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.860
It's a big word.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.270
Do I mean just intelligent?

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.220
Someone with a high IQ?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.960
Absolutely not.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.940
Have you heard of Marilyn
vos Savant, anyone?

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.730
High IQ.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.780
220.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.490
Perhaps the highest
ever recorded.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.140
She hasn't accomplished,
with all due respect to her,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.300
that much in the way of
creative achievement.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.040
William Shockley.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.390
Should be a familiar name here.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.640
Nobel Prize winner,
inventor of the transistor.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.020
One of the fathers,
really, of Silicon Valley.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.970
IQ of 140.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.050
Not so high.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.960
Not bad, but not so high.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.800
So I'm talking about
creative genius,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.290
genius where you're creating
something for the ages.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.120
And now if you apply
for a US patent,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.610
you have to meet three criteria.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.310
You have to invent
something that's

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.120
new, useful, and surprising.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.530
You need all three.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.780
You know, if I were to
invent a new coffee mug that

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.510
was fluorescent orange,
well, that would

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.745
be new and vaguely useful
because I could spot it

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:48.340
in the dark, but
not so surprising.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.460
You haven't made
that conceptual leap.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.950
I couldn't invent a coffee
mug with no bottom, which

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.000
would definitely be
new and surprising, not

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.609
particularly useful.

00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:00.150
If I invent a coffee
mug that doubles

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.230
as a flash drive and
folds in your back pocket,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.930
now we're talking
about something.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.070
And also, I believe strongly
you cannot separate the creative

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.220
act and the recognition
of the creative act.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.980
You can be doing the most
amazing work here in Google.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.610
If it's not
recognized by someone,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.370
it's almost as if
it doesn't exist.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.190
Which is sad, but true.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.780
So really, one important
aspect of genius, and maybe

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.980
the most important, is that
it is a social verdict.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.790
That we all agree as a
country and as a culture

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.620
who the geniuses are.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.860
If you're tinkering in your
garage and you're recognized,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.980
then you're a genius.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.790
If you're not, you're just some
guy tinkering in his garage.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.450
You may be recognized
years later.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.430
But if it takes a
village to raise a child,

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.080
as the African proverb
goes, it takes a genius

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.390
to raise-- I'm sorry.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.990
It takes a city
to raise a genius.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.510
That many people.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.260
Now there are a lot of myths
surrounding genius, myths that

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.020
are partially true and
which can be helpful,

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.330
but are myths nonetheless.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.220
One is that geniuses
are born, right?

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.390
This goes back, actually,
to the 19th century

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.480
and an odd English scientist
named Sir Francis Galton who

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.250
wrote a book called "Hereditary
Genius" who believed

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.860
genius was 100% genetic.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.090
And we still hold
on to that belief

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.790
that when someone is a child
prodigy, like a Mozart playing

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.960
the piano at age four and
composing at age eight,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.110
we think it must be genetic.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.160
In fact, psychologists
now estimate

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.570
that somewhere between
10%-- that genetics

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.486
account for somewhere
between 10% and 20%

00:07:37.486 --> 00:07:38.830
of the genius puzzle.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.830
Important, but not
the most important.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.700
Another myth is that geniuses
are made through hard work,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.750
and that it's all hard work.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.980
You've probably heard of the
10,000 hour rule, this notion

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.110
that you need to put in at
least 10,000 hours over a decade

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.880
to achieve mastery,
if not genius.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.480
And I don't want to be
dismissive of hard work.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.890
It's important.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.370
But there are lots of
hardworking people in North

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.234
Korea, but very few
geniuses, right?

00:08:08.234 --> 00:08:09.900
And it's not that
there's anything wrong

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.570
with them genetically.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.180
It's that the third element
is missing, which is place.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.410
So I believe that
geniuses are not born,

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.580
geniuses are not made,
geniuses are grown in the soil.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.336
The seed matters in the plant,
but you need to water it,

00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:26.960
and you need to have
the right climate,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.740
or nothing's going to happen.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.690
And it's always a
relationship, really,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.250
between the genius
and the place.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.230
Not always a comfortable
relationship, either.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.390
Freud had very mixed
feelings about his hometown,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.070
or where he lived most
of his life, Vienna.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.960
Socrates loved Athens and was
put to death by the Athenians.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.700
So it's a tense relationship,
but it is a relationship.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.510
So if you look around the world,
you look at a map historically,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.180
what do you see?

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:04.090
You don't see one genius popping
up in Montana, one in Bolivia,

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.500
and one in Redwood City.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.740
You know, you see
genius clusters, right?

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.910
Certain moments
in time and place

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.570
where you had just a
lot of brilliant minds

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.640
and great ideas blossoming
for some reason.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.950
And my book is largely
about those clusters.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.330
What was in the water back then?

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.710
Or if you like, what
were they smoking?

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.060
Um, but let's stick with--
let's stick with the water.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.000
What was in the water back then,
and can we bottle it, you know?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.660
What lessons can
we learn from it?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.880
So the book is a-- it's
a travel book because I

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.350
travel to these places.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.360
It's a historical book
because I travel back in time.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.530
It's a social science
book because I

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:52.380
read a lot of really dense,
boring papers on psychology

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.220
of creativity so
you don't have to

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.980
and try to distill the essence
of the lessons from it.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.390
And it's a kind of selfish
book on my part because, look.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.890
It's too late for
me to be a genius.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.920
That ship has sailed.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.840
But I have an
11-year-old daughter,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.510
and it's not too late for her.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.200
And she happens to be
adopted from Kazakhstan,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.230
so my wife and I don't
provide the genes,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.300
the nurture-- I'm sorry.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.466
We don't provide the nature.

00:10:17.466 --> 00:10:20.180
We provide the
nurture, 100% nurture.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.110
And so I wanted to know, can we
learn lessons from these places

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.270
and apply them to our lives?

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.160
So I'll just talk
briefly about some

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.225
of the places I visited,
some of the lessons

00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:34.980
I learned, and then I want to
open it up to conversation,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.110
to a discussion.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.860
Because if there's one
thing I've learned,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.120
it's that genius
is a conversation.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.946
It is a discussion.

00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:45.320
Let's take a look
at Athens, sort

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.680
of the cradle of
Western civilization

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.900
and certainly a genius cluster.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.710
Couple of observations about it.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.450
One is if you were to go back
to just before the Golden

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.220
Age of Athens and look around
at the Greek city-states--

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.680
and there were
hundreds of them--

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.350
you would not bet on Athens.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.630
You would not bet on Athens, OK?

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.850
The land was not
exactly fertile.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.510
In fact, it was pretty
arid and barren.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.220
There were other city-states
that were wealthier.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.442
They were stronger
militarily, like Sparta.

00:11:13.442 --> 00:11:14.400
It was not the biggest.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.960
So you wouldn't bet on Athens.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.730
But it had a few
things going for it.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.200
One is it had an
outward orientation.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.880
It had-- well, it had
the Port of Piraeus,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.850
and they were great sailors.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.850
And they borrowed/stole
ideas from others.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.050
The truth is that not
that much was actually

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.080
invented in ancient Athens.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.527
Not statuary.

00:11:39.527 --> 00:11:41.110
They borrowed that
from the Egyptians.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.290
Or mathematics.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.770
They borrowed that
from elsewhere.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.280
Or even drama.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.970
What they did was perfected it.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.580
Plato said what the Greeks
borrow from foreigners,

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.849
they perfect.

00:11:50.849 --> 00:11:52.890
You could argue-- and I'll
get to this in a bit--

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.740
that Silicon Valley is
somewhat the same way.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.180
That it's not necessarily
where ideas are born,

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.929
but where they come of age.

00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:01.470
Which you could
argue-- I would argue

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.450
is actually more important.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.910
They had-- this
discussion element

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.570
took place in symposia,
which literally

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.470
means drinking together.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.440
So next time you're invited to
a symposium, keep that in mind.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.930
And a brief aside about
alcohol, if we may,

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.130
because they actually--
the Greeks drank,

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.040
but they watered down
their wine five parts water

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.700
to two parts wine.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.630
Perhaps knowing, as
studies show today,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.770
that a little bit
of alcohol does

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.500
increase creative thinking,
but a lot of alcohol

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:40.259
makes you fall down and doesn't
produce much creativity at all.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.425
But these were free-- these
were mainly discussions.

00:12:42.425 --> 00:12:45.260
And I really do believe that
if alcohol or beverages,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.230
whether it's coffee in the
coffee houses of Vienna

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.610
or the Dana Street
roastery which

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.390
is my favorite place
in Mountain View,

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.720
it's a place for people to
get together and discuss.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.550
And in the symposia
in Athens, they

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.110
discussed everything,
everything under the sun.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.340
Poetry, philosophy,
whatever it was.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.140
And the real heart of the city
was the agora, the marketplace,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.250
where people came to trade.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.130
Philosophers were selling
their wares as well.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.940
And so another thing they
did, which sounds very basic,

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.600
is they walked.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.780
There was the peripatetic
school of philosophy,

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.310
which literally was a
walking school of philosophy,

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.790
walking and talking.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.957
And it turns out a lot of
geniuses have been big walkers.

00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:33.290
Charles Dickens would walk
through the streets of London

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.100
in the middle of the
night, turning over

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.420
the plot of "A Christmas
Carol," or whatever story

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.920
he was working on,
while the city slept.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.210
Mark Twain paced a lot.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.770
And down the road in
Stanford recently,

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.385
they did a study that looked
at the effects of walking

00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:50.400
and creative thinking, and found
that spending as little as 10

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.540
or 15 minutes on a
treadmill-- not even

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.050
outdoors-- on a treadmill
staring at a blank wall

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.610
will lead to more
of what's known

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.800
as divergent thinking,
creative thinking,

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.532
than if you're
just sitting still.

00:14:03.532 --> 00:14:04.990
The Greeks didn't
know any of this.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.760
They didn't know any
of these studies.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.070
But they sort of
knew it intuitively.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.790
Ultimately, Athens collapsed.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.087
And as I like to say,
these genius clusters all

00:14:16.087 --> 00:14:17.670
arised for different
reasons, but they

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.300
collapsed for the
same reason, which

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.490
is arrogance, what one historian
called a creeping vanity.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.450
It sort of seeps in.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:29.000
And I think all golden ages,
including this one, which

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.500
I consider a golden
age in Silicon Valley,

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.630
have to really be on guard
against arrogance and vanity.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.930
Which that's why I like
the phrase creeping

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.187
vanity, because it just
sort of sneaks up on you.

00:14:42.187 --> 00:14:43.020
Let's talk about it.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.720
Let's fast forward back to
Florence and to the Medicis

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.435
that I was speaking
about earlier.

00:14:51.435 --> 00:14:54.220
The fact is that
genius takes money.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.650
It takes some money.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.960
But it has to be
leveraged wisely.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.300
And the Medicis were
expert at doing that.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.500
A good example is,
again, Michelangelo

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:11.090
who was chosen by Pope Julius
II, who was a Medici himself,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.020
to paint the Sistine Chapel,
which we know of course admire.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.700
We all admire it.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.220
But Michelangelo was
not the obvious choice.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.240
OK, he was mainly a sculptor.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.830
He had focused on statuary.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.800
He did some painting,
but not a lot.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.510
Nothing on that scale.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.810
But what the Pope did
was bet on Michelangelo.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.330
Give him an impossible task.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.150
Give an unlikely person
an impossible task.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.400
And I don't know if
we do that today.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.040
We tend-- I'm not talking
about here at Google,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.805
but elsewhere perhaps.

00:15:46.805 --> 00:15:47.970
There's a caution.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.680
There's a safety
attitude of, I'm

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.340
going to hire someone for job
X who has done job X before.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:00.330
Not hire someone who's done job
X for job Y. The Medicis didn't

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.520
see it that way.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.770
But they placed a lot of wise
bets, and they knew their art,

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.500
and they leveraged
their money wisely.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.530
They also valued the manuscripts
from the ancient world,

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.610
from Greece and Rome.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.120
And a book back then
cost the equivalent

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.610
of what a car would cost today.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.070
So if you owned
100 books, it would

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.800
be like owning 100 cars today.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.799
It would be like, being,
I guess, Jerry Seinfeld

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:30.850
who owns 100 cars.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.170
But you had to know cars.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.090
You have to know
books back then.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.090
And they would mine
the books for wisdom

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.820
and then take it
to the next level.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.370
And they borrowed from
foreigners as well.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.105
But what they borrowed from
foreigners, they perfected.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.280
We're hopping around the
world and around time here,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.655
so I hope you
don't get whiplash.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.240
I want to talk about one
city that actually reminds me

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.410
of Silicon Valley a
lot, and that Edinburgh,

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.490
Scotland in the late
18th century, right?

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.067
This is the Scottish
Enlightenment.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.900
Some people call it the
Scotch Enlightenment

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.810
because they drank
a lot of scotch.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.990
But we'll call it by its
proper name, the Scottish

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.780
Enlightenment.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.579
So in this city of
45,000 people, small even

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:21.970
by the standards of its day, it
was-- or there's a good quote

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.500
here from a contemporary
Scottish writer.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.230
Tells you what it was
like in Edinburgh just

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.590
before this golden age.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.380
The city was inconvenient,
dirty, old fashioned,

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.840
alcoholic,
quarrelsome, and poor.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.337
Oosh.

00:17:37.337 --> 00:17:38.045
Yet it blossomed.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.480
It was the Silicon
Valley of its day

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.230
in that it was far removed
from the center of Europe

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.720
on the fringes.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.990
Silicon Valley, it's
not a coincidence

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.510
it grew up out west.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.550
A place where, as one of the
early founders of Silicon

00:17:54.550 --> 00:18:00.390
Valley said, out here if you
fail, your family won't know

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.900
and your neighbors won't care.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.900
All right?

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:08.020
And there was some
of that in Edinburgh.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.010
There was also, to get
back to this conversation,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.590
it took place everywhere.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.770
They had hundreds of
clubs, strange clubs,

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.190
like the 717 Club, where
they met at only 7:17 PM.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.660
The Oyster Club, which was
founded by Adam Smith and David

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.807
Hume, the philosopher.

00:18:24.807 --> 00:18:26.640
They would eat oysters,
which was considered

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.680
peasant food, drink claret,
red wine, and converse

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.780
about everything.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.595
And there was a lack
of specialization.

00:18:35.595 --> 00:18:37.730
That was true in Athens,
that was true in Florence,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.910
it was true in Edinburgh.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.435
And it's true that the fields
of sociology and geology

00:18:44.435 --> 00:18:46.900
and economics were all very
young back then, right?

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.060
So people had not
yet built fortresses

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.600
around their little
parcels of knowledge.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.670
I think that the reason we
don't have a Renaissance man

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.840
today-- or woman
today-- is largely

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.050
because of specialization.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.574
And at a dinner
party the other day

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:04.990
a friend said, well, of course
there's more specialization

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.490
today.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.090
The world's more complicated.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.580
I would argue the world is more
complicated because there's

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.960
more specialization.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.720
That specialization
certainly contributes

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.470
to the complicated
world we live in,

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.680
that people are rewarded
for knowing more

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.650
and more about less and less.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.000
That was not the
case in Edinburgh.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.800
And sort of the digital
technology of the day

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.936
was actually medicine.

00:19:31.936 --> 00:19:34.640
The school in
Edinburgh University

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.160
was the place for medicine.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.410
They were advances
in anesthesia,

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.160
and in all sorts of fields.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.410
And there was experimentation
and risk taking going on.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.590
There was a physician
named James Simpson

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:54.420
who wanted to test a
new type of anesthetic.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.960
And he had his friends over
for, like, a dinner party,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.962
and offered them
a liquid beverage.

00:19:58.962 --> 00:20:01.420
And apparently in Scotland,
people don't ask any questions.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.180
They will just drink
what's given to them.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.190
Turns out it was chloroform,
liquid chloroform.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:10.600
And the next morning the maid
found everyone passed out.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.430
He was lucky, because
any less and maybe they

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.500
wouldn't feel the
anesthetic effects anymore.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.370
They would have all been killed.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.490
Within a few years, chloroform
became the most widely used

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.272
form of anesthesia.

00:20:23.272 --> 00:20:24.980
But if you think about
it, it makes sense

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.560
that medicine has a
theoretical side, but also

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.490
a practical side.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.490
And the Scots were
great improvers.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.990
In fact, it was the
age of improvement.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.470
You know, they began with
building a better plow.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.975
They went on to
the steam engine.

00:20:36.975 --> 00:20:39.100
James Watt didn't actually
invent the steam engine.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.750
He invented a
better steam engine.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:46.540
And that reminded me of
Silicon Valley as well.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.210
There was also a lot of
complementary skills going on.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.315
There's-- I call this
compensatory genius.

00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:56.630
I was going to give an example,
but it involves a competing

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.610
company down the road.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:58.830
I won't give that example.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.502
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:59.502 --> 00:21:03.024
But two guys named
Steve, and one's better

00:21:03.024 --> 00:21:04.190
at something than the other.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.290
But no last names.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:13.910
The example in Edinburgh is
the founder of modern geology

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:17.510
was a man named James
Hutton, who was brilliant.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.030
I mean, he was the
first one to suggest,

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:24.700
through field research and
hard digging, literal digging

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.560
as well as
metaphorical, that, hey.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.880
Maybe the Earth is older than
6,000 years as the Bible says,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.870
and as everyone just
believed back then.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.010
Maybe it's a lot older.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.730
As of course we know it is
now, but it was a radical idea.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.910
He wrote up his paper.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.870
The problem was that Hutton was
a terrible, terrible writer.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.480
Turgid, dry prose.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.825
Nobody could get through it.

00:21:43.825 --> 00:21:45.450
But he had a friend
named John Playfair

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.200
who had a way with words.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.620
He spiced up his paper, made
it much more compelling.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.130
Ultimately presented it to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.920
And those ideas went on to
influence Darwin and Darwin's

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.370
theory of natural selection.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.510
Compensatory genius.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:08.980
One genius compensating for
the shortcomings of another.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.690
And usually one gets more credit
than the other, unfortunately.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.360
But throughout history
in all these places,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.540
there are always
invisible helpers,

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.250
people who are working
behind the scenes.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.980
In Florence, it was-- well,
Lorenzo wasn't exactly

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.460
totally invisible.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.010
But a priest named
Niccolo Bichiellini was.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.730
He worked in a church
called Santo Spirito.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.460
And Michelangelo was just coming
into his own as a sculptor,

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.765
and he wanted to understand
how the human body worked.

00:22:41.765 --> 00:22:43.690
And the only way to
really understand it--

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.398
it's a little disgusting,
but it's true--

00:22:45.398 --> 00:22:47.910
is to dissect a cadaver
and figure it out.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.235
That was absolutely forbidden.

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:51.314
The Church would not allow it.

00:22:51.314 --> 00:22:53.355
But he went to the Church
of Santo Spirito, which

00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:55.210
also had a mortuary
and a hospital,

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.000
as churches did then,
and said to the priest,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.380
I'd like to dissect a cadaver.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.980
The priest agreed, under
the cover of darkness,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.630
to allow Michelangelo to
do that, which gave him

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.570
the understanding
of the anatomy,

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.500
gave him the ability
to ultimately sculpt

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.240
the "David," which
we all admire today.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.460
So you have to give credit
to people like Bichiellini,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.130
to these invisible helpers.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.130
And so to sum up, before
we go to questions,

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.160
I believe that in all creative
places and all places where

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.230
you see genius, there
are invisible helpers.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.480
There is a creative ecology,
an actual ecology in place.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:40.420
And that it is the process that
matters more than the product.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:45.364
The product of the
Renaissance was largely art.

00:23:45.364 --> 00:23:46.530
But the process-- I'm sorry.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.321
The product-- yeah.

00:23:47.321 --> 00:23:48.240
The product was art.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.570
The process was a particular
way of bringing that art

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.740
to fruition.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.890
The product of this
place, of Silicon Valley,

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.851
is largely technology.

00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:01.100
But I don't believe Silicon
Valley is about technology

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.679
at all.

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:02.970
It is about a creative ecology.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:07.950
It is about a way of
bringing ideas to fruition.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.170
I'm generally wary of tying
things up in a neat bow

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:12.880
and saying, OK.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.007
Here are three Ts with three Bs.

00:24:16.007 --> 00:24:17.590
But I realize people
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.400
So at the end of my book
I have the three Ds,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.340
and I'll just discuss
them very briefly here

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.240
about what I think all
these places have in common,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.230
these genius clusters.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.170
And then I want to
go to your questions.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.680
The three D's are Diversity,
Discernment, Disorder.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.710
Diversity, not only
ethnic diversity.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.110
In fact, I would argue
that ethnic diversity

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.020
is less important than
intellectual diversity.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.126
Diversity of ideas,
that openness

00:24:43.126 --> 00:24:45.125
to experience that
psychologists have identified

00:24:45.125 --> 00:24:48.490
as the single most important
trait for creativity,

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.590
for creative people and
for creative places.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.640
Diversity and openness.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.500
Number two is
discernment, which tends

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.480
to get less attention than
diversity and openness.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.740
But you can't just
have a lot of ideas

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.310
and treat them all equally,
like they're all equally good.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.840
They're not.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.510
Jonas Salk, two time-- no.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.460
Two time Nobel Prize winner was
asked by a student, Dr. Salk,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.160
how do you come up with
so many good ideas?

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.010
And Jonas Salk said,
well, it's easy.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.840
You come up with lots of ideas
and you throw out the bad ones.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.940
But you need to throw
out the bad ones.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.220
So these genius clusters
are magnets, yes.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.980
But they're also colanders
that sift out the bad ideas

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.550
and leave the good.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.500
Disorder.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.180
As I mentioned, these
were unlikely places,

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.190
these golden ages.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.340
And their golden age
was often preceded

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.370
by disruption and disorder.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.980
In the case of Athens, it was
the Persian War, which they

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.250
won, but their city was sacked.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.010
I mean, Athens was burnt
to the ground, which

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.020
meant it had to be
rebuilt. And Pericles

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.590
built it much, much better.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.090
Built the Acropolis, which
we still admire today.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:01.050
In Florence, it was the
bubonic plague, which wiped out

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.240
a third of the population.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.976
But two generations later,
you've got the Renaissance.

00:26:06.976 --> 00:26:08.850
And I think there's a
connection, because you

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.810
need a stirring of the pot.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.980
And there's a lot of
fascinating research

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.850
out there in the
early stages looking

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.500
at the connection between
chaos theory and creativity.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.850
And there is a connection.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.040
Chaos, I believe,
is a necessary state

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.910
to pass through in order
to get to a new order.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.460
And that chaos is something--
you see this with geniuses

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.800
on a personal level.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.770
If you've seen-- well,
Einstein's hair or Beethoven's

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.560
apartments-- well, he had
multiple apartments in Vienna

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.090
and they were total
pig stys and messes.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.770
And there have
been studies done--

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.540
and this will be
reassuring for people

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.910
who have messy desks-- that
show in a messy office setting,

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.669
you will think more
creatively than in a neat one.

00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:49.710
You may think creatively.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.370
I don't know if you get those
ideas down on a screen or not.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:53.900
That's another story.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.954
So diversity,
disorder, discernment.

00:26:57.954 --> 00:26:58.870
It's a simplification.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.180
It's a little bow.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.890
There's a lot more
to it than that.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:03.850
It's all in here.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.760
And it's fun too.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.090
I mean, I think that
researching a serious topic

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:13.400
like creative genius can
be fun, and I have fun.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.970
I meet some amazing
characters on the road.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:21.200
And I approach the book the
way Socrates suggests it,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.340
from a place of ignorance.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.440
That the only thing I
know is that I don't know,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.980
and then I set out to learn.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.667
And so with that, I'd be
happy to take any questions.

00:27:29.667 --> 00:27:31.000
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.166
ERIC WEINER: You're welcome.

00:27:32.166 --> 00:27:35.115
MALE SPEAKER: And before
we open it up more widely,

00:27:35.115 --> 00:27:37.320
you've written two
geography books now,

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.860
"The Geography of Bliss" and
"The Geography of Genius."

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.140
I was wondering what you think
are sort of any intersections

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.450
or common themes which
are good for both,

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.030
and any contradictions,
if you will?

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.371
ERIC WEINER: Well,
Switzerland's a good example.

00:27:52.371 --> 00:27:54.120
One of the happiest
countries in the world

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.870
statistically, if you
look at the surveys.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.730
And it's included in my book
"The Geography of Bliss."

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:02.110
But as Graham Greene said about
Switzerland, ah, the Swiss.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.680
500 years of peace and
democracy, and what have they

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.370
brought the world
but the cuckoo clock?

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.590
Which is actually not true.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.173
The Germans invented
the cuckoo clock.

00:28:10.173 --> 00:28:12.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.980
I think there's probably,
like, if it's a Venn diagram,

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.970
is there an intersection between
happiness and creative genius?

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:20.650
A little bit.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:24.140
I think if you're
really-- a lot of geniuses

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.655
have been depressives, right?

00:28:25.655 --> 00:28:27.280
They've suffered from
manic depression,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.439
they've suffered from
clinical depression.

00:28:29.439 --> 00:28:31.480
But they don't really do
their most creative work

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.340
when they're really in the
throes of the black dog,

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.270
as depression's been called.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:41.610
So I think a little bit of that
unhappiness and instability

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.810
is good.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:47.460
But you can be a happy genius
too, a relatively happy genius.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.200
I think there's some overlap.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.090
But I think someone or someplace
that was perfectly happy--

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.000
say paradise.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.760
If paradise existed,
it would probably

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.960
be the least creative
place in the world.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.030
Because creativity, I believe,
is a reaction to a challenge.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.470
And there are no challenges
in paradise, right?

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.090
Everything is given to you.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.720
So like so many things in
this book, it is a sweet spot.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.330
A sweet spot between being an
insider and being an outsider.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.416
I write about immigrant--
[INAUDIBLE] immigrants

00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:17.040
and creativity.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.490
And sweet spot between
happiness and misery, basically.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.291
Other questions?

00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:25.290
MALE SPEAKER: Questions?

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.090
Yeah.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.840
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.130
AUDIENCE: So if you're
trying to anticipate where

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:37.005
the next, like, locus of
genius would be, well,

00:29:37.005 --> 00:29:38.130
are you willing to do that?

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.784
And what would you look for?

00:29:39.784 --> 00:29:41.200
ERIC WEINER: I
could say anything.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.650
You know, I think--
this question comes up,

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:50.370
and you know, I could say,
like, Ecuador, but not

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.580
for another 10,000 years.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.700
That would be the safest bet.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.170
The honest answer
is, I don't know.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.132
But we can say with-- not to
pick on the North Koreans.

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:03.590
I don't know if there's anyone
from North Korea here today.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:07.344
But it's not going to
be North Korea, OK?

00:30:07.344 --> 00:30:09.260
It's not going to be a
place like North Korea.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:09.926
We can say that.

00:30:09.926 --> 00:30:12.020
It's not going to be a
closed system like that.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.980
It's going to be an open--
place with an open system,

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.250
and a place with a
culture, a strong culture.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:24.560
Let's look at
Estonia, for instance.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.519
OK, usually people
don't know this,

00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:28.560
but I'm willing to bet
100% of people in the room

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.240
know that Skype was
developed in Estonia.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.530
That seems odd to some people.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.880
Small country, but
small can be good.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.000
A strong culture.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.220
They were never really russified
under the Soviet Union.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.102
Open, free flow of information,
geographically well positioned.

00:30:47.102 --> 00:30:51.520
It's between Russia
and Western Europe.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.730
That strikes me as a place
where things can happen.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.280
But the specific
place-- I mean, I

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.130
would be lying to you
if I were to say, it's

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.520
going to be right there.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.420
What I can say is
that it will not

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.930
be manufactured, this place.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.630
It will not be contrived.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:09.650
This has been tried.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.990
You know about Silicon
Wadi, Thames Valley.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.420
There have been so many attempts
to replicate this place,

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.060
and they have all failed because
I believe Silicon Valley is

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.020
a culture, and you cannot
transplant a culture.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.326
It just doesn't work that way.

00:31:27.326 --> 00:31:27.825
Yes?

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:34.305
AUDIENCE: So universities will
traditionally fit those three

00:31:34.305 --> 00:31:36.010
Ds that you talk about, right?

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.750
Generally, a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] have the culture.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.361
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:42.361 --> 00:31:43.110
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.540
I would take a little
exception with that.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.440
But is your question about--

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:47.850
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering-- I mean,

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.360
what are the track
record of universities

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.526
through history [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:50.526 --> 00:31:51.870
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.550
That's an interesting question,
because the relationship

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:59.370
between, say, education
and genius is curvilinear.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.501
A little bit of education's
good, but a lot is not so good.

00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:03.000
In fact--

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.080
No, I'm serious.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.230
And that's true with
happiness, by the way, too.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:10.520
If you have a PhD, you are
statistically less likely to be

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.890
a genius than if you don't.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.040
And by the way, you're
statistically less

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.766
likely to be happy than--

00:32:15.766 --> 00:32:16.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:16.702 --> 00:32:19.380
--than someone with
just a master's degree.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.370
But if you think
about it, I think

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.570
this is not a coincidence.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.010
Because you are-- you're
specializing, right?

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.550
More and more.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.560
And there's a long line of
geniuses who were bad students.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.460
Einstein was-- he
hated high school.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.320
I mean, he almost
gave up science

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.230
because of the exam system,
which he found stifling.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:42.750
He had difficulty getting his
PhD dissertation accepted.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.110
And I mean, I won't
name names here,

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:50.100
but Silicon Valley is littered
with college dropouts.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.530
Woody Allen was college dropout.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:56.520
One of the courses he
failed was film at NYU.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.900
But it makes sense in the level
that if a university represents

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.280
the status quo, the status
quo of knowledge and learning,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.950
and the genius is
upsetting that status quo,

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.340
they're going to have to
be outside the system.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.250
There are exceptions.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.730
This could go back to Edinburgh.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:16.310
The university played
a helpful role there,

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.680
partly because it was an
entrepreneurial university

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.190
system.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.480
Like Stanford and Fred
Terman under Stanford

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.400
who broke down the wall between
commerce and university.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.299
In Edinburgh, professors
got paid on commission.

00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:29.965
The more students
they had in the class,

00:33:29.965 --> 00:33:31.330
the more they got paid.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.690
And they would use the students
to test fly their theories.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:37.239
Adam Smith first
presented his ideas, which

00:33:37.239 --> 00:33:38.780
are found in "The
Wealth of Nations,"

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.300
to a group of students
who were-- average age

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.920
was 14 or 15 years old.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.120
So that was a pretty-- if it's
the right kind of university

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.060
system, it can play
a positive role.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.650
But the track record is not
as clear as what you'd think,

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.580
that just more education
equals more creative genius.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.480
It doesn't work that way.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.124
Yeah.

00:33:57.124 --> 00:33:57.624
Yes?

00:34:01.922 --> 00:34:03.380
AUDIENCE: In your
research, did you

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.080
come across any patterns that
caused the slow of growth

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.409
in creative genius?

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:11.520
Like, when did Athens become
not a place to do that?

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.310
ERIC WEINER: I think
it was arrogance.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:16.254
It was this creeping vanity.

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:20.330
And that's what happened is
either places become arrogant

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.699
and therefore they
become less ignorant,

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:25.553
which is bad-- they close
their mind to the possibility

00:34:25.553 --> 00:34:27.219
of possibility because
they're convinced

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:30.360
they know exactly how do it.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.389
There's also this kind of
obscure theory from the 1940

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:37.029
called configurations of culture
growth by this anthropologist

00:34:37.029 --> 00:34:38.000
named Kroeber.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.750
And the way I
translate his ideas,

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.989
it's like you have
a kitchen cupboard,

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:44.699
and you're trying to cook.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:48.630
And ultimately-- you can combine
them in different ways, right?

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.260
You know, there are
those apps where

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.759
you put in the
ingredients you have,

00:34:51.759 --> 00:34:53.540
and they give you
dishes you can make.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.750
At some point, you run out
of combinations, right?

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.640
So you have to import
more ingredients

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.740
or do something drastic.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.670
But at some point, cultures just
start to plagiarize themselves.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:10.480
And so I say either
arrogance or kind

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.060
of a staleness, the staleness
that comes from closing off.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.130
Athens was very
open to foreigners

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:20.680
during its golden age, and
then it became less so.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.390
They also-- I should
issue this is a warning.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.935
You could trace their decline to
when they became real foodies.

00:35:27.935 --> 00:35:29.810
Because before, they
were not foodies at all.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:30.410
No, really.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.890
They had, like, very plain,
bland food, a meager diet.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.670
And Aristophanes, the
satirical playwright,

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.770
attributed their genius
to their meager diet.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.170
Then they got into--
you know, started

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.355
shopping at Williams-Sonoma.

00:35:43.355 --> 00:35:43.855
And--

00:35:43.855 --> 00:35:44.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.240
--or the equivalent back then.

00:35:48.804 --> 00:35:50.970
It's being a little flippant,
but you think about it

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.720
like there's an opportunity cost
to all your creative energy.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.070
If you put it all into
cooking, how much more

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.445
do you have left
over for poetry?

00:35:57.445 --> 00:35:59.640
I don't know.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.911
Anyway.

00:36:00.911 --> 00:36:02.550
Hope that helps.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.340
Other questions?

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:05.840
Yes?

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.630
AUDIENCE: So you looked
classical cultures

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.540
and I guess post-Renaissance
or enlightenment cultures.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.080
Did you look at anything like
Arabic or Chinese cultures

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.740
around, say, 1000 AD?

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.050
Places where there are lots
and lots of creative genius

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.720
and that seemed to fade?

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:28.080
ERIC WEINER: I went
to China and focused

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.590
on Hangzhou China, which
was the capital of the Song

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.770
dynasty in the 13th century.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.660
A city that blew away
Marco Polo, for one.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.800
He wrote about it.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.710
And they invented-- essentially
invented the compass.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.330
Wood block printing was
invented and first used

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:47.070
in Buddhist monasteries.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.550
It was a city of
a million people.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.870
A million people
in the year, like,

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:55.360
1250 when the biggest city in
Europe was maybe 50,000 people.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.720
And it was remarkable.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.270
And I-- I mean, I get into
some of the differences

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:04.110
between Eastern--
Eastern-- Chinese Confucian

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.740
views on creativity
and Western views.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.930
And there's a lot of
interesting research on this.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.520
A lot of our views
about creativity

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.560
come from our creationists.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.250
Judeo Christian, in the
case of this country.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.320
Whether you're religious
or not, whether you're

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.111
Judeo or Christian.

00:37:20.111 --> 00:37:25.070
I mean, this idea of creation ex
nihilo, something from nothing,

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:29.520
is really part of our DNA,
speaking metaphorically, DNA.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.480
But in China, the
creation myth is

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.980
that there's always
been something,

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.280
and always will be something.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.700
That's a more cyclical
view, and you're just

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.900
sort of rearranging it.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:42.030
So they've always had, I
think, a more gradual approach

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.740
to innovation, which
I find interesting.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.220
And one of the
conclusions I reach

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.010
is that creative places
and creative people

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:54.630
were always more solidly rooted
in tradition than we think,

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.100
even this place.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.750
That Isaac Newton
famously said he

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.489
could see so far by standing
on the shoulders of giants.

00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:03.780
Well, we're always standing
on the shoulders of giants,

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.510
whether we
acknowledge it or not.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.369
In China, and to some
extent in India--

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:10.660
you know, in the Indian
creation myth at the beginning,

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.190
there was chaos, actually.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.870
That's their myth.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.170
Anyway, I do address--
I made a point

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:21.010
to try to get out of Western
Europe and to go to China.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:27.460
And I go to Calcutta in the
20th-- late 19th, early 20th

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.790
century to look at the
Bengal Renaissance.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:33.385
And I go to Vienna and
look at the musical genius

00:38:33.385 --> 00:38:39.620
and the genius of Freud and
others of 1900, and Scotland.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.470
And I end up here.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:43.570
Yes?

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.700
Almost have the
[INAUDIBLE] right here.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.710
AUDIENCE: This is
more an observation,

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:56.050
and I was just wondering
if you could comment on it.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.260
I sort of see a
running theme here

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.030
about looking at the
role of the urban space

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.700
and the city space as central
to the kinds of movements

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.950
that you're describing, right?

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:08.741
ERIC WEINER: Right.

00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:10.770
AUDIENCE: And I'm also
hearing these ideas

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:15.150
about the urban commons
and a culture that

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.740
encourages walking and
sort of ad hoc running

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.650
into people with whom you can
have a conversation, et cetera.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.390
And here in America,
the last 50 years

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:28.520
we have flown to
suburbia, and we have

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.110
cities that get interesting.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.160
The immediate sort
of thing that happens

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.060
after that is gentrification
because the spaces

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.380
are getting interesting again.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.440
And I was always-- I was
really pleasantly surprised

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.070
visiting Sydney earlier this
year, earlier last year,

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.330
and looking at how
the city was really

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:51.750
built around walking and
taking public transportation,

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.060
and entering large,
open spaces in the heart

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.547
of the city, et cetera.

00:39:55.547 --> 00:39:57.380
And I just feel like--
especially, you know,

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.838
I don't know if
you know about sort

00:39:58.838 --> 00:40:01.430
of debates in San Francisco
about who's city is it,

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:03.260
and what's happening to it?

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:07.230
I just feel like the way we
are dealing with urban space

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:11.390
planning and the culture of
urban spaces are interesting.

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.820
They're not conducive
to the kind of-- yeah.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.850
From what I'm hearing,
they're not conducive.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.100
Or is it not?

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.360
ERIC WEINER: Well, if
there's less mixing going on.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.150
I mean, cities-- it's
been said that cities

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.570
are where ideas go to have sex.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.070
Which--

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:29.670
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:32.020
And there's some truth to that.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:36.440
But you need to have-- to carry
this metaphor perhaps a little

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.390
too far, you need to have
different ideas having sex

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.410
and not just the same two.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:45.304
And you need to have a
mix of things going on.

00:40:45.304 --> 00:40:47.470
And you need to have a
degree of trust and intimacy.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.330
Because you know, there's
a very strong theory

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.690
out there about
density and creativity,

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.140
that it's all really
about density.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.780
Like molecules in a container.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.740
The more molecules you have
moving around very fast,

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.590
bounce into each other, forming
different compounds, then

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.770
the more molecules you have, the
more interesting combinations

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:07.890
you'll get.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.370
And it's called
interaction opportunities.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:14.330
And I see some-- definitely
there's some validity to that.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:16.940
But prisons are
dense places too.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:17.760
Slums-- no.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.964
The slums of-- slums
of Mumbai, right?

00:41:22.964 --> 00:41:24.880
There's the famous one
right near the airport.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.390
You know--

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.140
AUDIENCE: Dharavi.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.140
ERIC WEINER: Dharavi, right.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:32.210
Dharavi slum is
incredibly dense.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:35.220
And I'm not denying there's
some creativity going

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.050
on in terms of
how people survive

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:38.530
to get through each day.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:41.577
But there's not a lot of
genius, as we would call it,

00:41:41.577 --> 00:41:42.410
coming out of there.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:43.870
So it takes more
than just density.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:47.440
I think it takes some
intimacy and trust, right?

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.190
You need to trust someone
enough to share their ideas.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:55.990
An interesting little factoid,
if you will, that I came across

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.380
is a study that found that
we cooperate best with those

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.170
with whom we once competed.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.980
With cooperate best
with former competitors.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.540
It seems to be the
case here where

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.930
there's a lot of that going on.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:15.070
Because you've built up actually
some trust through competition.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.270
So I don't if I'm directly
answering your question.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.950
But cities are important.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.140
Designing cities-- if you look
at the cities around the world

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.650
that truly are artificial,
like Brasilia or Ankara

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.360
or Islamabad, they tend
to be not the most vibrant

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.670
creatively, right?

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:35.890
It needs to be
something organic.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.950
But one mystery--
and I have to admit,

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.200
there are plenty of mysteries
remaining in this book--

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.170
is this place, Silicon Valley.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.550
It's the one outlier.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.640
Did not begin as a city, right?

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.740
Began as orchards.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.120
Began as farmland
and small towns.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.127
And that's the exception.

00:42:52.127 --> 00:42:54.460
You really would have expected,
if you look historically

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.960
at all these places
I did, you would

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.840
have expected Silicon Valley to
begin on Market Street in San

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.080
Francisco and to
spread down here,

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.885
and not to go the other way.

00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:05.520
I haven't figured
that one out yet.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.560
So if you have
ideas, let me know.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.332
Yes?

00:43:08.332 --> 00:43:11.780
Drink of water, one second.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.787
AUDIENCE: So your
[INAUDIBLE] diversity.

00:43:15.787 --> 00:43:18.122
That's the new
concept [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:18.122 --> 00:43:21.780
Do you think these places
that you identified

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.170
have more diversity in
some sense, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.340
maybe more travelers
will come to the place

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.440
or different
religions [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:35.047 --> 00:43:36.630
ERIC WEINER:
Immigration, I would say.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:39.410
I mean, first diversity
of people, which

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.190
leads to diversity of ideas.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:46.531
And I've written-- I wrote an
article in the "Wall Street

00:43:46.531 --> 00:43:48.530
Journal" this past weekend
about this connection

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.900
between immigration
and creative genius.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.170
And there's a long list
of immigrants and refugees

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:57.100
who've become
geniuses, you know?

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.805
Whether it's Thomas
Mann or Einstein who

00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:04.320
was twice over an immigrant.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.190
Marie Curie, who moved
from Poland to Paris.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.140
And so what is it about the
immigrant experience that

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.140
makes them creative?

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.220
And it's not just
that they work hard.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.050
I mean, that might
explain their success,

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:19.029
but doesn't explain
the creative leap.

00:44:19.029 --> 00:44:21.570
I think it's because their world
has been turned upside down.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.770
They're bringing a
fresh perspective.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:28.560
And they bring
diversity to a place,

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.960
and then that has like a
contagion effect, actually.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.050
It's not that immigrants
just bring their ideas

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.710
and everyone says, oh.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:38.402
They use chopsticks in China.

00:44:38.402 --> 00:44:39.860
We're going to use
chopsticks here.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:40.090
No.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:40.900
It's like, oh.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.460
There's some other
way of eating other

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:47.040
than using a fork and
spoon, and maybe there's

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.840
other ways of
doing other things.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.600
So it opens your mind to the
possibility of possibility.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.310
And that, I think, is the
real value of diversity

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.180
and of immigration.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.280
It's not that, oh.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.210
We're just going to import
that idea wholesale.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:06.580
We might adopt that idea-- adapt
it rather, to our own needs.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.140
Or we might just
find another field.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.200
I mean, there's a creativity
contagion that goes on.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.790
Like Vienna of 1900s,
a perfect example.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:16.790
So you had the
Secessionist movement

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.380
in art led by Gustav Klimt.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.210
A whole new art movement.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:22.430
And then you've got
advances in physics

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.850
and you've got Freud
with his theories.

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:28.100
And what happens is I think
people see breakthroughs

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.375
in one field and they lead
to breakthroughs in others.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:38.630
And perhaps you see that here
in Silicon Valley as well.

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.225
Yes?

00:45:40.225 --> 00:45:41.000
OK, Yes?

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:48.260
AUDIENCE: Yes, I have--
I have equations.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:56.740
So the recent academic
Joseph Tainter who studied,

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:01.939
tried to make some sort of a
quantitative study of, let's

00:46:01.939 --> 00:46:02.980
say, creative throughput.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.300
So he and a few other
academics set up

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.710
this database of
all the US patents

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:11.960
and then tried to analyze
it, then tried to see what--

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.960
ERIC WEINER: Yeah,
this sounds familiar.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.459
Yes.

00:46:13.459 --> 00:46:16.590
AUDIENCE: --what
trends they can see.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:24.740
And what they found out is this
decrease in [INAUDIBLE]-- well,

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:30.470
a decrease in number of patents
for scientific [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.000
or engineering [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.430
So-- and he was really trying
to study sort of creativity,

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:39.420
but that's a proxy.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.570
He can study creativity.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:41.610
ERIC WEINER: It gives
you some numbers.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:42.220
Data, right?

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.850
Everyone loves data.

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:48.770
AUDIENCE: And he sort
of explains it partly

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:49.700
in the following way.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.430
He says at the time
of Newton or Darwin,

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:57.280
you could have sort of a loan,
reasonably wealthy person

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.750
with a laboratory
in the basement

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:06.780
and making really
impactful inventions.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.940
And he says now
that time is gone.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.940
You really need very
expensive equipment.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.564
You need a--

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:14.730
ERIC WEINER: Specialization.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:15.855
AUDIENCE: --specialization.

00:47:15.855 --> 00:47:19.100
You need a lot of people
helping you to operate.

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.950
And so he basically
says, well, there

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:28.900
are these-- there are these
great, impactful inventions.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.440
He calls them,
like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.660
Like a lightbulb.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.350
So that was already invented,
and gravity was already

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.680
[INAUDIBLE] gravity
was discovered.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.780
And he says now the inventions
are sort of further--

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.240
more difficult to make.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.810
And so-- and he isn't
making a statement.

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:50.620
He's sort of asking questions.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.480
In one of the lectures
he's asks, well,

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:58.110
is it the case-- I mean, is
the creative sort of throughput

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:01.240
coming to-- becoming diminished?

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.040
Do we need to invest
more and more resources

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.220
to have the same level
of creative throughput?

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.100
And so what is your sense?

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.370
ERIC WEINER: Well, I mean,
there-- it's definitely--

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:15.210
it's true, and it's been shown
by other researchers too that

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:19.560
we're-- we have fewer
real breakthroughs, right?

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.160
Where is the Darwin or
the Einstein of our day

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.720
who make a real leap?

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.770
And I think it's because
of specializations.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:31.000
Because, as you say, it's more
expensive to-- even though

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.400
in a lot of fields
like the digital fields

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.670
that you work in, it's
much easier for anyone

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:40.670
to get involved, I suppose,
to find a cure for cancer

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.390
or to do some real
breakthrough work.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:46.090
The costs have actually gotten
higher, you could argue.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.360
So there are fewer
scientific breakthroughs

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.210
today than in centuries past.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.220
I think we've raised the floor.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.330
Like, there are more talented
people in centuries past.

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:59.130
But we've actually
lowered the ceiling.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:04.240
I would point a finger
again at specialization,

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.220
that even a Darwin was crossing
over boundaries from botany

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.110
to biology that
maybe today there

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.480
would be a wall between them.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.490
Einstein was
crossing boundaries.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:21.190
I think we need to have
more of a porousness

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:25.430
and an amateur culture in a way.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:27.080
This place, Silicon
Valley, grew out

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.430
of tinkering, first
with ham radio

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.220
and then with motherboards.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.770
But if it requires
an institution

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.320
and a big, expensive institution
to make a breakthrough,

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.028
you're going to have
fewer breakthroughs.

00:49:40.028 --> 00:49:42.860
I mean, Google would
have never started

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.630
if it required an
institution to start it.

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:48.544
Yes sir?

00:49:48.544 --> 00:49:50.210
AUDIENCE: So I have
read your previous--

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:51.551
ERIC WEINER: Oh, sorry.

00:49:51.551 --> 00:49:52.050
Oh, hold on.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:52.950
One question here.

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:53.825
I didn't-- I'm sorry.

00:49:53.825 --> 00:49:54.755
I apologize.

00:49:54.755 --> 00:49:56.880
AUDIENCE: I wanted to go
back to your-- the earlier

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.520
question about decline of
creative locations today.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.420
And so you talked about Athens,
it being arrogance and maybe

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.630
a declining interest in
other ideas, outside ideas.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:11.680
And I think there's some saying,
as will happen in phases.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.319
That's happening now
in Silicon Valley,

00:50:13.319 --> 00:50:14.360
or there are signs of it.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.401
What's your take on that?

00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:17.930
Do you see any signs of
those things happening?

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.000
ERIC WEINER: I was
waiting for this question.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.720
AUDIENCE: Or other
signs of decline?

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.062
ERIC WEINER: I was actually
pleasantly surprised

00:50:22.062 --> 00:50:24.270
so many questions have been
not about Silicon Valley.

00:50:27.826 --> 00:50:30.200
I'm thinking about what I say
and whether I'll be invited

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.820
back based on what I say.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.930
How about just an
honest answer, yes.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.150
I do see some of that.

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:41.700
I think-- I lived in Palo
Alto about a decade ago.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.330
I was at Stanford University
doing a fellowship.

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.950
And since that decade
when I come back,

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.820
I see more bling, for
lack of a better word.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.260
Flashiness.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.210
And I think bling
is antithetical

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.260
to creative genius.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.080
You need the constraints
and the hardship.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:02.000
Every company that's
admired in the Valley,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.270
whether it's Hewlett and Packard
in their garage, you know,

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.550
or your two founders,
you know, they

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:09.650
didn't work in great
circumstances, right?

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:11.330
They had constraints.

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:15.300
And once you remove
all those constraints

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.710
and you replace
it with bling, you

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:22.665
might slip into arrogance
and complacency.

00:51:22.665 --> 00:51:25.820
But I think people are on
guard about it here, right?

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.670
I think especially
what Silicon Valley

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:32.110
does well is it appreciates
the value of smallness, right?

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.300
And help me out here, but
isn't there an attempt

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.460
to keep work groups
small, to work in teams?

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.875
To create-- just looking
around at the architecture

00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:43.770
of the place, there are
lots of small spaces.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.410
I mean, it's a big,
sprawling campus,

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.110
but with lots of
nooks and crannies.

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:50.730
And nooks and crannies are
where creativity happens.

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.580
I think that's good.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:56.630
I think immigration is still
a big part of life here.

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.990
Half of all Silicon
Valley startups

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:01.426
have at least one founder
who's born outside of US.

00:52:01.426 --> 00:52:04.110
That's important.

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:05.730
There's an outward orientation.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:09.490
I mean, look at the faces
and the accents in this room.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:13.080
I mean, to me that's
proof positive that it's

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.750
doing some things right.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.230
But-- I mean, I hate
to be the bummer,

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:20.480
but looking historically,
these golden ages

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.720
don't last that long.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.790
They're pretty fragile
and perishable.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:25.950
A few decades, a
few generations,

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:28.210
maybe a century or so.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.880
And Silicon Valley's
had a good run.

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.820
And I'm not
predicting its demise,

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.730
but you can't-- you know, I'm
sure in Athens at its peak

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:40.130
and Renaissance Florence, they
never thought that they would

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:43.900
see their end any more than
people in Detroit did in 1950.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:48.630
So I see some signs, but
I also see some awareness

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:52.270
of those signs, which is good.

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:54.215
Yes?

00:52:54.215 --> 00:52:57.090
AUDIENCE: My question's
about competition.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:00.740
There was only one Athens at
the time of Athens, and only one

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.710
Edinburgh at the
time of Edinburgh.

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:06.160
If there are several, say,
Google, Apple, Facebook, et

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.720
cetera competing at the
same time, and each of them

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.000
is being a genius
nurturer, and they all

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.270
know that another institution
will eat their lunch if they

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:18.140
don't keep that
genius, can that help

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.840
to reduce the creeping vanity?

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.040
ERIC WEINER: Well, I
mean, there was one Athens

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:21.748
that we remember.

00:53:21.748 --> 00:53:24.149
Of course, there were many
city-states and they--

00:53:24.149 --> 00:53:25.440
we remember the winners, right?

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.170
So-- but yeah.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:31.120
Competition is like one
of the trickiest aspects

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.110
of this genius puzzle,
because the research

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:39.240
in the lab sort of contradicts
the research in the real world,

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.420
or the other way around.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.220
I'll give you an example.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.760
There's this theory called the
theory of intrinsic motivation.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.920
And psychologists at Harvard
have done a lot of work

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.340
with their colleagues on this.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.420
And essentially-- I'm
simplifying here--

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.440
but they'll have
people in a lab,

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.620
undergrads usually,
looking for money.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:59.120
You know?

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.400
But that's OK.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.500
They're valid.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:05.060
And one group will be given
material to build a collage,

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.080
and said, OK.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.230
You're going to build a collage,
and you'll be graded on it.

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:13.300
If you build a particularly
good one, you'll receive money

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.550
and your name will
be publicized.

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:16.890
Extrinsic motivation.

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:18.660
The other group is told, here.

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:19.260
Same material.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.460
Build a collage.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.260
Just have fun, you know?

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:26.250
And they find consistently
it's that second group that

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:27.890
is told just to have
fun that produces

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.510
the more creative work.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.690
That doesn't jive with what
I've found in these places.

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:34.985
Like, Athens was competitive.

00:54:34.985 --> 00:54:37.670
The Greeks brought us the
Olympics, for crying out loud.

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:39.390
Florence was hugely competitive.

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.110
Michelangelo and
Leonardo, for instance,

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:43.130
hated each other's
guts, but yet it

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.300
brought out the best in them.

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.520
And look at this place.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.490
I don't live and work
here, but I imagine

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.454
it's a little bit competitive.

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:52.190
No?

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.690
Yes.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:53.620
[LAUGH]

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:54.840
But also cooperative, right?

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.670
There's that combination.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:00.290
And I found one study that
I think explains a lot.

00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:03.930
Those collage studies
tend to focus on--

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.074
to use people who are
novices to building collages.

00:55:08.074 --> 00:55:09.490
But one study
looked at musicians,

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:11.560
but looked at
experienced musicians

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.780
and found that with
experienced musicians

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:16.290
when they were told to
improvise a piece of music,

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:20.010
and one group was given
intrinsic motivation, have fun,

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:24.720
and the other, extrinsic
motivation, cash, recognition,

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.140
the second group did well.

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.600
So my working theory on this
is if you're a beginner,

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:33.750
if you're starting out
playing the violin or coding,

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:34.980
competition's not good.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.175
You're going to freeze up.

00:55:36.175 --> 00:55:37.890
It's going to paralyze you.

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:40.870
But once you achieve
a degree of mastery,

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:42.330
the competition is good.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:46.334
And on a societal scale or
a place, geographic scale,

00:55:46.334 --> 00:55:47.250
what do you have here?

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:50.940
You have competition,
but competition

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.400
among people who have achieved
some mastery in their field.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:53.900
Go ahead.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.439
AUDIENCE: To achieve mastery
in the musician field

00:55:57.439 --> 00:55:58.980
requires lots of
intrinsic motivation

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.393
and lots of specialization.

00:56:00.393 --> 00:56:04.384
So I think you're looking at a
very select population there.

00:56:04.384 --> 00:56:05.050
ERIC WEINER: Hm.

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:07.602
Well, let me-- I'm going to
turn the question and ask you.

00:56:07.602 --> 00:56:09.060
Do you think that
competition plays

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.524
a positive role in Silicon
Valley, for instance?

00:56:11.524 --> 00:56:13.940
AUDIENCE: Well, you said earlier
that in paradise, there's

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:14.642
no challenges.

00:56:14.642 --> 00:56:15.110
ERIC WEINER: Right.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:16.985
AUDIENCE: You're not
talking about engineers.

00:56:16.985 --> 00:56:18.030
We love challenges.

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:20.184
We are intrinsically motivated.

00:56:20.184 --> 00:56:20.850
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:22.740
But are you
extrinsically motivated

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.839
by, say, being number one?

00:56:24.839 --> 00:56:25.380
AUDIENCE: No.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.724
ERIC WEINER: No?

00:56:26.724 --> 00:56:28.140
AUDIENCE: Being excellent, yes.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:30.028
Being number one, no.

00:56:30.028 --> 00:56:31.210
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.950
But that excellence comes
from your internal compass,

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:36.469
not from an external validation?

00:56:36.469 --> 00:56:37.260
I'm just wondering.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.165
I'm seriously curious.

00:56:39.165 --> 00:56:41.790
AUDIENCE: It helps to be able to
measure it, because otherwise,

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:42.680
how do I know?

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.471
ERIC WEINER: Right.

00:56:43.471 --> 00:56:45.650
AUDIENCE: But I don't
compete with people.

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:47.455
I compete with the
highest standard

00:56:47.455 --> 00:56:49.402
I can find and attain to.

00:56:49.402 --> 00:56:50.610
ERIC WEINER: Hm.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:51.450
OK.

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:54.734
I mean, that-- you sound like
you're intrinsically motivated.

00:56:54.734 --> 00:56:56.525
But what if Google cut
your salary in half?

00:56:56.525 --> 00:56:57.250
[LAUGH]

00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.930
All right.

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:02.550
We've got a real
intrinsic motivator here.

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:04.050
That's maybe-- yeah.

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:04.646
Go ahead.

00:57:04.646 --> 00:57:07.500
AUDIENCE: So I have
read your other book

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.610
"The Geography of Bliss."

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:08.950
ERIC WEINER: Right.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.324
AUDIENCE: And I wanted to know
if you make any connection

00:57:11.324 --> 00:57:13.117
between bliss and genius.

00:57:13.117 --> 00:57:14.790
Does it happen [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:15.880
ERIC WEINER: Yeah,
that came up earlier.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.921
I think you weren't here.

00:57:16.921 --> 00:57:20.340
But there's a little bit
of overlap but not a lot.

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.300
I think if you're
totally blissed out,

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.850
if on a scale of one
to ten, you're a 10,

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:28.020
I don't see those people
being the most creative.

00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.755
But if you're one or two
and you're not getting out

00:57:30.755 --> 00:57:32.380
of bed in the
morning, you're not

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.570
going to create much either.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:35.242
Yes?

00:57:35.242 --> 00:57:35.950
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:37.330
Go ahead.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:38.372
We're almost out of time.

00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:39.038
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:57:39.038 --> 00:57:40.410
This has been great, through.

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:42.642
AUDIENCE: I was quickly
going to ask, to what extent

00:57:42.642 --> 00:57:45.880
does the diversity or the
spectrum, the range of ideas

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.160
qualify these places
as clusters of genius.

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.870
I mean, Florence, you had
everything from accounting

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:56.430
to-- and in Vienna you
had all of the arts.

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:58.570
And so these are
very diverse places.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:01.126
Is it sufficient that you
optimize the [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:01.126 --> 00:58:03.744
to be-- you know, I
mean, [INAUDIBLE]--

00:58:03.744 --> 00:58:05.680
ERIC WEINER: Optimize
the-- what's that?

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:08.840
But what I'm saying--

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:09.230
ERIC WEINER: OK.

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.730
[LAUGH]

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:10.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:13.680
So to what extent does
the diversity actually

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.269
qualify a clusterous
being, a cluster of genius?

00:58:16.269 --> 00:58:17.310
ERIC WEINER: In my mind--

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:18.820
MALE SPEAKER: When you
answer, could you maybe just

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:19.450
summarize [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:19.450 --> 00:58:20.200
ERIC WEINER: Yeah.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:24.040
The question is in order to
qualify as a genius cluster,

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.300
must you be a diverse
genius cluster?

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.300
In other words, do you
have to be more than just

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.780
a one-note genius cluster?

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.370
And I think so.

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:34.760
The only really exception
I had to that in my book

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.540
was Vienna part one, which
was musical Vienna, which

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:42.100
really was about music,
late 18th century.

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.900
But I think what in my mind
makes these golden ages

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.517
special is that sparks
were flying in so

00:58:47.517 --> 00:58:48.600
many different directions.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.850
Exactly-- and that's great.

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:55.360
Not many people know that
accounting, modern accounting

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.910
practices, came out of Florence
as well as all that great art.

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:02.640
And you see that time and
again in these places.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.524
And I think, again, it's
that contagion effect.

00:59:05.524 --> 00:59:06.690
It's not just a coincidence.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:11.540
Because you have an art
movement in Vienna in 1900

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.290
that's amazing, you're
more likely to have

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:17.100
an amazing psychological
movement as well.

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:21.623
And the problem with
Detroit is it was one-note.

00:59:21.623 --> 00:59:24.206
I don't-- you know, briefly when
I was looking at the US and I

00:59:24.206 --> 00:59:26.497
was going to have a chapter
on the US, I thought, well,

00:59:26.497 --> 00:59:28.100
do I do New Orleans and jazz?

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:31.020
Do I do New York and art
in the '50s and '60s?

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.646
Do I do Detroit?

00:59:32.646 --> 00:59:35.540
And some people considered
Henry Ford a genius,

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.400
in that place of genius.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.140
But it just seemed too narrow.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.520
It seems like it's got to
go in different directions.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.330
And I guess I'll
end with a question

00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:47.670
that I'm curious
what you think about.

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:51.350
Is this place-- how
diverse is Silicon Valley?

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:54.850
Is it a one-note town or-- town.

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:55.960
Place, region.

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.156
Or is it many notes?

00:59:58.156 --> 00:59:59.500
Anyone?

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.550
I mean, is it-- because
some people say, well,

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:06.780
it's-- you know, it's software
and hardware or its this

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.280
and that.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.670
But it's, you know--

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:09.893
AUDIENCE: It's many.

01:00:09.893 --> 01:00:11.101
ERIC WEINER: Its many things.

01:00:11.101 --> 01:00:13.460
AUDIENCE: Bioengineering,
all kinds of engineering.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.330
I mean, it's everything.

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:17.480
ERIC WEINER: Right.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.730
I suppose what's missing
is a true art scene.

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:22.159
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:22.159 --> 01:00:22.950
ERIC WEINER: Right.

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:25.160
Although if you
expand the definition

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.800
of Silicon Valley to San
Francisco today, you do

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.040
have that there.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:29.741
Right.

01:00:29.741 --> 01:00:31.532
AUDIENCE: Would you
include Berkeley there?

01:00:31.532 --> 01:00:32.032
Oakland?

01:00:32.032 --> 01:00:35.530
ERIC WEINER: Yeah, I mean if
you expand it broadly enough,

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:36.640
you've got everything.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.800
So I would argue that it would--
and this is just a theory-- is

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.690
that the more diverse you
are, the better your chances

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:45.566
of longevity, right?

01:00:45.566 --> 01:00:46.690
Because you've diversified.

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:48.439
Like, it's a biological
phenomena, right?

01:00:48.439 --> 01:00:50.230
You don't have all your
eggs in one basket.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.420
So the more Silicon
Valley diversifies

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:59.370
into even adjacent fields like
biotech, et cetera, the better.

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:02.760
Again, I'm against
specialization.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.295
So this has been a
great chat, though.

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:06.670
MALE SPEAKER: This
was fantastic.

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:08.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:09.450
in thanking Eric Weiner.

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:09.950
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.108
Thank you.
