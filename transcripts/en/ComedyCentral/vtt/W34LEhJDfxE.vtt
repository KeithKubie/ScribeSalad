00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:05.005
- Extra sprouts and

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:05.839
no mayo.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.610
My name's Amy.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.052
She's cute.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:19.886
- Yeah.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:26.359
Wow, Freedom Tower is like
really coming along, huh?

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.429
God, I can't believe it's
been 12 years since 9/11.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.497
- Oh my god, I know.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.766
It's bananas, time really flies.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.501
I can't remember, do they
take a long time here?

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, they're
usually pretty quick.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:37.270
- Okay.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.240
- I was actually supposed
to be meeting my girlfriend

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.175
at the World Trade
Center that day.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:46.346
I'm on like Walker Street,
and I hear this crazy noise,

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.548 align:start size:94% position:6%
but like I wasn't thinking
it was anything bad.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.216 align:start size:94% position:6%
But then I look up--
- Allen, I'm just kind of

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
freaking out right
now, that I want mayo.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.587
You know, I'm like why did
I act like I didn't want it?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.990
(chuckles) But I don't
have to go talk to them.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.392 align:start size:88% position:13%
I am so present and
here with you right now,

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.260
I can stay.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.294
- Uh, well...

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.302
- Everything's cool.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:11.438
They're gonna put mayo
on it, (chuckles) sorry.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:14.040
Okay, so what's going on in
the story, what were you...

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.041
- The fireball.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.142
- Ooh, right.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.677
Keep going.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.612
- Yeah, so, for hours I'm
like calling my girlfriend

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.681
and I can't get through to her.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.683
- Oh my god, is that Dina Lohan?

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.086
Oh, it's like a pile of cups.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.655
Sorry, what's happening?

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.623 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, I'm calling
my girlfriend,

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.625
and I can't, like
I can't reach her,

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.627 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause all the cell
phones are jammed, and

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:36.896 align:start size:97% position:3%
everyone is trying to call--
- Verizon?

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.431
It's Verizon, right?

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.433
They cannot get it together.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.202
It's been like 130 years, like,

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:45.872
like, help us out, help
us make a call, right?

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.374 align:start size:88% position:13%
(chuckles) Verizon, it's
like, run a business.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.876
Can we stand over there?

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.544 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm scared I'm not gonna
hear when they call my name,

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.046
and I want to keep an
eye on my sandwich.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.147
- Yeah, sure.

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.684
(pop music)

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:58.852
It's loud over here.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.653
- You thought she was dead?

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:04.290
- Yeah, so finally at like 8
pm, my girlfriend calls me,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.326
but she's so hysterical,
I can barely understand

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.194 align:start size:97% position:3%
a word she's saying--
- Yeah, wait, speaking of that

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.230 align:start size:94% position:6%
can you just stop talking
for like one second?

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.332 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm trying to Shazam a
song, it's like not tagging.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.901
I think 'cause you're
talking to me, yeah.

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.303
I know it's Robin Thicke but I
don't know what Robin Thicke.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.138
You know?

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.009
Oh, it's Pink.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.144
I'm an idiot.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.278
- [Server] Amy?

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.613
- Oh, thank you.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.216 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Anyway, so she
made it out, but like

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.118 align:start size:94% position:6%
as they were running, they
heard these loud noises

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.254 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they realized that it--
- Oh my gosh!

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:36.556 align:start size:84% position:16%
They didn't put
mayo on my sandwich.

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:39.526
Why is my life the worst life?

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.793
- Do you want to take it back?

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.662
- No, I don't want them
to think I'm an asshole.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:46.132
God, I'm in the worst
mood, and whatever.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.667
- So where were you on 9/11?

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.769
- I don't remember.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.338
(upbeat music)
