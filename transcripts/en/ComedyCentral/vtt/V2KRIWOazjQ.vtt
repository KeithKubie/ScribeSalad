00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:07.373
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.041
- [Moshe] Hey this
is Moshe Kasher.

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.543
- [Natasha] And Natasha Leggero.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.178
- [Moshe] And we just got
married six months ago.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.447 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Natasha] Which we think
pretty much makes us qualified

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.948 align:start size:84% position:16%
to give love advice
to strangers.

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:17.350 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Moshe] So,
that's what we did.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.052
We packed up the
car, hit the road,

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.887
spread the love.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.723 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
[Both] This is The
Honeymoon Tour.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.262
- Someone in the back.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.529 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- That's the same person
that's been raising their hand

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.398 line:0%
my whole set, who I've
been purposely ignoring.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:33.966 line:0%
- Wait, woah woah woah.
- Well, this probably

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
won't go well, I'm
warning you right now.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.537 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You are so amazing,
- Oh, oh hold-,

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.072 align:start size:94% position:6%
- both of you are amazing.
- Thank you, thank you,

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.606
come here, come here, oh
you're not wearing shoes,

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:41.941
so this is definitely a good
old Vegas white girl night.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.910
(audience cheering)

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.479 align:start size:97% position:3%
Alright. Do you have a
problem with your love life

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.446
that you actually
need help with,

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:48.714
or did you just want to say hi?

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:49.915 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I do have problem
with my love life, yeah.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:51.550
But I probably should be cool.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.386
- Okay cool. Thank you for
coming up, appreciate it.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.089 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well I tell you what, I will
tell you, it's just funny.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.324
It's funny.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.259 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Okay honey, let's give
it, what's your name?

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.395
- My name is Gretchen
and you're so awesome.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.229 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Thank you, Gretchen.
- Oh, Gretchen.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.463
Okay, I got it.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:05.498
Change your name,
you'll find love.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.999
Next.

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.501
- So Moshe, I'm looking at
this hotel in Amsterdam.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:11.304
Do you care that it looks
like a Hilton Garden Inn

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:13.272
when you're in the
middle of Amsterdam?

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:17.010
- [Moshe] Yeah, no, I
don't, it's free right?

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:19.778
- Yeah.

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:20.780
- It's not like it's a
piss-in-the-sink hotel,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.014
it's like a nice hotel.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:25.684 align:start size:88% position:13%
- No it's clean, it's
just, it's not charming.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.286
I'm just saying, you're basing-.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.787
- [Moshe] That's
a nice hotel room.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.957
What do you want it to be,
the bed in a wooden shoe?

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.326
- (laughs) Kind of.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:36.495 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean you're in Amsterdam,
and then you're like,

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.465 align:start size:84% position:16%
"uh, can I have my
Stouffer's Microwave?"

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.998
(Moshe laughs)

00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:41.633
"grilled cheese, or," you know.

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.970
There's a microwave in there.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.608
There's like a slip mat
on the bathtub. There's-

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.975
- [Moshe] Wait, what do
you want in the bathtub?

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.977
- There's fluorescent lighting.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Moshe] You want to
sink your feet into like

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.517
a four inch thick layer of
Beluga caviar in the bathtub?

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.186 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, I just want
something that feels

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:03.289 align:start size:88% position:13%
like we're in Amsterdam
and not Akron.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.990
(Moshe laughs)

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.225
- Ak-er-On?

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:07.160
- [Natasha] (laughs) I
was trying to make it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.060
the same syllables.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.329
- No I respected what you did.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.898
For me it's like, that's
a perfectly nice hotel

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:15.167
and it's free and we
should just stay there

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:19.004
and save our money and spend
it on going to dope restaurants

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:21.374 align:start size:94% position:6%
and maybe even that thing
that we talked about

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.376
maybe doing in Amsterdam.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:26.345 align:start size:97% position:3%
That you said that if I
behaved myself and cleaned up

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:27.514
that you would be down to.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.015
- What's that?

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:32.318 align:start size:94% position:6%
- The thing that we talked
about, about Amsterdam.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.686
- [Natasha] A prostitute?

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.055 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I don't like
calling them that.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.723 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Natasha] We didn't
talk about that.

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:39.158
- I was, I meant to bring it up.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:42.695 align:start size:88% position:13%
- (laughs) So you're
saying if we get to stay

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.598
in this shitty hotel I
don't want to stay in,

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:49.902 align:start position:0%
that we can finally get a
prostitute for the relationship?

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.538
- We can (laughs)
save our money.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:54.207
- And then she can
sleep in that bed.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.375
(Moshe laughs)

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.275
- What's your name?

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:57.510
- My name is Lacey.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.611
- Hi Lacey, that's cute.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:59.445
And what's...

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.279
- What's your name?

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.514
- Dave.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.749 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Moshe and Natasha]
Lacey and Dave.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.717
- How long have you
guys been dating?

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:05.952
- Three and a half
years, four years.

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.387
- Four years, and
are you married?

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:09.389
- No.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.623
- Okay, so ask-

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:11.858
- [Moshe] Okay, how
old are you guys?

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.125
- I'm 30.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.594
- I'm 23.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:15.794 align:start size:94% position:6%
- She's 23 and you've
been together four years.

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:16.929
That's what's up
dog, hell yeah bro.

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.398 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Natasha] Damn!
(cheering)

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.399 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You gotta get them when
they're a young lady.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:21.934 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I mean we've been
together for four years

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.569
and I talk about marriage

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.238
and he doesn't want
to talk about it.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.472
(audience boos)

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.608
- Wait a minute,
dude, you're like,

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.777
you robbed the cradle
and then you're like,

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.245 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't think we should
complete building the cradle,

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:36.915
I think, you're the guy who
got her all young and shit.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:38.951
She's spent her whole
adult life with you.

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.588 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It is really not about
me, it's, she's 23.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.089 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You think eventually
she's gonna look over at you

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:47.927 align:start size:88% position:13%
and be like, dude you're
old as fuck. Goodbye!

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:52.064
Gretchen where are
you, let's party!

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:54.267
(laughing)

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.137
- [Natasha] She's been waiting.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:02.241
- How many male comics do
you know who have a baby

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.142
who are touring?

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.610
400?

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.446 align:start size:81% position:19%
How many female
comics do you know

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:09.515
with a baby who are touring?

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:10.350
Ah, cero.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:12.785
Zero, not one.

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:17.757
Because the male
comics are like,

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.459
sitting at home and then
all of a sudden it's like,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.293
wah, wah, wah,

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.629 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they're like,
"Hello, I'll take it.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:24.830
"Peace!"

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.298
And then they call in,

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:28.301
they're like, "Hey
babe, how's it going?

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.936
"(smoking noise)

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.471
"(gargle noise)

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.705
"Party! Party!"

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.641
- When the woman is pregnant

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:39.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
you have to put the
bag balm on her belly.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:40.112
- [Natasha] the what?

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:40.946
- Bag balm.

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.348
- [Natasha] Bag balm?

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:43.849 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Don't you get that
udder cream and you put it

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.817
on her belly so that she
doesn't get stretch marks?

00:04:45.817 --> 00:04:47.353
- Or she can do that herself.

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:48.955 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Honestly though,
and real talk,

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:52.492 align:start size:94% position:6%
if you get stretch marks,
during the pregnancy,

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.893
boom, I'm out.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.160
Divorce.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.829
- What makes you think
that this is the man

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.030
you want to marry?

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.665 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, you have so much,
like when I was 23,

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:02.801 align:start size:94% position:6%
I was living in Australia
with a con artist.

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:04.837
It takes so long to
figure out your life.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.538 align:start size:88% position:13%
What makes you think
this is the man you want

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:09.007
to spend the rest
of your life with?

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.043
- We've lived together
for like three years

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:14.146
and everything is going
well so far, so why not?

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:16.348
- What Lacey's saying
that makes sense is

00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:17.917
if they were to get married,

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.584 align:start size:84% position:16%
it would make her
think, okay this is,

00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:21.187
now I can kind of see my future,

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.755 align:start size:84% position:16%
this is what's
gonna be happening.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.423 align:start size:97% position:3%
But the fact that he
doesn't want to get married

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:26.992 align:start size:84% position:16%
is making her feel
like, oh I'm insecure,

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:28.727 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't know what's
gonna happen.

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:30.229
- I just want him
to talk about it.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.331
He doesn't even want
to talk about marriage.

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:34.033
- Well there's no better
place to talk about it

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:37.937
than here at the Beauty Bar in
front of 200 drunk strangers.

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:41.107
- [Natasha] Hell
yeah! Hell yeah!

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:42.107
(Moshe laughs)

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:43.042
- By the way, you're 30.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.343
What do you want from life?

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:45.745
- Just to be a professional kid.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:46.612
That's...

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:47.880
- Oh.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.848
- He wants to be a
professional kid.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.516
- Lacey... run, run.

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:57.056
- I mean Vegas is
just so everything

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:58.725
that I can't handle.

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:03.796
All it needs is rats.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.198
(Moshe laughs)

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:07.933
Then I would be like, not-

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:09.468
- [Moshe] That'd be
your perfect storm?

00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:11.203
- Completely unable to be here.

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:13.305
- Dave, you don't have to
commit to marrying her,

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:15.040 align:start size:81% position:19%
but you have to
commit to going to

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.543 align:start size:97% position:3%
couples counseling with
her to talk about marriage.

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:19.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Do they have
therapists in Las Vegas?

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:24.316
- (laughs) None, there's
no therapists in Las Vegas.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:25.384
- Are you into therapy?

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:26.885
Would you do that?

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:30.889 align:start position:0%
- If there were any good
therapists in Vegas, then yeah.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.092 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Okay, would you be
open to talking about it,

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:34.927
maybe even just a
couple sessions?

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.128
- [Moshe] Two sessions.

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:37.597
- I really would do
anything for her.

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:38.430
(audience aws)

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.631
- Dave.

00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:41.100
- Who cares how old someone is?

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.334
It doesn't always matter,

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.436
it's not like everything
goes in a certain way,

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:45.337
and that she's 23-

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.139
- Aw Dave, I like Dave!

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.607
- Yeah!

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:50.509 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hey you get out of
here with your judgement.

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.911
(all chanting 'Dave')

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:55.180
- Really there's no,
there's no rules here.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.651
Try to live beyond rules in
your life for once, you know?

00:06:58.651 --> 00:06:59.919
- I think that's true,

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.320
Dave you're thinking
about it too much.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.788 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And maybe Gretchen allows
you be an eternal kid

00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:05.658 align:start size:97% position:3%
in a way and maybe you
need what she has to offer.

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:08.294 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You've been dating Lacey
since she was literally a kid,

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.796 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it's time for you,
the perpetual kid,

00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:12.665
to, you know, to talk about it.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:13.932
You don't have to
commit to doing it,

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:15.167
but you have to commit
to talking about it.

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:16.002
Deal?

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.203
- Absolutely.

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.805 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Deal! We did it!
- Okay, okay!
