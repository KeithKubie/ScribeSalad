really is that the product could

swap insurance on it I think there was

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430
swap insurance on it I think there was
 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.019
swap insurance on it I think there was
just too much of an assumption that the

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:17.029
just too much of an assumption that the
 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.640
just too much of an assumption that the

thought of credit default swap and

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020
thought of credit default swap and
 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.439
thought of credit default swap and
securitization was the spreading of risk

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449
securitization was the spreading of risk
 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.850
securitization was the spreading of risk
and I think what we've learned is yes

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860
and I think what we've learned is yes
 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.830
and I think what we've learned is yes
you can spread it but the other part of

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840
you can spread it but the other part of
 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.140
you can spread it but the other part of
it was you couldn't get rid of it

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150
it was you couldn't get rid of it
 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.600
it was you couldn't get rid of it
because of the lack of liquidity in the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610
because of the lack of liquidity in the
 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.230
because of the lack of liquidity in the
market and I really see the major issue

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240
market and I really see the major issue
 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.629
market and I really see the major issue
in the major signal for me was early on

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639
in the major signal for me was early on
 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.200
in the major signal for me was early on
when there was no 30 60 90 day money in

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210
when there was no 30 60 90 day money in

the market and people with positions

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889
the market and people with positions
 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.629
the market and people with positions
couldn't finance themselves and I think

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639
couldn't finance themselves and I think
 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.820
couldn't finance themselves and I think
the Fed was a little slow to pick that

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830
the Fed was a little slow to pick that
 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.450
the Fed was a little slow to pick that
up but I think too much assuredness in

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460
up but I think too much assuredness in

the product they'll be interesting to
see when when the product does come back

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:03.409
see when when the product does come back
 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:05.350
see when when the product does come back
in a major way will it just come back

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360
in a major way will it just come back
 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.540
in a major way will it just come back
again in the same way that there won't

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550
again in the same way that there won't
 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.029
again in the same way that there won't
be any features on it that will yield

control in the banking organization so
 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.119
control in the banking organization so
that they can get these off

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:21.229
come back like there are coming back but
 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:23.170
come back like there are coming back but
i but i think there was just too much of

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180
i but i think there was just too much of
 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.089

an assumption that this product worked
 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:30.909
an assumption that this product worked
but we and it probably you know I guess

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919
but we and it probably you know I guess
 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:32.290
but we and it probably you know I guess
we'd have to look back to the last

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300
we'd have to look back to the last
 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.570
we'd have to look back to the last
recession and say you know there really

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580
recession and say you know there really
 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.920
recession and say you know there really
weren't a lot of issues in housing of a

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930
weren't a lot of issues in housing of a
 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.809
weren't a lot of issues in housing of a

great degree securitize housing in the
 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:43.149
great degree securitize housing in the
last recession so we we lack the

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:43.159
last recession so we we lack the
 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:45.550
last recession so we we lack the
experience and the major concern on

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560
experience and the major concern on
 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.519
experience and the major concern on
securitizations were in a market of

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:48.529
securitizations were in a market of
 

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:49.959
securitizations were in a market of
falling interest rates people doing

now when when when people can do it but

00:07:59.920 --> 00:07:59.930
now when when when people can do it but
 

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.440
now when when when people can do it but
I think the answer is to be a little

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:02.450
I think the answer is to be a little
 

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.770
I think the answer is to be a little
more skeptical of the product I'm

disappointed in the buy side we've had a
 

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.550
disappointed in the buy side we've had a
lot of criticism of the south side which

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560
lot of criticism of the south side which
 

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.150
lot of criticism of the south side which
is deserve but a lot of the people
