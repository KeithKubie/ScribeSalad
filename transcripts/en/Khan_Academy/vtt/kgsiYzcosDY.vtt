00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:04.166
- In triangle ABC above, AB,

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.433
the length of this
segment, is equal to AC.

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:10.166
E is the midpoint of AB.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.633
Well they really haven't
drawn this to scale.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:15.092
Let me see if I can draw a
little bit more to scale.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:19.104
So they're saying E is the midpoint of AB.

00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:22.767
So the midpoint looks
closer to around there.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:23.966
So it would look like this.

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:28.766
This is A, this is E, this is B,

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.633
that is D and that is C.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:32.833
So let me mark this off.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.833
E is the midpoint of AB

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.572
so that means AE is equal to EB.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.633
And D is the mid point of AC.

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.567
We know that AC is the same length as AB

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.167
so AD is going to be
the same length as that

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:50.769
which is also the same length as that

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.767
which is the same length as that.

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:55.433
If AE is equal to x--

00:00:55.433 --> 00:01:00.033
So AE, this distance right
over here is equal to x.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.635
And ED is equal to 4.

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:06.966
So this is ED is equal to 4

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:11.100
so this length of this
segment right over here is 4.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.611
What is the length of BC?

00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:16.367
What is the length of BC here?

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:18.633
Now the key thing that
might jump out at you

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:20.966
is that we're dealing with
two similar triangles.

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.366
That triangle AED

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:27.100
is similar to triangle ABC.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.766
And how do we know that they are similar?

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.500
Well, their corresponding
sides have the same ratio.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.166
The ratio AC is twice AD,

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.301
AB is twice AE

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:42.766
and then they have a
common angle in between.

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.967
So AED is similar to triangle ABC.

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:47.500
Let me right this down.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.166
So triangle AED

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.299
is similar

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.972
to triangle ABC.

00:01:58.972 --> 00:02:01.500
And what that tells us
is the ratio between

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.972
corresponding sides is
going to be the same.

00:02:03.972 --> 00:02:07.767
Now, BC is the corresponding
side on the larger triangle,

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:12.433
on triangle ABC, to this side, side ED

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.168
on the smaller triangle, on triangle AED.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.100
Now what's the ratio between

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.033
corresponding sides of ABC and AED?

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:23.700
Well, this length is x,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.233
we've already been told that,

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:27.167
this length we know is two x.

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:29.434
How do we know that?
Because E is the midpoint.

00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:32.100
So the ratio between
the corresponding sides

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.233
of the larger triangle
and the smaller triangle,

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:38.700
the ratio is two x to x
or the ratio is just two.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.966
Or another way of saying it
is the corresponding side

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:43.633
of the larger triangle is twice

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:47.300
the corresponding side
of the smaller triangle.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.300
So if this is four, this is
just going to be twice four.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.500
It's going to be eight.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.515
So the length of segment BC is eight.
