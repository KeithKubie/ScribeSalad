00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.352
Let's see if we can use our knowledge of the greatest common factor to solve

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:08.931
this new equation. What's the greatest common factor of x squared, 5x, and 6?

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:13.401
Now, this question is pretty tough, so take some time to think about it, and

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:17.732
think about any number that can go in to each of the terms. Writing out the

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:21.125
prime factorizations of each of these might help as well.
