00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.280
A while ago I had an epiphany.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.080
(chorus sings)

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.460
Because I had finally had a thought that perfectly articulated everything I had been feeling for months

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.700
and that thought was

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.340
"I feel like I don't deserve to be depressed."

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.580
I've been very open about the fact that my sister committed suicide

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.360
but I've never really talked about depression.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.280
I made a very general video about it years ago

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.380
(where the color correction is cringe-worthy, I know)

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.380
but it was easier back then to recognize that I was depressed

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.840
because my sister was dead

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.420
I was self-medicating with alcohol and escaping with drugs

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.520
and I hated my job and I hated school

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.420
and I hated my life.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.380
So was I depressed? Hell yes.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.720
But now?  Now I have a career that's like picking up momentum.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.840
Now I'm in a happy relationship with four furry cat children.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.320
Now I feel like I have a purpose.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.960
So now when I think:  "Am I depressed?"

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.840
A part of me is like: "Oh really?  What do you have to be depressed about?"

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.660
But this denial of it just makes me a shitty person to be around.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.460
I'm just a shitty person to be around right now.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.680
And why do I feel this way?  You know, why do I feel this weird sense of shame?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.540
Like by being depressed I'm somehow being ungrateful.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.960
Who or what is telling me that I should feel this way?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.300
External factors are the keys to happiness and you have those right now so be happy!

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.320
Do I really think that if I talk to someone they're gonna say:

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.180
"So you think you're depressed?"

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.460
"Yea."

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.320
"How dare you."

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.760
"What?"

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.500
"Who do you think you are?"

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.020
"A human being?"

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.320
Does anyone else feel like this?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.200
I feel like I don't deserve the label "depression"

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.780
because there are so many levels to it and the extreme side of it sucks.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.660
At least now that I have this glorious insight

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.360
(chorus sings "Hallelujah")

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.460
I can actually do something about it.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.240
So yay for epiphanies!

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.040
Woo!

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.400
I actually had one the other day when Los Angeles raised the legal cat limit from 3 to 5.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.760
(gasps) I can have 5!

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.540
(chorus sings "Hallelujah")

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.880
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay Awesome Gotham.
