00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.410
You're watching the game, you've got a cold
one on the way, you grab a piping hot slice

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:14.310
of pizza, put it in your mouth, AAAAAND -- WAAAAHHHH
I BURNT MY TONGUE.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.870
WHY GODS.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.160
WHY?!

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.289
Pizza is one of the worlds greatest inventions,
but when I was watching sportsball over the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.699
weekend I totally put a piece in my mouth
and now I can't feel this part of my tongue.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.810
The act of burning your tongue falls under
the medical term of glossitis -- which also

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.070
covers dry mouth, infection, or hormonal factors
-- plus simple things like biting your tongue

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.320
or reactions to spicy foods.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.590
Hot food renders our tongues pretty much useless
because it's burned off the top layer of our

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.690
taste receptors -- we call them taste buds.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.809
The receptors vary in number from person to
person from 2,000 to 10,000.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.020
They're are all over the tongue, the roof
of the mouth and the back of the throat.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.539
Those tiny bumps on your tongue ARE NOT your
taste buds, those are called lingual papillae

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.700
-- there are four types of papillae in your
mouth, some contain taste buds, and some do

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.700
not.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.830
If you burn your tongue, you've probably damaged
the fungiform papillae, named that way because

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.420
they look like tiny mushrooms.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.720
Each one of those fungiform papillae contains
six taste buds.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.020
Commonly, a tongue burn is a first-degree
burn -- the lowest of the three levels of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.020
burn.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.390
An example on the skin would be an accidental
brief touch of a hot pan that leaves a shiny

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.800
red line.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.540
When you burn your mouth, the taste buds are
destroyed, which in itself isn't a big deal,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.470
because they're constantly being regenerated.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.060
Underneath the top layer of your tongue are
basal cells.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.259
Every 10 days, the basal cells mature into
place at the top of the taste bud, where they're

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.210
eventually replaced.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.860
The good news is, mouth wounds heal relatively
quickly; twice as fast as rest of the body

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.460
because it's in the body's best interest.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.540
Taste evolved to protect us from poisons which
commonly taste bitter, and allow us to eat

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.070
things which keep our body in tip-top shape
like salty sodiums and sugary fatty energy

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.070
foodstuffs.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.140
If you burn your tongue, there's not much
to be done but wait until it heals -- which

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.670
might take a couple of days.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.550
If it's REALLY bad, like the burn has blisters
or you see charred tissues -- Go to the damn

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.550
hospital.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.420
But even knowing ALL THIS, WHY IS IT ALWAYS
PIZZA?!

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.480
I found, surprisingly, this was pretty well
studied.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.450
In one paper, titled "Thermal Characteristics
of Mozzarella Cheese," the researchers found

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.660
the specific heat capacity of mozz -- or the
amount of heat the physical molecules of cheese

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.150
can hold -- is 2.7 kilojoules per kilogram.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.150
That's a lot!

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.129
More than rubber or fiberboard and a little
less than balsa wood or paraffin wax,!

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.569
Cheese can get pretty darn hot before bursting
into flame.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.080
Thank you physics students.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.080
Y'all are great.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.330
Do you have a burning science question?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.330
See what I did there?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.510
With the… burning?

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.319
And since we're talking about burning, Do
you think eating spicy foods makes you more

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.319
macho?

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.430
Because there's a link between testosterone
and those spicy meatballs!

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:05.439
Watch me and Julian talk it out in this video…
(sound up) thanks for watching DNews!
