you know like all these big companies

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940
you know like all these big companies
 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.880
you know like all these big companies
have their own patents pools and they

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
have their own patents pools and they
 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.139
have their own patents pools and they
use them as leverage against other

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
use them as leverage against other
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.280

companies with patents but I just you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290
companies with patents but I just you
 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.880
companies with patents but I just you
know I think there are so many problems

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
know I think there are so many problems
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520
know I think there are so many problems
with it the biggest problems are that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
with it the biggest problems are that
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.650
with it the biggest problems are that
you have people patenting things that

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
you have people patenting things that
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.620
you have people patenting things that
are essentially math which is what

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630
are essentially math which is what
 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.260

patents are not supposed to be even

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
patents are not supposed to be even
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.060
patents are not supposed to be even
about at all and the I mean there are

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
about at all and the I mean there are
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.220
about at all and the I mean there are
other problems there no it's I'm usually

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
other problems there no it's I'm usually
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740
other problems there no it's I'm usually
drunk when I give this explanation and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
drunk when I give this explanation and
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.449
drunk when I give this explanation and
it comes out so much smoother I just

00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:08.459
it comes out so much smoother I just
 

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.099
it comes out so much smoother I just
think that they're a big problem largely

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109
think that they're a big problem largely
 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.800
think that they're a big problem largely
because you can infringe on them without

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
because you can infringe on them without
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.499
because you can infringe on them without
knowing that you do and as a small

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
knowing that you do and as a small
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690

whether or not you do that's I could

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179
whether or not you do that's I could
 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:22.789
whether or not you do that's I could
write a hundred thousand lines of code

write a hundred thousand lines of code

write a hundred thousand lines of code
and for all I know 50,000 of them

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109
and for all I know 50,000 of them
 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.190
and for all I know 50,000 of them
infringe on various things and I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
infringe on various things and I
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050
infringe on various things and I
wouldn't know that and normally if you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
wouldn't know that and normally if you
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.609

example if they don't enforce it it's to

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319
example if they don't enforce it it's to
 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.819
example if they don't enforce it it's to
your advantage because days they start

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
your advantage because days they start
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.949
your advantage because days they start
to lose their rights whereas patents if

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959
to lose their rights whereas patents if
 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.929
to lose their rights whereas patents if
they don't enforce it for ten years they

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
they don't enforce it for ten years they
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.399
they don't enforce it for ten years they
can come and sue you if for the ten

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
can come and sue you if for the ten
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.629
can come and sue you if for the ten
years that you've been making money on

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639
years that you've been making money on
 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:49.099
years that you've been making money on
their patent and you're completely

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109
their patent and you're completely
 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.929
their patent and you're completely
screwed so there's no incentive for them

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
screwed so there's no incentive for them
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.289
screwed so there's no incentive for them
to actually go and and tried it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
to actually go and and tried it
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.309
to actually go and and tried it
legitimately license it it's it's really

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319
legitimately license it it's it's really
 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.809
legitimately license it it's it's really
the kind of thing where there are

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819
the kind of thing where there are
 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.550
the kind of thing where there are
probably there's place a middle ground

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
probably there's place a middle ground
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.429
probably there's place a middle ground
where it makes sense to have things be

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
where it makes sense to have things be
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.210
where it makes sense to have things be
patentable obviously in many places it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
patentable obviously in many places it
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.370
patentable obviously in many places it
does make sense but things like software

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380
does make sense but things like software
 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.360
does make sense but things like software
and people patenting DNA it's it's it's

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370
and people patenting DNA it's it's it's
 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.950
and people patenting DNA it's it's it's
at the point where you have

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960
at the point where you have
 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.750
at the point where you have
things that are so abstract that they

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
things that are so abstract that they
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.210
things that are so abstract that they
really should belong to everybody and no

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
really should belong to everybody and no
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.340

one's really like making viable

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350
one's really like making viable
 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.320
one's really like making viable
businesses on software patents the only

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
businesses on software patents the only
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.550
businesses on software patents the only
thing they're doing is extorting money

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
thing they're doing is extorting money
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.210
thing they're doing is extorting money
out of other people and the people who

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
out of other people and the people who
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.280
out of other people and the people who
have the most software patents probably

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
have the most software patents probably
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.750
have the most software patents probably
don't even want them to exist they're

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
don't even want them to exist they're
 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.490
don't even want them to exist they're
just forced to do it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
just forced to do it
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.730
just forced to do it
to cover their own asses
