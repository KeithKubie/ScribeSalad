00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.850
which is one of four area
study divisions in the library.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.150
We are responsible for recommending
from and providing reference

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.920
for most of the countries of Europe
except Great Britain and Ireland

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.800
which is covered by the main
reading room, Spain and Portugal

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.050
which is covered by the Hispanic
division, and the European part

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.690
of Turkey which is covered by the
Africa and Middle Eastern division.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.580
Our collection of Hungarica is
the largest outside of Hungary

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.990
and numbers about a quarter of a
million volumes, 250,000 volumes

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.430
of Hungarian or Hungary-related
material.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.960
If you'd like to know more, you can
go to the European division website

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.970

Go to Researchers and then
the European division.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.760
Andras Visky was born in
Targu-Mures, [Inaudible], Romania.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.100
He is a poet, playwright, and
essayist, and resident dramaturg

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.680
at Cluj-Napoca Hungarian Theater in
Romania where he holds the position

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.510
of Associate Artistic Director.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.790
He holds a Doctorate of
Liberal Arts from the University

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.640
of Theater and Film in Budapest.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.030
And since 1994, his lecture
at the [Inaudible] University

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.670
in [Inaudible] in the Department
of Theater and Television.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.250
He is one of the cofounders and
the former Executive Director

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.820
of [Inaudible] Publishing.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.760
His plays have been
staged in various countries

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.990
of Europe and the United States.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.880
His work will now reach an
English-speaking audience

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.810
with his latest book,
"Barrack Dramaturgy," published

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.030
by Intellect Books and distributed
by the University of Chicago Press.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.050
It contains an anthology of
his well-known plays as well

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.020
as a critical analysis of his
theory of considering the theater

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.050
as a space for exploring feelings
of cultural and personal captivity.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.620 position:56%
This collection makes use of
scripts and director's notes as well

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.400
as interviews and creative
teams behind the productions

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.580
and reveals an insider's view
of Mr. Visky's artistic vision.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.480
And we have a small display of
his books outside all of this room

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.130
that you can view as you leave.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.510
It is my pleasure to introduce
to you Dr. Andras Visky.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.100
[ Applause ]

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.400
&gt;&gt; Andras Visky: Thank
you very much.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.020
Thanks for coming.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.390
Thank you, Ken, Erica, Natalia.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.930
I plan today to speak
mostly about this book,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.850
about this "Barrack
Dramaturgy," which was created

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.170
by me many, many years ago.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.900
So I would like to begin
by telling you that for me,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.520
the theater is a tool
for creating tools.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.490
I used to say that the
theater is not a place

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.010
for me for entertainment.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.270 position:56%
It's a place for serious gatherings.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.630
That doesn't mean that I don't

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.250
like when my audience would
laugh during the show,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.050
but I think that this
is not the purpose.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:22.590
First of all, let's see
how I got to this idea

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.020
of considering the theater
a real event for everybody

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.480
who takes part in the show.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:37.240
I never divide the space of the
theater into the space of the show

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.690
and the space of the audience.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.060
I think that these two are emerging

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.800
to get our penetrating
into each other.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.380
My first memory as a child was

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.980
when I was one-year-old,
that I'm a prisoner.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:05:00.650
After '56 -- I think that
most of you are familiar

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.250
with the Hungarian
revolution in '56.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.740
In Romania more than
30,000 potential opposers

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.820
of the regime were
sentenced in prison.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.370
My father was sentenced
for 22 years.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.090
So I don't have even
a personal memory

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.100
of my father before
his imprisonment.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.150
Then we were removed
in a prison camp.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.190
My mother, an Austrian, grown
up in Budapest, Hungary,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.810
not knowing one word
in Romanian language,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.440
and we spent more than four years.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.360
My father served almost
7 years in the prison.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.690
We didn't know about each other.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:55.920
We didn't know about him, where
he was, is he alive or not.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.440
We were totally separated.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.930
I am the seventh in my family, so
my mother with seven very active

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.970
and very hungry kids, ended
up in this prison camp

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.970
which had become later
on a very famous village

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.500
for the Romanian intelligentsia,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.540
because very interesting
people were sentenced together

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.690
with us to live there.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.650
This is the family here.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.120
That man, [Inaudible],
was a student.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.370
He was a student during
the Hungarian revolution.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.130
He was a student in
Timisoara and now he is a page

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.140
of the Romanian history
because he was the one

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:41.560
who formulated the [inaudible] of
the Romanian students influenced

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.030
by the Hungarian revolution
in Romania.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:53.440
So after prison, he was sentenced
again, not to go home but to stay

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:05.250
in this prison camp which
is probably familiar to you

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.870
because of the novels
of Solzhenitsyn

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.490
or Shalam Wolf [phonetic], right?

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.910
So you can see how a
barrack would look.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.320
It's behind us.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.220
I am down there, the fairly
depressed youngest child.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.930
Here is a famous photo.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.360 position:56%
It is the winter in our prison camp.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.930
The printers were unbelievably
strong.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.320
There is a wind which is called
[inaudible] coming from Russia

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.520
and brings a lot of snow.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.910 position:56%
For instance, I remember when the
snow covered up totally our barrack,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:49.710
but it happened very often during
the - It was a plain field,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.190
no trees, only these barracks,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.990
and we got covered up
totally by the snow.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.990
I thought for years that this was
only the image of my imagination.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.170
And then I found from photography
how the people are working

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.470
on their roof.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.960
It's like a Chagall painting.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.150
The people floating
above their homes

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:18.150
and being a part of a mythology.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:24.260
So what am speaking about
now is that, for me,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.700
it's hardly separable -- the
reality from the mythology.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:37.520
I think that the imagination--

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.860
sometimes it's a much
stronger reality

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.730
than the reality, which
is hiding from us.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.330 position:56%
It's very hard to grasp the reality.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:54.720
Actually, this is the main
reason we are doing theater,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:04.650
not to create an illusion but to
create a counter reality in order

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:15.180
to understand better
our own reality.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:43.840
The man there -- I
really love this picture.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.870
His name is Paul Goma, a
famous Romanian author who,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.120
after the prison, came to our camp.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:05.310 position:56%
Now, this is a map of the camp, done
by that student who is behind us

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.640
in the camp, a very famous map.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:15.840 position:56%
I have the original one but there
is a version in a museum in Romania,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.990
the Museum of the Communist
Terror in Romania in [Inaudible].

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.880
You can find our name also there.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.410
Let me show it to you.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.310
[ Laughter ]

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.250
This is the family Visky.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.210
But there are other
very famous names also.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:53.090
For instance, in the same
village lived the wife

00:11:53.090 --> 00:12:00.570
of the former prime minister
of Romania, Maria Antonescu.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.590
I remember her very well.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:10.230
Former members of government,
and you won't believe probably

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:15.540
that I don't know how
but I'm researching now,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.290
I'm working on a novel
of the village.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:29.290
It lands there a piano
also, in this village.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:37.130
Probably it's like a part of
this theatricality of the place,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:47.690
or I was together there with
the first Romanian woman pilot,

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:55.490
Nadia Russo [phonetic], a
very well-known name now.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:01.020
So let's come back to the cover.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:13.010
So I think that this experience of
being a prisoner first for myself,

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:18.890
than being released
during the dictatorship,

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:25.310
so it was a semi-freedom
than afterwards, until '89 --

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:33.780
brought me to this idea that the
captivity is a universal experience

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.670
of the humanity.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.370
I have a definition
of the captivity.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.950
Now, be attentive.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:53.850
My definition of captivity is
that captivity is a state of being

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.250
in which we are dislocated
from our bodies.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:03.090
So we are dislocated
from our bodies.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.520
What does it mean?

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.600
That the prisoner is
never present in himself.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.900
He is not there.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.630
He is always [inaudible].

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:19.950
So a prisoner always creates
his or her own double,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:26.190
like [Inaudible] would
say, great French artist.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:33.070
I relate to that double which
is an expression of freedom

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.230
for me but I am a prisoner.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.870
So what is the theatrical
space for me?

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:51.660
It's a where we freely shoot
ourselves in order to be set free

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.040
by the event, what happens there.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.580
What does it mean to set free?

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.230
Don't think about something big.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.420 position:56%
A special understanding of yourself.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:11.280
A new understanding your identity
or your own personal story

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:18.230
or regarding your relationships,
etc. etc. So I think

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:26.940
that the 20th century created
this kind of universal aspect

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:35.010
of the human being to create huge
factories to exterminate people.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.540
For instance, gulag --
What does it mean, gulag?

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:45.910
Gulag is an acronym which means
that chief quarter of camps --

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:50.860
that would be Russian meaning
of this -- corrective camps.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.150
This is a euphemism
for extermination camp,

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.810
because when someone wants to
correct you in a prison, I mean,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.490
we were political prisoners, right?

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.900
We were there because of our
convictions about freedom,

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.000
about the rights of a person.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.510
Then a corrective camp means
extermination camp, right?

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.970
But at the same time, don't
think that for a child

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.960
to be a prisoner in
a gulag camp was sad.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.260
I tried to be happy.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.120
My older siblings, they kept
teaching me to recognize my father

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.670
on small black and white photos.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:34.660 position:56%
And I couldn't recognize him all the
time and that's sort of a big trauma

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.550
for me, how to recognize
your father.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.150
That's not possible.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:47.430
So my poetry, my writings
are focused on this idea

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.700
of being dislocated and we
are addicted to freedom.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:59.570
That would be probably the
definition of a human being.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.960
So the lack of freedom
creates big traumas for us.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.980
If we shut in ourselves
in a theater,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.050
that means that there
is no hierarchy

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.340
between actors and audience.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.960
So I don't write stories
for the stage.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.020
I try to write snapshots with
big open spaces and empty spaces

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.450
in order to offer for the
audience to enter in the story,

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:33.360
to offer for them to recognize
themselves in the play.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.650
So what happens in a cell?

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.130 position:56%
The freedom is highly fictionalized.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.670
The space is always tight.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:45.900 position:56%
If you move, you bump into somebody.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.780
If you move, you create a conflict.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:55.770
So the level of the story
within a cell should be much,

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.210
much higher than in normal life.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:05.420
And what happens in a cell?

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.380
Obsessive rituals which
you cannot control.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.930
You have to follow them.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:15.620
These are not happy rituals but
these rituals help you to survive.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:22.410
So I show to you how
the barrack looked like.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:29.450
I remember, for instance, a group
of Franciscan monks who served

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.510
in the prison, I don't
know, more than 10 years,

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.900
than they were removed to our camp.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:45.690
And one of them, he made --
actually, it was a Romanian man --

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:52.650
he was a priest actually.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:19:08.330
He made a small chapel
in his barrack.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.590
And I remember going there in
this chapel, entering this chapel

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:26.150
and the lights that dim space and
watching these people like singing

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.440
and elevating their souls.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.470
And I remember very well one
man who was the main singer.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:43.750
When he came out when the service
ended, he always kissed the ground.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.730
And that was, for me,
not understandable.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.920
How would you kiss the
ground of your detention?

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.970
What is this space about?

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.310
I think that's why I
ended up in the theater,

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.560
because of this theatricality
of the loneliness.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.590
And I remember, once
everybody left the barrack

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.590
and I stayed there and
I kissed the ground.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:15.280
And I feel even today, the
ground, it was very cold.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.900
It was not nice at all.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.690
And then again, I couldn't
understand why.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.000
What's that now?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.870
So I discovered reality.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:38.910
I discovered an inner reality which
is as bleak as the outer reality.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.940
You can disappear in
this inner reality also.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.510
So I began to write plays.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.160
That was my main focus, to
follow different situations

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:59.820 position:56%
of imprisonment, dependencies, which
is in the same way an imprisonment.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.880
So let me show it to you -- images.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.580 position:56%
This is a play which was produced in
Chicago in two different versions,

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.980
and it's called "Juliet."

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.310
It's not called "Romeo and
Juliet," only "Juliet."

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:22.110
Because in my play,
Romeo is in prison,

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.660
and Juliet, my mother, is with us.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.050
So it's a re-writing of Shakespeare
in a way, because my mother went

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.770
to a vast experience in the camp.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:39.810
They take her away from us and we
were expecting to remain alone,

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:44.810
which was one of the most
tragic outcomes for the children

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.670
in all kinds of dictatorships,
I think,

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.970
because they put you in
different orphanages.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.180
So you get cut off from
every personal relationship,

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.040
from everybody.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.690
And they have taken my mother.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:03.450
But after a few days,
she came back to us.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.700
So I wrote a play about the
disappearance of my mother

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.440
and the resurrection of my mother.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:17.150
How Juliet is resurrecting in
not the best moment in her grave.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:25.500
Her name is Julia --
the name of my mother.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.900
So that's why it's
Juliet in the play.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:36.360
This is another one,
a part of a trilogy.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:42.020
I will speak more about
this a little bit.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.490
It's called "Born for Never."

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:49.770
Ten actors are on the
stage but only one.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:56.790
But only one -- this one in
this solitary confinement

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.880
who is the author - only
he is real on the stage.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.830
Everybody's coming out
from his imagination.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:09.580
You can see the space.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:15.330
It's like a skin, but the writing,
it's not readable on that skin.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:24.830
So what the performance is doing
reveals the story of these people,

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:30.320
reveals this writing
during the show.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.260
I'm happy with this.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.930
It went very well at
the Festival d'Avignon,

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.530
toured in Europe and
many, many places.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.830
I tried to combine the
stories of the Holocaust

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.870
with the stories of the gulag.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:52.250
Because in the prison, one of
my father's cellmates was a man,

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.890
a Holocaust survivor, with
then was sentenced again.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.020
So he was a professional prisoner.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.510
And I dedicated to him
this writing actually.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:06.460
And when he went in this cell,
for instance to talk to my father,

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:13.210
he always touched the bed, like
the mezuzah, to enter the space.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:18.840
And that story for
me was unbelievable.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:27.060
This is the way to transform a cell
in your private freedom in order

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:32.040
to follow that ritual, which
brings you back in time

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.630
and brings you back
in a different space.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.610
This is the way to deny the cell.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:45.160
And I was very glad
to hear this story

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:51.120
so I wrote a play dedicated to him.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.260
In this image, you can
see I created a character.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:02.640
He is a handicapped man, and
everybody has to carry him around.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:10.070
And interesting, it creates a
sort of humor in the piece also

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:14.040
because they tend to forget him.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.180
And then they are going
back and they are holding

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.250
and they are bringing with them.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:26.470
Because I saw many people in
the prison camp, very old people

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:32.680
for instance, who could
not provide their food.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.700
That was the daily project,
to provide your food.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.500
I asked once my mother,
"What did you do

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.970
when we hadn't anything to eat?"

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:52.080 position:56%
And she told me, "I told you stories
and I sang to you," which is genius.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.170
Yeah, which is beautiful.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:59.410
So this play, it's called
"I Killed My Mother."

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:08.890
My titles, you can
see, are very gentle

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:13.550
and very inviting for
everybody, yeah?

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.660
This is the La MaMa version in
New York, which was a joy for me,

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.500
very well received, [Inaudible]
and Julie [Inaudible].

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.550
The other thing which I
would mention here to you

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.570
but because this is
important actually for me,

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:39.200
that I'm very interested in
this idea of open dramaturgy

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.040
when I'm doing a theater piece.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:50.670
That means that I don't decide the
number of characters in the play.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.020
I offer a text, a texture
rather than a text, and I offer,

00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:05.080
if it's possible, total freedom
for the company, for the director.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:16.130
Because in the theater,
a text never saves you,

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:22.240
because we can destroy even
a genius Shakespeare text.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:32.160
Sometimes Hamlet is
boring too, right?

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:44.570
Not the text saves you, but your
courage to get in that story

00:28:44.570 --> 00:29:06.960
and to consider your own.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:30:01.460 position:56%
This is a play which is running now
back home in Hungarian language now.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.020
"Juliet" is running now,
both in Romanian language

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.320
and Hungarian language in
three different places.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.610
The title of this play
is the following --

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.600
be very strong now - It's "Porn."

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.950
It's P-O-R-N.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:25.050
And it's about political
pornography.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.640
What is it mean, political
pornography?

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:35.700
That there are periods in the
history when the politicians want

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:42.190
to own our body, want to
own our intimate life.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.480
What happened to us in '86?

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.720
I became officially a
political dissident.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:55.330
And we noticed the moment when
they bugged our apartment.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:31:01.950
We were a very young
couple, with my wife.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:08.420
And we asked ourselves
now how to make love.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.670
What is [inaudible] and
intimacy of your own life?

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:23.690
After '89, I got from
the Romanian Minister

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:32.290
of Internal Affairs my
secret files, 1300 pages.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:37.580
And I took these files and
I exhibited all of them.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:44.240
So when the audience enters
the space of this show,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.860
they go through my files.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:53.360
We have also photos taken
by the secret police.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:32:01.900 position:56%
Very dear for me in a way because we
are the street, talking to my wife.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:10.490 position:56%
And after two kids, she got
pregnant again and she lost her baby

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.800
when she was six months
old, but she couldn't abort.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.920
And in the hospital, they
didn't want to intervene,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.050
and we counted backwards the
days, because she was very close

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:28.060
to dying in a septic shock.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.850
So this is what the play is about.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.840
Born is the code name

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.900
of this character followed
by the secret police.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.040
My friends are telling me
that why you are giving

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.780
so hopeless titles for your play.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:51.140
Please stop doing that.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.250
I think I told this yesterday.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:33:00.270
I remember after the show directed
by Natalia, I told this yesterday

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:09.080 position:56%
that I don't want to be a merchant
of a cheap hope, because I don't say

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:17.210
around this very easy-going
way to resolve our problems.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.870
So if somebody is not
coming to see my play

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:26.280
because of the title,
that's still fine.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:36.800
I am fighting successfully
against success.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:46.940
This is a play which I loved a lot.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:57.320
It was produced by the Hungarian
National Theater in Transylvania.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:02.860
The previous one was commissioned
by the Hungarian National Theater

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.260
in Budapest to write that play,

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.780
and it was performed
in various versions.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.630
This play is called "Alcoholics."

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:20.180
I read an interview with a
woman, an addicted woman,

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:26.380
who told her story in a newspaper.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.380
And the story, it was fascinating.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:37.120
She's not alcoholic anymore, but
she's telling the way how she went

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.450
through this extremely
hard experience.

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:51.110 position:56%
This is an image of that production.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:57.500
As you can see again,
it's the same dramaturgy,

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:02.810
only the main character is a real
person and the others are coming

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.140
out from her imagination.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:14.410
And this is humorous and funny
and painful at the same time.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:19.630
It's a garbage dump there.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:35.710
And finally, I think this play,
it's called "Caravaggio Terminal."

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.010
It's about Caravaggio.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:50.180
I don't know how many of you are
familiar with this early Baroque,

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.750
late Renaissance painter.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:59.860
He became a very close
friend of mine.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.620
He was a genius and one

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:08.280
of the biggest painters
in this 17th century.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:15.160 position:56%
He died in 1610 at a very early age.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:25.870 position:56%
I fell in love with him because he
could never integrate in the system.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:32.080
He got commissions, being genius,

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:40.150
but then the system got
him, went against him.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:44.650
So he had to leave Rome.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:53.430
He went to [Inaudible], and he
wanted always to come back to Rome.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:37:01.140
I was very interested in the way
how he preserves his freedom.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:07.080
He got the highest
commissions in Rome.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:14.280
If you're going to Rome,
Santa Maria del Popolo Church,

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.430
you can see his paintings
[inaudible].

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:27.330 position:56%
I tried to follow his way of being
free, being radical in his messages.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:32.310
Just one trunk remained
after him at Porto Ercole.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:39.530
And in spite of getting the
highest commissions in his time,

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:43.640
nothing remained after him.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.250
He gave away all his
money all the time.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.030
So he never became an
established artist.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:38:01.390
Sometimes my kids are telling
me that that is the time for you

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:12.510
to become an established artist.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:21.340
[ Laughter ]

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:28.720
Okay, so now to summarize a
little bit and I will finish here.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:35.000
What does it mean to be removed
from your space of freedom?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.430
It means the trauma which
creates, for instance,

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:47.930
a very special amnesia for you.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:54.140
Or it creates -- it's
called also anomia.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.950
Nomos means weird or [inaudible].

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:07.150
So you are an outcast when
rapes your freedom, right?

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.050
What does it mean, this?

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:15.580
That means that you forgot
to read the language,

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.010
now metaphorically speaking.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:23.590
We lose the meanings of our words.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.500
What happened after
the Second World War?

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:33.040
The major authors of the
Western culture are speaking

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:39.500
about the impossibility to
use again the same language.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:44.760
Where to go now?

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:52.060
What is the meaning of this
consensus for everybody, right?

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.670
Thou shall not kill?

00:39:54.670 --> 00:40:00.710
After, for instance,
Auschwitz when killing kids,

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:06.910
killing mothers in
a professional way.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:14.510
One of my favorite authors, who
was awarded with a Nobel Prize,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:26.190
Imre Kertesz, in2002, I knew him
personally, and I even rewrote one

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:31.040
of his novels in three
different versions for the stage.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:40.250
For a one-man show, 10 actors,
and again for 10 actors.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:44.000
In his acceptance speech
delivered in Stockholm,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.500
he speaks about this -- that for
him the hardest part of his life

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:55.390
after coming home from
a prison camp was

00:40:55.390 --> 00:41:00.180
to reconstruct the language,
to create new meanings.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:05.780
Who is from this point of
view, my master in the history

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.590
of the Western theater
is Samuel Becket.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:15.510
Samuel Becket, the former
disciple of James Joyce.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.600
You know, a novel of James Joyce,

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:24.570
it's as rich as the
creation, "Ulysses."

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:34.120
And Samuel Becket wanted
to follow the same path.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:39.760
After [inaudible] that
path got close to him.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.030
It was an abyss, not a road.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:47.060
And then he [inaudible]
it's a very famous phrase.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:56.050 position:56%
It was a mystical turn he names like
this, a mystical turn in his life,

00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:03.080
when he says that subtracting
rather than adding.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:10.410
So he created the very poor
language, almost a known language.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:18.570
He created of poetry
of the depraved.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:23.570
So he created the space of
the theater, loop dramaturgy.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.630
What does it mean,
this loop dramaturgy?

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.170
The endlessness.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:35.790
He's going around all the time,
"Waiting for Godot," "Endgame",

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:42.690 position:56%
his genius radio plays, "Footfalls,"
etc, etc. He is going always around,

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:48.410
always around and tries
to expend the time,

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:54.610
because he doesn't fear the
possibility to go further.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:43:01.180
Sometimes in the theater
this is what I am doing.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.940
Don't go further.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.310
Slow down.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.910
Be more radical with yourself.

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:14.470
And if somebody in the
audience would get bored,

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:18.930
this is also part of the event.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.980
I don't want to torture
you now in the theater,

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.510
but sometimes it happens.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:28.140
[ Laughter ]

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:32.890 position:56%
Because the basic question is always

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:37.260
for a playwright, "What
happened to us?

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.410
What happened to me?"

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:53.260 position:56%
So the drama, the play is a literary
text created with no language

00:43:54.600 --> 00:44:00.170
and we can understand it
because of the actors,

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.910
only because of the actors.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:08.540
If they don't offer
totally their lives for us,

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.190
we won't understandably the play.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:15.910
I think that we cannot
understand Hamlet either,

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.450
or the very funny Moliere.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:26.350
So sometimes I direct but very
rarely, and my actors are asking,

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:32.160 position:56%
"What is your main stage direction."

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.590
You need to die on the stage.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:45.900 position:56%
Then when we are applauding you, you
need to respect and to smile to us.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.700
Thank you very much.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:54.220
[ Applause ]

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:58.890
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady: I think we
have time for a few questions.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.720
&gt;&gt; By any definition, you and
your family were fortunate

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.880
by the Communist regime -
emotionally, physically, whatever.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:19.010
And comes 1989, and the
door of the prison opens.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:23.660
Why did you decide to stay
in the locale of the vulture?

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.190
Why were you not living
in Switzerland

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.950
or Denmark or where ever?

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.210
&gt;&gt; Andras Visky: I lived
in the United States,

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.340
working as a visiting
professor here.

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:46.610
I got many offers to stay
with my family, but I realized

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:52.780
that I don't want to construct
a different identity for myself.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.080
I have my own stories.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.940
I have to tell these stories.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:05.420 position:56%
And I think that after '89, both in
Romania and Hungary and that region,

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:13.690
it was a big challenge to
work on an idea of the freedom

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:19.260
or social justice,
especially as a playwright.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:25.250
I'm considered the first who wrote
plays about the communist past.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.310
And it was a big surprise
for me that nobody wanted

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:32.670
to speak about that past.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:41.060
So I think that my career or
my journey cannot be described

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:50.600
with these geographical
regions, Switzerland

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:56.310
or this heaven of banks, whatever.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:57.950
I don't know.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:02.560
I can't see floating
banks around me.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:12.310
I think that it's much for me as a
writer, much important to go back

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:20.660
in time and to create pages or
images which tell to my audience

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:27.060
that the most fragile aspects of
the human life is the freedom.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.530
And time to time, we are
ready to give up our freedom.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:38.370
To invest our freedom in
somebody, to hit him instead

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:43.600
of hitting ourselves by
giving up our freedom.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:52.800
And also, it's important for a
writer to be surrounded, I think,

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.250
if you don't switch
your language by those

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.370
who are speaking the same language.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:04.150
To follow how the language,
the evolution of the language,

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:10.430 position:56%
the evolution of the meanings, how
language is being changed after '89,

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:14.550
for instance, in our region.

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:33.890
&gt;&gt; How can the political
changes effect you

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.410
as person that has [inaudible].

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:40.490
&gt;&gt; Andras Visky: For me, '89
was a big, big, and happy event.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:47.410
I was vice president of
the county, for instance.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:52.420
But I realized after a while
that I had to resign to not

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:56.620
to destroy totally this county.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.960
I had to offer the
space for somebody else.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.980
You know how it affected?

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.800
For us young professionals,
intellectuals,

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:17.080
university professors, it was the
time to construct things from zero.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.920
Ken mentioned the publishing house.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.100
I'm not doing it anymore.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:32.360
I worked on creating out of
the blue a theater department

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.890
as a part of our University.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:40.210
[Inaudible] University
is a huge university.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:45.430
We have almost 60,000 students.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:53.120
I was very challenged because
of these opportunities,

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:59.940
and then I began to travel
everywhere in the world.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:06.970
But I realized that in most of
the big democratic countries,

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:10.320
everything is almost done.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:15.770
I don't want to enter
in something new.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:19.560
&gt;&gt; And your writings?

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.140
How has it affected your writings?

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.190
&gt;&gt; Andras Visky: Probably a lot.

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:29.490
I don't know because you don't
have to counter, test for this.

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:35.710
Just let me tell you one aspect.

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:43.500
It took a long time to kill the
inner censorship in your mind,

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:47.260
to don't censor yourself.

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:53.040
You know, because a censorship,
it's both a political aspect

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.260
but it becomes a part
of your identity.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:00.240
So you need to be very
courageous to go against this.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.230
&gt;&gt; It seems like those who
celebrate freedom are those

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:05.860
who have been in captivity.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:11.910
I sense in your works a
longing to go back to captivity

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.630
because of the treasures
and the wonder and the joy

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:18.750
of experiencing the freedom
that came afterwards.

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.600
And even in that.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:29.060
My big question -- is it possible
to find freedom without captivity?

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.680
&gt;&gt; Andras Visky: I think
that the captivity,

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:36.600
it's not a simple political term.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:42.270
It could be a very personal term.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.850
But this is common sense, that
the freedom is not a given thing,

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:52.440
but I think that the
captivity is a given thing.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.510
The structure of -- sorry for that,

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:04.410
but I'm not very optimistic
regarding the human being

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:07.140
in general.

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:13.090
Because I got to see things,
a lot of things around me,

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:18.890
people dying on the street,
in that prison camp also.

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:26.250
Mothers and were unbelievable,
especially the winters.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:31.460
I still dream is this winter?

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:38.980
I have the sound of the -- For me,
the snowing is not that romantic.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:43.600
I could see my mother, how
she tries to hide herself

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.840
to not be watched, how she cries.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.230
Now, what's next?

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:59.930
I think that the captivity
- Well, I don't you now

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:03.190
to become prisoners today.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:04.490
I cannot help you.

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:09.190
The captivity in many
ways makes you mature.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:15.580
I was a child, but I noticed
much, much more than many others.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.810
But in the same time, you know,

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:26.620
also for me the captivity is a
special experience of the body

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:36.410
that sometimes I feel that I
remained in many ways a prisoner,

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:43.200
not having the trust
sometimes in people around me.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:49.240
That level of trust you
need to continue your life.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:58.520
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] and does
this dramaturgy apply

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.820
to all of your plays?

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.120
&gt;&gt; Andras Visky: I don't know.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.650
Read the book, because there are,
I don't know how many, seven,

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:09.270
eight critical essays
about what I'm doing now.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:15.730 position:56%
But you know, barrack dramaturgy, I
consider the theater being a prison.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:21.380
We entered the prison and
we get out from the prison.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.240
For instance, in one of my plays,

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:31.380
we shot the audience
behind the Iron Curtain.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.470
And it was very meaningful for them

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:40.220
because the Iron Curtain is a
metaphor of the Eastern Bloc,

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:43.900
and the concreteness of the iron.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:49.900
People were very disturbed
because of that.

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:54.230
Historically speaking, you know?

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:58.610
Because you are a director,
historically speaking,

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:06.690
you know the black box is the
tomb, is the [inaudible] tomb.

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:11.950
You remember the main
[inaudible], 8th,

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:20.230
9th century when the theater
again, after 1000 years of silence.

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:23.750
We hadn't had theater
for 1000 years.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:27.730
When I say this, I'm speaking
of professional theater.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:29.660
You know, after the Greek.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:35.860
The historians say that it was
1000 years without theater.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.370
And then in the 8th, 9th century,

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:44.280
it emerged from the
Catholic liturgy in the West.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:50.340
I'm speaking about
the Western countries.

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:55.930
So I am telling you this,
that the architecture

00:55:55.930 --> 00:56:01.900
of the back box goes
back to the empty tomb.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.180
So what are the actors doing?

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.910
They entered the empty tomb.

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:11.740
They are dying as persons.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:18.970
We see them as characters and they
are coming out from the empty tomb.

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:20.270
It's the same.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:25.890
I barrack dramaturgy for me,
that's why it is important

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:28.020
because it's very personal,

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:32.280
and at the same time historically
speaking you have a foundation

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.580
for it.

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.380
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Nyirady:
No more questions?

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:52.040
[ Applause ]

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:55.670
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
