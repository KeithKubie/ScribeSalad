00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:02.934
A magician performing at a birthday party

00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:05.351
stands inside a circle of 15 kids.

00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:08.750
He's going to choose a volunteer
and he wants each kid to have

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.518
the same chance of getting
chosen, fair enough.

00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:14.910
Now we have three methods
by which he can do it.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.487
Let's just think about whether
each of these methods are fair,

00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:21.279
where each kid does have

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.729
the same chance of getting chosen.

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:26.153
If they don't lead to each kid

00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:27.456
having the same chance of getting chosen,

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.456
think about why that is the case.

00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:32.816
So, method one, the magician starts

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:35.737
with the birthday boy and moves clockwise,

00:00:35.737 --> 00:00:39.880
passing out 100 pieces of
paper numbered one through 100.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.544
He cycles around the circle

00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:43.345
until all the pieces are distributed.

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:45.559
He then uses a random number generator

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.705
to pick an integer, one through 100,

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:50.503
and chooses the volunteer
with that number.

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:52.088
So just think about what's happening.

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:53.489
So there are 15 kids in a circle.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.639
So there's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:04.583
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:06.912
I planned that out amazingly well,

00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:09.197
I didn't think I would be
able to fit exactly 15,

00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:10.088
but it worked out.

00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:11.698
So 15 kids in a circle,
and then he's going

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:13.226
to hand out pieces of paper.

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:18.699
So he's going to give
one, two, three, four,

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:27.029
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:32.275
This person is going to get
pieces of paper one and 16.

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.378
Now this person is
going to get two and 17.

00:01:34.378 --> 00:01:36.315
You're going to keep going
round and round and round

00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:41.003
until all 100 pieces of paper
are going to get distributed.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:49.037
Now, something to think about
is whether every child here

00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:52.163
is going to get the same
number of pieces of paper.

00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:54.053
I encourage you to pause this
video and think about that.

00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:56.556
If we just keep cycling
around all the way to 100,

00:01:56.556 --> 00:02:00.920
does each child get the same
number of pieces of paper?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.823
Well just think about it.

00:02:02.823 --> 00:02:04.726
In order to get the same
number of pieces of paper,

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:07.729
100 has to be divisible by 15,

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.793
and we know 100 isn't divisible by 15.

00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:13.838
15 goes into 100 six times.

00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:20.384
Six times 15 is 90, and
you have a remainder of 10.

00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:23.336
So what's going to happen is all 15 kids

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.080
are going to get six pieces of paper,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.432
and then another 10 of the 15 are going

00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:29.928
to get a seventh piece of paper.

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:32.920
So they're not all getting an equal number

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.040
of pieces of paper.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.009
So even though he's
randomly picking an interger

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.049
between one and 100 some
of the students are going

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.234
to have a higher chance
than the other ones.

00:02:41.234 --> 00:02:44.187
The 10 that have seven
pieces of paper are going

00:02:44.187 --> 00:02:46.426
to have a higher chance
than the other five

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:51.042
who only have six pieces of paper.

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:55.338
So I would say method one is not fair.

00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:58.094
Let me write this down.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:01.758
Not fair.

00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:03.350
Sometimes life isn't fair,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.470
but in this case it's not
fair where we define fair

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.879
as the same chance of getting chosen.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.214
That's because they all
have different numbers

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:14.445
of pieces of paper.

00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:17.854
All of the students are not
equally likely to get picked.

00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:20.046
Let's look at method two.

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:22.381
The magician starts with the birthday boy

00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:26.766
and moves counterclockwise
passing out 75 pieces

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:28.598
of paper numbered one through 75.

00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:30.534
He cycles around the circle until

00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:31.918
all the pieces are distributed.

00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:33.862
He then uses a random number generator

00:03:33.862 --> 00:03:36.158
to pick an integer between one through 75

00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:37.894
and chooses the volunteer
with that number.

00:03:37.894 --> 00:03:39.807
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:41.806
and think about whether
this one, method two,

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:43.565
whether that one is fair.

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:46.726
Well method two is the same as method one

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.141
except for instead of
using 100 pieces of paper,

00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:51.459
we're using 75 pieces of paper.

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.350
So think about, is 75 divisible by 15?

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.190
And 75 is, five times 15 is 75.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.234
So in this situation,
each student is going

00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:05.866
to get five pieces of paper.

00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:10.130
Each gets five pieces of paper.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.449
So they all have an equally
likely chance of getting picked,

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.114
and he's using a random
number generator to pick them.

00:04:16.114 --> 00:04:18.442
So they all have an equally likely chance.

00:04:18.442 --> 00:04:24.097
I would say method two is, indeed, fair.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.970
They all have the same
chance of getting chosen.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.922
Now think about method three.

00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:33.894
The magician starts with the birthday boy

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:35.693
and moves clockwise, passing out 30

00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:37.750
pieces of paper numbered one through 30.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.157
So they're all going
to get the same number

00:04:39.157 --> 00:04:40.365
of pieces of paper.

00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:41.926
They're all going to get
two pieces of paper each.

00:04:41.926 --> 00:04:43.348
15 children getting two pieces

00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:45.605
of paper each would be 30 pieces of paper.

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:47.549
So that looks reasonable so far.

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:48.974
He cycles around the circle

00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:50.381
until all the pieces are distributed.

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.125
Everyone gets two pieces.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.341
He gives number one to the birthday boy,

00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:54.749
number two to the next kid and so on,

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:57.178
so that all seems reasonable.

00:04:57.178 --> 00:04:58.650
Kind of consistent with method two

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.402
except instead of 75 it's 30,

00:05:00.402 --> 00:05:02.394
and obviously 75 was overkill.

00:05:02.394 --> 00:05:04.515
Even here this is overkill,

00:05:04.515 --> 00:05:06.675
he just really needs 15 pieces of paper.

00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:10.658
He then counts the number
of windows in the room

00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:14.490
and chooses the volunteer
with that number.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.435
So the question here is,

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:19.395
is the number of windows in the room,

00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:22.851
is it random and is it evenly distributed?

00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:27.387
So maybe, maybe you can make a case

00:05:27.387 --> 00:05:29.231
depending on what building it's in,

00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:32.515
and someone's house, it's somewhat random

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:36.954
on how many windows that
house happens to have,

00:05:36.954 --> 00:05:39.084
the house that's happening
to host the birthday party,

00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:43.035
but it's not going to
be evenly distributed.

00:05:43.035 --> 00:05:49.234
I don't know, there's probably some,

00:05:49.234 --> 00:05:51.186
if you were to sit and
plot all of the houses

00:05:51.186 --> 00:05:52.250
that had a birthday party,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.626
you'd probably see that it's more likely

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:56.986
that they'd have 10
windows than one window,

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:59.466
and definitely more likely that they have

00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:03.558
10 windows than, let's say, 30 windows,

00:06:03.558 --> 00:06:06.035
or even maybe 15 windows even.

00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:09.952
So it's not going to
be evenly distributed.

00:06:10.398 --> 00:06:16.616
Every house has a somewhat
different number of windows,

00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:19.154
and the house that's
happening to host the party

00:06:19.154 --> 00:06:21.650
seems to be somewhat random,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.515
but it's not going to be
evenly distributed here.

00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:26.962
I would say it's not a
kind of a really good

00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:30.907
random number generator because
it's not evenly generated.

00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:35.081
So I would say method three is not fair.

00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:38.149
The number of windows is not

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:41.446
a really good random number generator.

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:43.574
A good random number
generator, we would want,

00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:45.950
say, number one through
75 where any of these

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.950
have an equally likely
chance of getting picked.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.949
It's somewhat random,

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.246
the number of windows that building has,

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:57.246
but they're not all equally likely.
