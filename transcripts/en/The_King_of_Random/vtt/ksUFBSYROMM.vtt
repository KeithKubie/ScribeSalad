Boing.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.520
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.560
I am denting the wall.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.760
Hey guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.720
Welcome back to the workshop,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.880
where today we're going to be making
a cool pocket-sized coin launcher

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.340
out of used gift cards.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.340
This is a fun little weapon
that's built from things

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.440
you probably already
have lying around your house.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.720
And it uses nickels as ammunition.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.220
For any non-Americans out there,
a nickel is what we call our five-cent coin.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.420
The actual launcher is made from

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.980
four rigid plastic cards,
two rubber bands, and some super glue.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.120
We'll also use scissors to cut them up.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.419
And of course, we're going
to need some nickels as our ammunition.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.200
I recommend using used gift cards for this.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.660
In the past, I've had a tendency
to throw away gift cards

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.700
when I'm finished with them.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.020
But I did have these for arcade
cards left over from a trip.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.300
They're the same size and thickness
as a gift card or a hotel key.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.980
To start,  let's take
one of our cards, one of our coins,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.460
and something with a straight edge
we can use to trace against.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.610
Technically, you could probably use
just about any coin to make this shooter work.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.520
I went with the nickels
for a couple of reasons.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.559
One of which is that
the thickness of a nickel

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.960
is almost exactly
the same as two of the cards.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.960
Whatever coin we're using,
we want to put that onto our card,

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.340
and then use our straight edge to draw
two parallel lines down the center of our card,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.820
approximately the same width as our coin.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.400
There's a little bit of extra
space to either side of our nickel,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.420
but that won't be a problem.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.720
I'm leaving about 80%
of the card just as straight lines,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.460
then we'll make sort of a
curve flare on both sides.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.060
We now want to cut along
the curve flared portion,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.620
and meet up with the straight portion,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.260
all the way across the card.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.960
Our card will end up
divided into three sections.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.480
Now we want to divide a
second card exactly the same way.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.440
So let's fit our first card
center piece onto a second card,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.640
and then trace the outline.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.960
[Music]

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.740
You should now have two pieces
that are basically identical.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.840
You can see how
nicely they line up.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.340
There may be a few imperfections

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.000
where we didn't cut them
out quite perfectly the same,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.640
but we'll be able to fix that later.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.100
Now let's take some super glue,
and glue our two pieces together.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.620
Super glue will react fairly
quickly with this type of plastic card.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.920
So I find the easiest thing
to do is apply the glue to one card,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.360
then line up two of the edges on the table,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360
and then press the cards together.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.840
This will help make sure
you have them properly aligned,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.240
and that you don't miss while
you're trying to glue them down,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.780
because once they're glued,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.380
you won't really be able to
adjust them back to straight.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.040
Now let's grab another one of our cards,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.300
and begin to glue on the four pieces
that we cut from the sides of this centerpiece.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.920
We'll use a similar technique applying glue,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.200
then lining up the edges
before we move the two pieces together.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.640
[Music]

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.780
Now we do the same thing with
the two card pieces on the other side.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.580
[Music]

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.160
We do want this Center piece to
fit nicely in the Gap that we've cut,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.780
but oftentimes,
our gluing will be a little bit imperfect

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.380
or the sides will
just be a little too close.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.290
And in that case,
we can take some sandpaper,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.820
and just take down the edges
of the centerpieces a little bit.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.360
Sand the center portion until it 
doesn't catch or snag on any pieces of card.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.280
Before we attach our last card

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.730
onto the three that we've
already attached together,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.220
we want to cut out a
little bit of a notch at the bottom.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.560
And that'll make it a lot easier
to grab onto our firing mechanism.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.680
[Music]

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.040
With the notches
cut out of the bottom,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.460
now let's glue our top card on
to the three we've already connected.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.300
[Music]

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.540
The center tab should now fit easily
into the gap between the other cards.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.620
We now need to add some spring power.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.120
To do that, we're going
to be using a couple of rubber bands,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.020
but we want to make sure
that they're going to stay in place

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.600
right where we put them.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.930
Just by stretching our rubber band
over the cards,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.340
We can see a
good spot to put the notches.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.680
We don't want the
rubber band to be covering the gap,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.840
because that's where
we're going to fire the nickels.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.700
[Music]

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.040
To cut these four notches out,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.650
We can use a knife,
or a saw, or a file.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.570
The notches don't have to be very deep.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.840
They just have to
hold a rubber band in place.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:17.500
[Music]

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.680
With our notches cut,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.260
we can now stretch the rubber band
between the notches on both sides,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.300
and they should be held nicely in place.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.740
Two normal rubber bands
should give us all the power we need

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.840
to launch our coins pretty far.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.240
At this point, the basic version of
our coin launcher should be ready to use.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.340
Let's give it a try.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.200
To load in a coin,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.500
let's just pull back
the launcher a little bit,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.160
fit a nickel into the opening,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.160
and then drag it back the rest of the way.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.520
[Music]

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.680
That works great.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:55.840
[Music]

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.300
This thing works pretty well,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.460
but I've got a couple
ideas of some upgrades

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.250
that will make it work a lot better.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.190
I would say the two biggest problems
are that it can be a little bit hard

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.960
to hold on to
since it's such slick plastic.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.840
And of course, that you have to
reload the coin individually every time.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.700
And I think we've got solutions
for both of those problems.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.120
I have here the two pieces of plastic
that I cut off of the ends of the card

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.640
that make it easier
to grab on to the launcher.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.940
Let's cut out a
small piece from each of these

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.880
and glue them on to
the back of the launcher on both sides

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.980
so it's a little
bit easier to hold on to.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:38.820
[Music]

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.300
Those two notches should
give us much better grip.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.360
We also want to make the body
of our coin launcher easier to hold on to.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.920
Let's see if we
can cut a couple of notches

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.680
into the sides of our coin launcher

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.940
that makes it easier to grip.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.640
This curved file should give us
a nice profile that's easy to hold.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:05.420
[Music]

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.400
These two curved notches
are easy to fit my fingers into,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.080
and they give much better grip.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.580
That solves our first problem
of how easy it is to hold on to

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.590
the coin launcher.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.320
But at this point,
we're still loading our nickles individually,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.300
And I've got a good solution
for how to get past that as well.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.520
We can add a semi-automatic
launching attachment onto the card.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.870
But to do so will require
a little bit of surgery.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.680
We're going to have
to remove the top card,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.980
drill a hole into it,
and then glue it back in place.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.280
Let's use an exacto knife to see

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.710
if we can fit it in between
the top card and the next layer down,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.640
and see if we can split through
the superglue to get this off.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.860
Now of course,
if you're going to be making

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.240
these modifications at home,
you can just do this from the beginning,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.420
and add all of this before
you glue it on in the first place.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.420
When we're firing our launcher,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.780
pulling it back about that
far seems to be a good distance.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.080
We can see that the curved notch

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.800
we've cut out of the card
goes right about like that.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.320
So if we have a hole
the exact size of a nickel

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.360
just above there,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.800
we should be able to drop
nickels down into our launcher

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.360
through a hole in the top
just by pulling back the firing mechanism.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.400
To drill that hole,
I have a 7/8 inch Forstner bit.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.200
And we're going to be using that size
because it's just barely larger than

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.440
the diameter of a nickel.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.060
[Music]

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.740
That line will mark where
we should start drilling that hole.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.840
To be able to drill
cleanly through our card,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.260
let's secure it in
place to a block of wood,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.580
and that whole block to our desk.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.400
That should let us
drill nicely into it

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.840
without it moving around too much.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.480
Alright, right about here,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.220
It looks like our bit is fitting
nicely between all of our markings.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.400
So let's start drilling.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.940
[Music]

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.960
There we go.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.260
We are through.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.440
That might take a little
bit of cleaning up with a razor blade.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.440
[Music]

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.320
Perfect fit.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.740
The nickel just drops right through there.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.590
Let's also hit that
with a little bit of sandpaper

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.860
to take off the burr.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.300
[Music]

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.320
If we line all of the pieces
of our launcher back up together,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.639
we can see how this will
work to drop coins down inside.

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.669
You have a nickel on top,

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:20.210
when we draw it back,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.540
nickel drops in
and then gets fired out the front.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.440
But we don't want just one nickel
to be able to launch from the top.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.580
We want to add a whole magazine on to this.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.610
And so to do that,

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.360
we're going to cut off
the neck of a standard water bottle

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.800
and attach that on
to the top of the cards.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.740
Stay hydrated kids.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.160
Most standard water or soda bottles,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.200
should be able to fit a nickel nicely
through without much space on the sides.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.500
[Music]

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.620
After we cut off the
neck of the water bottle,

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.940
we want to remove any of the plastic
that starts flaring out sideways.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.140
We don't want these
pieces that get wider.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.420
We just want the same width
of the neck all the way down.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.180
I'm doing some rough
trimming with the razor blade,

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.880
and then we'll move on to using some
sandpaper to get a nice even flat edge.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.600
[Music]

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.660
The bottom of our bottleneck is sanded,

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.820
and it should fit just perfectly over
that hole we drilled into our card.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.200
Let's use some super glue
to glue that in place on to our card,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.580
and then glue that top card back
in place on to our coin launcher.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.560
[Music]

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.920
Just to reinforce the connection

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.000
between the neck of
the bottle and the top card,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.720
let's go around
the base with some hot glue

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.500
because the plastic is so thin.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.200
That should be a little bit more secure 
of an attachment than just super glue.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.480
With the bottle neck,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.840
we now have a magazine
that could hold up to seven nickels,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.940
And we can put a lid on top of it,

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.820
so they don't spill out
while we're carrying this around.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.780
Some taller types of water bottle neck
may be able to hold even more.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:01.700
[Music]

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.880
We've got one thing left
to do before testing this out,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.640
and that of course is to paint it.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.280
We love to give things a
little bit of decoration here.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.780
Let's just lightly hit the surface

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.780
with some sandpaper first
to make the paint grip nicer.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.120
I'm going to paint it
with the firing mechanism in,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.340
which wi'll add some
black paint on to the back of it,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.400
but won't get any paint onto the body of it.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.400
That's because if there
was paint on the body of it,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.680
it could bind up inside the mechanism.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:31.320
[Music]

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.340
Our coin shooter is painted up,

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.000
and ready for some firing.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.760
Let's load up our ammunition.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:48.340
[Music]

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.240
Oops, pulled that too far.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.660
If you want additional power,

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.520
try just adding
a second rubber band each side.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:03.300
[Music]

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.540
That was way better.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:13.240
[Music]

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.840
This mifty little coin shooter is

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.950
just made out of
a few cards and a rubber band.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.530
And if you want the added magazine,

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.830
a piece of a water bottle.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.640
It works really well,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.720
it fits in your pocket 
and it can carry up to seven shots

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.339
with just the short little
water bottle neck that I have on it.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:25.900
And like I said,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.840
you can probably
extend that magazine size

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.040
by just using a taller water bottle neck.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.600
Hey guys, thanks for watching.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.920
If you're not a subscriber yet,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.240
just hit the bomb to get in the club.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.440

Click down there at the bottom
to see what the internet thinks

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.740
that you are supposed to watch next.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.460
That's it for today.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.020
Have fun.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.460
Be safe and see you tomorrow.
