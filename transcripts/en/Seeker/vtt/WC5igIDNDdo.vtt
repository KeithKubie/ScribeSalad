00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.950
Are you a member of the Clean Plate Club?
If you’re an adult, then the answer is probably

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.509
yes! Children... not so much.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.509
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we’ve
all heard of the clean plate club, right?

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.500
It’s the meaningless title parents use to
guilt their kids into eating all of their

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.609
food?

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.160
Well it turns out, most card-carrying members
of the Clean Plate Club aren’t children

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.500
- they’re adults!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.550
Researchers at the Cornell Food &amp; Brand Lab
analyzed almost 1,200 diners across 8 different

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.600
countries, and found that across the board,
adults eat, on average, 92% of what they put

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.300
on their plate. This is of course specific
to homemade meals, versus at a restaurant

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.340
where you’re given a pre-determined portion.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.039
They also found that percentages were lower
for snacks - only around 76% - and also lower

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.210
when a person was distracted - around 89%.
People who were NOT distracted while eating,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.010
actually ate around 97% of their entire meal,
on average. So maybe there is something to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.870
be said for watching TV during dinnertime...

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.059
What’s especially interesting, is that there
doesn’t appear to be any cultural bias here

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.320
- at least, not among developed countries.
The numbers were almost identical from the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.730
US to Korea to France. The co-author of the
study, Dr. Katherine Johnson, believes the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.360
reason we finish most of what we serve - is
because “we’re aware enough to know how

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.730
much we’ll want in the first place.”

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.730
Children, on the other hand, may not be. Researchers
also analyzed 326 kids under age 18, and found

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.070
that the average child only finishes 59% of
what he or she serves.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.040
One possible explanation, is that kids are
pickier, and thus less certain about whether

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.930
or not they’ll like a particular food. “Regardless,”
they say, “this is good news for parents

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.720
who are frustrated that their kids don't clean
their plate,” since it appears that few

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.290
of them actually do.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.700
As for adults, it’s believed that these
findings could help us practice more conscious

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.770
eating. If we know we’re gonna eat almost
everything we serve ourselves, then maybe

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.250
we should be mindful about how much food we’re
actually putting on our plate.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.380
What do you guys think? Are you members of
the Clean Plate Club? And what about your

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.960
kids? Let us know your answers in the comments
below - and as always - thank you guys for

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.210
watching!
