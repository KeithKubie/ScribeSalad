00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.533
NARRATOR: The boats
may look simple,

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.532
but their design is
intricate and complex.

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.000
Ta'u boatbuilders journey
deep into the forest--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.300
[non-english speech]

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.133
--to find the 11
different species of tree

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.700
needed to make a [non-english].

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.834
Centuries of experience go
into making these boats.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:29.734
The wood for the keel is heavy,
to keep the boat centered.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:33.166
The woods used for the sides
are light and buoyant to help

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.699
it float.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.500
Only an ax is used
to shape each part,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.767
and wooden pegs hold the
whole thing together.

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:42.667
There isn't a single nail.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:43.800
It's a real work of art.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.500
[non-english speech]

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.867
Building a [non-english]
takes around 5 months.

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:52.300
But with good care, it can
last more than 10 years.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.367
To make sure my [non-english]
survives this journey,

00:00:58.367 --> 00:00:59.967
I need to fix those cracks.

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:05.533
And that means heading inland
in search of a rare tree.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.233
The interior of the
island is so mountainous

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:12.800
that most of the forest is
completely inaccessible.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.166
Even the parts the Ta'u can
reach are a tough climb away.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.166
[music playing]

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:25.400
The tree I'm looking for only
grows in a handful of places.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.000
But the Ta'u always know where
to find such a valuable plant.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.433
Finally, I reach my goal--

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:36.000
a tree they call [non-english].

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.834
That's gotta it.

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:38.700
They're hard to find.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.400
So the elders, they mark these
trees so they can find them

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.300
again, showing how
important a tree like this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.633
is to the Ta'u people.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:52.399
And what's important
about it is in the roots.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.467
Yeah, right there.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.166
The roots of the [non-english]
tree are surrounded by these

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.800
strange, densely packed fibers.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.000
It's like cotton fibers,
really super soft and lofty--

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.333
just bizarre stuff.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:14.166
In all my travels,
I've never seen a tree

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.867
that makes that kind of stuff.

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:17.700
Bizarre.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.566
[music playing]

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.767
Back at the shore, I get
to work on my repairs.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:27.834
I need to hammer
the [non-english]

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:30.333
fibers into the cracks.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.900
These tiny fibers, they
act just like the wood.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.367
When they get wet, they swell.

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:42.100
This is the sort of
indigenous technology

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.700
that have been keeping people
going out here for centuries--

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.667
simple, but effective.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:49.667
It's all about knowing the
resources that are out there.
