00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:08.466
- This is Rene Magritte's
Menaced Assassin from 1927.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.939
In preparation for the exhibition,

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.527
we did some treatment,

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:15.671
and also some technical examinations.

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:19.170
One of the techniques we used
for examining the painting

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.513
was infrared light,

00:00:20.513 --> 00:00:24.251
and that typically shows underdrawing.

00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.989
In some cases you can see details,

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.150
where, for instance, in the toe of the man

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.041
standing in the center,

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:36.860
the table leg actually was
painted over the figure.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.122
Particularly in 1927,
when he painted a lot of

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:43.721
large paintings, you can
really see he was working

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:47.157
very quickly and economically to get these

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:50.211
big images ready for his gallery show.

00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.307
In the transmitted light,

00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:55.690
where you actually shine
a light from behind

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.173
the canvas, so you can see
details in the brushwork.

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:02.017
You can see he used a much finer brush

00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:04.099
for the details in the faces,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.706
and in the case of the three
small heads in the center,

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:12.706
he also used a kind of varnish
to accentuate the faces.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.970
We also saw that particularly
in the black paint,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.511
our theory is that Magritte
used a commercial paint

00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:25.469
to mix in with the blacks to
make them more rich and glossy,

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.767
to accent details, in particular,

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:30.855
in the shoulders of the
figures on the left and right.

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:33.050
When it was first acquired by MoMA,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.028
the conservators described
the surface as moldy,

00:01:37.028 --> 00:01:40.549
and they thought that
this patchy appearance

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.973
was due to actual mold contamination.

00:01:43.973 --> 00:01:46.087
We actually discovered that this kind of

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:50.254
patchy appearance is mainly
due to zinc in the ground.

00:01:50.254 --> 00:01:53.934
The commercial canvases that Magritte used

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:56.884
had a thick layer of zinc
in the priming layer,

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:01.039
and over time, especially
in a thin paint layer,

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.860
the zinc can actually come to the surface,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.053
and that seems to have
happened in this case.

00:02:07.053 --> 00:02:10.246
The treatment and examination
took about a year,

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:12.847
and now, you really get to see Magritte

00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:17.788
as is intended, with the
palette looking very fresh

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:21.867
and differences in the nuances
of the brushwork visible,

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.026
and all this is now very apparent

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:27.237
after the recent conservation treatment.
