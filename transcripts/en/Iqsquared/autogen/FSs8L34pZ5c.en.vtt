have an impact on the election the
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.550
have an impact on the election the
question was which of the two options

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560
question was which of the two options
 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.610
question was which of the two options
was the least terrible but I assumed we

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620
was the least terrible but I assumed we
 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.820
was the least terrible but I assumed we
might have an impact and so that's how I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
might have an impact and so that's how I
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.530
might have an impact and so that's how I
think about it I don't know that I would

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540
think about it I don't know that I would
 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.630
think about it I don't know that I would
ascribe that kind of responsibility to

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640
ascribe that kind of responsibility to
 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.480
ascribe that kind of responsibility to
myself especially I look back over the

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490
myself especially I look back over the
 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.380
myself especially I look back over the
significant events of the two years

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390
significant events of the two years
 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.540
significant events of the two years
before that and so I'm not trying to

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
before that and so I'm not trying to
 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.040
before that and so I'm not trying to
dodge responsibility but I'm not trying

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050
dodge responsibility but I'm not trying
 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.960
dodge responsibility but I'm not trying
to yank it and hug it to myself either

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970
to yank it and hug it to myself either
 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.530

had started the investigation and our

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.290
because I was about to have a encounter
with the press where I knew I'd be asked

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300
with the press where I knew I'd be asked
 

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.080

think it's probably time for us to
 

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.830
think it's probably time for us to
confirm that we're doing this and she

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:24.840
confirm that we're doing this and she
 

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.850

just call it a matter and that actually
 

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.230
just call it a matter and that actually
made the hair stand up on the back of my

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240
made the hair stand up on the back of my
 

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.590
made the hair stand up on the back of my
neck a little because

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600
neck a little because
 

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.890
neck a little because
the Clinton campaign had been struggling

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:40.900
the Clinton campaign had been struggling
 

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.100
the Clinton campaign had been struggling
to avoid characterization of this as an

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.110
to avoid characterization of this as an
 

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.020
to avoid characterization of this as an
investigation they'd called it a

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.030
investigation they'd called it a
 

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.900
investigation they'd called it a
security referral a security review and

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:48.910
security referral a security review and
 

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.110
security referral a security review and
so Loretta's direction to me we don't do

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120
so Loretta's direction to me we don't do
 

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.060
so Loretta's direction to me we don't do
matters we do investigations it's in our

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.070
matters we do investigations it's in our
 

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.320
matters we do investigations it's in our
name and that that direction that that

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:58.330
name and that that direction that that
 

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.110
name and that that direction that that
direction to me roughly tracked what the

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120
direction to me roughly tracked what the
 

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.350

that's what made the hair stand up I
 

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.460
that's what made the hair stand up I
probably should have said Loretta come

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:08.470
probably should have said Loretta come
 

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.910
probably should have said Loretta come

it's just based on my encounters with

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:09.170
it's just based on my encounters with
 

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:11.290
it's just based on my encounters with
the president after he became president

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:11.300
the president after he became president
 

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:15.160
the president after he became president
that his is constantly bringing it up in

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:15.170
that his is constantly bringing it up in
 

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.490
that his is constantly bringing it up in
order to deny it so he knew all this he

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:18.500
order to deny it so he knew all this he
 

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.080
order to deny it so he knew all this he
knew what you were going to tell I don't

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.090
knew what you were going to tell I don't
 

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.990
knew what you were going to tell I don't
know no I don't know that and so the

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000
know no I don't know that and so the
 

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.250
know no I don't know that and so the
plan was I will stay behind to meet with

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:27.260
plan was I will stay behind to meet with
 

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.980
plan was I will stay behind to meet with
the president-elect alone to tell him

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:29.990
the president-elect alone to tell him
 

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.370
the president-elect alone to tell him
this as my first meeting with him and

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:32.380
this as my first meeting with him and
 

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.710
this as my first meeting with him and
and so that was the part I was I'm not

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720
and so that was the part I was I'm not
 

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.970
and so that was the part I was I'm not
sure how much I was paying attention to

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:36.980
sure how much I was paying attention to
 

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.290
sure how much I was paying attention to
the first meeting because the second

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:38.300
the first meeting because the second
 

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.490
the first meeting because the second
meeting was gonna be very difficult and

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:39.500
meeting was gonna be very difficult and
 

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.510
meeting was gonna be very difficult and
so we did that I met along with him and

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.520
so we did that I met along with him and
 

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.920
