um yeah there's something about that
 

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:16.710
um yeah there's something about that
simplicity like I said it's just taking

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720
simplicity like I said it's just taking
 

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.109

through two filters to make the
 

00:23:26.049 --> 00:23:27.810
through two filters to make the
connection and it's just so much easier

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:27.820
connection and it's just so much easier
 

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.849

actually there it's the simplicity and
 

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:32.820
actually there it's the simplicity and
it's funny because it's so much more

a little bit of a difference that I

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:10.360
a little bit of a difference that I
 

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.330
a little bit of a difference that I
think is an improvement of what we're

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:12.340
