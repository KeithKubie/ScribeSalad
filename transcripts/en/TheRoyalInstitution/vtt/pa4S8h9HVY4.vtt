00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.349
[archive audio] Why? Why must man go into
space?

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.480
Why must he attempt this new and forbidding
environment?

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:26.019
Space, with its belts of radiation, meteorites,
solar winds, unknown cosmic forces.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.859
To explore his world man has always risked
the unknown,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.160
because it is unknown, and man's nature is to know.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.010
Project Mercury is a beginning for man, in
space.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.960
[narration] Mercury: the mythological God
of travel,

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.760
was the name chosen for the US's maiden space
programme,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.020
which was established in 1959, shortly after
the formation of the civilian space body,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.640
NASA.
Defining the goal was simple: to send a man

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.330
into space and bring him back safely.
But NASA was under no illusions that achieving

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.900
this would be simple.
Just two years previously the US had watched

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.740
with shock and embarrassment as the Soviets
placed Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.420
into earth orbit.
And against the backdrop of an ever-escalating

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.090
tension between the two nations, the Space
Race was born.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.420
The ultimate goal: to claim the title of first
in placing a man on the moon.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.909
The Cold War had seen a boom in the military's
development of long-range rocket technology.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.149
With the clock ticking, NASA didn't have the
luxury of time to develop new rocket systems

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.979
from the ground-up.
So instead, it turned to the military's existing

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.140
arsenal of ballistic missiles.
Two rocket systems were chosen.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.000
The first was the Redstone rocket, to be used
for Mercury's short-range sub-orbital missions,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.599
which involved sending sending payloads into
space, but not sending them into orbit.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.569
For this, the more powerful Altas D rocket
was selected.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.150
These rockets were designed to carry munitions,
so NASA needed to develop a capsule system

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.959
to carry the human payload and return them
to Earth safely.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.290
In the event of an emergency, these capsules
were designed to separate and carry their

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.590
pilot away.
[archive audio] The escape rocket takes the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:47.030
capsule away from the booster.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.239
From all of the active duty pilots from the
navy, marines and air force,

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.980
the service records of 473 test pilots were
selected for...

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.159
[narration] Perhaps more important to Project
Mercury's goals was the selection and training

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.030
of the men who were going to pilot the rockets.
[archive audio] The graduate of an AV or air

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.360
force test pilot school, 1500 hours of flight
time, qualified in jet aircraft, an engineering

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.190
background, younger than 40 at the time of
selection, and 5 feet 11 or less,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.780
[narration] The candidates underwent intensive
physical and mental assessments.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.799
[archive audio] Each measurable reaction of
body chemistry, each physical function was

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:42.000
measured, probed, diagnosed. What is the specific...
[narration] Women were automatically excluded

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.250
due to President Eisenhower's insistence on
recruiting from the pool of active military

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.940
test pilots.
[archive audio] 7 men emerged from this competitive

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.439
purgatory as the Project Mercury astronauts.
[narration] The so-called Mercury Seven were

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.209
soon paraded in front of the world,
thrust into the national spotlight, becoming

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.700
the poster boys for the newly established
American space programme.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.260
Over the coming years the press and US public
would take great interest not only in the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.680
progress of Project Mercury, but in the personal
pursuits of these budding astronauts,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.729
digging into their private lives, and presenting
them as national heroes.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.820
[archive audio] Here the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration space task group

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.780
under the direction of Robert Gilruth had
organised a training programme for the astronauts.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.419
They were excellent students and had a realistic
and tough minded approach to Project Mercury.

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.169
They had to know all the answers, here they
discovered...

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.139
[narration] Project Mercury's manned missions
featured only a single pilot, sot he 7 would

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.139
have to work alone under the harsh g-force
profiles of launch and re-entry,

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.310
along with the uncomfortable temperatures,
confined spaces, and quirks of weightlessness.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.889
Before any of the astronauts could put this
training into practice, NASA would have to

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.490
ensure the rocket hardware was up to scratch.
So 20 unmanned developmental missions were

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.400
launched before any of the Mercury Seven strapped
into a launch capsule.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.860
A number of these missions involved sending
animals into space, including Ham, the first

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.430
space-faring chimpanzee,
who was sent into space and returned safely

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.970
in January 1961.
And Enos, the first chimp to orbit earth in 1962.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.780
Preparations for missions started a month

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.430
in advance, with two men chosen to take part,
one as the primary astronaut, the other as

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.650
the backup.
On 5 May 1961 the US sent its first man into

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.479
space.
Launching Alan Shepard 116 miles above the

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.940
Earth on a 15 minute sub-orbital mission,
retrieving him safely from the Atlantic Ocean

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.540
shortly after launch.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.840
Project Mercury saw a total of six manned missions,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.819
achieving its first orbital flight
with John Glenn in February 1962.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.169
Gordon Cooper brought the programme to a close
in 1963 with a 34-hour orbital flight, achieving

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:24.069
22 orbits.
Although the US had achieved impressive feats

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.160
with Project Mercury, the Soviets had beaten
them at nearly every step.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:37.330
[archive audio] Newspaper headlines tell the
story: Gherman Titov of Russia returns to

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.800
earth after orbiting the globe 17 times in
a little more than 25 hours, covering...

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.680
[narration] Yuri Gagarin had achieved a successful
orbital flight a whole month before Shepard's

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.759
first sub orbital mission.
A year later, in 1962, Andriyan Nikoliev completed

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:58.220
a 4 day orbital stint aboard Vostok 3,
far outstripping any mission on the Mercury

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.810
roster.
It was beginning to dawn on the American people

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:08.470
that they were losing this race.
And so in 1962 Kennedy hit back with a rallying

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.460
call:
[archive audio] For the eyes of the world

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.060
now look into space,
to the moon and to the planets beyond,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.330
and we have vowed
that we shall not see it governed

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.910
by a hostile flag of conquest,
but by a banner of freedom

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.000
and peace.
We have vowed that we shall not see space

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
filled with weapons of mass destruction,
but with instruments of knowledge

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.699
and understanding.
Yet the vows of this nation

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:48.849
can only be fulfilled if we in this nation
are first,

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:54.169
and, therefore, we intend to be first.
[narration] By pitching America's quest for

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:59.410
space as a fight for peace and security,
Kennedy had enlivened the nation's ambition.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.599
But it would have to dig deep into its pockets
and cover significant ground if it were to

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:08.960
beat its rivals to the top spot.
All eyes were now set firmly on the moon.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.870
[archive audio]We choose to go to the moon
in this decade and do the other things,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.180
not because they are easy, but because they
are hard.
