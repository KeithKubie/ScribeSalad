00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.130
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So going back to our earlier problem, if a times b equals 15, and a plus b

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.555
equals negative 8, then what are the values of a and b. Just to remind you in

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:13.175
case it's not completely clear right away, it doesn't which number we call a and

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:17.535
which number we call b. As long as we have the two right numbers that satisfy

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:18.835
these two equations.
