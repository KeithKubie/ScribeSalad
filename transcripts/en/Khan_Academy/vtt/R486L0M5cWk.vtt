00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's say we need to figure
out how many times 16 goes

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.221
into 1,388.

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:06.720
And what I want to
do is first think

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.970
about how we traditionally
solve a problem like this

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.630
and then introduce
another method that

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.450
allows for a little
bit more approximation.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.990
So traditionally you would say,
well, 16 does not go into 1

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.700
any times.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.210
So then you move over one spot.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.970
Well, how many times
does it go into 13?

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.700
Well, it still does
not go into 13.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.830
And then you go
all the way to 138.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.990
And you say, well,
16 does go into 138.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.830
And you say, how many
times will it go into 138?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.619
And you might try 9 first.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.340
And I'll do all my arithmetic
here on the right side.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.550
So you'll say, 16 times
9-- 6 times 9 is 54.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.830
1 times 9 is 9, plus 5 is 14.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.050
So it goes 144 times.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.170
So that's still too big.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.060
That's larger than 138.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.230
So it's going to go
into it eight times.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.370
Eight times will
be less than 138.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.630
So you would stick an 8 here.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.660
And notice, I had to do this
little trial and error here.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.650
I had to make sure I got
the right exact number.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.566
I had to make sure I put
an 8 right over here.

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:12.410
Then you say, 8 times 6 is 48.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.880
And then 8 times 1
is 8, plus 4 is 12.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.750
So 8 times 16 is 128.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.680
So when I subtract, I get
the remainder from 138.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.300
So I get a remainder
of 8 minus 8 is 0.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.790
3 minus 2 is 1.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.024
And then these cancel out.

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:31.190
So I have a remainder of 10.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.960
But I still have this
8 right over here,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.010
so I bring that down.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.590
So I have 108.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.090
And then I do the
same thing again.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.173
Let me get rid of this so
we don't get distracted.

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:42.640
We say, how many times
does 16 go into 108?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.952
And you can approximate.

00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:45.910
You say, well, it's
definitely not eight times.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.280
Eight times is 128.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.911
Is it, maybe, seven times?

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:50.910
And then you might do a
little math on the side.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.220
See-- 16 times 7.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.442
6 times 7 is 42.

00:01:55.442 --> 00:02:03.180
1 times 7 is 7, plus 4 is 11.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.060
So you get 112.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.280
So that's still too large,
so it's going to be 6.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.430
But notice, we had to
do this little side work

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.490
on the side right over here
to realize it wasn't seven.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.910
Now six is the
largest how many times

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.700
you go into 108
without going over it.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.691
So 6 times 6 is 36.

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:22.150
Carry the 3, or regroup
the 3, depending

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.240
on how you think about it.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.830
6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.340
Then you subtract again.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.720
8 minus 6 is 2.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.079
And then you can just
say 10 minus 9 is 1,

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.120
or you could even borrow.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.161
You could make this a 10.

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:38.610
And then that goes away.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.050
10 minus 9 is 1.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.187
So then you have 12.

00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:43.270
And if we're not going
into decimals, you're done.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.340
Because 16 does not go into 12.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.392
So 16 goes into 1,388 86
times with a remainder of 12.

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:55.370
That right over there
is your remainder.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.500
And that's all a
decent way of doing it.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.000
And that's the way
you traditionally

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.770
know how to do it.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.670
But what I want
to do is introduce

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.580
another maybe a little
more interesting way

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.380
to solve a
long-division problem.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.679
So once again, let's do
our 16 goes into 1,388.

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:13.220
And what we're going
to do is give us

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.510
much more leeway
for approximation,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.940
or for essentially guessing.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.610
And what we want to
do is just guess.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.780
We're going to make
guesses for how many times

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.750
16 goes into the numbers
without overestimating,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.470
without jumping too high.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.280
And now we're not
just going to think

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.430
about the 1 or
the 13 or the 138.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.040
We're going to think about
the whole number as a whole.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.290
And before we do that, I'm
going to get two things out

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.990
of the way, just
because it will help us.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.406
I'm just going to
remind ourselves

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:41.767
what 16 times 2
and 16 times 5 are.

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:43.600
And I'm just picking
these as random numbers

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.260
that we can use to approximate.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.530
You don't have to use 2 and 5.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.530
You can use any numbers.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.210
Maybe I'll show
other examples there.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.740
So 16 times 2, we know, is 32.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.180
And 16 times 5 is
50 plus 30, is 80.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.430
So let's just keep these
two results in mind

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.476
while we try to tackle
this right over here.

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:04.850
So the first thing
to think about

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.072
is our best guess for how many
times does 16 go into 1,388.

00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:13.280
Or another way to think
about, how many times does 16

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.390
go into 1,000?

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.769
Let's just do something at
a very rough approximation.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.570
Well, we know it's not going
to be 100, because 100 times 16

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.810
would be 1,600.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.990
You would just throw those
two 0's at the end of it.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.480
And [? you'd ?] say, how many
times does it go into 1,000?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.436
Well, we know if 16 times 5 is
80, we know that 16 times 50

00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:41.455
would be 800.

00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:43.650
So let's use that.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.490
And I'm using the 5-- I'm
multiplying it by another 10

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.730
to get to 50-- instead of the
2 because 800 is a lot closer

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.090
than 320 to our 1,000
that we care about.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:01.041
So what we could say is, well,
16 times 50 will get us to 800.

00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:02.540
And once again, how
did I know that?

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.330
Well, 16 times 5, I know
ahead of time, is 80.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.200
So 16 times 50, I
multiplied by 10-- 5 times

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.520
10-- it'll get us to 800.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.385
And then I just subtract.

00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:13.690
So I subtract here.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.160
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.990
And then you could
say 13 minus 5 is 588.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.600
And now we ask ourselves, how
many times does 16 go into 588?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.844
How close can we get to that?

00:05:26.844 --> 00:05:28.260
And let's just
assume that we only

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.843
know this stuff right
over here, or we

00:05:29.843 --> 00:05:32.480
can multiply 16 times
a multiple of 10.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.646
So 800 would once
again be too big.

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:36.995
That gets us above 588.

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:41.680
Let's just go with
320 right over here.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.122
We know that 16 times 2 is 32.

00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:50.140
So 16 times 20 is
going to be 320.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.200
I just multiplied
the 2 times 10,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.470
which would give us
our product times 10.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.060
And so we can subtract
this right over here.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.092
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:01.710
8 minus 2 is 6.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.840
And then 5 minus 3 is 2.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.570
So now I'm left with 268.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.262
And we say, how many
times does 16 go into 268?

00:06:14.154 --> 00:06:15.210
Well, let's see.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.270
800 is too big.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.740
Even 320 is now too big.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.100
Well, we could say-- 10
times 16 will get us to 160.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.100
Let's just try that out.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.760
We don't even have to get
the right exact answer.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.590
We don't have to get the highest
multiple that's less than 260.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.070
We just have to make sure
that we're still within 268.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.060
Let me do a new color over here.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.370
If we multiply 16
times 10, we get 160.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.270
160, we subtract again.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.896
So 8 minus 0 is 8.

00:06:42.896 --> 00:06:44.620
6 minus 6 is 0.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.560
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.560
And then we're left with,
well, how many times

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.010
does 16 go into 108?

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.710
And we know 16 times 5 is 80.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.860
So let's just try out 5.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.810
16 times 5 is 80.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.750
We subtract right over here.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.992
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:07:04.992 --> 00:07:06.480
10 minus 8 is 2.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.806
So we're left with 28.

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:08.930
And now it's pretty simple.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.680
How many times
does 16 go into 28?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.185
Well, it only goes
into it one time.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:20.050
And then when you subtract
16 from 28, 8 minus 6 is 2.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.520
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.604
You're left with
a remainder of 12.

00:07:23.604 --> 00:07:25.020
But you might say,
well, how do we

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.520
know how many times
does 16 go into 1,388?

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.410
Well, it goes 50 times
plus 20 times plus 10 times

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.520
plus 5 times plus 1 time.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.810
So that's going to
be-- we can just add up

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.840
all of these things on
the right-hand side.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.860
This is going to be 50 plus
20 is 70, plus 10 is 80,

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.000
plus 5 is 85, plus 1 is 86.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.100
So there we have it.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.130
It went into it 86 times
with a remainder of 12.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.610
And what's cool about this
method is that at every step,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.230
I could have put a
60 over here and I

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.730
could have done
the math correctly.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.390
Or I could have picked my
two multiples to be 16 times

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.382
6 and 16 times 3.

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.340
And I would have gotten
different results here.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.300
But at the end, I would still
have gotten the right answer.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.640
So what it does is it gives us
a method so that we're always

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.780
thinking about-- we're
always kind of biting away

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.940
chunks of what
we're dividing into.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.610
So first we bit off
an 800-piece chunk.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.300
Then we bit off a
320-piece chunk.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.660
And we keep going
until we essentially

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.650
can't divide by 16 any more.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.890
So hopefully you found
that kind of interesting.
