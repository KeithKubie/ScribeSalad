TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.090
I'm Timothy Jordan, and I'm
here at Google SF for a Tango

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.600
workshop.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.475
And with me is Eitan.

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:20.930
Eitan, how are you doing?

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.070
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
I'm doing great, Timothy.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.350
Thanks for having me here.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's always
a pleasure to have you.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.225
For those of you that have
seen Eitan on our show before,

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.900
you know that he's a senior
software engineer on Tango.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.380
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yep.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.088
I've been working on
Tango for some time,

00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:34.510
trying to help mobile
devices see and understand

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.660
the world around them.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: God, it's
such a cool technology.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.070
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah,
we're really excited about it.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.778
I know we've talked
about it in the past,

00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:43.230
but use cases like shopping
for furniture at home

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.330
or using your device
as a tape measure,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.980
or even getting from point A
to B in a mall or in a museum

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.870
and using your device
for indoor navigation.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.760
It's really exciting.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.885
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, and
we've talked about those.

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:56.690
We've even shown some screen
capture of those use cases.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.750
I love games on
Tango, and the whole

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.980
being able to measure things
is so simple and useful.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.090
And at this workshop you're
going beyond those use cases

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.820
and exploring photo and video
and visual communication

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.320
with Tango.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.550
Can tell me a little
bit about that?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.910
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.570
So at this workshop,
we're really

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870
looking to expand the
capabilities of a camera,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.430
and what people
think of when they

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.640
think of their camera
on a mobile phone.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.770
And we're doing this kind
of in three major ways.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.100
So the first one is
in video, doing things

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.670
like video stabilization and
rolling shutter compensation.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.040
The second thrust we're
pushing on at this workshop

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.530
is around filters
for imagery, so

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.790
being able to combine depth
information with the RGB camera

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.850
to get really
interesting effects,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.700
sort of stylize your photos.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.930
And the third thrust is really
around storytelling, and just

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.700
tying the camera to
the space that it's in,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.010
and enabling new
experiences and new stories

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.700
to unfold in front of you
in your actual environment.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
God, that's so cool.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.050
Well, I'll tell you
what, why don't we

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.650
actually just look at
some of these use cases

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.720
and talk to some developers?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.470
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.305
We should do it.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:01:57.221
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:00.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.556
I'm now sitting here
with Chris and Ana

00:02:05.556 --> 00:02:06.930
from the Wall
Street Journal, who

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.663
are doing really cool stuff with
Tango at this workshop today.

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:10.579
How are you two doing?

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:11.350
CHRISTOPHER CHESTNUT:
Doing great.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.110
Loving it.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Tell me what
it is that you're working on.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.720
CHRISTOPHER CHESTNUT: Working on
a new angle of photojournalism.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Tell me about that.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.790
What does that look like?

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.000
ANA BECKER: We want to create
an app that lets photographers,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.900
as they're taking a
photo, sort of place

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.550
in 3D space exactly where
they are and exactly

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.560
the viewpoint that they're
shooting through, I guess.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.160
On the users' side,
as they're sort

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.280
of navigating their day-to-day
world, footsteps that appear in

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.140
places where photographs have
been taken with this app.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.610
It's capability-enabled, so you
can hold your phone up and sort

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.500
of line up seamlessly
into your environment

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.120
where this photograph was taken.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.410
So utilizing Tango's fine scale
location information and area

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.986
mapping as a tool to give people
a new lens to view their world.

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:03.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
really exciting.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.080
I think it's really
interesting the ability

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.900
to explore space in new
ways because of technology

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.860
like this.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.680
And the demo that you
guys are working on

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.320
is a really cool
example of that.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.990
I think what I hear
from you is that there's

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.870
this gap between
the photographer

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.160
as the creator of
the work and the user

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.470
who's viewing this work.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.572
And you're trying to
bring them more together.

00:03:27.572 --> 00:03:28.280
ANA BECKER: Yeah.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.340
I think that's a really
good way of putting it,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.660
of sort of stepping
literally into the shoes

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.753
of another person
at another time.

00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:39.537
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:43.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm now sitting
here with Andy and Eddie

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.049
from Mirada, who are also at
this Tango workshop today.

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.340
Tell me what you're working on.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.150
EDDIE OFFERMANN: I sort
of took a left turn

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
from what I normally am doing.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.910
I decided to sort of approach it
from the perspective of gaming,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.480
and scanning an area and
building an environment

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.500
based on what's actually there.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.730
And so my idea
with this was what

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.340
if you could just sort of build
the structure of your landscape

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.690
with LEGOs or building blocks
or cardboard or whatever

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.160
and then, using Tango, scan
that and creates your terrain.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.910
It's basically
taking the mesh data

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.000
that we get from Tango
that's great for doing stuff

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.350
like just determining
the locations of things

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.970
and measurements of things,
or bouncing physics off

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.310
of it, but then taking that
data and using it to construct

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.580
something that's actually
texturable and looks

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.490
like a nice landscape.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
What about yourself?

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.406
ANDY COCHRANE: So
it's an app that

00:04:36.406 --> 00:04:38.550
takes the depth data from
Tango and then creates

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.780
digital art out of it.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.870
Taking that and using the
depth data only from the Tango

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.780
to allow you to create digital
art really quickly and easily.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.499
So it's just really,
really fun, really easy

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.040
way of taking the depth data
and making something really cool

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.291
out of it and then sharing it.

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:56.831
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So what do you
think about building for Tango

00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:57.550
so far?

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.299
EDDIE OFFERMANN: We've
done a lot of stuff

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.830
for some other
platforms, and I think

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.050
we probably agree that the
functionality is a lot more--

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.425
ANDY COCHRANE: It
actually works.

00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:09.883
EDDIE OFFERMANN:
It's a lot-- yeah.

00:05:09.883 --> 00:05:11.690
It's a lot more mature.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.350
So it's pretty easy
to develop for.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.632
I can kind of rely
on it to provide

00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:19.090
the essential
information, and then

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.631
I just have to figure
out what I want

00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:23.221
to do with that
information on top of it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:28.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
OK, Sam, so tell me

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.020
what you're working on today.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.690
Sam Maliszewski: I'm working on a video
stabilization app using Tango.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So walk me
through the user experience.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.610
Sam Maliszewski: Yeah.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.130
I mean, I really wanted it
to be as simple as possible,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.020
where you open it up, for
a second you kind of still

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.230
see the camera shaking,
and occasionally-- I'm

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.810
still-- I'm adding
some new features,

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.560
so it's a little bit buggy and
gets some weird distortions,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.750
but after about a
second, it'll stabilize.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.660
And then it'll just be a
smooth image on your thing.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.460
And you basically move the
camera like you would--

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.460
it's sort of like having a
virtual gimbal, in a way,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.389
where it's-- it'll--

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Like one
of those things that you

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.142
attach that makes it smooth.

00:06:09.142 --> 00:06:09.642
Sam Maliszewski: Mhm.

00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:10.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Uh-huh.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.640
Sam Maliszewski: Yeah.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.280
It's kind of just a very
little imaginary Steadicam

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.330
inside your tablet,
in a way, where

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.340
it's just you kind of guide
it where you want to go.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.224
And ideally, it will follow.

00:06:20.224 --> 00:06:21.515

YULIYA PARSHINA-KOTTAS: Hello.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you've
been playing with Tango.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.720
What do you think?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.580
BRIAN PLUMMER: We're
really excited,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.246
and there's a lot of
cool possibilities.

00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:38.350
And we are in the situation
where we have lots of data

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.210
and we're trying to figure
out how we can leverage

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.910
AR to showcase this data
and drive user engagement,

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.150
and also, I guess,
surfacing our content

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.912
so people can discover things.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And what
are some of the things

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.814
that users could potentially see
with Tango and New York Times?

00:06:57.814 --> 00:06:59.730
YULIYA PARSHINA-KOTTAS:
The one exciting thing

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.560
is maybe utilizing some of
the 3D models and the 3D data

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560
that we'd been building.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.600
So imagine seeing that on your
table top, or all around you.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.290
Visualizing some scenes
from the news headlines that

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.400
have happened, so going
beyond even the 2D headlines

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.649
and jumping into the
3D world around you.

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:18.690
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What do
you think about the Tango

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.919
development process so far?

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.960
YULIYA PARSHINA-KOTTAS:
I'm actually coming at it

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.085
from a different direction.

00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:26.750
I am a 3D artist and not
that much of a developer.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.090
So for me, it's been
an amazing experience.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.890
I've jumped into the
Unity side of it,

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.150
and even being able to crawl
through-- with baby steps

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.640
through getting
the basic tutorials

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.979
and actually building stuff
has been really great.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:41.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.728
YULIYA PARSHINA-KOTTAS:
So it seems

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:45.190
to be a friendly platform
for even beginners.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.965

00:07:53.929 --> 00:07:56.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Those are some
really cool demos that we just

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.180
saw, Eitan.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.840
I can't wait to get
those on a Tango

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.444
phone, which begs the question,
when can I get a Tango phone?

00:08:02.444 --> 00:08:04.610
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah,
so we're super excited.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.818
We're really close to launch.

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:08.300
The first Tango phones are
going to go out this fall.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.070
They'll be made by Lenovo
with a partnership with us.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.430
They're called Phab 2 Pros,
and you can look for them

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.555
on store shelves this fall.

00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:15.846
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:08:15.846 --> 00:08:17.400
And in preparation
for that launch,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.910
you guys have done a bunch
of SDK updates, as well.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.190
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.670
So in preparation
for launch, we've

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.470
been working hard on the SDK,
both performance improvements

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.482
and some new features.

00:08:25.482 --> 00:08:27.440
If you're interested in
learning more about it,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.280
you should definitely check
out our developer sites.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:32.874
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
You got it.

00:08:32.874 --> 00:08:33.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
we'll put the link below.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.760
I'm Timothy.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.179
This is Eitan.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:36.500
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
Bye, guys.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.720
Thanks.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.136
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
See you next time.
