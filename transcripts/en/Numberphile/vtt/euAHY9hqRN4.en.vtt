00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.650
KATIE STECKLES: My favorite
number is 27.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.140
It's always been my favorite
number, even before I was a

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.840
mathematician--

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.810
before I was properly a
mathematician, I guess.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.600
Because 3 has got--

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.550
3 is a magic number,
in some sense.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.960
It's got properties.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.910
Like 3 add 3 was a bit boring.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.430
3 times 3 still wasn't
quite good enough.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.330
But then 3 to the power of 3
was like, that'll do me.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.660
So I went for 27.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.550
And I always had this idea that
being 27 would be, like,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.460
I would totally have
everything in my

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.870
life sorted by then.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.560
The year when I was 27
would be awesome--

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.240
a brilliant year.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.830
I have recently turned 27.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.680
Things are going pretty well,
I'd say, probably.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.360
3 is sort of the first proper
number, really.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.070
Like 1's nonsense.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.980
1 doesn't really do anything.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.770
2 is just there.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.060
And then 3--

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.040
3 is when you start to
really get number-y.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.535
3 crops up in a lot of places.

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:06.150
It has got quite a lot of
stuff related to it.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.690
BRADY HARAN: Then why isn't
3 your favorite number?

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.190
KATIE STECKLES: Well,
it was, at first.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.340
But I realized that I was
quite derivative.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.600
And that pretty much everyone
who realized how good 3 was

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.290
would just be like, oh, yeah,
my favorite number's 3.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.100
So I decided to power it up
and go for 3 to the 3.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.040
I recently found out that 27 is
a self-locating number in

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.390
the expansion of pi.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.370
It obviously starts with the
3, but then the bit we're

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.520
interested in is the decimal.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.750
So it's like 3, 141,
and so on.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.850
So these are just the decimal
digits of pi.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.280
But if I count along here--

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.910
and of course, like all good
computer scientists, I start

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.160
counting at 0--

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.600
occasionally I'll find numbers
which match up with their own

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.200
position in this decimal
expansion.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.390
So 6--

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.060
there is a number which starts
at its position 6 in here.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.920
So if I carry on numbering
these, this doesn't actually

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.070
happen for that many numbers.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.070
And in fact, if I get
here, I've got 27.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.170
And the 27th digit there is the
beginning of the number 27

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.980
here in this decimal
expansion.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.310
And in fact, the next time that
will happen is at some

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.195
point in pi, we'll
get to this.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:29.285
And in fact, that digit there
is digit number 13,598.

00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:32.280
That is next time that
that will happen.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.890
So 27--

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.140
pretty special.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.920
BRADY HARAN: What'd you do
for your 27th birthday?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.020
KATIE STECKLES: I had a party
and invited all my friends.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.555
And we played board games.

00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:50.210
BRADY HARAN: What games?

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.840
KATIE STECKLES: We had a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.870
Rubik's-cube-themed board game.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.680
We had some maths-- we
had Set, which is

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.340
a maths card game.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.620
And various other fairly nerdy,
serious board games.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.380
But it was pretty good.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.990
We hired out a room in a pub and
just took over the room.
