00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.110
All right, so let's walk through this solution line

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.530
by line. We first initialize an empty array, word counts.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.460
We then cycle through all of the lines in

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.350
the document. For each line in the document we create

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.820
an array, data. Data is the line stripped of

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.680
any surrounding white space and tokenized based on the white

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.820
space. For each string in data, we create a new

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.590
key. And we remove any punctuation from the word and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.270
make sure that the word is lower cased. Then, we

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.210
check if the key exists as a key in word counts.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.860
If it does, we add 1 to the value for

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.750
that key. If not, we initialize that key in the word

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.630
counts dictionary and we set it equal to 1. When

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.110
we've cycled through all of the lines And all of the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.400
keys in each line. We print out the dictionary word_counts.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.830
Which should have a count of each word, in our document.
