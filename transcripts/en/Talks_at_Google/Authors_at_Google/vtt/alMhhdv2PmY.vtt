STACY SCHIFF: Thanks so much.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.220
Just after I started
work on this book,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.700
I went to see one
of the greatest

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.020
scholars of the 17th century.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.110
He'd written some of the
finest pages about Salem,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.729
and I wanted some advice.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.520
When I left him that
day-- we were standing

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.560
on the front porch
of his house--

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.940
he added another
little piece of advice,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.712
pretty much as an afterthought.

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:31.170
He said, I should
probably warn you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.130
that when you write
about witchcraft,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.970
really strange
things happen to you.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.312
And I kind of forgot about that.

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:38.770
The comment
disappeared in the air.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.228
And I went on to
research the book.

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:41.250
I write the book.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.080
I finished it more
or less on schedule,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.866
kind of more or less maybe sort
of approximately on schedule.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.490
The publisher was
really happy with it,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.323
and they were even
happier when they learned

00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:53.000
that Publisher's Weekly was
going to do a profile of me

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.200
this summer, with
which they would

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.330
run a full bleed,
full page picture.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.430
And indeed they did.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.410
And here's what it looked like.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.010
So as you may notice,
that Stacy Schiff is not

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.020
I. Thanks to Twitter, it
took me about 90 seconds

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.360
to figure out that it's Amy
Stewart, a novelist whom

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.200
I've never met.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.700
She does have a book out this
fall, which I'm thinking maybe

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.380
I could cross promote.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.370
And when I asked my
publisher to send me

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.980
this page so I could show people
what strange things happen

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.900
to you when you
work on witchcraft,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.916
I also asked them to send
me the table of contents.

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:27.540
And here it is.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.456
I don't know if you can
read it, but essentially I

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.330
was rather surprised to
learn that after four

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.880
years in the archives
unearthing, and deciphering,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.175
and squinting at documents,
corralling my imagination

00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:42.060
and hiring fact checkers,
I had written a novel.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.230
So strange things
obviously do happen to you

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.460
when you work on witchcraft.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.680
This is not a book of fiction.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.490
Instead, it's an
attempt to grapple

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.995
with exactly what happened
in eastern Massachusetts

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:57.960
in 1692, among the loopiest,
really certifiably strangest

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.170
moments in American history.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.700
Salem may qualify as the best
known, least understood chapter

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.760
in our past, partly because
it seems so improbable

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.340
and partly because it comes
to us through Hawthorne

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.490
and through Arthur Miller who
were in fact writing fiction.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.800
Here we are halfway between
Plymouth Rock and Paul Revere,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.810
and suddenly everything
just goes screechingly

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.700
off the rails.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.950
As I'll also make clear, in
the course of nine months,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.880
we go from one kind of story to
a very different kind of story.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.770
It's a tragedy to which
we go back regularly.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.720
Few corners of American history
have been so often explored.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.370
And if you don't believe
me, take a look at this.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.950
Here's my local library's
stack of 17th century

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.080
American history.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.910
So you can imagine me crawling
my way-- eating my way--

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.560
from one end to the other.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.220
The other slide
is my office shelf

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.720
when I finished
writing the book.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.180
You can see at the very
top there those little

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.700
Loeb Classical Library volumes.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.780
Those were leftovers
from the Cleopatra years.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.492
And I've always
wondered what Cicero

00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:03.450
thought about being wedged
between the Puritans

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.810
on both sides of him there.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.010
Salem is a little bit our
national campfire tale.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.030
It's one of the rare
moments in our history

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.050
when the candles are
knocked out and everyone

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.320
seems to be groping
around in the dark.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.760
That's where all
good stories begin.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.770
In the dark, we
imagine most vividly,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.790
and we believe most fervently.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.160
It's in the dark that we
contemplate our mistakes

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.010
and wrestle with our fears.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.220
"In the dark," goes
the Italian proverb,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.390
"every cat is a leopard."

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.170
And if you read the court
papers of 17th century Essex

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.570
County, which I spent
a lot of time doing,

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.570
you begin to notice that
the New Englander lived

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.500
very much, very attentively,
and very apprehensively

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.730
in the dark.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.480
Women tend to stumble
into their beds

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.560
to find strange
men sleeping there.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.870
Men trip home through
the night to discover

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.920
that familiar landmarks have
moved and that people get

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.179
lost in their own backyards.

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:55.470
Young men report that they're
weak-kneed at the thought

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.097
of riding home in the night to
their families after sundown.

00:03:59.097 --> 00:04:00.930
And when the devil
offers to accompany them,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.900
they accept his offer.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.450
I read every 17th century
account of the New England

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.870
murk, of the wolves
howling in the distance,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.746
and the lurking
Native Americans.

00:04:10.746 --> 00:04:12.120
But it took me a
really long time

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.480
to figure out how dark
dark truly could be.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.422
And in truth, it
took me until this.

00:04:17.422 --> 00:04:20.529
This is midtown
Manhattan in 2012

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.930
in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.730
I was driving some friends
home to their home downtown.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.377
We were uptown, and
we had electricity.

00:04:26.377 --> 00:04:28.960
And suddenly, all those accounts
of the New England wilderness

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.620
made sense.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.730
I mean, you couldn't
see anything.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.192
You could truly become
disoriented in your own yard.

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.150
And hence, the line in
chapter one of the book,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.250
"The sky over New England
was crow black, pitch black,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.750
Bible black, so black
it could be difficult

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.090
at night to keep to the path,
so black that a line of trees

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.760
might freely migrate
to another location

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.830
or that you might find yourself
pursued after nightfall

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.200
by a rapid black hog
leaving you to crawl

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.920
home, bloody and
disoriented on all fours."

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.950
That's, by the way, from
the court testimony.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.960
The basic facts of
Salem are simple.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.000
In early 1692, over a
particularly cold winter,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.480
a nine and an 11-year-old girl
begin to shudder and scream.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.600
They happen to have been the
niece and daughter of the Salem

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.840
Village minister, Samuel Parris.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.310
Here he is.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.150
He would have been in
his late 30s at the time.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.990
The cousins complained that
something bit and choked them.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.077
Their bodies twisted.

00:05:23.077 --> 00:05:24.785
They would attempt to
fly through the air

00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:26.560
and climb down wells.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.770
We have lots of descriptions
of the afflicted girls,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.490
the bewitched girls' symptoms.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.820
But we obviously have no image.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.020
And here's the closest
that we can really come.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.130
This is a 19th century French
text on the phases of hysteria,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.370
on the emotional trauma and
what its physical manifestations

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.720
would have looked like.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.860
Remember that no one
in the 17th century

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.860
distinguished between an
over-taxed nervous system

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.040
and bewitchment.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.500
The first question
anyone asked in the face

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.260
of these kinds of symptoms was,
and for some time would remain,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.160
am I bewitched?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.650
It was understood that
any kind of prolonged fit

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.460
had been sent by the devil.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.690
And indeed, within
a matter of weeks,

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.180
two other village girls began
to exhibit the same symptoms.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.070
Everyone soon learned
from their parents,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.680
or from local authorities,
or from Reverend Parris,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.410
that they were bewitched.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.590
And with that as the
diagnosis, you could very well

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.450
imagine what came next.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.520
The girls' symptoms
seriously deteriorated.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.090
Soon enough, all
four of them could

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.640
reveal who bewitched them.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.300
We don't know why they
named the names they did.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.050
But when you think about it
for a second, to the question,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.180
who irritates, who annoys
you, who unsettles you,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.860
who wishes you ill, every
one of us has an answer.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.840
And so did the girls.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.920
The answer to that
question in 1692 was clear.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.480
It turned out that
there were not

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.630
one but three witches
flying around Salem.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.980
Warrants went out at the end
of February for their arrests.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.700
The suspects came immediately
before the authorities.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.544
Justice was very swift
in the 17th century.

00:06:57.544 --> 00:06:59.210
And they were
interrogated in the manner

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.290
of a day, which meant
that a local beggar

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.860
woman, the first
woman to be deposed,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.000
was asked by the justices
when she had signed

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.710
a contract with the devil,
why she hurt the girls, what

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.850
creatures she had
dispatched to do so.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.370
Those questions came to
her from very well-dressed

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.850
important men, who owned
significant businesses, who

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.690
spoke with weight and authority.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.740
The contest was
asymmetric, and I

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.660
should say that
this is a story that

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.890
has something for everyone.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.550
And here you can see it begins
to mutate because it begins

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.290
as a kind of fairy tale, "once
upon a time a wicked witch

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.760
cast a spell on a little girl,
and it turns very quickly

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.314
into a courtroom drama.

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:38.730
Let me talk for
just a few minutes

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.850
about how witchcraft worked,
what exactly a witch was.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.370
Are not every 17th
century New Englander

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.560
was clear on the subject.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.320
But those who were
were exceedingly clear.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.840
To the early American, a
witch existed as plainly

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.235
as did heat or white.

00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:57.430
The early American
witch, I should add,

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.960
did not look like this.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.710
Although there is a
certain "Wizard of Oz"

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.399
theme running through
the Salem story,

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.940
and I'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.390
And nor did a 17th century
witch look like this.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.850
This is, by the
way, the original--

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.750
if you can believe it--
the original Wicked

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.270
Witch of the West from the
book "The Wizard of Oz."

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.950
I particularly like
that flying pig tail

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.790
and the spats, which are kind
of unexpected for a witch.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.725
This is an early
American Halloween witch.

00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:28.550
You can see that witches
came very late to Halloween,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.050
and they didn't
dress in basic black

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.380
until after Margaret Hamilton
and the 1939 "Wizard of Oz."

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.809
The witch as a 17th
century New Englander

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:40.350
knew her was someone who could
perform unnatural feats because

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.649
of the compact that she
had signed with the devil.

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:45.520
And from that pact,
she drew her power

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.370
to transform herself into
cats, wolves, rabbits,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.555
and of course rapid black hogs.

00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:54.280
A witch could be a man or woman,
but more often she was female.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.170
And she maintained a
menagerie of imps or familiars

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.710
who could do her bidding.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.840
And those mascots could
be turtles or weasels.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.820
Cats, dogs, and toads
were very prevalent.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.630
As you can see here, this
is a 17th century witch

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.250
who is feeding blood to
her diabolical toads.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.820
This is a woman who has her
diabolical familiars with her.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.770
You can see her black cat of
which there are a great number

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.910
and her demon familiar.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.090
And she illustrates a 1621
English witchcraft case,

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.670
but this woman actually
was acquitted at her trial.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.640
Here's some more
diabolical familiars.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.040
You see that they range from
the standard issue barnyard pig

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.760
to rather gargoyle-like
fantastical creatures.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.577
Black cats were
particular favorites.

00:09:44.577 --> 00:09:46.410
They seem to have been
the arch enemy of man

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.770
from the very beginning.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.700
And they turn up regularly
throughout the Salem testimony.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.340
They've enjoyed an association
with the devil for a long time.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.070
Black dogs turn up a lot
too, but historically

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.450
English witches intended to
prefer feline to canine form.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.840
This, by the way, is
not a witch's familiar.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.550
This is our family cat, Moose.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.010
But I hope she's looking
sort of vaguely demonic here.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.340
A witch signed her pact
with the devil in blood.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.390
And she enchanted with
effigies and ointments.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.270
She could be a muttering,
contentious malcontent

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.830
or she-- or he-- could be simply
strong or unaccountably smart.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.390
Both kinds of witches
would turn up in 1692,

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.340
as would wealthy merchants who
were witches, sea captains who

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.990
were witches, ministers and
homeless five-year-old girls

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.420
who were witches.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.920
While her power
was supernatural,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.120
the witch's crime
was a religious one.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.740
In New England, her target was
the soul rather than the body.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.460
And our connection to
convulsing Salem girls?

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.770
According to the legal guide on
many Salem desks and which was

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.320
about to land on
Samuel Parris's desk--

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.720
this is the volume by William
Perkins-- "Witchcraft,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.280
when it manifested, it showed
up the senseless trances,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.980
paralyzed limbs, convulsions,
jaws clamped shut, frothing,

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.490
gnashing, and violent
shaking"-- In other words,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.726
the symptoms of the girls
in the parsonage to a T.

00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:10.280
When Massachusetts
established a legal code,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.430
the first capital
crime was idolatry.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.040
The second was witchcraft.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.290
In the years since those
laws had been codified,

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.720
New England had indicted
about 100 witches,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.160
a quarter of whom were men.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.780
Massachusetts, however,
had hanged only six.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.730
Beside the mystery of the
girls' symptoms in Salem

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.590
is a greater mystery--
why, in 1692, the hasty

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.780
and the merciless prosecution.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.320
The charges were very familiar
from earlier witchcraft cases.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.530
Casting spells on livestock
was a fairly common one.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.020
In Salem, witches cast spells
on cattle, on hay, on wagons,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.020
on muskets, on fireplaces.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.850
They send dishes
sailing through the air.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.230
Why, you might ask, are
these women riding on a pig?

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.890
This is from an early
English witchcraft trial.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.050
These women have been accused
of bewitching the pig.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.860
New England witches
do not do a great deal

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.690
of flying, down chimneys.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.730
They do do a great deal
of flying down chimneys

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.380
and through apple trees.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.271
And ultimately, they will
fly to a satanic Sabbath.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.770
But I should say
that traditionally,

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.830
the English witch did not fly.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.262
Continental witches,
however, will fly.

00:12:17.262 --> 00:12:18.970
And that will give us
a clue as to what's

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.950
about to happen in Salem.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.410
And also, there
were ghosts in 1692

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.390
who tend to flit in and
out of the Salem courtroom.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.540
Most, but not all
of them, are women

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.350
who have come back to avenge
themselves on abusive husbands.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.710
Those who do confess
to witchcraft--

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.850
and there are quite a
number-- will confess

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.835
to having flown either on the
devil's shoulders or on poles

00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:44.100
or on branches or on sticks.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.310
No New England witch ever flies
on a broom, I'm sorry to say.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.380
These are some English flyers.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.200
They seem to be recruiting
the women on the ground here.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.190
This is an 18th century
woodcut, however.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.460
As far as broomsticks go,
this one is my favorite.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.970
Leave it to a French woman
to be able to fly gracefully.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.770
This is a 15th century
French set of witches.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.230
The accepted phenomenon
of witchcraft

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.950
basically went like this.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.790
Witches existed everywhere in
the world in every culture.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.240
And how is it possible
that imagination,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.710
which is so varied
and so unpredictable,

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.520
could deliver the same
idea across all cultures

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.740
at all times?

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.530
In other words, witchcraft
was so preposterous, so

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.440
improbable, it had to be true.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.300
You just couldn't
make this stuff up.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.120
The first arrest in
Salem surprised nobody.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.700
The suspects counted
among the likeliest people

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.540
to be voted off the island.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.860
And let me talk just for a
minute about the next person

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.240
accused, the fourth accused
witch, for a few reasons.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.530
I think part of what
fascinates us about 1692

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.020
is the random, the seeming
randomness, of the accusations.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.830
What if the next knock
landed on your door?

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.940
In the case of Martha Corey, a
very pious, stiff spined farm

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.780
woman in her '60s, we
know what happened when

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.200
the knock landed on her door.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.470
It was mid-afternoon
on March 12.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.975
She'd been named by a
12-year-old village girl.

00:14:06.975 --> 00:14:09.430
And it surprised everyone
because she was a full church

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.050
member and very devout.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.670
Because she was, the church
deacon and another man

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.902
went to pay a call
as a courtesy on her.

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:18.110
And first they stopped off
to see the little girl who

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:19.240
had accused her.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.430
They asked if she could
possibly be mistaken,

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.610
and could she describe what
Martha Corey had been wearing

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.065
when she afflicted this girl?

00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:28.940
The child said she
couldn't because the witch

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.230
had blinded her that
morning, but she

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.312
would be back that evening
to torture her some more.

00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:35.020
The men rode off.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.050
They found Martha Corey
alone at her house.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.960
She welcomed them with
a smile, but she also

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.940
anticipated their question.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.480
"I know what you are
come for," she said.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.129
"You are come to talk with
me about being a witch."

00:14:47.129 --> 00:14:49.170
She was not a witch, and
she couldn't stop people

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.780
from gossiping.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.530
How do we know all
this, by the way?

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.209
This is the deposition
against her,

00:14:55.209 --> 00:14:57.500
which the two men will write
out after they visited her

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.690
that day.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.300
And they tell her that
the girl has deemed her.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.800
The first question
Martha Corey asks

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.182
is, but did she tell you
what clothes I have on?

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:09.890
They were flabbergasted
by that question,

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.723
because of course it
was precisely what they

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:12.862
had themselves asked.

00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:14.320
And they seem to
think that she had

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.590
some supernatural knowledge.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.590
She assured them there
was no cause for concern.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.173
She had nothing to
do with witchcraft.

00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:22.880
As everybody knew, she
was a very devout woman.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.880
She wasn't surprised,
though, she said.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.640
If the devil had
recruited the first three

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.740
women, in her
estimation, they were

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.070
malicious, slothful people.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.210
An interesting thing
about Salem is that even

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.176
those who insist on
their innocence, who

00:15:35.176 --> 00:15:36.550
believe in their
innocence, think

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.310
that the others are witches.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.530
Martha Corey that
afternoon promised

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.310
she would open the eyes of the
magistrates and the ministers

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.260
so they might find the real
witches, another comment that

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.700
would backfire.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.650
Within the week, not only
her 12-year-old accuser

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.360
but that girl's mother
was also afflicted.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.610
A spectral Corey nearly tore
the older women to shreds,

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.960
offering her a
diabolical pact to sign.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.130
The warrant for Martha Corey's
arrest went out immediately.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.450
This is it.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.400
She was accused of
having committed

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.910
sundry acts of witchcraft
on a grown woman

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.740
and on four youngsters, one
of the Reverend Parris's

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.490
12-year-old niece.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.310
That note you can see in the
bottom in the different ink

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.330
is the Salem
constable's confirmation

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.140
that he's arrested her
and that she's in custody.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.050
And this document
is dated March 21,

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.334
but because the Sabbath
was the next day,

00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:27.750
she, in fact,
couldn't be arrested

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.500
until Monday, which left her
time on Sunday to go to church

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.360
along with her accusers.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.570
So before the
pulpit that Sunday,

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.530
you have five spellbound
girls and women and one witch

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:44.540
suspect, all of them in close
proximity in a tiny building.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.960
This is a reconstruction of
the village meeting house.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.880
It measured 34 by 28 feet.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.580
And you can see how dark
it would've been inside.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.600
It wasn't always possible
during the hearings

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.570
that were held here to
identify suspects indoors.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.640
They often had to be taken
out into the daylight.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.995
And when the minister began
the service, the March service,

00:17:03.995 --> 00:17:06.930
he was interrupted by the
afflicted girls in the pews.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.770
One pointed to the ceiling.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.869
She claimed she could see Martha
Corey sitting not in her seat

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:15.914
but up in the beams nursing
a diabolical canary.

00:17:15.914 --> 00:17:18.819
The next day Martha Corey
returned to the same room

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:19.790
to defend yourself.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.859
It was thronged with spectators.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.609
There was a palpable
terror in the room.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.450
A visiting minister said
that he could nearly make out

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.080
the hammering hearts, the raised
hairs on the backs of the neck.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.860
Martha Corey insisted
on her innocence.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.850
One of the justices
asked the question

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.500
that gnawed on every mind.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.280
How had she known that she would
be asked about her clothing?

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.900
She tried to explain
but she was interrupted.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.870
Generally, 17th
century courtrooms

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.730
were not orderly places.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.520
The girls frantically
pointed about the room.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.440
They could see they said
the devil whispering

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.430
in Martha Corey's ear.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.950
"What did he say to
you?" asked the justice.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.570
She had neither seen
nor heard a thing.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.790
"We must not believe all that
these distracted children say,"

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.210
she replied, to which
they were fresh agonies.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.370
"Did she understand the
meaning of distracted?"

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.260
asked the justice,
"because by definition,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.550
distraction was fleeting and the
girls were utterly consistent.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.360
Everyone," he reminded
her, "understood

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.110
them to be bewitched.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.060
He urged her
repeatedly to confess.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.030
She would not.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.780
One of the interesting
things about Salem,

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.070
I should point out, is that
those who refuse to confess

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.620
will hang, which is to say that
the most principled, the most

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.800
noble, the most steadfast
people will end up

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.030
fairing the least well.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.880
Corey was pelted with questions,
none of which she could answer.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.550
Instead, she posed a
particularly plaintiff query

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.040
herself.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.039
"Can an innocent person,"
she asked, be guilty?"

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.830
I don't know if you
can see it, but this is

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.400
the document of that hearing.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.730
And the first question
here is, "You are now

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.820
in the hands of authority.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.980
Tell me now why you
hurt these persons."

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.430
And she actually asks
if she can prayer.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.930
She asks several
times, a request

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.464
which is repeatedly denied.

00:18:59.464 --> 00:19:00.880
She insisted she
had nothing to do

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.370
with witchcraft, a statement
that incensed the crowd.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.040
The girls began to yelp and to
snap and to mock her replies.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.810
When she bit her lip
with nervousness,

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.020
teeth marks bloomed on
the arms of the girls.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.040
If she clasps her
hands together,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.990
the girls would
begin to shutter.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.639
If she leaned forward, they
would crumple over in agony.

00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:20.430
It seemed as if she
were working witchcraft

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.590
in the courtroom itself.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.837
By this time, too, adult
women are bewitched.

00:19:24.837 --> 00:19:26.670
In the course of the
testimony, one of them,

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.870
a 40-year-old woman,
starts to howl in pain.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.550
And she says that it's Martha
Corey who's attacking her.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.700
So the woman takes off
her muff from her hands

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.247
and throws it across
the courtroom at Corey.

00:19:37.247 --> 00:19:38.830
It fails to hit here
so the women that

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.225
leans over and takes off
a shoe and lobs her shoe

00:19:41.225 --> 00:19:41.940
at Martha Corey.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.580
It hits her squarely
in the head.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.090
A pin that she had stuck
in one of her victims

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.740
also turns up that day
in the hearing room.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.560
Pins will tend to turn
up often in Salem.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.570
Here are some pins, by the
way, from the Peabody Essex's

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.110
collection.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.880
These were taken over the
next weeks or reportedly so

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.120
from the girls' hands and legs.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.550
One girl turns up with a
pin puncturing her lips

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.490
so she can testify.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.380
Blood will trickle from
another girl's mouth,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.890
and a red stain will
appear across her bonnet

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.750
in the courtroom.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.300
How do we know all of this?

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.120
From two sources.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.200
A former village minister
was on hand that day

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.730
and published his account
of the trials in April.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:22.900
This is the title page.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.670
You can imagine that the
account of what was happening

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.392
did nothing to
alleviate the symptoms.

00:20:28.392 --> 00:20:29.850
And we have a lot
of the paperwork,

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.070
too, from this
particular hearing.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.940
This is the deposition of
one of Corey's accusers,

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.370
a 17-year-old girl
named Elizabeth Hubbard.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.150
It seemed that Martha
Corey had urged her

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.940
to sign a pact with the devil.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.010
She'd bitten and
choked and pinched her,

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.370
and the girl had the
bruises to prove it.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.410
"I believe in my heart,"
she testifies here,

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.020
"that Martha Corey
is a dreadful witch."

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.015
And as you can see, some
of this was added later.

00:20:55.015 --> 00:20:56.390
The court testimony's
interesting

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.090
because it's not
infrequently edited

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.480
or expanded on after the fact.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.030
This is in the hand
of Reverend Parris.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.490
It's the local
innkeeper's deposition

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.380
against Martha Corey
for having tortured

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.830
the girls at the hearing.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.880
And you can see on that
second and third line,

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.270
he seems to have
written out the account

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.710
before he asked his neighbor
to fix his name to it

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.520
in the third line.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.020
Martha Corey that
they went to jail.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.270
She would spend the next six
months in chains and in prison,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.980
awaiting her trail.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.250
Six days after the
hearing, Parris

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.142
will deliver this sermon
in the meeting house.

00:21:31.142 --> 00:21:33.600
You cal see it's titled "Christ
Knows How Many Devils There

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.590
Are."

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.550
And when I mentioned
documentation, by the way,

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.110
this is as good as it gets.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.080
Parris was a very meticulous,
very diligent man.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.730
And this is the finest of
17th century penmanship.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.570
So I want you all to
feel sorry for me.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.820
It's a finger-pointing sermon.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.819
After this, it's basically
you're either with us

00:21:52.819 --> 00:21:54.060
or you are against us.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.582
And the community really divides
between accusers and accused.

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:59.290
People begin to remember
things that they

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:03.180
can't explain, often decades old
things that they can't explain.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.550
Men begin to see their neighbors
flying through the streets.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.740
The evening after the first
hearing, two villagers

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.960
will meet an unnatural
beast on the ground, which

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.790
dissolves in the moonlight.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.530
Two or three women,
they testified,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.680
materialized in its
place and fly away.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.520
Shortly thereafter, behind
locked doors, one of them

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.020
sits up in bed when a great
gleam and a big fat cat

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.700
appears in his room.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.260
If this has happened to any
of you recently, please let me

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.360
know afterwards.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.200
All of this testimony
was sworn on oath.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.090
It's all full of
tall tales unless you

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.840
happen to believe, as
one woman reported,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.270
after having vowed to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.080
and nothing but
the truth, that she

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.860
flew on a stick with her
church deacon and two others

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.270
to a satanic baptism and
that the previous Monday

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.860
she carried her minister in
spectral form through the air

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.590
along with having previously
conferred in her orchard

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.571
with a satanic cat.

00:22:57.571 --> 00:22:59.320
Again and again while
working on the book,

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.940
I kept thinking of Dumbledore in
the seventh Harry Potter book.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.920
"Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.480
But why on earth should that
mean that it's not real?"

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.980
The first case came
to trial in June,

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.770
the first suspect
hanged a week later,

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.110
protesting her
innocence to the end.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.270
Events moved quickly.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.880
Arrests and
afflictions multiplied.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.790
It was a plague that involved
100 witches, a number that

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.680
grew to 307 or later to 500.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.590
And here's where the courtroom
drama will mutate again

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:33.980
now into a horror story, not
only for those who spent months

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.500
roasting and then starving in
airless [INAUDIBLE] prisons.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.180
Some suspects would die there.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.800
And others, in chains,
would give birth there.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.530
By late July, the
authorities begin

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.540
to piece together a tale of
a diabolical Sabbath which

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.740
witches flew to from as
far away as Connecticut

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.800
by various conveyances, all of
them to land in Salem Village,

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.350
and all of them
part of a conspiracy

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.292
not only to subvert the church
but to subvert the state.

00:23:59.292 --> 00:24:01.250
And according to Parris's
daughter, by the way,

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.070
Martha Corey also will
attend that meeting.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.630
Again, you can reconstruct
that meeting and these rituals

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.330
from at least 50
court confessions.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.930
But we unfortunately
have no image

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.020
of the diabolical Sabbath.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.650
Here's the closest we can come.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.730
This is a 17th century German
engraving of a witch's Sabbath.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.670
It's a more decadent production
than a New England one.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.706
But certain themes are familiar.

00:24:23.706 --> 00:24:25.080
You'll remember
that I said there

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.280
had been no flying in
Massachusetts before 1692.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.830
Well, suddenly by the summer,
everyone in Essex County

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.790
seems to be aloft.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.870
Here's an earlier illustration
from a Swedish witchcraft

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.574
epidemic.

00:24:37.574 --> 00:24:39.240
And from the book,
you'll see why Sweden

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.900
is hugely important here.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.020
But notice that this woman
is flying with her children.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.480
In Massachusetts in 1692,
girls of eight or nine

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.290
are accusing their
mothers of coercing them

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.750
into signing pacts
with the devil.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.790
By late summer,
the denunciations

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.180
are flying in every direction.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.510
Daughters accuse mothers.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.690
Brothers accuse sisters.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.500
And parishioners will
accuse their ministers.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.440
In Andover, nearly
one in 10 people

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.070
was accused, including
nearly every female member

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.350
of the town's senior minister.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.150
Servants accused mistresses,
although mistresses did not

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.060
accuse servants.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.700
No one ever suffered
from witchcraft

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.120
without also being
able to name a witch.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.800
Martha Corey went to her
death in September 22

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.610
in what would be
the last hanging.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.800
Before she hangs,
she's visited in prison

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.600
by Reverend Parris who
will excommunicate her.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.970
And this is his account
of the excommunication.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.770
He's irritated that
the prisoner, who's

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.920
a very religious woman,
refuses to pray with him.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.460
In the 17th century, a
prisoner also, by the way,

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.265
paid for his or her jail
charges for the blankets

00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:43.860
and the provisions.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.540
This is the jailer's accounting.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.790
And you can perhaps see
that the third item here

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.400
was for Martha Corey
and her husband.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.340
By September, the colony had
executed 14 women, five men,

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.400
and two dogs for witchcraft.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.610
Somewhere between 140
and 180 had been accused.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.270
And then as abruptly
as it had begun,

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.350
the witch panic was over.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.120
The questions the Salem elicits
are those of our nightmares.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.680
"Can an innocent person,"
Martha Corey asked, "be guilty?"

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.400
"Might I be a witch
and not know it?"

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.710
another suspect
asked. "Could anyone,"

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.320
wondered a group of
men late in the summer,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.340
"think himself safe?"

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.780
A brash widow in her 50s came
before the justices in April.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.950
She was not a witch.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.190
She could not even
say what a witch was.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.050
She had the bad
luck to be appearing

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.760
before a fine logician.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.990
"How can you know that
you are not a witch

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.405
and yet not know what a
witch is?" asked the justice.

00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:43.030
So obviously, what
we have on our hands

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.400
is not entirely a fairy
tale or a courtroom drama

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.860
or a horror story
but a thriller.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.620
Presumably, that line
of truths did not

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.530
move from one side of
the field to the other.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.710
Presumably there were no flights
through the air, killer cats.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.100
There was no satanic
celebration with a long banquet

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.100
table in the Salem meadow.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.694
How, then, did
these things happen?

00:27:03.694 --> 00:27:05.610
When you begin to pry
the whole episode apart,

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.377
you see that it makes uncanny
and eminently modern sense.

00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:11.710
And no, I'm not going to tell
you how that came to pass.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.620
The clues as to what
drives Salem forward

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.660
and what will result in an
unprecedented 100% conviction

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:21.650
rate for the only witchcraft
panic in our history,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.600
are woven a strand at a time
into each chapter of the book.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.720
And it's meant to
read like a thriller

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.740
so that you get the idea
that only at the end--

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.350
it's meant to unspool
with the logic of a dream

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.000
and the lucidity of
the supernatural.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.027
The unlikeliest of heroes
will emerge in the end.

00:27:39.027 --> 00:27:41.110
No, I'm not going to tell
you who they were either

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.690
because that would make
my publisher unhappy.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.590
We go back to Salem again
and again for the same reason

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.680
that it came to pass
in the first place--

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.680
the irksome lack of closure.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.570
We share the villagers'
need for resolution.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:58.110
We go back to the trials for
another reason too though.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.510
As crack ups go, this one counts
among the more sensational

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.010
in our history to which so
many later missteps would

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.440
be compared.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.140
That is less on
account of the scale

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.230
than on account of
the circumstances.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.000
The court in 1692 consisted
of the best and brightest.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.950
They lived in the
finest homes in

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.850
their respective communities.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.380
In 1692, it's the state
in the broad light

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.300
of day in the name of
God led by ablest men

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.280
in the colony who sent
innocents to their deaths.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.020
When friends and acquaintances
came before them,

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.840
those authorities
doubted not the girls

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.460
but their own friends.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.050
This is a portrait of
Chief Justice William

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.330
Stoughton who sat at the
head of the witchcraft court.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.070
And I will give you
a hint and tell you

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.810
that he is not the
hero of the story.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.070
He was nearly as starchy
as he looks here.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.430
He's the most eminent New
England legal authority

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:46.110
at the time.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.840
And he will die at home
nine years after the trials

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.480
without a word of
regret or apology.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.760
He was the go-to person for all
legal matters in 17th century

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.500
Massachusetts.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.240
No one was better
versed in legal code,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.040
which points up something
else crucial about the panic.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.290
Erudition plays much more
of a role in this story

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.870
than does ignorance.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.580
Arguably, the Bay
Colony qualifies

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.170
as the best educated
community in history

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.060
of the world until that time.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.940
The New England ministers--
here are Increase

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.330
and Cotton Mather,
the father and son

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.790
to whom any number
of civic authorities

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.420
would appeal for guidance--
had delved deeply

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.400
into the literature.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.710
They have devoured libraries
on the subject of witchcraft.

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.010
If anything, they may
have read too much.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.680
Today, of course,
the trials endures

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.060
as a sort of moral guardrail.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.820
This is where Salem
mutates, yet again,

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.840
to become a cautionary tale.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.620
They stop us when we over
react or over correct,

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.670
when fear tends to
overpower reason.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.860
They make the experts
seem less expert.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.800
They remind us of the risk of
thinking ourselves exceptional.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.794
Satan's appearance
in Massachusetts

00:29:50.794 --> 00:29:52.210
seemed to the New
England ministry

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.160
like a badge of
honor, further proof

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.620
that New Englanders
were the chosen people.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.690
That statement resonates.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.290
In troubled times, we naturally
look for terrorists and traders

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.282
and secret agents because
they hate us for our freedoms.

00:30:05.282 --> 00:30:06.740
I just want to add
that Salem feels

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.930
deeply and eerily familiar
in an age of crowd sourced

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.670
stories as well.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.320
An oral culture bears
a remarkable similarity

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.180
to an internet one.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.740
Both feed on indelible rumor.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.559
Neither has much use for truth.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:21.600
And the internet turns
out to be a brilliant tool

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.210
for sowing conspiracy theory.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.280
Things went viral in
the 17th century too,

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.010
and today, we can be two places
and two people at once as

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.660
well, just as Martha
Corey could simultaneously

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.280
be at home minding your
own business and at

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.850
the parsonage pummeling
and choking the children.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.260
At Salem's heart, there's
a sort of fairytale

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.140
or are these rippling
sexual undercurrents

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.060
and a lot of terror.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.630
It's really about what we
see when we close our eyes

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.520
and about how those images
can turn from one thing

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.750
into another.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.840
It touches on what's unreal
but by no means untrue.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.675
If we're all concerned, it's a
story about everyone's agendas

00:31:00.675 --> 00:31:02.870
and everyone's secret
agendas-- the girls,

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.444
the justices, the ministers.

00:31:04.444 --> 00:31:06.360
Everyone's trying to
accomplish something here

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.260
which is not what he
states as his goal.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.560
They would truly unsettle
us, those agendas,

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.730
just as they unsettled
the 17th century New

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.120
Englander who met with the
goblin or the rabid pig.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.380
And out of reasons,
the early American

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.030
turned to witchcraft
for an explanation.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.480
Out of reasons,
you of course are

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.790
supposed to turn to a book,
which I hope you'll enjoy.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.128
Thank you.

00:31:30.128 --> 00:31:33.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.920
I'm told you may have
questions or comments

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.640
or corrections for me.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Laura.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.460
I had seen something
once, PBS maybe--

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.380
I can't remember where--
talking about one

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.470
of the theories for what
happened in Salem being not

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.790
just the hysteria of the girls
but also potentially a fungus

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.350
that may have affected
them mentally.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.634
I'm curious as to what
your thoughts are on that.

00:31:58.634 --> 00:32:00.009
STACY SCHIFF: I
love that theory.

00:32:00.009 --> 00:32:02.530
There's a theory that the
rye supply had been poisoned

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:07.420
and that a fungus that caused
hallucinations had grown.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.530
And it was a great
and incredibly elegant

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.980
theory, which has been largely
discredited for two or three

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.840
reasons, the two foremost
ones being that the girls are

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.300
strangely, terribly
afflicted at some times

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.130
and perfectly normal
at other times.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.280
And they tend to be
the convenient times,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.157
like when they're
asked to do housework

00:32:24.157 --> 00:32:25.740
or when they need
to testify in court.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.823
And at other times, they
seem to sleep like babies

00:32:27.823 --> 00:32:28.930
and be perfectly normal.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.920
So that doesn't
entirely hold up.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.830
Also, if the grain supply had
in some way been contaminated,

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.840
certain members of the
household-- everyone

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.881
would have been affected.

00:32:37.881 --> 00:32:39.620
In this case, like
Parris's family,

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.260
there were three
unaffected children

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.570
and then there are two girls
who were convulsing, one of whom

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.940
is then sent away.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.669
But it doesn't affect the
household universally.

00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:51.210
And also apparently it was the
wrong season for such a fungus

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:51.793
to have grown.

00:32:51.793 --> 00:32:55.372
But I love that theory because
it would have been so neat.

00:32:55.372 --> 00:32:56.080
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.335
I have a couple questions,
and you can actually refer me

00:32:58.335 --> 00:32:59.543
to the book if that's better.

00:32:59.543 --> 00:33:02.060
But first, what became
of the girls who were

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.970
the original accusers here?

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:07.100
And second of all,
historically, how much

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.084
time did it pass before people
properly came around on this

00:33:12.084 --> 00:33:13.750
and said, you know,
the witchcraft stuff

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.930
is something in our imagination.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.370
How long before that was
generally accepted in society?

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.120
STACY SCHIFF: They're
two great questions.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.600
Let me start with
the second one.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.420
What's really interesting
about the end of the trials

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.020
is that the accepted
wisdom seems

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.780
to be that they have
indeed murdered innocents,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.980
but they also let
guilty people go free.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.300
In other words, the belief
in witchcraft survived 1692.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.500
The belief in a perfect
prosecution does not.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.180
So the impatience
here is with the way

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.320
this has been prosecuted.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.986
It's not with the
concept of witchcraft.

00:33:44.986 --> 00:33:47.490
It will take years still
for everyone to give up

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.130
the belief in witchcraft.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:53.100
In 1693, Cotton Mather, bless
his well-documented heart,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:58.260
is taking clinical notes on two
more witchcraft cases, two more

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.110
girls who-- in
Boston-- are basically

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:04.700
experiencing the same symptoms.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.000
And he knows enough in
1693 to take those notes

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.989
and to document
the cases, but he

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:12.480
says it's too volatile for him
to publish these things now

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.960
because everyone's still so--
because Salem and Andover had

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.290
been such a terrific wipe out.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.100
And there's so much puddling
guilt and shame over the issue.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.429
Nobody will talk about
Salem for quite a while.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.730
But that belief in
witchcraft persists.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.290
The girls themselves,
it's a difficult book

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:35.659
to write because, of course, no
17th century girl kept a diary.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:39.842
So we have the
girls' voices in how

00:34:39.842 --> 00:34:41.300
they converse with
the devil, which

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.508
is an interesting place
where they express themselves

00:34:43.508 --> 00:34:44.205
the best.

00:34:44.205 --> 00:34:45.580
The devil will
bargain with them,

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.330
and they'll speak
back to the devil.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.871
Those accounts, of
course, come to us

00:34:48.871 --> 00:34:50.670
from the male reporters
in the courtroom.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.086
So we have nothing
that's actually

00:34:52.086 --> 00:34:55.530
written in the girls' own
hand except some testimony.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:56.577
We have no diaries.

00:34:56.577 --> 00:34:58.660
And we have very little
about what happens to them

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.840
after 1692.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.850
One of them apparently
does continue

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.860
to be in some way infirm.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.400
And it's very unspecific about
what continues to torment her.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.790
The others go on to lead
perfectly normal lives.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.510
And as I think I say
in the last chapter,

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.590
they go on to get married
and have families, not

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.680
necessarily in that order.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.360
There's a strange amount of
having children out of wedlock

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.520
among the cohort of girls who
had been afflicted in 1692.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.984
But most of them do seem to
go on to lead normal lives.

00:35:25.984 --> 00:35:27.400
It's interesting
because there had

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.950
been the case of possession of
serious diabolical possession

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.770
20 years before Salem.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.500
And that girl who was
then a grown woman

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.080
would've been alive at
the time of the trials

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.510
and the mother of
a large family.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.190
And I always
wondered, what did she

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.474
think of what was happening?

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:44.890
Because it could so easily
have happened in her case years

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:49.070
earlier, but the minister who
had dealt with her affliction

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.690
had really been very
careful about containing

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.482
the crisis in that case.

00:35:53.482 --> 00:35:54.940
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.910
about the research, how long
it took and where you did it,

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.180
and just what the
process was like?

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.640
STACY SCHIFF: It took
approximately 120 years.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.994
The research took three
years completely--

00:36:05.994 --> 00:36:08.410
it took me about three years
to research entirely and then

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.979
a year and a half to write,
during which I was still

00:36:10.979 --> 00:36:12.020
researching a little bit.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.470
Because, of course,
once you start writing,

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.830
you realize that you forgot
to research something,

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.715
or that you need to
know more or you just

00:36:17.715 --> 00:36:19.340
haven't got to the
bottom of something,

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.950
or you're just
obsessive and you need

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:24.470
to keep researching because it's
better than writing, always.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:27.110
So it breaks down
about that way.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.960
The trial documents,
these illegible

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.450
beauties that you
saw, are most of them

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.880
at the Peabody Essex in Salem.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.360
It's just astonishing.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.000
You're holding these
papers that say

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.312
so and so has been maliciously
and feloniously and wickedly

00:36:42.312 --> 00:36:44.270
practicing witchcraft
and is sentenced to hang.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:47.112
I mean, they send
chills down the spine.

00:36:47.112 --> 00:36:48.320
They have a great collection.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.050
Danvers has a
terrific collection

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.170
because they have the
church record, which

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:54.930
speaking to holes in
the narrative, leap

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:58.015
frogs over the entire summer,
as does a lot of documentation.

00:36:58.015 --> 00:37:00.710
There are huge holes
in the documentation,

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:04.390
so great was the regret and
the shame in the wake of Salem.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:07.790
The Massachusetts Historical
Society has terrific stuff,

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.050
so does is it the New
England Historic Genealogical

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.330
or Genealogical Historic--
whatever it's called--

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.190
has great contextual stuff.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.690
And the American
Antiquarian Society

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.399
has a lot of the
Mather material.

00:37:17.399 --> 00:37:18.940
And essentially what
I filled in with

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.710
were other 17th century diaries.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:26.509
And the quarterly court records
of the years proceeding Salem,

00:37:26.509 --> 00:37:29.050
which are brilliant in giving
you a sense of what New England

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.170
life was like, what people's
grudges and antipathies were,

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:35.330
who was suing-- everyone, by
the way, is suing everybody.

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.310
This is the most litigious
society you can imagine.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.100
And we're talking
about litigation

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.490
that can last decades and
slights that reappear years

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:44.120
later.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.200
And it just gives
you such a sense

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.955
of what people's obsessions
were, what the hot spots were--

00:37:49.955 --> 00:37:52.350
the trespass, and
drunkenness, and fornication

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:53.225
were the big sellers.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:38:00.140
There are a number of witchcraft
accusations that go nowhere.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.930
It's fascinating in
terms of giving you

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.317
a flavor of New England
life, which obviously came

00:38:04.317 --> 00:38:05.900
in handy when you're
trying to explain

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.990
the strains on either a young
girl or a civil authority

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.640
in terms of adjudicating
something like this.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.230
AUDIENCE: Another question.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.070
So I think one of the
most frustrating aspects

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.480
of this story is this
concept that there's no way

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.150
to really prove your innocence.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.900
I was curious if there's--
if it's a spoiler,

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.860
you don't have to share, but if
there's any record of someone

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.190
actually rationalizing their
way out of being accused outside

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:36.850
of just being executed
or confessing or pointing

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.520
the finger at somebody else?

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.680
STACY SCHIFF: You put
your finger, I think,

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.950
on the thing that kept
me awake most nights,

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.450
which is that you're in a locked
room and you can't get out.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:48.320
And once you're accused,
basically-- the answer is no.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.670
Once accused, nobody manages
to shirk the accusation.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.680
There are two ways out.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.770
One-- class plays a
huge role in this story.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.800
The wealthy manage to escape.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.969
And most of them will
escape to New York.

00:39:01.969 --> 00:39:03.760
The relations between
Massachusetts and New

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.824
York at this point
are very hostile,

00:39:05.824 --> 00:39:07.490
and New York very
happily takes them in.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:08.645
And I kept thinking
there were going

00:39:08.645 --> 00:39:10.440
to be great papers
in New York saying,

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.630
all those crazy
Puritans, look what

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.796
they're doing to each other.

00:39:12.796 --> 00:39:13.670
I never found them.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.302
But most of the fortunate people
who escape do go to New York.

00:39:17.302 --> 00:39:19.385
And the other way to get
out of it was to confess.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.950
Without spoiling
anything, it does

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:27.010
have some bearing on why
you have these unbelievably

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.860
specific and
colorful confessions

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.640
because the more you confessed,
the happier the justices were,

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.700
the more useful you
were to the prosecution,

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.622
the better you fleshed
out this crazy story.

00:39:39.622 --> 00:39:43.086
And the confessors go back to
prison, but no confessor hangs.

00:39:43.086 --> 00:39:44.460
So after a certain
point, it does

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.330
become clear that it's better
to accuse than to be accused.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.365
And it's best to confess.

00:39:50.365 --> 00:39:52.490
AUDIENCE: THey've told me
in Old Sturbridge Village

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.650
that there weren't
forests for the most part.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.510
Everything had been clear
cut to be used for buildings

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.890
and heating and such.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:04.880
What was it like
around the setting,

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.460
150 or whatever years earlier?

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.860
Was it foresty?

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:12.072
Because all the public
media presentations of I

00:40:12.072 --> 00:40:13.530
thought I saw
something, hey, where

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.190
did that person come from,
are in a forested sort

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.840
of environment.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.673
Particularly when you
have a low light, when

00:40:18.673 --> 00:40:20.290
you have shadowy
light, it becomes

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.010
very easy to imagine things.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.690
The demons in your
mind, basically,

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.650
become more tangible.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:27.749
Was it like that then?

00:40:27.749 --> 00:40:29.540
STACY SCHIFF: That's
also a great question.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.550
And here's where the
court papers came in handy

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.270
and as did some of the
captivity narratives, which

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:35.680
there are quite a few.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.140
Very unforested.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.820
There had been a remarkable--
basically the Puritans arrived

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.920
and cut down all the trees,
is the long and short of it.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.160
Sounds familiar, right?

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.260
And today it's much greener
and lusher in Essex County

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.130
than it would have been then.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.700
And I kept having to remind
myself of that with the help

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.470
the Danvers historian
Richard Trask,

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.202
because I would say, well, you
can't see from this household

00:40:57.202 --> 00:40:57.910
to the parsonage.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.810
And he would say, but
you could have in 1692.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.590
These trees are 100 years old.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:07.494
And you can see in the court
records how much obsession

00:41:07.494 --> 00:41:08.410
there was with timber.

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:10.240
Because, of course, without
timber, they can't build.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.490
And without wood, they
can't heat their homes.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.660
And again, without
spoiling anything,

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.510
the Parris household
is in particular danger

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:20.830
that winter because it's
up to the parishioners

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:22.205
to bring their
minister firewood,

00:41:22.205 --> 00:41:24.621
and they don't like him and
they're not bringing him wood.

00:41:24.621 --> 00:41:26.780
And it's a very cold
winter, and he's shivering,

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.740
and he's talking about
this from the pulpit.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.010
And he's basically saying,
how can you leave me?

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.240
Without wood, I can't pray.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.224
Without pray, I can't live.

00:41:34.224 --> 00:41:35.890
You will dispatch me
to the other world,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.598
and you'll have this
on your consciences.

00:41:37.598 --> 00:41:39.570
It's a pretty
contentious relationship.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.840
So yes, the wood is
a huge flashpoint

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.300
as is the trespass on
other people's yards

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.640
to cut down wood that maybe
isn't yours or the carting away

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.015
of other people's homes that
you could use for the wood.

00:41:51.015 --> 00:41:52.890
And there was a second
part of your question?

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.260
Oh, you hear a lot about
swamps, what I was going to say.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.843
When you read the
captivity narratives

00:41:56.843 --> 00:42:00.702
and when you read about
spectral presences,

00:42:00.702 --> 00:42:02.160
at this moment in
Gloucester, there

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.110
are a lot of sightings of a
spectral band of Frenchmen

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.050
and Indians.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.280
And the local
militias is terrified

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.910
because they can hear these men.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.425
They see these men, but
they can't find these men.

00:42:12.425 --> 00:42:14.050
And they're clearly
just seeing things,

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.820
but they always arise
from the swamps.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.240
There's a lot of talk about the
swampiness of the landscape,

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.842
very little about the trees.

00:42:20.842 --> 00:42:22.675
AUDIENCE: Thanks, this
has been fascinating.

00:42:22.675 --> 00:42:24.530
I'm looking forward
to reading your book.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.530
And I was just curious,
do you have any thoughts

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.240
yet on the topic
of your next book,

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.740
if you're willing to share?

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.610
STACY SCHIFF: I
was hoping you all

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.901
were going to bring that to me.

00:42:31.901 --> 00:42:34.430
I thought that was
the transaction here.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.510
No, it's interesting.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.610
This material, it does get
under the skin in a way,

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.860
and I have not entirely
been able to emerge from it.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.720
I keep seeing angles
that I wish I could

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.184
play with a little bit more.

00:42:45.184 --> 00:42:47.350
And I'm not sure if that's
the fault of the material

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:51.260
or of the tired and
downtrodden author.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.140
But at the moment, no.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.430
AUDIENCE: It's sounding like
the possible explanation of sort

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:00.220
of a combination of
external stresses

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.410
and internal just
quarrelsomeness

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.140
that seemed to exist is
maybe a good candidate

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.320
for explaining all this.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.590
But I'm wondering,
and you've talked

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:11.550
about some of the possible
external stresses,

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.090
I'm just wondering
have people been

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:18.860
able to develop any personal
motives in any of this?

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.860
In other words, did
some of the accusers

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:25.840
have grudges or particular
quarrels or property issues

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.720
or anything like that
against the people

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.160
that they were accusing?

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.610
I think in your
book, I think you

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.740
say there was a lot
of just-- even people

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.610
within their same family
accusing each other, which

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.010
would argue against that.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.140
But I'm sure people
have done-- probably

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.930
you have done--
investigation about just

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.090
the more obvious motives
that might have existed.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.532
And what's the story on that?

00:43:49.532 --> 00:43:51.740
STACY SCHIFF: There was a
wonderful book, some of you

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.680
may know, which essentially
argued that the whole thing had

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.760
been a property scam.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.660
And if you accused
the right person,

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.050
your estate would
therefore flourish.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.812
And it had a
wonderful set of maps

00:44:03.812 --> 00:44:05.270
which proved that
the accusers were

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:06.728
on one side of town
and the accused

00:44:06.728 --> 00:44:09.520
on the other side of town
and how all of the properties

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.930
had joined.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.070
That, too, unfortunately
doesn't really hold up.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.240
And it also doesn't
explain why you

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.950
have the intrafamily
accusations or why

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:19.380
someone like
Rebecca Nurse, who's

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.970
this extremely pious older
woman, who's actually

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.930
never been in court, which was
unusual in New England, gets

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.510
accused.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.660
It's possible people thought
the family had too much land.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.780
It's possible because
all her children lived

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.430
and most people lost children.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.900
It's possible that the family
was simply too functional

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.160
and other people were jealous.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.530
We just do not know
in so many cases

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.360
why the fingers pointed
where they pointed.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.360
The property thing,
the only person

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.990
who makes that well in terms
of confiscating properties

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.760
is the local sheriff, who's
an extremely tireless figure

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.890
and manages to be
confiscating things

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.260
the minute anyone
is put in prison.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.949
But he seems to have done it in
a somewhat under the radar way,

00:44:59.949 --> 00:45:02.240
and he doesn't share his
proceeds with the authorities.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.610
So it doesn't really
hold up in terms

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.400
of some kind of
conspiracy in that way.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:11.569
To my mind, it's a number
of forces come together.

00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:13.360
And I guess the one
that I would talk about

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.360
without it being a spoiler alert
is the political scene, which

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.680
is that this is a colony
that for three years

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.240
has been living
without government,

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.320
has a new government in place.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.300
The strains of the
chaos of the last years

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.610
are still very apparent,
and the importance

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:32.110
of establishing rule of law
in the summer of 1692 is huge.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.610
So for these men,
for the justices,

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.970
all of whom have helped to
topple a royal governor three

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.990
years earlier, and are
in disfavor in London,

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:44.590
to prove that they are competent
and law abiding and law

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:49.030
enforcing officials plays
an enormous role here.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.930
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious
like your research process,

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:56.010
like the start to finish
if you could maybe touch on

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.510
like the first thing you do
when you're starting to research

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:02.177
a book or how that sort
of evolves as you're

00:46:02.177 --> 00:46:04.010
further into researching
the book and stuff.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:07.280
STACY SCHIFF: I'm really
unscientific, which is to say,

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.530
if I'm working on a biography,
which until now I had--

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:11.720
or a living person--
I usually started

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.030
with interviews because I knew
I had a limited amount of time

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.180
often with a
particular demographic.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.070
Obviously with the book like
"Cleopatra," that didn't apply.

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:23.430
So I tend to go first to
the primary materials, which

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:26.030
is possibly the wrong thing
to do because you're coming

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:28.950
to them without the context,
and then I circle back to them

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:29.450
in the end.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:32.451
So I went immediately
to the Peabody Essex

00:46:32.451 --> 00:46:34.200
and read through the
witchcraft testimony.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.866
I didn't know what
to make of some of it

00:46:35.866 --> 00:46:38.530
because I hadn't read
everything else yet.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.760
I tend to confine myself
to primary materials

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.570
wherever possible because
there's just such-- I mean,

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:44.570
you saw those shelves.

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.653
You could be reading in
those shelves for 15 years

00:46:46.653 --> 00:46:48.410
and never get to the end.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:51.930
So my feeling is to use
the secondary materials

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:55.490
as little as possible, things
like the Puritan Sermons,

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:57.750
any 17th century diary I
could get my hands on-- I

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.140
mean, I don't think
there's one that I missed.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.260
Anything that a 17th
century New Englander

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.760
would have known or
read and anything he

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.990
wrote I needed to read.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.950
And I don't do that in a
particularly scientific way,

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.680
partly because you don't really
know what you're looking for.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.800
You haven't articulated
your questions yet.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.010
And that ultimately,
of course, means

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.010
that I end up going back
to some of those things

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.700
once or twice again.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.390
And the court testimony is
a perfect example of this.

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.380
I read it once in the original.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.550
Most of it is published.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.680
90% of it is
published, at least.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.620
I went back to it again
in its published form

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:31.910
over and over again.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:34.180
And then often, not
until two years later

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.847
did I actually notice that in a
particular person's testimony,

00:47:37.847 --> 00:47:39.680
she doesn't really give
the authorities what

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.360
they're looking for.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.318
She's just agreeing with
them and collaborating

00:47:42.318 --> 00:47:44.820
with whatever-- and agreeing
with whatever they've said.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.700
She's not adding anything
to their questions.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.680
It's the kind of thing
that doesn't jump out

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.050
at you till you've
read it several times.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.510
And so I guess the answer
to your question is,

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.990
it's a kind of full
immersion process for me.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.340
But it doesn't necessarily
follow a linear line.

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.450
And with people like
Stoughton or the Mathers,

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:05.410
I can't read everything--
no one can read everything

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.950
that Mathers wrote.

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.515
So I would read
secondary sources.

00:48:08.515 --> 00:48:09.640
And I would confine myself.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.556
So that's actually a
frustration with somebody

00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:15.880
like Cotton Mather who writes
I think 92 books in the 1690s

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.970
alone.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:19.240
You have to really
limit yourself

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.924
in terms of what
you're going to read.

00:48:20.924 --> 00:48:22.340
And those texts
are really crucial

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.300
because you begin to compare
different accounts he gives

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:29.070
or how he accounts for
witchcraft at different moments

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:30.430
and how his thinking evolves.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:33.030
So I tend to go back to the
same things over and over

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.640
and read them more closely
rather than necessarily

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.490
spreading myself more broadly.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.560
Thank you all.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.510
