00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.890
So the objectives of this lesson are for

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.410
you to learn about
what is Dynamic Range.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.040
We will specifically talk about Dynamic
Range as a concept that applies to

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.680
images, and how we want to be able to
capture real scenes with the lighting

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.120
and radiometric information of the scene
to capture the best possible image.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.550
We'll also think about what makes or

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.010
prevents a camera to be able to
capture dynamic range correctly.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.100
Specifically talking about
digital cameras, and

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.930
how they encode information?

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.010
Or do not encode the information
of dynamic range of an image.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.450
We will talk about
the Image Acquisition Pipeline.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.270
Which is aimed at capturing the scene
brightness, the scene radiance, and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.500
basically covert them to pixel values.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.130
And of course,
those are the pixel values.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.730
We can do various types of mathematics
on to generate newer types of images.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.200
We will look at the variety
of a linear and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.790
non-linear aspects that are inherent
in an image acquisition pipeline.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.500
That will allow us to
start thinking what,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.780
what kind of mapping we want
to model and build upon.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.790
In this lesson, we will also cover
aspects of camera calibration.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.150
That will allow us to
calibrate a camera, so

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.260
we can actually be able to get
the right kinds of levels of images and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.970
colors, that are actually visible
in the scene, into a real image.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.030
So the goal here is to
calibrate a camera,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.740
so we will be able to look at
the exact colors in a scene, and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.900
be able to capture all of those
to replicate them in an image.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.180
We will then discuss
how we can take values,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.480
the pixel values of intensities from
different exposures of an image.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.070
Again, this is where a camera comes in,
how we'll use the exposure?

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.090
You know,
to remember things like aperture and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.600
shutter, to then actually capture
the light information, and

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.510
then use that to generate
a new image of the scene.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.180
And then we'll talk about Tone Mapping.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.520
Which is aimed at taking a high dynamic
range image and then converting it in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.910
a form that would be made visible
on the traditional display or

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.790
perhaps even bring it out so

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.180
you can actually see all the different
types of dynamic range in that image.
