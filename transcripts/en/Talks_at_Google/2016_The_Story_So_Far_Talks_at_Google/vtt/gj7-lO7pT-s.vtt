00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.710
MALE SPEAKER: Please join me
in a massive round of applause

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.580
to welcoming Lord Mervyn King.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.388
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:11.510
MERVYN KING: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.580
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.630
I should apologize right at
the outset for wearing a tie.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.680
Google is actually
a lot more tolerant

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.620
in this respect than
some other places,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.230
because I remember going,
when I was at the bank,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.640
with some colleagues
to the Palo Alto area,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.410
and Hal Varian, your chief
economist who's an old friend,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.850
showed us around Mountain View.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.379
And it was a very
civilized visit.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.420
We enjoyed it enormously.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.114
And then we went
off to Facebook.

00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:40.530
And as we got to
Facebook, we were

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.720
greeted by a young woman
straight out of college

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.350
who had this missionary
zeal on her face.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.257
And we're about four of us.

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:49.840
And we're all wearing
suits and ties--

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.460
from the Bank of
England, of course.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.620
And as we walked in
to go up a staircase,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.980
she pointed to a
picture, because they

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.690
spent vast amounts of
money in Facebook doing up

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.000
an old warehouse to make it
look like an old warehouse.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.530
And there was a poster on the
wall with a man in, you know,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.670
gray hair and a suit and tie.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.590
And she pointed at this man
and said, that's the enemy.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.900
So I'm forever
grateful to Google

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.064
for being more receptive
to people who wear ties.

00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:19.230
MALE SPEAKER: Well, welcome.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.170
We love ties.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.930
I'm wearing a T.M.Lewin
shirt, which also

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.280
puts me slightly out of that.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.488
MERVYN KING: Very impressive.

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:27.110
MALE SPEAKER: So what do
you see as the difference

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.870
between engineering
and economics?

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.050
We're in an
engineering building.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.180
There's many engineers
in the room here.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.010
And you were saying
economics perhaps started out

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.870
as a scientific
engineering subject.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.078
MERVYN KING: Well after the
Second World War, it did.

00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:43.650
I think that what was very
striking in the early 1960s

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.310
was that there was an
influx of mathematicians

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.540
and natural scientists
into economics.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.040
And people wrote highly
mathematical treatises

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.170
and the old idea of
the invisible hand,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.410
Adam Smith, Paul Samuelson
wrote his textbook.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.865
Highly mathematical.

00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:02.570
And economists got more and
more excited about the fact

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.670
that they could be
like scientists,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.610
and we could make
accurate predictions.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.830
And I remember in the
'60s, as a student,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.960
that people were constructing
computer models of the economy

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.000
and applying control
engineering techniques to it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.950
to optimize the
part of the economy.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.330
So you'd choose interest
rates and fiscal policy

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.510
to optimize that
part of the economy.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.220
And this was a tremendous,
exciting development.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.260
And it all failed.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.730
Completely failed.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.816
And the reason is that there's
a fundamental importance--

00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:33.190
and I don't think
it's fully been

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.530
grasped since-- that there
are no natural constants

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.190
in economics.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.870
There are no laws that you
can believe hold exactly.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.500
And one of the things
that's crucially

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.450
important in understanding
the behavior of the economy

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.860
are people's beliefs about
what will happen in the future.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.540
Expectations.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.710
And sometimes, these
can be pinned down

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.190
by what look like sensible or
plausible views of the world.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.640
But other times, the future
is so inherently unknowable

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.830
that there's no rational basis
on which to form expectations

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.390
about the future.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.200
And so in the book, what I
talk about is that people

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.300
don't optimize, they cope.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.020
And that is the big difference,
I think, between engineering

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.420
and physics, where
you can genuinely

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.391
believe that there are laws
of nature determining paths--

00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.890
you may not know what they all
are, and you try and discover

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.848
more about it, but once
you've discovered them,

00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:29.850
they're paths-- and
economics, where

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.350
there are no fixed scientific,
immutable laws like that.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.030
And I think economists are
deeply reluctant to admit this,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.107
because it would pull them
back into the pack of all

00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:40.190
the other social sciences.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.640
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.120
MERVYN KING: And
it was always very

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.850
thrilling to be thought of on
the same level as engineers

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.820
and scientists.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.600
When you realize
actually you're not,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120
it becomes a bit of a shock.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.990
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.740
So the book is called
"The End of Alchemy:

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.990
Money, Banking, and the
Future of the Global Economy."

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.642
What do you mean
when you say alchemy?

00:03:57.642 --> 00:03:59.850
MERVYN KING: Well the
traditional meaning of the word

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.920
alchemy is to turn
base metal into gold.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.980
Change something
that, in reality,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.330
isn't very valuable
into something that is.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.910
That's clearly been true of
money down the generations.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.450
Paper money, electronic
money, there's

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.620
no inherent value to it.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.800
It depends on trust.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.810
People's willingness to accept
it, and the trust of the people

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.576
issuing it.

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:21.950
But it's even more
true of banks,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.571
because you put your money
in a bank that has a deposit,

00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.070
the bank tells you you can take
it out whenever you want to,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.450
to make a payment
or to have cash.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.240
Actually if we
all did that, they

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.020
wouldn't be able
to meet the demand,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.010
because they've used
the deposits to finance

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.920
highly illiquid loans.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.090
So there is something-- it's
a sort of alchemy to believe

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.030
that all of us have deposits in
banks which are highly liquid

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.850
and we can use them
whenever we want.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.800
And yet at the same time,
they're backed by something

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.230
that cannot possibly
meet that demand.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.830
That's what I mean by alchemy.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.690
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.880
And by illiquid, just in
case anyone isn't clear,

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.710
illiquid means?

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.460
MERVYN KING: So the
bank would make a loan

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.540
to a household or a company
where they would say well,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.610
I will lend to you for
10 years for a mortgage

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.447
or for an investment.

00:05:08.447 --> 00:05:10.530
And there's no way the
bank can get the money back

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.620
until that period.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.950
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.324
MERVYN KING: So if someone
walked into the bank and says,

00:05:14.324 --> 00:05:16.180
terribly sorry, I'd
like all my money out,

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.910
the bank can't then turn around
to the people it's lent to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.820
and say, well, I know I said
I'll lend to you for 10 years.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.805
Actually, the people that I got
the money from have now come in

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:25.930
and asked their money back.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.400
So could you please
repay your loan tomorrow.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.540
And even if they did try to ask
people to repay it tomorrow,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.090
they wouldn't be able
to do so, and people

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.120
might have to sell
the assets that they'd

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.640
bought with the loan.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.944
And that would be at a--

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:40.110
MALE SPEAKER: A lower value.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.910
MERVYN KING: A lower value,
at a fire sale price.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.440
So that is the ultimate
alchemy, that the banking system

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.270
pretends to people that all the
money that they put in a bank

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.750
is highly liquid, that
is you can take it out

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.040
whenever you want and use
it, whereas in fact it's

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.710
backed by investments
that are far from liquid.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.740
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.590
So the 2008 crisis is a
large part of the book.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.590
How did it come
about, and how is that

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.320
related to the alchemy on
which the book is based?

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.010
MERVYN KING: So the
book is not a memoir.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.870
It's not a blow-by-blow account.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.990
We've got dozens
of those already.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.400
And I didn't want to do that
because, inevitably, that's

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.090
self-serving.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.690
If I wrote a book about
the events that happened,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.450
it would be from my
perspective, and most of you

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.350
would be sensible to say, well,
he would say that, wouldn't he?

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.870
So I wanted to write
something about the ideas

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.510
behind this, because
it seemed to me

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.720
that the first observation
I had when I left the bank

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.160
and reflected on everything was
almost everyone in this drama

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.650
was in a prisoner's dilemma.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.970
That is, that there was nothing
that they could do on their own

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.880
to get out of this.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.190
But the classic
demonstration of this

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.610
was Chuck Prince, who
ran Citibank, who said

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.220
in 2007, this
famous statement he

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.210
made, while the music's playing,
we've got to go on dancing,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.705
so we're dancing.

00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:01.470
And within two or three
months, the music had stopped

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.840
and he lost his job.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.340
But the interesting
point about this

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.170
was if he'd said that five
years earlier and said,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.180
you know, I am very
nervous about all

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.910
these complex
financial instruments

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.050
that people are selling and we
don't want to do this anymore,

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.020
we're gonna get
out of this market,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.160
we're not gonna be so
highly leveraged-- that

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.040
is, the bank was
financing itself

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.450
by too much borrowing, rather
than equity finance-- if he'd

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.000
said that, then Citibank
would have been much less

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.467
profitable in the
intervening five years,

00:07:31.467 --> 00:07:33.050
and he would probably
have been sacked

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.240
before we even got to 2007.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.110
MALE SPEAKER: Because
the shareholder

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.367
expectation wouldn't be met.

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:37.950
MERVYN KING: All the
other banks would

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.870
have been earning
a lot of money,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.510
because they were taking risks.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.610
So Keynes once said,
John Maynard Keynes

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.910
once said, that
it doesn't matter

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.610
what risks you take as a bank,
provided all the other banks

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.830
are taking the same risks.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.580
And there was a similar
problem for central banks,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.260
because there was this downward
movement of interest rates,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.170
which started really after
the fall of the Berlin Wall

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.620
when, you know,
communism was said

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.520
to have lost out to capitalism.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.172
Now we saw all this.

00:08:07.172 --> 00:08:08.630
And in fact, at
the same time, what

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.160
we saw with China
and other countries

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.740
embracing a market economy
was that the number of people

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.030
working in the manufacturing
sector around the world who

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.540
wanted to export their
production probably trebled.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.870
And that was partly
responsible for keeping wages

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.890
of most people at low levels, or
at least no increases in wages.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.550
But it also meant
that these countries

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.260
that wanted to export a lot
were saving a vast amount.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.622
They were saving far more
than we were willing to spend.

00:08:36.622 --> 00:08:38.080
And so they were
putting this money

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.120
into the capital market
around the world.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.990
It was a global capital
market for the first time.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.530
And interest rates
determined by the balance

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.600
between saving and investment
kept pushing rates down.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.040
And that meant that countries
like the UK and the US

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.610
were facing trade deficits,
for different reasons.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.400
China, other countries
in Asia, on the one hand,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.870
and Germany on the other,
wanted trade surpluses.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.010
That meant that they were saving
more than they were investing.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:13.370
We were on the other side of
that, with a trade deficit,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.940
we were borrowing
more than we were--

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.450
we had to borrow from
the rest of the world

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.610
to finance the trade deficit.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.250
And our debts were
spiraling upwards.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.830
And everyone thought that
we could go on doing this.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.250
But in the end, we couldn't.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.130
And that's really what brought
about the crisis in itself.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.220
So the symptom of the crisis
was that the banking system

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.760
through which these flows
of savings and investment

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.310
were mediated, the banking
system itself had borrowed

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.210
a lot of money, taken
in more deposits,

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.980
and became very fragile.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.880
So there were many
banks that had what

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.210
are called leverage ratios.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.120
That is, how much has
the bank itself borrowed

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.590
from other people
rather than financed

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.390
through its own shareholders.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.080
That was 50 to 1,
which meant that if you

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.600
had a bank with, say,
$100 million of assets,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.770
you only had to have a fall
in the value of those assets

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.440
on average by 2% to mean
the bank was literally bust,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.100
insolvent.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.808
MALE SPEAKER: So with
that 50 to 1 ratio,

00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:20.310
would the healthy
amount be 1 to 1?

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.932
Is that the ideal?

00:10:21.932 --> 00:10:24.390
MERVYN KING: I don't think we
know what the ideal ratio is.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.660
And this is where
expectations come back,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.880
why this isn't an
engineering phenomenon.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.970
So ask yourself the
question, how much money

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:36.400
does a bank need to finance
itself through equity in order

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.330
to persuade other people that
it's safe to lend to the bank,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.630
and they can attract funds
and do their business.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.290
Before the crisis,
we know the answer

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.610
to that, which is hardly any.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.800
Because banks were able
to get lots of money

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.400
from elsewhere with
very little equity.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.580
Immediately after the
crisis, the answer

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.380
to that same question
was a hell of a lot,

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.060
because people suddenly thought,
God, banks aren't safe anymore.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.840
And the innocence of the
banking system was lost.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.360
And the regulators really
played no part in any of this.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.620
This swing in sentiment
from being wildly

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.130
optimistic about
what banks could

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.360
do to being
extremely pessimistic

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.410
was a change in sentiment.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.670
You couldn't claim that it
was obviously irrational

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.580
in any way.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.830
People were trying to cope
with an unknowable future.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.420
They made this judgment.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.660
And that is the danger with
the banking system, where

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.340
if people can't get their
money out and know that maybe

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.900
if the bank is fragile they
can't get their money out,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.260
then they may be tempted to run.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.940
And what happened in New York
in September, October 2008,

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.500
it wasn't that ordinary people,
ordinary depositors queued up

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.600
outside the bank to
get their money out.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.990
It was wholesale depositors.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.180
That is, financial institutions.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.450
Money market funds.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.220
Hedge funds.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.330
All said to
themselves, these banks

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.940
aren't as safe as we
thought, we get our money out

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.600
as soon as we can.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.810
And that was the run
on the banking system

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.400
that reached its peak in
New York in that period.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.070
MALE SPEAKER: So you mentioned
the normal day-to-day

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.980
depositors, the you and I. Do
you think that the public's

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.450
anger is justified at
bankers, and the banking

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.490
industry in general?

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.610
MERVYN KING: Well, I
don't think we should go

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.230
into this with blaming people.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.234
I think ordinary people
are right to be angry.

00:12:23.234 --> 00:12:24.900
But the reason they're
right to be angry

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.730
is because of a collective
failure of thinking and ideas,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.440
rather than the behavior
of any one individual.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.890
So Dick Fuld in Lehman
Brothers or Fred Goodwin

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.620
here in the Royal
Bank of Scotland

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.770
did not cause the
financial crisis.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.850
It was much deeper
forces than that.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.660
The difference
between what happened

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.960
in 2008 and the early 1930s
in the Great Depression

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.350
is that central
banks and governments

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.290
in the latter instance,
in 2008, expanded demand,

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.830
cut interest rates, to prevent
a big rise in unemployment.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:59.970
And that worked.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.050
However, that kind
of policy stimulus

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.430
is a bit like a painkiller.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.210
It conceals the initial pain.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.880
It brings relief.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.130
But it doesn't deal with
the underlying symptoms.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.950
And if all you do is to
give a patient painkillers,

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.000
they don't get better.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.375
And in fact, it's
quite dangerous

00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.830
to go on doing it too long
without tackling the underlying

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.140
symptoms.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.130
And I think that what
people started to see

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.670
was, well, yes, we didn't see
a massive rise in unemployment.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.310
We did see a considerable
rise, but it was

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.350
muted compared with the 1930s.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.550
But we don't see a recovery.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.170
We haven't got back to
where we should have been.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.240
In fact, I would reckon
that total national income

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.220
is about 15% below where
it would have been had we

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.040
not had the crisis.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.200
That's a staggeringly
large number.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.500
And that's an enormous
cost of this crisis.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.110
And therefore, there are
two conclusions from that,

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.680
in my view.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.700
One is that this
shows the potential

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.600
for rapid growth in the future,
if we do tackle the underlying

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.610
symptoms.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.560
And secondly, it shows why it
is that people are indeed angry,

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.760
because their living standards
have not grown as they should

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.380
have done and would have done.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.600
And I think it's been compounded
by the fact that, certainly

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.520
in the US and the
UK, that people

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.875
were taught that a market
economy is good for you.

00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:32.020
That it can be unpleasant
at times, you know,

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.690
if your business
isn't doing very well

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.990
and people don't want to
buy what you're producing,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.830
the government
won't bail you out.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.830
If you're an employee
in a company,

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.850
you might have to
accept a wage cut

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.520
rather than go on strike in
order to protect your wages.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.950
And that's a healthy
response to enable a company

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.220
to keep employing more people.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.360
So embracing the discipline
of a market economy

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.660
was what everyone was
told was good for them,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.490
and would boost productivity.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.860
And the people who were
telling this to ordinary people

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.350
most loudly were those who
worked in the financial sector.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.212
Well, blow me.

00:15:05.212 --> 00:15:07.670
When it comes to the financial
sector and the banks getting

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.927
into trouble, where
was the market?

00:15:09.927 --> 00:15:11.885
Where was the discipline
of the market economy?

00:15:11.885 --> 00:15:13.890
We all bailed them out.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.660
Now, there were
reasons for that,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.590
which was to protect the
economy from the banks.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.330
We didn't want to see a
collapse of the payment system.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.770
But you can
understand why someone

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.430
who hasn't read a lot
of financial history

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.054
or got a degree in
economics would say,

00:15:26.054 --> 00:15:29.910
well, this is deeply unfair,
and to feel very angry about it.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.320
And I used to have
dinners at the bank

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.180
in the immediate
aftermath of the crisis.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.480
And I've asked people, I'd say,
why aren't people more angry?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.990
This has got to grow
as time has gone by.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.470
And I think that is
true, it is growing.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.080
And the failure of
governments around the world

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.400
to deal with it
is the reason why

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.560
there is support for
extreme political parties

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.270
on both sides, both
left and right.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.310
Doesn't matter whether
you vote left or right,

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.710
as long as you don't vote
for these guys in the middle

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.630
who, when one goes out of power
and the other one comes in,

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.510
same policy.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.060
No change.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.750
This unhappiness with
what's going on I

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.360
think is very serious.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.300
And it's not going
to go away quickly.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.990
MALE SPEAKER: And then
towards the end of the book,

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.281
you talk about ways that you
think we can restore faith

00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:17.014
in the system.

00:16:17.014 --> 00:16:19.430
So what do you think, in your
opinion, the kind of the way

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:24.167
forward is to make this system
stronger and more reliable?

00:16:24.167 --> 00:16:26.250
MERVYN KING: I think there
are two sets of things.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.470
One on the banking side, which,
you know, in the short run,

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.030
we've certainly made the banking
system, at least in Britain

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.430
and the United States, safer.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.470
It's not as safe as it
needs to be, in my view,

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.390
but it's safer than it was.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.330
And I would think, that,
over 10 to 20 years,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.750
if we really buckle
down to it, we

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.100
could eliminate the
alchemy of the system.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.280
And I suggest that we turn
central banks into what I call

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.540
the pawnbroker for all seasons.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.710
In other words, instead
of waiting until a crisis

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.730
and then throwing money at
the banking system, what

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.829
we do is to say, if there's a
crisis, we will lend you money,

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.839
and you have to be in
a position that you

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.450
can borrow from us enough to
pay off all the depositors.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.150
That will end the alchemy.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.960
But in order to do
that, you've got

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.440
to bring to us well before
a crisis, in normal times,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.460
your assets, like someone
would take a gold watch

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.859
to a pawnbroker.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:27.650
They take the assets
on their balance sheet

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.358
to the central bank,
and the central bank

00:17:29.358 --> 00:17:35.630
says, hm, well, you say these
assets are worth $100 million.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.236
We are prepared, in the
future, to lend you $75 million

00:17:39.236 --> 00:17:41.410
on these assets.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.530
And the banks have
to pre-position,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.680
they have to bring collateral
to the central bank,

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:52.030
sufficient assets that they will
have enough guaranteed credit

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.490
line with the bank that they
will always be in a position

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.410
that they can pay
off the depositors.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.440
Then everyone would
know that there's

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.170
no point in starting a bank run,
because the bank would always

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.670
be able to go to
the central bank

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.480
and raise the money
to pay you off.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.405
So if some people run,
that's their right,

00:18:07.405 --> 00:18:09.010
but there's no reason
to follow them.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.280
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.330
MERVYN KING: Whereas
in the current banking

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.560
system, if you see people
queuing outside a bank,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.310
the rational thing is
to get in the queue.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.350
MALE SPEAKER: Because if
you're last in the queue,

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.160
you may not get your money.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.630
MERVYN KING: Absolutely.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.570
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.444
MERVYN KING: That's the
first thing, I think.

00:18:19.444 --> 00:18:21.024
Make the banking system safer.

00:18:21.024 --> 00:18:23.190
The other is what do we do
about the world recovery.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.500
And I think that
this is much harder.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.390
It's not obvious to me
that any one country

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.690
can get out of this on its own.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.160
This is the prisoner's dilemma.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.260
But I do think it's two or
three things that go together.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.580
One is that fixed exchange
rates, locking exchange rates,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.810
has not served us well.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.340
And that's true with
China fixing exchange rate

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.570
to the US dollar, as well as
many other Asian economies.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.380
And it hasn't worked well within
the monetary union in Europe.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.810
And I'll give you
one simple example.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.620
If you take Finland, a
country in the monetary union,

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.240
it's obeyed every fiscal
rule you could think of.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.720
No one criticized Finland for
not being prudent and tough

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.380
on the fiscal rules.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.220
Then it had a big shock, Nokia.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.235
Nokia was about half the
Finnish stock market.

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:15.240
It went down massively
in value, Russia

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.240
in deep economic trouble.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.990
Those two things administered
a major economic shock

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.770
to Finland.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.450
In the past, well, all
right, these things happen.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.900
It's very unfortunate.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.362
But there was a shock absorber,
namely the exchange rate.

00:19:29.362 --> 00:19:30.820
And the Finnish
exchange rate would

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.782
have fallen to enable Finland to
export more and to import less.

00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:37.490
And that would have
been a shock absorber

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.750
to keep the economy going.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.000
There's no shock absorber now.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.458
They can't change
the exchange rate

00:19:42.458 --> 00:19:45.240
against any of its
major trading partners.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.680
And so what you see is that
output is declining in Finland.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.140
Unemployment is rising.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.380
It has a major problem,
and no instrument

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.550
to be able to deal with it.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.500
So I think making exchange
rates more flexible

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.010
is very important.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.390
I think we will also need
to face up to the fact

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.480
that people discovered
in the crisis

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.440
that, in some countries,
certainly here and in the US,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.810
we'd all been spending
more than we now realize

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.640
we should have
been spending given

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.970
the prospects for the future.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.680
We don't want to have spent
everything out of our lifetime

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.310
incomes too early.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.920
And it's very expensive now to
put money aside for a pension.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.929
But, you know, we need our
pensions when we get there.

00:20:24.929 --> 00:20:26.470
And so people are
being very cautious

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.740
now about how much they spend.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.800
I think the only way
to deal with that

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.690
is to embark on a massive
program of raising

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.410
productivity.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.760
This will require a
lot of small measures

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.690
different from one
country to another.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.014
It will take many years.

00:20:40.014 --> 00:20:41.680
But as long as people
believe that there

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.340
is a coherent and credible
plan to boost productivity

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.000
in the future,
then they'll think,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.780
well, I'm gonna be better off in
the future than I think today,

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.740
and that means I'll
have more confidence

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.670
to be willing to spend today.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.710
I won't run down debt as quickly
as I might otherwise have done.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.890
And the third thing, I
think, is that the experience

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.440
of the post-war period is
that trade between countries

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.110
is fundamentally important
to boosting productivity.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.880
We learn from each other,
we get ideas, innovations

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.810
transmitted through trade.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:18.090
You can see in your field that
the flow of people and ideas

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.390
is crucial, and trade in
services as well as goods

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.220
is a crucial part of that.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.650
So those are the things I think
we will need to embark on.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.400
And then finally, I
do think that there

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.610
is a lack of
effective cooperation

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.820
amongst countries in the world.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.700
And if no one country can
get out of this on its own,

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.470
we will need
greater cooperation.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.470
And I went to all these
international meetings.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.800
My god, they were awful.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.280
And they cost a lot
of money to put on.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.800
And you know, as I say in the
book, talking shops are good,

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.160
but only if the talk is good.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.612
And it wasn't.

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:56.070
MALE SPEAKER: We're gonna open
up to questions in a moment,

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.060
so get some questions
in your mind.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.400
One question for me.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.530
In those heady days of 2008,
the late nights, all the kind

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.160
of takeaway pizzas
I imagine, what

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.950
was the most surreal
moment that you went,

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.350
I can't believe that
we're facing this.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.370
MERVYN KING: Well
actually, we didn't

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.660
have any takeaway pizzas.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.060
We just had glasses of water, I
think was about the only thing.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.460
There were dramatic
moments, such as when

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.400
the Royal Bank of
Scotland rang up and said,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.200
you know we said
last week that we

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.550
were finding it difficult to
borrow money except overnight.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.830
Well actually, we can't
borrow overnight tonight,

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.810
so unless you give
us some money,

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:40.850
we'll have to close the doors.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.340
And so I did something
which I never

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.260
thought I would do, but
effectively write out

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.300
a check for 60 million pounds.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.490
And the only benefit
of this is that when

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.740
I've met professional
sports people subsequently,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.836
especially footballers,
because normally they're

00:22:57.836 --> 00:22:59.210
not very interested
in economics,

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.444
and if you've got to get
their attention somehow,

00:23:01.444 --> 00:23:03.610
you just ask them what's
the biggest check they ever

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.670
wrote out.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.900
And it is surprisingly
high, I must say.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.340
It's actually surprising.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.180
But then you trump
it with 60 billion--

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:11.250
MALE SPEAKER: Nice.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:11.480
Nice.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.688
MERVYN KING: --which they
have trouble understanding.

00:23:13.688 --> 00:23:17.160
The most extraordinary
moment I think-- and it

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:23.030
was a bit surreal-- was after
a meeting in Downing Street

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.740
where I was with the prime
minister and the chancellor,

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.410
and I went there with
my private secretary.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.680
And people watching
the crisis on TV

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.360
found the whole thing
rather dramatic,

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.600
but actually it wasn't quite
so dramatic in real life

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.320
when you were doing
it all the time.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.850
It was grind.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.320
Anyway, after the meeting,
we were coming out

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.440
of the front door of number
10 to get into the car.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.270
And you may have seen television
pictures of people coming out

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.610
of the front door on
number 10 Downing Street.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.490
What you don't realize probably
is that anyone coming out

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.350
of that door cannot see a
thing because they are blinded

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.120
by the lights of the television
cameras and the flashing

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.820
of the bulbs of the
print photographers.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.680
Anyway, I knew this.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.432
So I got my private
secretary, I said,

00:24:10.432 --> 00:24:11.640
check that the car's outside.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.225
He said, it's outside.

00:24:13.225 --> 00:24:15.850
So I said to the man who stands
inside the front door in number

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.794
10 Downing Street,
the waiter there,

00:24:17.794 --> 00:24:19.210
I said, you can
open the door now.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.470
So he opened the door, went
out, you know, lights flashing,

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.010
the bulbs, couldn't see a thing.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.870
But I could vaguely
see the car was there.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.974
So I got in the car.

00:24:26.974 --> 00:24:29.140
My private secretary went
around the other side, got

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.180
in the back on the other side.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.930
There was then quite a
long pause before I said,

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.324
very calmly, this isn't our car.

00:24:37.324 --> 00:24:40.593
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:40.593 --> 00:24:43.540
There was another long
pause before we both got out

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.270
at the same moment, walked
across Downing Street

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:51.560
to where our car actually was,
and under the gaze of-- well,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.010
it was no more than
three million viewers.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.300
And ITN News ran the
headline that evening,

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.984
governor loses his way.

00:25:01.984 --> 00:25:03.650
There are a number
of moments like that.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.500
MALE SPEAKER: Do you
know whose car it was?

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.041
MERVYN KING: It actually seemed
to belong to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:09.135 --> 00:25:10.010
MALE SPEAKER: Lovely.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.080
So any questions
from the audience?

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.222
Mikes are coming round.

00:25:18.094 --> 00:25:19.010
AUDIENCE: Can I start?

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.640
MERVYN KING: Why not.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.015
AUDIENCE: So "The
Guardian" today

00:25:21.015 --> 00:25:24.290
has a story about the fact that
intergenerational transfers

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.130
seem to be broken, so that
younger people, Generation Y,

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.840
are making a lot less
money than they should.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.030
Is that related to 2008, is that
important, and can we fix that?

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.200
MERVYN KING: It's related
both to the causes of 2008,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.410
and also what people have done
since to try and deal with it.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:48.600
So to my mind, what
happened to the banking

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.606
system was a symptom of a
deeper underlying problem.

00:25:51.606 --> 00:25:54.820
The cause is, in a way--
and I talk in the book

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.080
about when the Berlin
Wall fell, you know,

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.000
somebody wrote a
book, Francis Fukuyama

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.780
wrote "The End of History."

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.550
Capitalism had triumphed
over socialism and communism.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.590
And the irony of
this is actually

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.740
it was the beginning
of a process that

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.570
led to the biggest crisis of
capitalism since the 1930s.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.900
Why was that?

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.460
Because what was happening
in the world economy,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.540
with the attempt to run massive
export surpluses in China

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.610
and elsewhere, was that
long-term interest rates were

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.530
just being pushed
down and down and down

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.330
as more savings were being
pushed into the capital market.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.130
And you know, the world economy
needs positive interest rates,

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.900
partly to give an incentive
to save for the future,

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.420
partly to discriminate between
profitable and unprofitable

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.120
investment projects.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.590
And a lot of investments
were made that turned out

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.240
to be very unprofitable.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.340
These have yet to
be written off.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.940
So that will be a
problem in the future.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.050
So what happens if interest
rates keep falling?

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.980
Well the prices
of assets, assets

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.620
are simply the present
discounted value

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.610
of a future stream of earnings.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:04.260
So even if you don't change your
view about the future stream

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.610
of earnings of shares
or government bonds

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.960
or the value of the
housing services

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.330
you get from a house,
merely the fact

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.640
that the discount
rate keeps going down

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.750
over a long period pushes
up the asset prices.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.910
So it was no surprise that house
prices and stock prices, prices

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.720
of art and wine, kept going up.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.730
However, that does create a
serious potential problem,

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:32.390
in that the housing stock
is always being sold.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.920
Year by year, the older
generation, people like me,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.680
sell their houses to the younger
generation, people like you.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.170
And in normal
circumstances, that's fine.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.070
The trouble is, if you've
just gone through a period

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.521
when house prices have
gone up a lot, what

00:27:48.521 --> 00:27:50.270
happens is that the
younger generation has

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.790
to borrow much
more money in order

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.140
to finance the house purchase.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.010
Now at one level, that's fine,
provided interest rates always

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.090
stay low.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.220
And then people like me
sell their houses for much

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.440
more than you ever
dreamt of paying for it.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.670
So you know, I remember
being astonished

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.420
at the mortgages that
were being taken out

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.070
by my younger colleagues, people
who worked for me in the bank.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.070
And the biggest mortgage
I ever had in my life,

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.420
and that was only for a short
period, was 50,000 pounds.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.190
Many of you may, I fear,
have mortgages much bigger

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.690
than that.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:23.481
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:23.481 --> 00:28:24.854
Yeah.

00:28:24.854 --> 00:28:26.270
MERVYN KING: I
never ever believed

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.350
I would be able to afford
a mortgage as high as that.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.680
I would have been
horrified by it.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.090
But with interest
rates so low, people

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.890
can service the mortgage.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:39.150
But the intergenerational
implication of this

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:42.340
is that old people like
me, when we sell houses,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.740
end up with a lot
of financial assets.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.870
Younger people, like you,
who buy houses end up

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.590
with a lot of debt.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:53.030
Now, the household sector as
a whole sort of washes out.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.300
So if you're fortunate
enough to be in a family

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.920
where the parents say,
you know, tremendous,

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.150
I've just earned all this
money on selling the house

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.370
to your friends, so I'll
give some of you back,

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.870
so you don't have to borrow
quite so much to buy the house.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:07.920
Then that's fine.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.840
But obviously, it doesn't
work like that all the way.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.790
And the real concern of the
younger generation, I think,

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.540
is twofold.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.600
And I mean, I've
always said I belong

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.470
to the luckiest
generation of all.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.010
That is, born in 1948,
I was young enough

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.520
not to have to fight in
the Second World War,

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.010
as my father did, and
young enough not even

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.000
to do national service.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.750
But I was old enough
not to have to pay

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.820
a penny for my education.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.290
When I was an undergraduate
at university,

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.300
there were no loans.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.060
I even got paid a
maintenance grant

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.500
to pay for my housing and
drinks in the evening and so on.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.920
Very generous of my parents'
generation to pay for that.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.920
Obviously, that's all gone.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.620
And I was also very fortunate
to have bought a house at a time

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.680
when I thought gosh,
house prices have gone up

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.620
quite a bit, so I'd
better buy a house,

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.780
but way before the
big house price rises

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.080
that happened afterwards.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.710
And the younger
generation are stuck

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.420
with paying for education,
borrowing to finance that,

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.680
and borrowing a vast amount
to buy a very tiny apartment

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.810
or house.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.380
Now, in the long run,
this will work out.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.420
But the big threat, I think,
to the younger generation now--

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.110
and this is why I think
concerns are really justified--

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.700
let's suppose interest
rates start to rise.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.710
Not now, but in 15, 20
years, just before you

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:32.760
start to sell your house.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.620
Well, house prices could
come right back down again.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.505
And the younger generation will
have been bought at the peak,

00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:40.880
and have to sell
them at the trough.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.360
And the other
problem, of course,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.770
which is a really
serious issue now,

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.290
is that the pension scheme which
is offered to younger people

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.800
is so much less attractive than
the one that I was offered.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.590
Why?

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.240
Because the interest
rate which can

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.100
be earned on the savings that
go in to provide the pension,

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.890
whether it be your
savings directly

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:05.020
as a defined contribution
pension scheme,

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.660
or whether it be the savings
which your employer puts to one

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.610
side through a defined
benefit scheme,

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.480
the return on those
schemes are very low.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:18.280
And the obverse of high
rates putting up asset prices

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.970
is that, as interest rates
fall to where they are now,

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.690
close to zero, the cost
of providing a pension

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.310
in the future is much higher.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.140
There is no incentive to save.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.760
And these are very
big problems, which

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.000
is why I think it's very
important that we get back

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.612
to a normal level of interest
rates sooner rather than later.

00:31:35.612 --> 00:31:37.570
MALE SPEAKER: So we have
about 10 minutes left,

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.357
so let's take three or four
sort of short-ish questions.

00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:41.773
Graham, yeah, if
you pick someone.

00:31:45.373 --> 00:31:45.914
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:45.914 --> 00:31:49.120
I actually have two
questions [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.300
So my question is that,
I'm sure you know,

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.680
regulators have made a lot
of new regulations now.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.300
So for example, [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.970
But how do we know that
the regulation is working?

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.205
I mean, like unless there is
a more data-driven approach

00:32:03.205 --> 00:32:05.857
to the stuff, like,
how do the regulators

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:07.440
know that their
regulation is working?

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.981
For example, you
know, how do we know

00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:11.870
that the leverage ratios that
the banks have now are actually

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:12.814
the right level?

00:32:12.814 --> 00:32:14.980
MERVYN KING: OK, so let me
answer that very quickly.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.610
We don't, and we can't.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:18.260
And we can't.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.440
And there's quite a
section in the book that

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.840
explains why very complicated
risk weights to calculate

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.820
the requirements for equity
capital by banks are,

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.320
in my-- I mean,
let me exaggerate,

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.630
but almost not worth the
paper they're written on.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.690
Why?

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.440
Because they're based
on looking at past data,

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.150
which do not represent an
engineering or scientific law,

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.540
but they happen to represent a
particular set of correlations

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.020
over a period.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.120
And when a crisis occurs,
it's because something

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.140
totally unexpected
happens, which

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.570
economists don't anticipate.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.320
And when that happens,
the calculations

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.920
of correlations and
covariances that

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.950
go into the official regulatory
measures are irrelevant.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.750
They don't work in a crisis.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.680
That's why I want something
very, very simple.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.360
And having enough
pure equity finance

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.950
is guaranteed to absorb losses.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.290
And you'd need a lot
more of that, in my view,

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.870
in the long run, than
banks have today.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.170
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE]
second question.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:23.630
MERVYN KING: We've got some
others, I think we have--

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.588
MALE SPEAKER: Let's take
this person over here.

00:33:25.588 --> 00:33:27.920
MERVYN KING: Come back at it
later if we have a chance.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.787
AUDIENCE: So I
guess you probably

00:33:29.787 --> 00:33:32.180
don't want to comment on
the [INAUDIBLE] directly.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.335
But in 2008, we were
in the unusual position

00:33:36.335 --> 00:33:38.796
of being in the EU
but not in the euro.

00:33:38.796 --> 00:33:41.195
And so that gave you some
freedoms in terms of strengths.

00:33:41.195 --> 00:33:44.580
Can you comment on how much
difference did it make to you,

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.990
being in that position?

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.740
MERVYN KING: Yes, I
can certainly do that.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.310
And indeed, there
are quite a lot

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.440
of countries in the European
Union that are not in the euro.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.870
And I think that will continue.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:58.660
And one of the problems that
the EU needs to face up to

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.470
is the fact that it needs to
recognize much more explicitly

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:05.050
than it's done so far that there
are indeed two types of member,

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.220
those in the euro,
and those not.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.219
The real benefit to us
in not being in the euro

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:13.010
goes back to what I said
about Finland earlier.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:17.830
In 2009, Sterling fell quite
sharply, by around 25%.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.500
And that did enable
us to see a benefit

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.760
by having higher exports
and lower imports

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.230
than we would
otherwise have done.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:28.150
The trade position did improve.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:32.280
That was not enough to generate
a satisfactory recovery,

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.949
because the euro area
was growing very weakly,

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.409
and that's our biggest
trading partner.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.139
So I do think that having
that exchange rate flexibility

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.239
is important, and I
think it's important

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.760
that other countries get
back to that, as well.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.070
That was when the world
economy worked, in my view,

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.389
more efficiently.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:51.982
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:34:51.982 --> 00:34:53.690
AUDIENCE: Thanks very
much for your talk.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.310
To your point before
about how economics

00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:01.560
lacks fixed laws in the way of
science and engineering, myself

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.600
and my friends worry about
all our hard-earned savings,

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.765
putting it down as a house
deposit and for there

00:35:06.765 --> 00:35:09.700
to be a recession or a
crash, and house prices

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.160
to fall literally overnight.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.790
So would you say just kind
of don't worry about that

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.829
and go for it because,
essentially, you have to,

00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:19.370
or are there any kind of, like,
tips or advice that you have,

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.180
given what's happened
in recent years

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.286
in terms of investing
and buying property?

00:35:23.286 --> 00:35:25.870
MALE SPEAKER: How
can we all get rich?

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.872
AUDIENCE: Or just
not really poor.

00:35:27.872 --> 00:35:28.580
MERVYN KING: Yes.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.955
I think that's a
better question.

00:35:29.955 --> 00:35:32.800
And I think there are no
simple ways of becoming rich.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.930
And I'm always struck by you
go into an airport bookstore

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.880
and you see some book by
a famous industrialist,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.860
you know, my advice on
how to succeed in life.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:47.770
No one ever writes a book
saying boy, was I lucky.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.700
And in fact, there's an awful
lot of that in the outcomes

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.520
that determine relative rewards.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.080
I'd probably be
arrested if I tried

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.740
to give investment advice
without having a qualification

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.730
to do so from the regulator.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.610
But I think there
are no simple rules.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:10.620
There's no mechanical way
of guaranteeing returns.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.870
And certainly, if
anyone says to you,

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.740
I really know a great
investment, just

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.860
be deeply, deeply skeptical.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.790
I would suggest that it is very
important to put money aside

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:24.260
for a pension.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:30.480
And I think that, if you
are sensible and careful,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.670
and find a property
that you think

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:35.460
you'll be able to afford
over 20, 30 years,

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.729
then that is a good investment.

00:36:37.729 --> 00:36:39.270
The key thing is to
avoid-- if you're

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.730
going to move frequently,
then rent, don't buy,

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.600
because the cost of
buying and selling

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.420
is so horrendously high.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.180
But I have no simple
advice, and I can't claim

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:53.180
to be an investment expert.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.020
But you know, don't
be too greedy,

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.190
and don't let other people
manage your money for you.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:03.690
So what I find
quite astonishing is

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.510
that there are big
institutional investors,

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:11.360
like pension funds, who
have decided to put money

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.360
into a hedge fund that, at least
until recently, would typically

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.930
say yeah, we've got these
very smart, clever people,

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.390
and we can make more
money than you'll ever be

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.205
able to work out how to make.

00:37:23.205 --> 00:37:24.955
And all you have to
do is to pay off fees,

00:37:24.955 --> 00:37:28.830
and our fees are 2% of the
capital value each year.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.240
That's 20% of the profit.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.920
Now, if you think about some
investment earning 5% a year,

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.110
and you have to pay two of those
five percentage points in fees,

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:44.640
plus another fifth,
another one in the profits,

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.150
so that's-- at least five
percentage points return

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.560
on the asset, three
goes into fees.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.060
And the interesting
thing about that

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:55.460
is, if you just think about
the law of compound interest,

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.090
that instead of
growing at 5% a year,

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.920
your investment's
growing at 2% a year.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.705
You've only got to be in
this fund for 5, 10 years.

00:38:02.705 --> 00:38:05.040
And most of the money
that's been earned

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.383
has gone to the fund
managers and not to you,

00:38:07.383 --> 00:38:09.140
even though it's
your money that's

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.730
financing the investment.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.610
So I'd be very, very cautious
about investing your money

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.690
when other people are
making the decisions.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:16.350
MALE SPEAKER:
Particularly when they

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.933
don't have any skin in the game,
which seems to be one of the,

00:38:18.933 --> 00:38:20.354
like, their money's not at risk.

00:38:20.354 --> 00:38:22.020
MERVYN KING: So the
person who obviously

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.061
has the best investment
record over a long period

00:38:24.061 --> 00:38:25.177
is Warren Buffett.

00:38:25.177 --> 00:38:26.760
Now actually, it
hasn't been very good

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.360
in the last couple of years.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.520
And he's very old now.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.640
He's worrying about
who to hand it onto.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.780
But over 40, 50
years, what he did

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.290
was to say, if you
buy shares in my,

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:42.310
you know, management fund, I
don't charge fees or anything.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.140
You become shareholders with me.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.440
And I own some of the shares in
my company, Berkshire Hathaway.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.290
And he bought lots
of other companies.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.970
And he had the basic,
sensible rule of thumb.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:55.850
He only ever bought
things he understood,

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:59.390
and where he could judge whether
someone was a good manager.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.500
So never invest in something
you don't understand,

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.240
and never invest
in something where

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.880
other people are charging you
fees for managing your money.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.750
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.216
Let's take a question
from over here.

00:39:10.216 --> 00:39:12.935
AUDIENCE: So if the UK does vote
to leave the EU, what will be

00:39:12.935 --> 00:39:14.473
the impact to the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:17.216 --> 00:39:19.590
MERVYN KING: Well, that comes
awfully close to, you know,

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.334
asking me what my view would be.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.710
And I don't want to do that.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:33.030
I did it in an interview
with BBC earlier today.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.010
I had a very interesting
experience in the village

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.260
I live in.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.310
Sometimes people come
up and say, you know,

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.730
what do you think of this new
man of the Bank of England,

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.720
and what you think
about interest rates?

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.600
But when it comes to
the question of Brexit,

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:51.050
they do not say to me, so how
do you think we should vote?

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.990
What they say is--
because they do not

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:57.090
want to be told or even advised
by former governor of the Bank

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.840
of England, or for
that matter anybody

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.420
else, which way to vote.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.210
What they do want is,
what are the arguments,

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:05.700
what are the facts.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.650
They want facts and
arguments to enable them

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.150
to make up their own minds.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.297
This is a very important
national question.

00:40:12.297 --> 00:40:13.880
People should make
up their own minds.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.030
And what is so awful about
this campaign is that people

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.850
are treating it as a
kind of PR campaign

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.590
where you look in the
newspaper and some list,

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.140
whether it's industrialists
or financiers,

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.570
it will be footballers
and film stars soon,

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.830
you know, which
side are they on.

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.655
And I think this is
completely valueless.

00:40:32.655 --> 00:40:35.280
And what I want is to have-- and
I said this in the interview--

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.040
the BBC has a big
responsibility here

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.380
to set out all the
arguments and all the facts.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.310
We've got four months before
we have to make up our minds.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.880
There's no rush on this.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.400
So that people can go away,
think it through, and decide

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.830
and then cast their vote.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.710
Because if we don't
do it that way,

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.930
my worry is that
it could be rather

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.450
like the Scottish referendum,
in which the referendum didn't

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.620
actually settle anything.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.800
I don't think this referendum
took the issue off the table.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.080
It's still there.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.270
And that's in part because it
was fought as a PR campaign,

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.480
with both sides exaggerating.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.160
You know, whichever
side you're on,

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.670
it ought to be possible,
in my judgment, given

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:20.500
the issues at stake
here, for people to say,

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.270
well, yes, you've got a good
point there, I see that,

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.200
and that's why you
want to stay in.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.480
But here's another argument
that really matters to me.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.560
And that's why, in the end,
I'm going to vote to leave.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.166
And the other person can say,
well, you know, I accept.

00:41:36.166 --> 00:41:37.540
There is an argument
for leaving.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.490
But actually, this argument
is more important to me.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.260
So I'm going to vote to stay in.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.150
That is the basis on which the
debate should be carried out.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:49.299
The idea that it's blindingly
obvious what the answer is--

00:41:49.299 --> 00:41:51.090
the only problem is
that half of the people

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.544
think it's blindingly
obvious we should stay in

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:54.960
and the other half
it's blindingly

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.170
obvious we should leave.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:58.760
This is treating
people as idiots.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.980
And actually, we have a jury
system to try people in court.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.620
Why?

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.100
Not because these people
are technical experts,

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.800
but because ordinary people
have a pretty good ability

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.580
to judge when someone's
telling the truth.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.590
And what I do think is that
a referendum is only sensible

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.700
if people are given the chance
to make up their own mind.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.160
Otherwise, there'll be a
call for the same referendum

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.670
all over again in a year or
two, when some other development

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.090
takes place.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.745
So that's all I'm going to say.

00:42:28.745 --> 00:42:29.620
MALE SPEAKER: Lovely.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.310
We will leave it there,
in the essence of time.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:35.320
Oh, we've got one
very quick question.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.550
One very quick question.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.644
Maybe something lighthearted?

00:42:40.644 --> 00:42:42.530
AUDIENCE: It's not
super lighthearted,

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.196
but I'll make it a
little bit different.

00:42:44.196 --> 00:42:46.940
So you spoke about the value
of floating exchange rates

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.640
to act as a shock absorber
in various economies.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.340
Why do you think it is
that the US dollar works,

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.980
or does it work, for
such a diverse country,

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.260
you know, over 300 million
people living there,

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.490
very different industries
across the states.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:03.739
Why does that union work?

00:43:03.739 --> 00:43:05.280
MERVYN KING: Well,
very briefly, it's

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.660
partly because people move
all around the United States.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.920
If one part of the
US economy suffers

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.400
because it can't change
its exchange rate,

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.480
then what you need
to do is some people

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.760
have to emigrate and leave,
and people don't worry too much

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.830
about that.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:23.590
And because through one
mechanism or another,

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.300
whether it's social
security or the tax system,

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.320
the richer parts, the more
successful parts of the US,

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.520
will actually transfer
resources to the poorer parts.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.020
But even within
the United States,

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.210
there are parts which
are clearly economically

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.790
unsuccessful, deprived
almost, and bits

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.190
which are very successful.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:47.120
The fundamental thing is that
no one in the US says look,

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.760
I'm not American.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.830
I don't come from New York,
and I resent these people,

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:53.890
you know, failing
to pay me money

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.210
or telling me how to run
our taxes and spending here.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.996
People feel American.

00:43:58.996 --> 00:44:01.090
And one of the
chapters of the book

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.940
talks about the link
between money and nation.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.910
And over a very
long period, there

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:12.210
has been a remarkable one to one
correspondence between nations

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:12.960
and their monies.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.520
And I think that
is not an accident.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.860
It's because if you live in
one nation and feel part of it,

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.390
you're willing to accept
the decision of a majority,

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.375
that the outcome is one
that you will accept,

00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:29.350
and you won't rise up
in rebellion against it.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.160
And that's of
fundamental importance.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.910
And that's true
within a country,

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.770
and it's not true
between countries.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:36.604
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:44:36.604 --> 00:44:38.478
Please join me in a
massive round of applause

00:44:38.478 --> 00:44:39.840
in thanking Lord Mervyn King.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.190
[APPLAUSE]
