00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.150
MATTHIEU RICARD: So meditation.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.850
So first of all, meditation
is basically about silence.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.220
So I don't really need to come.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.010
And my dear mother
who's 92 said "silence

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.370
is the language of the future."

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.400
But since I came, I'll
just share a few words.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.310
So I think in a way it's nice
in the kind of world we live,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.740
which is mostly a secular
world and although we

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.480
have many other
options, meditation

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.480
is a bit of a
culturally loaded word.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.930
We always think of something
exotic, not from here.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.750
And then also there are cliches
about meditation, like just

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.310
empty your mind and relax.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.033
So relaxing, of
course we can do.

00:00:58.033 --> 00:00:58.824
Emptying your mind?

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:02.180
I don't know how
long you can do that.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.070
But anyway, if you look
at the roots, in Sanskrit,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.150
bhavana means to cultivate.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.950
In Tibetan, [? gom ?] means to
become familiar with something.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.200
So obviously it's like training.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.620
So what are you training?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.342
You play badminton or chess?

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:21.550
They're not quite the same.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.710
So now familiarization can
also be cultivating a quality,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.930
like loving kindness,
mindfulness, open presence,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.510
pure awareness, loving
kindness, rejoicing,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.380
and so forth-- emotional
balance and all these things.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.904
And if you are going to teach
in schools or in enterprise,

00:01:42.904 --> 00:01:44.570
if you say we're going
to do medication,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.861
there might be some resistance.

00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:47.930
But if you say we
are going to help

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.080
you to have better attention,
better emotionally balance,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.200
and better [? prosocial ?]
behavior, everybody goes wow.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.260
So familiarization
could be also not just

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.970
captivating something
but becoming

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.510
more familiar with the
nature of your mind.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.770
What is behind all of these
whirlpools of thoughts?

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.670
Is there something
like a pure awareness

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.390
that is free from mental
constructs, hope and fear, that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.490
is the most fundamental
aspect of mind from which

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.830
all emotions, recollections,
reasoning, perceptions, inner

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.200
and outer perceptions come.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.690
Without this luminous quality of
the mind, this basic cognitive

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.780
faculty, none of it will happen.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.300
A glass doesn't think anything,
doesn't feel anything,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.230
doesn't remember anything.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.440
It doesn't has this luminous
quality of cognition.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.570
So that basic nature that
we sometimes don't perceive

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.060
because of so many
movements in the mind,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.220
we could also become
more familiar with that.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.610
And that's also one of
the aspects of meditation

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.810
that doesn't necessarily need to
have an effortful cultivation.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.620
So all of those fall
within the scope

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.480
of what we call meditation.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.450
So as you see, it's a very
generic term, like training.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.840
So this is why the idea of
cultivating, familiarization--

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.680
mind training tells more.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.020
So now again, what are
we going to train in?

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.880
So mindfulness and
any other things

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.840
related with presence, with
attention, is, of course,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.830
extremely useful.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.680
Because if your mind is
constantly distracted,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.780
you're going to
cultivate anything.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.150
So that's why most
mediation begins

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.770
with refining that tool of
mindfulness, and attention,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.590
and vigilance, and presence.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.460
And as you know,
since many of you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.637
are engaged both in
the well-being program,

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:57.095
the search inside
yourself program,

00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:00.285
in this-- what do you call that?

00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:01.175
The G--

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:02.070
AUDIENCE: G Pose.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.420
MATTHIEU RICARD: G Pose.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.500
In France, there's a
[? 3D ?] meditation

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.090
that is sold on the internet.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.941
And you can get subscribed
for $30, $40, $50.

00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:14.440
And then depending on that, you
get more and more beautiful,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.550
young, and all kinds of things.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.470
I don't know.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.260
So I gather the G
Pose is not like that.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.400
So anyway to achieve
that as you do,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.942
a simple mind exercise to have a
clearer, more stable, more calm

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:31.800
mind.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.390
And you do that often
with watching your breath.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.800
Why is this is a good
object of attention?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.530
Because you see, if you have
one of those red flashing lights

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.650
as you find sometimes on the
highways, very aggressively

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.430
flashing red lights, and it's
right in front of your eyes,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.650
and you say focus on that
and don't get distracted,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.990
even if you're totally
distracted, you still see that.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.130
There's no way to escape.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.690
So there's no help to find
out whether you're distracted

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.640
or not.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.320
But breath is
something invisible.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.940
You really have to pay attention
to be aware of the coming

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.981
and going of your breath.

00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:09.670
If you are distracted,
it's gone because it

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.260
doesn't impose itself to your
attention no matter what.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.180
So therefore it's a good
way to have something

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.005
that is subtle enough that you
can realize that at some point

00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:22.130
that you have been distracted
because it's just not

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.740
there anymore.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.510
And you can bring
back your attention.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.010
So as you do often,
I'm share, for those

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.600
who practice the
G Pose and Search

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.950
Inside Yourself and well-being
program, so what do you do?

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.114
Balance posture?

00:05:36.114 --> 00:05:37.530
You don't have to
torture yourself

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.580
by trying to sit in
the full lotus posture

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.780
unless it's natural to you.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.730
But the balance posture, not
to slack, or no self-induced

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.980
torpor.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.290
Well, we call that in
the neuroscience lab

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:00.230
the self-induced absorption
in cognitive opacity.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.290
Well, we don't want to do that.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.950
So a [? set ?] of clarity-- you
don't need to close your eyes.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.550
But you can just gaze
in a very panoramic way,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.350
not focusing on
anything and just simply

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.420
be a aware of the coming
and going of the breath,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.670
a tickling, or warm, or cold
sensation, or the movement

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.720
of your lungs or abdomen.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.420
And just keep on
that, very simply.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.700
I've felt distracted, just
like the butterfly who

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.890
goes out of the flower
and just come back.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.269
And don't make a fuss about it.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.310
Oh, I've been distracted.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.410
I'm no good.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.350
That's another kind
of distraction.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.274
If you are aware that you have
been distracted, that's it.

00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:42.190
You are mindful again.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.580
So that's.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.560
Just resume your mindfulness.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.060
So let's do that
for a few moments

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.740
and then see how we can
embed this caring dimension

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.890
you into it after that.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.670
While you do that,
thoughts will come.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.460
Once they are there,
they are there.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.790
So there's no idea
of blocking them.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.810
But the problem is
not when they come.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.280
It's what you do after that.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.800
Do they proliferate or
do they just dissolve?

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.510
That's the main thing.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.820
So imagine that a thought comes.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.170
Don't run after it.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.570
Don't try to block it.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.290
Let it pass like a bird
passing through the sky.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.385
If you do so, they
will not multiply.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.280
And if a bird passes
through the sky,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.690
you can still very well be
aware of the sky that has not

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.910
changed behind the bird.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.895
So that's the pure
mindfulness or pure awareness.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.100
So imagine that you have
done that for 5, 10 minutes,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.900
whatever you can afford to do.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.820
Then you have a relatively more
clear, relatively more calm,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.840
relatively more
stable state of mind.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.460
That will come with practice.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.730
As you have seen with
the neuroscience data,

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.130
anything you practice
will change what you are.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.940
So if you have done
that within a session,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:06.710
then you can use that calmer,
stable, more clear state

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.910
to go to cultivate
something wholesome,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.610
like altruistic
love or compassion.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.050
So altruistic love, remember
that beautiful child

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.860
we saw after the image of
saying man is a willful man?

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.770
So when you see and think
of such a beautiful child,

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:31.590
what do you wish except may
that child be safe, happy,

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.710
may he or she flourish in life.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.260
May he spared
terrible suffering.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.890
May those who are
around him also

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.830
enjoy a sense of flourishing.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.240
So just wishing
good to that person.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.450
So that's altruistic love.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:54.160
So let's start with something
easy, like this young child,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.730
and then we can extend it to
other people, like strangers.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.270
Why not?

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.635
Why should the sun
not shine on everyone?

00:11:01.635 --> 00:11:03.370
It doesn't cost more.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.780
It's just a
qualitative experience,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.950
not like a keg that we
have limited resources of.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.730
Just extend that to all,
that same benevolence.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.780
Let this loving kindness
or this altruistic love

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.260
completely fill your
mental landscape.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.350
If you are distracted,
come back to it.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.390
If it sort of becomes
dim, revive it.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.070
So nourish it.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:16.160
Keep its quality
vivid, intense, clear.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.730
And then if you
think how could I

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.870
do that with bloody dictators?

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.160
So in that case, it's
not wishing success

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.280
to that person's
terrible projects.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.410
It's not liking that person.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.120
You can have total disgust
for the person's action,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.515
but still what shape
would altruistic love

00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:04.590
take in front of this dictator?

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.050
It becomes a wish of compassion.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.950
May the suffering and the causes
of suffering be dispelled.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.510
And of course, a dictator is
a cause of immense suffering.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.290
So you might wish may his
action be counteracted.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.700
May the cruelty, the
difference indifference,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.570
the greed that motivates such
a destructive state of mind

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.480
be dispelled.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.990
That, you can wish, of course.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.690
So that's how we can
shift to compassion.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:47.190
Compassion is not fundamentally
different from altruistic love.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.470
Altruistic love was
wishing everyone happiness

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.710
and the cause of happiness.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.230
When it meets suffering,
it becomes compassion,

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.220
which is the shape that
altruistic love takes

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.200
when it encounters suffering.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.070
It is the wish may the beings
suffering and the cause

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.670
suffering be dispelled.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.210
So for that, we may
visualize intense suffering--

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.440
and there's so many
in this world--

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.170
and wish those beings be
spared that suffering,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.110
the causes of
suffering be remedied--

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.915
a sort of intense compassion.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.440
And if you feel somehow
overwhelmed by the magnitude

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.400
of suffering, you
should think that this

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.310
needs to be met not with some
kind of empathic distress

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.700
but with a magnitude of
compassionate courage.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.980
Then sometimes,
we must still feel

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.400
overwhelmed by so
much suffering.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.180
Though then we can also
think of wonderful people who

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.470
are imbued with such
great quantities

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.690
of compassion, of
knowledge, of wisdom,

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:15.650
of dedication to
others-- social workers,

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.300
spiritual teachers,
great luminaries,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.730
those who bring new ideas
into this world and rejoice.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.430
Without any other thoughts,
just fully appreciate them.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.800
It's a very altruistic
thing to rejoice.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.550
Because there's nothing
to gain from that.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.290
Nobody's going to praise you if
you rejoice in Gandhi's life.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.810
Nobody's going to
blame you if you

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.820
don't have this state of mind.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.050
They won't know.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.830
So it's really part
of altruism to rejoice

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.828
in the goodness of others,
and their qualities,

00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:48.536
and achievements.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.069
And rejoicing is
also the antidote

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:16.410
to envy, jealousy, feeling
miserable because others have

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.339
quality, which is pretty silly.

00:17:41.065 --> 00:17:44.770
And besides altruistic
love, compassion,

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.480
rejoicing and
celebrating, there's

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.060
a fourth thing that we need.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.890
That's impartiality.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.800
We cannot know compassion--
and altruism is not a reward

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.100
for good behavior or for
the way people treat you.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.210
Compassion aims at removing
any suffering wherever

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.020
it is, however it manifests.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.310
So it's not a moral judgement.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.380
Moral judgement
exists, but it's not

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.810
about the way people behave.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.160
It's about remedying
the causes of suffering.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.160
Therefore, that we wish to
dispel the causes of suffering

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.400
can apply to all-- close
persons, strangers, even

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.070
obnoxious people.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.720
So we need that powerful
wish, like the sun,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.450
which shines on everything.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.950
And when some
people tell you how

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.380
can I not love more my
children, and my dear

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.470
ones, and my companions,
and so forth?

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.020
Yes, of course.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.770
No, if the sun shines, if
life circumstances bring

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.110
them very close to you, they
get naturally more light

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.750
and more warm.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.840
But it's not at the
cost of discriminating.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.210
Just they happen to be there.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.580
But the sun still
shines on everyone.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.680
If you are to concentrate
your reserves on those people,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.420
actually, you will shine
less well, less intensely,

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.510
with less light on those.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.640
So everyone is losing.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.390
By having this attitude
to all, you also

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.780
love better your loved ones.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.130
So this is a much
better situation.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.750
Just extend your altruistic
love, your compassion to all.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:18.875
That's called impartiality.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.880
So of course, we did that
for a very short time.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.970
But you can see you could
expend those periods of silence,

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.920
which are the real thing.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.330
And then also you can
switch between those.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.890
For instance, if altruistic
love turns a little bit

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.330
into attachment, then
go to impartiality.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.500
If impartiality becomes
a bit of indifference--

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.080
you're impartial, but
you're not caring very much,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.120
then move to compassion.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.160
Think of the
suffering of beings.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.400
And if you're overwhelmed
at some point,

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.560
then move again to rejoicing.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.910
So likewise, skillfully,
by combining those four,

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.330
then the four of
them go together.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:24.566
And then you get this profound,
you could say, good heart

00:20:24.566 --> 00:20:27.320
or good-heartedness, this
is fundamental quality

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.830
of goodness.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.580
So that's what
meditation is about.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.360
So you see, of course,
mindfulness is a precious tool,

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.870
and it does extreme
good in the world,

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.360
in the clinical world, in the
world of the working place,

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.320
and many other areas.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.460
But I think if we never lose
sight that mindfulness should

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:55.430
go always and unambiguously
with a caring quality,

00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:00.190
then it will have its full
potential to help you, I think,

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:01.380
even more.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.120
So thank you.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.255
And at the end of any
practice, in the same way

00:21:08.255 --> 00:21:10.320
at the beginning, which
is why I'm doing that,

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.930
not just for me, for all
sentient beings, at the end,

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.930
at the conclusion,
dedicate whatever good we

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.680
did this morning, may
that benefit everyone.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.180
Why not?

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.130
And it's not like a piece of
cake that you put in pieces.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.910
Everyone gets everything.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.570
That's a good deal.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:26.170
So thank you.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.560
So if you have any
questions, welcome.

00:21:33.862 --> 00:21:35.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.820
Thank you so much for the
talk and the meditation.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.240
I'm over here.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.920
So my question is how can
our micro actions really

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.790
help people who are
quite far away from us

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.880
and are experiencing extremist
violence in different parts

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.710
of the world?

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.610
And somewhat relatedly, how
can consumer technology,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.260
or how can technology in
general, like Google, Facebook,

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.940
everything here
in Silicon Valley,

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.347
really help accelerate
social change ?

00:22:05.347 --> 00:22:06.805
MATTHIEU RICARD:
Well, you see, you

00:22:06.805 --> 00:22:10.721
must remember once when
I did a small book called

00:22:10.721 --> 00:22:12.720
"The Art of Meditation"--
or I think it's called

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:20.810
"Why Meditate?" in English, it
was the time of the Iraq War.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.340
And then people said,
how can this help?

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.840
You're meditating?

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.100
That's great, but how
can this help globally?

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.310
And that is true, that when the
forest is on fire, why are you

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.490
going to talk about the sparks?

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.810
But the problem is the fire
started with the spark.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.470
And there's no war,
or discrimination,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.790
or massacre that didn't start
with hatred, or at least

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.660
with devaluing others.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.320
If you value others and
you are concern by others,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.860
then how can you exert harm
if you are genuinely concerned

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.860
with the well-being of somebody?

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.490
So it did start with the mind.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.010
There's no war that didn't
start with someone, somebody,

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:14.750
a group contagiously having this
dehumanization of the other,

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.180
reducing them the
state of thinking

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.490
they are like animals, inferior,
and so forth and so forth.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.660
So that's why.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.620
The fact that immediately
a change of mind,

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.380
first, would not solve
immediately a conflict

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.600
that is raging somewhere.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.910
But after all, conflicts
are made with people.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.280
People have different
states of mind.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.090
And that's exactly what
I mentioned earlier

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.440
about the articulation point
between individual and societal

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.700
change.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.310
A culture that is based
on nonviolent values,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.990
on compassion and
altruistic love,

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.910
it's much more likely
that they will not

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.740
be resort to violence
to solve conflicts.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.310
They will not impose
terrible things onto others.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.420
So it start with someone.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.650
Then it grows to family, the
community, the working place,

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.250
the society, the
village, the culture.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.260
And then culture can
become also contagious

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.100
or succeed better than
other cultures, which

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.400
are more individualistic,
everyone against everyone.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.690
So the evolution of
culture can favor that,

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.240
and it starts with the people.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.800
A society is made of people.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.900
So if you have a culture that is
nonviolent because generations

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.040
of people have
cultivated those virtues.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.860
And if someone is
promoting violence,

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.870
then your children will also
grow in that environment.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:46.430
So it's not the
immediate, magic solution.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.480
But it's the only way that we
gradually change individuals

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.450
and by extension society.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.540
So we should not worry
that immediately I

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.140
may not have an effect, some
kind of magic vibes going

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.520
to solve conflicts.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.210
But the more there are people
thinking that way, especially

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.370
in the global world,
virtual world,

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.410
where altruistic
people have a tendency

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.265
to get together and cooperate,
while the free-riders,

00:25:10.265 --> 00:25:11.750
the really selfish
guys, they kick

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.460
each others' legs all day long.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.570
So as a group, they have
a selective disadvantage

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:18.540
to a group of altruistics
who cooperate.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.420
That's clear.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.490
All the models have shown that.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.590
So we should not
get discouraged.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.870
It's one by one, thought after
thought, emotion after emotion,

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.480
individual after individual.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.670
And somehow you
create a culture.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.040
That may take a few
years or some whatever,

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.570
but you can make a real
difference, because everyone

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:37.760
can make a difference.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.780
And that difference ripples out.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.460
So that's why movements started.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.350
When I first came here, I think
there was not much question

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.447
about [? G Pose ?] and--

00:25:50.447 --> 00:25:51.530
AUDIENCE: Bowel movements.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.405
MATTHIEU RICARD: Huh?

00:25:52.405 --> 00:25:53.880
AUDIENCE: We had
bowel movements.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.500
MATTHIEU RICARD:
Yes, bowel movements.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.050
[GIGGLING]

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.469
So within a number of
years, less than 10 years,

00:25:59.469 --> 00:26:00.760
it becomes part of the culture.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.310
And then the people
who do that, they

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.890
will go about their
activities in different ways.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.433
So that's what the
culture is about.

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:08.933
Yeah.

00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:13.830
Whoever, yes?

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.780
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.420
I just loved that
image of mindfulness

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.740
versus caring--
mindfulness, the sniper,

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.270
versus caring mindfulness.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.240
Can you provide a
little inspiration

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:38.640
for how we, as an organization
that wants to provide things

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.710
with the right language,
the right approach

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.310
so that things can
scale and organizations

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.900
that don't have
exposure to this,

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.270
we can incorporate this
idea of caring mindfulness

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.305
into everything that we do?

00:26:51.305 --> 00:26:54.430
MATTHIEU RICARD: We talked a
little bit about that, about

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.765
economics first.

00:26:56.765 --> 00:27:04.420
As you say, if you take the
definition of homo economicus--

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.590
I don't know if you are
too familiar with that,

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.830
but there was somebody
called Francis [? Edwards. ?]

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.150
He was one of the fathers of
classical and modern economics.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.350
He said there's no place for
altruism in economic systems.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.270
Maybe he was not a bad
person, but this is not

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.110
about economics.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.862
So of course, it's
a big caricature.

00:27:20.862 --> 00:27:22.320
[INAUDIBLE] said,
for example, it's

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.300
absurd to think that people
only think of promoting

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.080
their personal interests.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.970
Human beings don't
function like that.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.880
We are not so reductionist.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.800
So to postulate
everything on that?

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.840
So then we say can we have
a compassionate, caring

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.040
economics?

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.560
If you say that to
mainstream economists,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.350
they say it's very nice,
and that, of course,

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:46.220
I agree that individually we
can and should be altruistic.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.360
But that is not about economics.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.850
Basically, economics
is economics.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.290
So be altruistic, but
one altruistic economics?

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.080
Who is going to
take us seriously?

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.410
But today, if you say
now about inequalities,

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:06.720
about the environment, I
don't care, that discourse

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.720
doesn't work anymore.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.492
It's like saying let's
put back slavery.

00:28:09.492 --> 00:28:11.200
I don't care a damn
about the environment

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.630
and I don't care a damn
about poverty in the world.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:14.750
Who can say that?

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:19.120
A few might, but basically
it's really the extreme fringe.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.430
So that's why it's
more acceptable,

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.500
and that's why economists like
[? Dennis ?] Nour and others

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.930
speak of caring economics
as a real important concept.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.280
You could expose that
in Davos Economic Forum.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.600
It's acceptable
because it makes sense.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.550
And it's not words that
are chosen properly.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:42.100
So likewise I think
the concept of caring,

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:48.570
mindfulness, if you bring these
to different companies that

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:52.680
are maybe not so enlightened
in the beginning,

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.760
if you go in the
corporate world,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.060
it's not always that they put
altruism as a core component.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.050
But the notion of caring, they
can all resonate with that.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.400
We need more caring in the
workplace with each other.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.900
You need to be more
caring with your family

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.745
So the idea of leadership,
being more of service--

00:29:11.745 --> 00:29:18.090
I remember in Davos when there
was an evening on leadership--

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.872
I can never remember the name
properly-- Price Cooper Water

00:29:20.872 --> 00:29:21.830
or something like that.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.716
I don't know where
the Water comes from.

00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:25.590
So anyway, they had
invited Christine Lagarde

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.970
and the head of
"The New York Times"

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:27.900
to discuss her leadership.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.180
And Christine Lagarde could
not come, so one smart guy

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.346
though, hey, would you come?

00:29:31.346 --> 00:29:33.160
I say, oh, of
course, but they will

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.839
be quite surprised to see me
instead of Christine Lagarde.

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:37.630
Anyway, I went there,
and I said what can I

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.990
say about leadership?

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.330
And I thought of
people I admire.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.249
I had some wonderful
doctors or people

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.790
I met in
[? Imagine World. ?] We have

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.600
a big organization with them
and still maintain the spirit.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.180
I thought, well, leadership
is to serve, serve the purpose

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.720
of what you're doing.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.690
Google has to achieve
certain things,

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:03.029
doing what Google needs to
do to survive and prosper.

00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:04.570
Then you have to
serve the people who

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.700
work here by providing a
nice environment to work in.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.384
You have all these people
going to the swimming

00:30:10.384 --> 00:30:11.800
pool at 10 o'clock
in the morning,

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.970
but they do their work
the rest of the time.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.710
And you have nice
food everywhere.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:17.910
Last time, it was 100 feet.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.900
I don't know if you
still have that.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.390
So serve the people so they
feel happy to be there,

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.260
and then they'll fulfill
their aspirations.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:30.550
And then serve society
by doing something

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.780
that's not harmless to
society, like selling

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.290
substances like
tobacco that kill

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.660
6 million people every year.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.620
That's 100 million in a century.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.170
We don't serve society
by telling lies.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.100
So that's not serving.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.150
So likewise, this idea
of service, I think,

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.880
caring goes well with this idea.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.420
So I think it's an
acceptable thing.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.620
So then when you practice
and introduce something

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.980
like mindfulness, which is
pretty new-- now in France

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.970
when it was being
introduced, meditation

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.550
in the corporate world,
nobody would go for that.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.520
This is just not our thing.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.690
Now, yoga, you can
see or go to do yoga.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:10.490
Nobody minds, but
it took 20 years.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:14.030
So mindfulness,
people accepted that.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.890
And it's thanks to Jon
Kabat-Zinn and all this work.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:19.250
Now in the clinical world
and corporate world,

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.370
it's widely accepted,
a mindful revolution.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.470
But then if it's not done
probably by the right people,

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.380
you could imagine using
it for just efficiency,

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.740
cold efficiency, so therefore
they make a mindful psychopath.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.450
So that's why I think caring
is very acceptable, politically

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.880
correct, you could say.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.940
And therefore, the
notion of caring,

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.710
I think, in now
world I don't see

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.970
why it should meet any
resistance, why you would say

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.410
that compassion,
altruism-- although it's

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.000
the same thing--
it's a little bit too

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.694
far from the usual
preoccupations

00:31:56.694 --> 00:31:58.360
of those corporate
worlds, for instance.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.060
So it's a skill, like
meditation in the school.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.680
If you say we'll teach you
attention, emotional balance,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.550
and prosocial behavior,
any parents and any teacher

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.860
will go for it.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.940
So meditation in
school, they say mhm!

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.120
I heard from Mark Greenberg,
who's an educator.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.530
He said when he wanted
to put meditation

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:20.370
in school in Texas or
somewhere, the parents

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.230
threatened to pull
out their kids.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.480
They were teaching meditation.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.521
They thought they were
going to indoctrinate them

00:32:25.521 --> 00:32:28.110
in some weird oriental
metaphysics or something.

00:32:29.802 --> 00:32:31.260
CHADE MENG TAN:
Two more questions.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:38.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you for your
inspiring and interesting talk.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:42.770
I cannot see clearly the
difference or they need

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:52.010
of saying caring mindfulness
and mindfulness because, for me,

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.080
according to my experience
when I practice mindfulness,

00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:02.120
this caring feeling or need to
take care of myself and others

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.560
is born naturally.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.670
MATTHIEU RICARD: Yes.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.750
So that's exactly what
Jon Kabat-Zinn said,

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.350
and he's right.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.000
If you do it properly
with the right instructor

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.090
in the right way, he
says it always witnesses

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.870
a strong opening to others.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.260
Great.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.910
But you know, it's still
an expected byproduct.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.270
And it depends on
how it's taught.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:32.610
But again to take the sniper
example, he's mindful.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.220
No question.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.430
So he's not caring.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.630
So you could have that.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.490
So just to avoid that
and to reinforce that

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.650
among the qualities that
mindfulness should bring,

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.740
caring is one of
the most powerful.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.010
And actually many
studies have shown,

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:55.420
like Tania Singer's one year
study, that mindfulness alone

00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:00.162
reduces stress, doesn't
bring prosocial behavior.

00:34:00.162 --> 00:34:02.370
Although the people say
they're actually more caring,

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:05.370
but in behavior they don't
really make much difference.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.090
So nothing wrong.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.630
Nothing to put it down.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.909
But the scientific results
show that it doesn't per se

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.310
automatically bring about
more prosocial behavior

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.800
while loving kindness
[INAUDIBLE] does in a big way.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.429
So when those results
are be published,

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.554
I think that we'll also
clarify the situation then.

00:34:21.554 --> 00:34:23.699
Yes, when it's well
done, probably yes.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:26.219
But not necessarily with
every instructor, not with

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:27.620
every practitioner.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.580
So then why mention
it so clearly

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.060
that you can't escape it?

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:33.790
Yes.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:37.520
And then also you have
a lot of programs,

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.300
like Search Inside
Yourself, the well-being,

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.580
the mindfulness
training, and MBSR, MBCT.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.969
And a few friends
thought should also

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.471
gather meditation
instruction that

00:34:48.471 --> 00:34:50.929
includes very clearly the notion
of compassionate altruism.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.219
So there's a trailer
now that will be

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.040
completely online from August.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.180
It's called "Imagine Clarity."

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:05.520
And I participate in helping
them to build up those apps

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.240
and among other teachers
to-- I'm not a teacher,

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.470
but to share those instructions.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.230
And so you can look
at that as well.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.350
I think already a trailer
on "Imagine Clarity."

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:20.909
And also to do things
like what Meng is teaching

00:35:20.909 --> 00:35:22.200
with this 10 second meditation.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.700
I think it's very powerful.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.810
And one example that I
gave over to Meng to use

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.650
is, why only 10 seconds,
but actually it's

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:30.850
more than 10 seconds?

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:34.400
And for example, if you open a
flask of perfume for 10 seconds

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.020
and close it, perfume
still will last longer.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.030
And if you open it often
enough for 10 seconds,

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.300
it will be there all the time.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.020
So it's just that we're
setting something in motion.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.360
It's not just 10
seconds and then

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.318
we go back to bashing
people and slapping them.

00:35:48.232 --> 00:35:50.315
CHADE-MENG TAN: Let me
clarify the 10 second thing

00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:51.874
you're talking about.

00:35:51.874 --> 00:35:54.040
The 10 second exercise that
Matthieu's talking about

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.760
is every now and then
just spend 10 seconds,

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.990
identify two human
beings, and secretly

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.950
wishing for them to be happy.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.224
So that is very powerful.

00:36:02.224 --> 00:36:04.890
MATTHIEU RICARD: So people can't
say that don't have 10 seconds.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:05.883
People maybe don't have time.

00:36:05.883 --> 00:36:06.480
They don't have 20 minutes.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.105
But 10 seconds?

00:36:07.105 --> 00:36:10.340
Nobody can dare to say
I don't have 10 seconds.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.520
CHADE-MENG TAN:
The last question.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.151
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:14.151 --> 00:36:17.370
I'm losing things
from my pocket.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:22.400
When I first encountered
loving kindness practice,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.940
it seemed very conceptual--
I wish you joy.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.670
I wish you peace--
without a feeling quality.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:33.380
Sometimes, a real feeling
of warmth is there,

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.360
and I can feel it.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.490
And when I accompany those
thoughts of may you be happy,

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.920
may you be free from
suffering with that feeling,

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.470
it becomes much more powerful.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.650
But sometimes that
feeling isn't there

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.100
and I don't know how to generate
it effectively or consistently.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.432
Do you have any advice for that?

00:36:49.432 --> 00:36:53.160
MATTHIEU RICARD: So I remember
not far from here many years

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:58.687
ago, I met Paul Ekman, who's
a great scientist on emotion.

00:36:58.687 --> 00:36:59.770
He asked me this question.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.650
When you feel
compassion, do you have

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.605
to feel the suffering of others?

00:37:03.605 --> 00:37:06.690
At that time, I had
not worked with people

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.690
working on empathy so I was
not sure-- be Sometimes yes,

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.930
sometimes no.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:11.560
I was not sure.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.160
Then we distinguished
nicely empathy, compassion,

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.610
and so forth.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:21.310
So in short, when you
think of all the suffering,

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:25.000
just thinking with empathy,
like those Romanian children.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.900
There is a strong
emotional component

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.630
that then triggers and
should bring about loving

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.870
kindness and compassion.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.550
But there's also a
cognitive aspect.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.140
In Buddhism, we
think that suffering

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.330
is not just headache,
or being tortured,

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.630
or terrible things like
that which are obvious.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.992
Why did the Buddha teach
of the four noble truths,

00:37:45.992 --> 00:37:47.200
the truth of suffering first?

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.190
We don't need the Buddha to
tell us headaches or toothaches

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.430
are suffering.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:52.930
But he meant much
more than that.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:55.876
He meant that as long as you
are a man, you're deluded.

00:37:55.876 --> 00:37:57.250
And as long as
you strongly grasp

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.230
the solidity of permanence,
and friends, and enemies,

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:04.900
and those solidifications of
reality and distorting reality,

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.650
you are bound to suffer.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:07.950
This is not very emotional.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.870
The root is that
distorting reality brings

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.970
hatred, jealousy-- all that.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.410
So you can, of course,
take compassionate

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:20.050
about the root of suffering,
but it is not very emotional.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:22.990
But you understand the
deep cause of suffering.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:28.030
So depending upon times, we have
seen many times the Dalai Lama.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.070
You're having tears in
the middle of teaching.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.014
And he said the
last 30 years when

00:38:32.014 --> 00:38:34.180
he does his four hours of
meditation in the morning,

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.030
there's hardly any morning where
I didn't have tears thinking

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.320
of the suffering of beings.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.500
So you could say it's
emotional, but also he meditates

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.030
on the lack of solid reality.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.340
And I'm sure it's tears
that come at that time.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.780
It's understanding wisdom
that reinforces and deepens

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.230
his compassion.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:57.160
So those two-- it doesn't have
to be always the emotional.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.345
There's this cognitive
dimension that

00:38:59.345 --> 00:39:01.410
is very important,
especially in Buddhism,

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.344
but I think in
general, because you

00:39:03.344 --> 00:39:04.510
go at the root of suffering.

00:39:07.057 --> 00:39:09.140
CHADE-MENG TAN: Thank you
so much, my dear friend,

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:13.260
for benefiting us, for
teaching, and for being a life

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.035
in this world.

00:39:14.035 --> 00:39:15.035
Thank you.

00:39:15.035 --> 00:39:17.530
MATTHIEU RICARD: We'll
see how long it lasts.
