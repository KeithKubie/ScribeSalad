00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.170
Now that we've selected this number line, what does this actually tell us about

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.222
the value of x? We know that it has to have something to do with 0 and something

00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:12.127
to do with 15. But what exactly? I'd like you to pick one condition from the

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:15.953
left column and from the right column that you think fits x. And then also

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:20.020
whether both of these conditions are true, in which case you should pick and.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.031
Or, if only one of them might be true at a time, pick or.
