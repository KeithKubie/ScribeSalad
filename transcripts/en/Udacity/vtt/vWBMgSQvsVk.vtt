00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
So, in summary, I'd like to say just a little

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.130
bit more about correcting data. The types of corrections that

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.660
we typically make to any data set that we're cleaning,

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.960
usually involve one or more of the following. We're going

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.410
to be removing typographical errors, or correcting them. There will

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.450
often be a component in cleaning where we're validating against

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.610
a known list of entities. We will frequently be cross

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.270
checking our data with a validated data set of some kind.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.665
We might be doing data enhancement, and frequently

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:31.170
are, where we're making data a little more complete

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.200
by adding some related information. So for example, we

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.320
might have a username, an email address, and first

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.590
and last name for every entry in a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.270
record set. And as part of our cleaning process

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.900
or part of our process before, we analyze data.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.610
We're going to integrate each of those records with

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.220
marketing data for each person on employer and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.220
job title et cetera. Another common thing we do

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.030
in cleaning data is harmonizing the data. So for

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.230
example in this case, we would be transforming all

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.890
abbreviations for street and road to say for

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.660
example, their full names, or vise versa. Maybe we're

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.700
going the other direction. Likewise with directions. N and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.810
W become north and west, et cetera in addresses.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.590
We might also be changing our data set so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.380
that it uses a new standard for some set of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.250
codes that it contains. So for example, we might

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.700
be transforming our data set to, instead of two-digit country

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.420
codes, use three-digit codes by simply mapping each of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.110
the two-digit codes onto the appropriate three-digit codes. These are

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.210
some of the common types of tasks that we

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.990
do when cleaning data, and again, it's very situation specific.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.970
So what we've tried to do throughout this lesson, and what we're going to do

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.470
in the problem set, is give you

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.570
examples from a few different situations, to give

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.420
you some practice with cleaning, so that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.640
you have some concrete examples in mind, when

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.280
you get into your own data wrangling tasks

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.910
where you need to do some data cleaning.
