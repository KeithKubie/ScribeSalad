00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.830
My first pitch meeting was with
an Angel investor called Owen.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.340
And I gave the pitch of my life and
he was convinced.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.630
I felt that he fell for me.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.180
And in the second meeting I brought
my team members and he said,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.510
yeah, amazing, let's do it.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.180
And somewhere in doing
the meeting he told me Norm,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.260
I have a feeling that you have
a feeling that I'm in your pocket.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.620
You know what?

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.370
Let's stop it right there.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.560
You go and get five more investors

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.580
to give the same amount of money
that I'm going to give you.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.560
And then I'll give you my money.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.970
What do you say about that?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.720
And I said, what?

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.070
Really?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.580
Why?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.440
I thought,
I thought if we're doing this.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.050
No, no, I want more people to
participate in this round.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.950
And you know what?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.680
I want you to bring in an engine
with the whole Gigi level.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.550
And that time and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.560
still, Gigi Levy was the most
notable engine investor in Israel.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.230
And Gigi was like a celebrity for
me, I don't know him.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.680
He said, yeah, go do that.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.500
Go do that, that will be your test.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.180
And I went from that meeting with
my team members somewhere between

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.380
humiliated to disappointed,
to what's going on?

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.610
I really thought that we're
going to start operating.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.960
But not, so the next day I
just like this isn't fart,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.060
how I'm going to
approach this person and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
I was so
I was the hokiest of the hokies.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.060
And I didn't know anyone.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.710
So my best chance was just to Facebook
message this Angel [COUGH] sorry.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.550
So my best chance was to Facebook
message this angel investor.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.830
And this is a huge no-no.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.790
Everybody will tell you,
this is so hood.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.690
Don't do it.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.060
It's so amateur, it's so unprofessional.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.630
But I did it, and
he answered right away.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.210
Three days later we had a meeting.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.300
We had an amazing meeting.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.440
And he decided to invest and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.140
this guy became my mentor he became
one of my favorite person on Earth.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.990
And he invested not once, not twice,
four times in my companies.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.910
And now he's following,
he followed us to the next company.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.120
And yes, I'm excited to talk about him.
