1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Cord to server music.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.970
<v 0>I know that's not the right song.</v>

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.800
Fuck did it go?

5
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.510
<v 1>Oh uh,</v>

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.000
<v 0>and we drive passing.
That's not the song either.
Wait,</v>

7
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.940
what was the song called again?
It's called fish paste.

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.300
<v 1>Oh.
Oh.</v>

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.373
<v 0>This was</v>

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.670
jealous of us because I guess you pronounce it d and words.

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.500
It's die and w o r d

12
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.770
and it is in fact the shit is shit.

13
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.250
[inaudible] original man.
I love that chick's voice.

14
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.220
I love everything about her.
I love that.
Fucked up there.
Cut.

15
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.200
Fuck the show.
That crazy bitch.
Fuck.

16
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.310
[inaudible] dudes are like debating whether or not she's hot.

17
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.380
Oh,
she's weird looking.
Yeah,
but she's hot as fuck you man.
Fuck us.

18
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:15.930
Look bangs out.
Crazy bitch.
Crazy.
That bitch on a one to 10.
Uh,

19
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.210
did she seems like a seven,
seven or eight.
I can a strong seven.
I bet.

20
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:24.980
She's a lot of fun.
She makes up for it.

21
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.660
Since we're off air,
dude,
you're off air.
You're all fair.

22
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.380
Here we are.
We're on
took awhile.
It took awhile to,

23
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.450
for us to show up.
So,
so that album came out.
Today comes out today.

24
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.050
They're from South Africa and I don't know what the whole story behind them is.

25
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.010
It's like you hear that it's manufactured that they were part of other bands and

26
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:52.640
this like whole like,
you know,
there supposed to be like Cape Town white trash,

27
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.470
right?
Like this is sort of manufactured.
I also heard that one of their,
their,

28
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.460
their main songs,
uh,
was actually released early prematurely.
Like the,

29
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:05.780
the footage got stolen or taken from somebody that worked on it and re released

30
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:10.460
it early and that actually made them become popular.
Really?
Yeah.
So,
well man,

31
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:15.450
the first,
the Zeff side one,
um,
do you have that load,
that up Zeff side?

32
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.130
Yeah,
that's the first one that I ever saw from that.
It's so strange.

33
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:23.990
You have to see the youtube to really get an appreciation for what these folks

34
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:28.550
look like because the dude is like really tall and really skinny and he has

35
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:32.390
these crazy gold teeth in these tattoos that looked like they were just

36
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:36.230
scribbled onto him.
You know?
I don't know know if they're real tattoos.

37
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.190
Are those real tattoos?
Probably.
I mean,
is that really his real deal?
Yeah.

38
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:42.610
Maybe he's just a Thespian.
I keep hearing.
I heard you.

39
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.880
I heard he was like an art.
They were art school dropouts.
So,
okay.
I like this.

40
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:50.270
It might be like alternative art,
whatever it is.
It's bad ass.

41
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:53.420
I don't give a fuck if it's real.
He doesn't have to be really be dumb and crazy,

42
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.890
you know,
whatever he's doing,
that character is fucking brilliant.
Yeah.
You know?

43
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:00.440
But do you gotta do you gotta side?
Yeah.
Ife or Wifi.

44
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.880
It loads up cause it's,
um,
it's fascinating,
right?

45
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.680
<v 2>You have to see the youtube.</v>

46
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.420
Like I'll just standing outside with his granny and then I lived with my mom and

47
00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:14.490
dad on the road.
And then your land.
This,

48
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.600
this is the one ghetto way of showing something guys been friends for how long?

49
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.540
Forever.
Yeah.
You gotta to get people most sick.
This bro.

50
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.380
Why you guys have internet or yeah,
just get on youtube and look up PC,

51
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:31.360
computer die.
Antwoord NSF sides.

52
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.320
[inaudible] gangster skill.
Here's my phone apart.
Are you around?

53
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.480
Yeah.
Okay.
So give me a wrap.

54
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.210
<v 0>Do me a rap Dj hot deck.
Drop them off the fucking beatbox dog.</v>

55
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.780
This was the one that was stolen,
by the way.
Yes.

56
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.323
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.630
<v 2>That's what I'm talking about.
Just going to ask,</v>

58
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.890
don't be Saki [inaudible] this pops up for you.

59
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.960
Just like pick up the top [inaudible] digital zone.

60
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.070
Puck is dope,
man.
I love it.
I love his accent and I love it.

61
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.240
I love the whole thing.
Please.

62
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.340
<v 0>Yeah,
that's it.
With boxer shorts in front of her.</v>

63
00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:23.450
It's swinging his dick and they're fixing those dick.
It's fucking great,
man.

64
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.190
Yeah,
it's interesting.
It's new.
It's something,
you know?
Yeah.
It's something real,

65
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.210
you know,
in this world of packaged bullshit,
you know,
over and over again,

66
00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:35.330
some of these fucking bans that they're just keep pushing.
It's like,

67
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.670
what is this fucking bullshit on the highway to fuck?
Speaking of bands,
oh,

68
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:44.660
by the way,
we were sponsored by the flashlights.
We got off to a bad start here.

69
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.530
Avatar or not?
Not,
yeah,
it's hurts.
Alien.
Fuck a blue flashlight.

70
00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:52.250
I remember talking about this on the podcast,
like,
could this be real?

71
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.930
I think it's right next to your chair.
Yeah,
sure.
It's right here.

72
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.950
And we were talking on the podcast after we saw avatar because I told you I

73
00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:04.820
totally wanted to fuck that blue Chester.
She's bad ass who doesn't,
right.

74
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.550
I'm like,
why don't they make an Avatar?
Fleshlight well they don't,

75
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.730
they don't make an avatar flashlight.
Yeah,
this is definitely not,

76
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.920
I mean it is blue and it's an alien pussy,

77
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:16.790
but those are coincidental circumstances,
old type thing.
Chris,
actually,

78
00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:20.550
so that they released that a couple of years ago before Avatar was even.
Yeah,

79
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.430
totally.
Yeah,
it's on the books.
Well,
either way it's awesome.
Yeah,

80
00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:28.100
it's not avatar.
It's alien.
It's a slow at it is.

81
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.080
It's going to be a SMURF fleshlight next year.

82
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.130
You don't feel guilty fucking that too because it's not really a vagina.

83
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.860
You know what I mean?
Like you look at like the vagina flashlights.

84
00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:41.310
Like why would this vagina be in a tube?
Right.
Well,

85
00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:44.660
I wasn't making any sense.
I fucked a regular nine fleshlight pushing.

86
00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:47.340
It was just an ass like a piece of ass.
Like,
like a,

87
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:48.820
it looked like a piece of Dexter meat.

88
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.310
You know that you're a fucking off and not as good.
No,

89
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.430
because that was actually weird to me now.
And they know what they're doing,
man.

90
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.860
Um,
so anyway,
are sponsored by them.

91
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.820
And what we were talking about before we got into that was this thing on the

92
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:06.500
highway today in Los Angeles there was a band and was the band called imperial

93
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.940
stars.
Imperial Stars.
Now I didn't know about this.
I lucky I missed this.

94
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.980
I didn't leave the house today,
but um,

95
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.040
when it happened apparently was these guys got on the highway and they did turn

96
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.470
there.

97
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.370
They're stopped their truck and turned it sideways so that the created traffic

98
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:27.371
jam and then they started singing the biggest piece of attention whoring may be

99
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.660
anyone's ever done stood on the truck playing music by the way.

100
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.440
Like they had like full now these dumb motherfuckers probably thought that this

101
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:39.740
was like,
this is like the opening scene in our movie,
man.
This is it.

102
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:42.860
It's like they were so wild.
Like this is how they got discovered.

103
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.160
They got on top of the truck and they stopped traffic and the fucking music was

104
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:50.800
so good.
People didn't care,
man.
Yeah,
you get it.
Yeah,
and the crazy thing is,

105
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:53.900
is they actually,
I listened to the song,
I don't know if you've heard it.

106
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.130
I have not heard if I want to hate them.
I know.
If it was really good,

107
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.920
I would have been like,
damn,
there's no way.
It could be really good.

108
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.230
Because if they were,
it was really good.
They wouldn't be willing to do this.

109
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.310
It just makes you have to be a Douche bag.

110
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.280
You have to be a Douche bag to want to stop traffic and get on the news and do

111
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:12.680
all this at other people's expense.
Right.

112
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:16.610
Because you want to be known for your fucking music.
Fuck you.

113
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.550
Especially in this city where that fucking is.
Yeah.
Well,

114
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.230
what about people who are on the way to the hospital?

115
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:24.230
What about people were on the way to serious emergencies?

116
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.150
What about people that lost their job because of you?

117
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:30.620
That was the one day they were late again over the mark [inaudible].
You know,

118
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.640
maybe they had a fucking thing.

119
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:34.850
If you're late again this month you're fired and they were fired because you

120
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:39.680
fuck you dude.
Even if the song is all about traffic on the one on one,

121
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.450
that's the bad thing.

122
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.120
The song is all about him and what sucks is that every news place it's going to

123
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:45.320
talk about this and you know,

124
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:48.410
there's so many dumb asses out there that's going to like fall for this whole

125
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:51.140
trick and they're going to become their,
their Twitter count went up today.

126
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.750
How much I'm going to bet that I maybe,
I'm sure they did.

127
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.100
I'd probably follow them.
Listen,
I would have hoped for this.

128
00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.450
They'll say something really stupid,

129
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.040
but I mean we just have to discourage that kind of shit.
You can't do that man.

130
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.971
You can't.
You know,

131
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:08.870
it's one thing if you want to do something for publicity and it doesn't fuck

132
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:10.250
with everybody else's life,

133
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.670
but when you want to do something like that in La and you want to stop traffic

134
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:17.300
just so that you get attention essentially like this is how we're going to make

135
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:21.200
it,
man.
This is,
it's a brilliant publicity stunt.
Like you guys are idiots.

136
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.740
That's an idiot move,
man.
It sucks.
And look,
you know,

137
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.280
maybe a bounce back from it and you maybe you fucked up and maybe you guys were

138
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:31.070
all high on coke and it seemed like an awesome idea.

139
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.250
I'm not saying your shitty human beings.
You fucked up though.

140
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.900
You want to hear this song flooded?
Huge.
Could take this piece here,

141
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:37.850
this fucking song.

142
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.140
We are going crazy.
Okay.
All right.
This all right.
Now actually I got,
hold on,

143
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.970
I forgot.
I can't do that on this computer.
Remember?
Oh,
that's right.

144
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.050
You can't get to it on an iPad.
Uh,
yeah.
Hold on a second.
So I,
uh,

145
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.670
talk about some joy.
Listen man,

146
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.870
I totally understand the appeal for all of these reality shows where all these

147
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:10.170
people become famous for no reason.
And then people go,
fuck man,

148
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.780
it's all just about getting eyes on you.
And then once you get eyes on you,

149
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:15.210
you can be a business and you can even use that for good.

150
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:18.210
You can go all Oprah style and fucking save the world with all the money.

151
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.220
You know,
maybe Kim Kardashians going to do that.

152
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:24.090
So maybe all of this will be kind of a good thing.
But d because of that,

153
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.560
people are trying to find ways to get attention outside of the normal shit

154
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.430
outside of being recognized for something recognized for what you do.

155
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.180
You know this fucking d at word is perfect.
However you say it.

156
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:41.040
Diane would die at word Diet that that rap band we were playing at.
We don't,

157
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.890
we haven't,
there's no publicity stunts.
There's nothing.

158
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.960
They didn't fucking start a fire in a mall.

159
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.890
All they did was make badass music and it got on youtube and everybody's like,

160
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:54.030
dude,
this is the shit.
Check this out.
This is fucking cool.
It's real smart.

161
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:58.440
They did it to the whole clip is like two minutes long.
Is this the song?
Yeah,

162
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.040
Dude.
And it's really poor greenscreen effects.
Okay,
so it's a

163
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.850
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

164
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.910
<v 0>This is really low.
Can we turn it up?</v>

165
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.280
<v 4>I've got your number.</v>

166
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.740
I've got the energy to get to watch me.

167
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.040
The energy and

168
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.810
it's a perio by can you stay with y'all?

169
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.180
Can you shut down the thing stuck in traffic or something.

170
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.130
<v 0>So it sounds,
you know,</v>

171
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.890
it sounds like to me it's like a fake video used inside a movie.
You know,

172
00:11:05.891 --> 00:11:10.170
like tropic thunder,
look at this new video that's on it's own.
I know.

173
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.620
That's what it sounds like to me.
That's a perfect way of describing it.
Dude.

174
00:11:14.621 --> 00:11:19.420
That is the perfect way to describe I fake videos.
They're playing musicians,

175
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.770
right?
Yeah,
exactly.
They do look like you even had a wig on too.
Yeah.

176
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.640
Well he's got fabulous hair.
Don't hate,
I think,
um,
yeah,

177
00:11:27.641 --> 00:11:29.770
they're,
they sound like they're playing musicians.

178
00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:32.900
I just hope there's no trying to get famous.
It wasn't bad.
I mean it was,

179
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.030
I couldn't say it was terrible.

180
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.070
I just hope there's nothing like copy catters you know,

181
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:38.310
like open Mike Acoustic people,
you know,

182
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.430
putting our bikes in the middle of highway.
Oh

183
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.080
No.
Fuck people,
we,

184
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.320
that guy might have started something and I know the economy is bad,

185
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:51.790
but what the fuck people,
yeah.
You know,
jam.
What if that does happen?

186
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:53.990
What if people start doing that all the now?
I think they're going to make,

187
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.780
make an example out of these guys,

188
00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.430
they're probably going to charge them a lot of money.
Yeah.

189
00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:59.470
Well what if it's nothing?
What if it's like,
no,

190
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:02.320
it's gotta be something that's gotta be something big because they blocked

191
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:06.130
traffic.
That's like a felony.
I think what they did for publicity's,

192
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:10.150
I think it's fairly serious,
right?
I think,
um,
I think they could go to jail.

193
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.850
It's very possible that you go to jail for something like that.
Yeah.

194
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.210
Like unlawful restraint.
You're an offeree saying,
yeah,

195
00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:17.890
you could put like a kidnapping charge on danger to you.

196
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:20.890
Put human beings in danger,
close off the highways and make,

197
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.070
make it tough for people to get around ambulances.
You know,

198
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.110
someone's dad could have died because you know,

199
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:28.690
there's a heart attack and they rushed him to the hospital and they can't get

200
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:33.270
there in time because you fucking decided to sing in the road.
You cunt.
Fuck you.

201
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.520
You know,
that's just dumb.
And everybody,
you know,

202
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.100
everybody should react the same way to them.
Even if you like them.

203
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.730
It's like if there was a dumb move,
man,
there's just something so not cool.

204
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:45.250
Something should start from this.
Like it's a new tradition.

205
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:47.800
Every time you see these guys in public,
you have to throw a tomato at them.

206
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.750
They should charge them for everybody that was late.

207
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.360
Think about all the people that relate thousands and thousands of people that

208
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:53.021
were late there.

209
00:12:53.021 --> 00:12:56.020
Their employers have to pay the person for the time that they weren't even at

210
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:58.360
work because they were stuck in a traffic jam because these assholes,

211
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.940
they should all like that shit.
Like they could just stack all that up.

212
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.120
They should like find out,
okay,
what do you get?
You get $50 an hour.
All right,

213
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.480
this guy gets 20 bucks an hour and this guy got okay,

214
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.620
45 minutes and we'll calculate it up and you know,
and Oh,
you owe $1 million.

215
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.700
You fuck.
Yeah.

216
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:15.920
This guy was auditioning for iron man for he could've made this much money on
it.

217
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.350
Yeah,
you crazy.
Yeah.
I could get crazy.
Like I had a fishing in a dream.

218
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.910
I knew it was going to happen for me.

219
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.680
Everything in my patient was absolutely perfect and true.
Except you,

220
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.000
you decided to sing on the fucking freeway.

221
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.230
What would have been smart if they hired these guys at,

222
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.740
these guys were homeless guys and they were,

223
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.800
they made like this fake video up just to make it look like they were the ones

224
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:36.161
singing.

225
00:13:36.161 --> 00:13:39.610
But the real band hired these people to get in trouble to go to jail so they

226
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.520
wouldn't get in trouble.
And the,
the problem with a band like that,

227
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:45.970
it's that anybody that would come up with a stunt like that is not going to be

228
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:47.910
good.
Right.
We're just not going to be good.
Right.

229
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.540
Cause they obviously aren't famous yet.

230
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.520
What's not even not that you're not famous yet,

231
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:53.770
obviously there's a lot of good bands that aren't famous.

232
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:57.100
It's a being famous in the music business as a fucking weird thing.

233
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.570
It doesn't really make sense.
It's not that easy.
It's tricky,
you know,
it's like,

234
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:06.040
but with the Internet,
like look at this Dna ord thing,
you can get famous.

235
00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:09.010
You just have to put something together.
And their show was cheap.
I mean,

236
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:12.580
it wasn't,
there was enough hand,
high tech,
nothing to it from South Africa.

237
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:17.500
We know about how Sally Mann and they did,
they,
they did it right.
You know,

238
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:22.180
it's,
but it's,
it's tricky like to try to like get record sales and shit and,

239
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.840
and get in the door and get played on the radio and everything.
It's like,
man,

240
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.150
it's so,
it's a fucking funky business.

241
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.150
And it got gutted because of the MP3S online,

242
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.090
like the music businesses in a state of shambles.
You know,

243
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.130
it's interesting with something like this,

244
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.710
Dee aunt word comes in and shakes things up,

245
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.770
but it's annoying when you see the other manifestations of it,

246
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:46.580
like these assholes with their fucking bus on the highway.
Right.
It's just,

247
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.390
it's just sad that someone would decide to do that.

248
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.130
That you would be so fucking selfish and stupid.

249
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.300
You would want to block off a main route just so that you could,
you know,

250
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.330
make it,
man,
the kid fucking make it mean.

251
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.350
What are the odds those guys aren't annoying as fuck his is a quote.

252
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:09.450
The band describes themselves as rock stars living on the edge.

253
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.380
They're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends.

254
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.550
That's a real quote.
Shut the fuck up.
Swear to God.

255
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.870
Fucking La times.com.
I'm reading it right now.
The fuck up the band,

256
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.410
the band.
This is a subtle comedy.
Wait a minute.
I'm starting to like them.

257
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.160
I'm starting to become,
I think I just became a thing.

258
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.440
No Way.
Is it 180 degree turnaround?
This is a subtle comedy.

259
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.190
My bad internet.
This is a subtle comedy,
Dude.
No,

260
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.350
I think we're missing out.
We're missing out.
I'm on La Time Dotcom.

261
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.990
Where's this funny quotes about three sentences and members arrested after

262
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:47.060
blocking one-on-one freeway.
Okay.

263
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.800
That la times blogs and I want you to read it,

264
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:58.340
but I want you to read it.
How they wrote it too.
Oh my God.
Where's,

265
00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:01.880
where's yours?
Is it the same day I emailed him saying he met it to you here.

266
00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:06.290
You want to look at it right here?
Yeah.
Okay.
The band describes itself,

267
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:08.120
says rock stars.

268
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:12.330
Now this is in all caps with an exclamation point.
Oh,

269
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.270
living on the edge.

270
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.720
They're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends.

271
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.971
Okay.

272
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:24.971
It says they debuted in 2010 with a hardcore hip hop album.

273
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.260
Well,
wait a minute,
are they rock stars or are they hardcore hip hop artists?

274
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:33.590
They can do anything.
That is crazy.
Is that a new thing that's going on now?

275
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.110
Like hip hop and rock?
It's just this all together.

276
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:39.850
It's just a setting in garage band nowadays so they can do anything they want
to.

277
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.210
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
The band describes itself.
I'll say this again.

278
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:49.211
For those of you who haven't crashed your fucking cars and furious white

279
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:50.960
knuckled anger at these cuts,

280
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.090
the Ben describes itself as Rock Stars in there on the edge.

281
00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.320
They're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends.

282
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.070
That's a real quad.
If you seen the truck to that that was pulled over,

283
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.440
that was like,
oh,
it looks like Wayne's world

284
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.540
fucking picture of them.
It looks like something from Wayne's world.

285
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:15.800
It looks vague.
It doesn't even look real.
I hope this is not a movie.
Um,

286
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.210
it might be,
they might be brilliant.
It seems like it is.
Yeah.
Like I said,

287
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.610
like I said,
it seemed like a fake band inside of a movie.

288
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:27.290
Whatever the whole thing is.
I bet.
I bet it is.
I bet it is.
There just is.
No.

289
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.000
Well,
if they are,
come on man,

290
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.080
then they're really fucked because if they make a movie and they closed the

291
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:37.430
highway down from movie like that.
Yeah.
No,
I don't believe that.

292
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.600
Because first of all,
you would have cameras everywhere.
You'd have real cameras.

293
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.000
You wouldn't have fucking little youtube cameras.

294
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.560
They're going to do a stunt like this.

295
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.510
They're going to have to have like real permits.
But look,

296
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:52.080
how could that photo is?
It's photos perfect.
They turn the car sideways,

297
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.450
turn it sideways.
That's perfect lighting.
It's perfect.

298
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.360
It even looks like it Kinda caught.
Dammit.
If this is a movie,

299
00:17:57.361 --> 00:18:00.650
I'm going to be really mad and I'm already mad.
This devil mad.
Um,
I,

300
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.490
I'm hoping that these guys were like,
Andy Kaufman just is brilliant.
You know,

301
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.850
farmers,
artists.
No,
you're not like that.
Maybe the quote is so bad,

302
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:13.050
but so say it like Ben Describes itself as Rock Stars.

303
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:15.180
This is all in cabs living on the edge.

304
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.190
They're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friend.
Right.

305
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.790
That's what they're known for is this guy in my neighborhood.

306
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.240
This guy is fucking crazy.
He hangs out with his friends.

307
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.050
That's how he's known that way.
Say It like you lived in Glendale though.

308
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.470
It totally changed the whole sentence.
You'll member walks.
Does,

309
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:33.240
we're living on the edge.
You know,
they're getting,

310
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.480
we'd like to get crazy in England.
People.
They were Flynn's man,
an Armenian guy.

311
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:40.680
You're doing what?
Does that make sense?
I don't have a Swedish Swedish.
Wow.
Um,

312
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.680
listen,
I think that these guys,
uh,
if,

313
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:47.580
if this is a scam and if this is just a,
a hustle,

314
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.880
then I dunno,
I'm on the fence.
I'm on the fence now.
It's not like you're going,

315
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.020
we decided to make a bad band on purpose.

316
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:58.410
I might think this is pretty fucking funny.
If the song was good.

317
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.680
That's what I was saying.
Remember when we went to see that band steel panther?

318
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.240
Yes.
That was good music.
Fucking awesome music.
If you haven't seen those guys.

319
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:09.840
Steel Panther or this,
they do this like eighties,
um,

320
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:14.450
thing where they play like all the,
like the best eighties rock and the,

321
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.110
the dude does the most insane Ozzy Osborne impression round and it's all like

322
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:22.770
hair metal stuff.
It's all like,
you know,
like it's good man.

323
00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:27.630
It's good music but it's like this like hilarious good music parody on.

324
00:19:27.631 --> 00:19:30.150
But you love it because you know there are fake band,
right?
You know,

325
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.990
but they're good.
These guys,
what if they are fake band too,

326
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.900
but they didn't do the good part of the music so it doesn't go together.

327
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:39.440
It doesn't work.
It has to actually cause cause I,

328
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.780
if I like these guys and I respect him actually have to get into their music and

329
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:43.320
I'm not,

330
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.210
what am I going to hang out with these guys and become friends with them.

331
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:48.300
But if it's just this brilliant performance piece,
which just make the worst,

332
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:51.060
most cliche,
do bland,

333
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.240
dumb wrap and we'll do it with like a lot of confidence.

334
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.850
Let's see if we could sell it.
What if they just want to make friends?

335
00:19:56.851 --> 00:20:00.000
Maybe this is just a friend thing.
Like they,
you won't like the music,

336
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:02.190
but they just want to be your friend.
Well,
they do hang out with their friends.

337
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:03.410
They're known for that.
Right.

338
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.720
So known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends.
Right.
So it's a,

339
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.970
it's a big frame thing.

340
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.820
How many people right now are going to change their Avatar,

341
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.420
their fucking signature under the advertiser on the road board now too.

342
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.700
He's known for getting crazy and hanging out with his friends.

343
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.930
You fucking dubby you shut up dummy.

344
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.000
It makes God dammit everybody's doe.
And they,

345
00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:32.610
because of this ban Joey did wasn't here today.
Yeah.
This fucking band.
The,

346
00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:36.180
these cut holes,
when they decided to do that,
Joey Diaz is a bit,

347
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.970
he was filming something today and he wasn't gonna be able to make it over and

348
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:43.830
time of traffic.
So we flew solo because of you.
You twats yeah.
Where'd it go?

349
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.160
Ah,
speaking of dumb,
um,

350
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.370
<v 5>there's that guy who is running well,
he is,</v>

351
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:56.200
I'm the Democratic nominee for Senate for,
I think it's South Carolina.

352
00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:57.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:02.010
<v 5>And His name is Alvin Green.
And this guy,
um,
he won.</v>

354
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.760
Okay.

355
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.390
He won the Democratic nomination and a lot of people were thinking that he was a

356
00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.224
plant.

357
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.350
They were saying there's something going on here because this guy is so bad.

358
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.310
Like it almost seems like the Republicans must've paid to get him in as the

359
00:21:14.311 --> 00:21:17.190
Democrat.
Therefore they would run a posed for the Senate.

360
00:21:17.191 --> 00:21:20.190
Like they would have this guy who was just like so bad.
It's impossible.

361
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.220
And He seems like a troll.
Right.
Really seems fake.

362
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.150
The Guy who is a military veteran.
Okay.
And he,

363
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.190
he did no campaign speeches.
He had no campaign events and he won.

364
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.430
Wow.
Yeah.
I mean he won in,
a lot of people are saying the one,

365
00:21:35.431 --> 00:21:39.510
cause he's black because they saw that he was black and black people just said,

366
00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:42.980
well,
you know,
hey,
he's a veteran.
I'll vote for them.
So people were in,

367
00:21:42.981 --> 00:21:47.370
the veteran's voted for him.
But when it comes to the guy talking,
dude,

368
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:52.170
it's one of the weirdest things ever.
It's almost like,
he's like,

369
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.500
it's like something is wrong.
It's not just that he's dumb.

370
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.560
It's like there's like a weird disconnect.
Like he's retarded.

371
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.580
What if it's something that like,

372
00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:02.400
you're not allowed to say anything on this interview,

373
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.390
like the people that pushed him into no.
No.
You don't think there?
No.
There's an,

374
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.320
there's a sheer pure idiocy to this guy.
Really?
That's shocking.

375
00:22:10.321 --> 00:22:12.810
I'm going to hear this and this guy is a,

376
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.250
he goes on this talk show and they,
they ask them some questions.

377
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.610
[inaudible] plug it in.
I'll play this because it's so,
it's so trippy.

378
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.313
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

379
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.500
<v 5>Turn your speaker so,</v>

380
00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.740
so hard to believe that this fucking guy so hard to believe that this force

381
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.910
[inaudible] Mute your Ustream.

382
00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:34.820
<v 6>Okay.</v>

383
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.820
It's so hard to believe that this guy is actually running this guy for anything

384
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.100
you have to see.
It's very trippy here.
I'll plant.

385
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.200
It's very trippy.
Yeah.
Onto anything Brian.

386
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.420
That's the sound that the primary over a long a time democratic activists with

387
00:22:57.051 --> 00:23:00.130
69% of the vote at the time though,
we're going to Greenland.

388
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.140
<v 5>You still have a Ustream somewhere open?</v>

389
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:04.203
<v 1>No.</v>

390
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.530
<v 5>Okay.
It has to be.
How's it?
Why can't you plan on yours?
Um,</v>

391
00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:14.600
have you send me the youtube?
Yeah,
send me that link.
Uh,
oh Brian,

392
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.970
I thought you were going to be able to do it through this.

393
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.400
[inaudible] you ever used dream playing it?

394
00:23:19.401 --> 00:23:22.880
That's why that echoing sound is going on right now.
Well,
it's this,
this,

395
00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.980
this is what we're playing.
No,
no,
no,
no.

396
00:23:24.981 --> 00:23:29.390
There's a second window somewhere where you're Ustream is playing.
Oh,

397
00:23:29.391 --> 00:23:31.400
it's probably this.
Yeah,
it's us.

398
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.460
This is the fucking Satish shit ever.

399
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:39.640
You people shouldn't have to listen to this answer this year.

400
00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:42.760
And that is of course.
Are you a witch?

401
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.040
No.
First

402
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.150
<v 7>I want to remind everyone that demand started the recession.</v>

403
00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.770
There you go.
You're on your talking points.
Not a witch.
And demand started.

404
00:23:55.771 --> 00:23:57.400
The is the guy who's running against,

405
00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.560
now you're saying to men started the resection.
Turtle.

406
00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.160
Does that tell us you have to see what this guy looks like?

407
00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.130
Does that tell us anything about how this race might end up?
Well,

408
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.540
dement started to recession dimension is responsible for the session and I'm the

409
00:24:15.961 --> 00:24:20.040
best candidate that defines where we at right now in this country.

410
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.250
Um,
now I know people tell you,
you know,
no matter what the question is,

411
00:24:24.251 --> 00:24:28.720
just do your talking points and all that sort of stuff.
But seriously,
Alvin,

412
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.730
your nickname,
turtle.
Um,
where did that come from?

413
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.430
No,
no.

414
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.560
Dummit started the reception and I'm the best candidate and that defines where

415
00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:45.150
we had in this country.
I'm a United States army veteran.

416
00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:48.220
Ones wrong are the concentrations on those efforts in,

417
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:52.300
and I'm an unemployed military jet or knitting currently and,

418
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.440
and we'll lose in this country is losing 100,000 jobs a month.

419
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.050
And,
and the is responsible for the recession.

420
00:25:02.051 --> 00:25:06.310
Dimmitt Dimmitt started to refresh.
Uh,
okay.
Um,

421
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.880
what,
let's go to some debate positions and seekers.
You know,

422
00:25:09.881 --> 00:25:14.850
if a white guys get this gas reporter voice shouldn't be allowed to be screwed.

423
00:25:14.851 --> 00:25:19.150
Teachers in South Carolina.
Yes,

424
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.600
that's their private life.
And um,

425
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.810
none of their private life doesn't interfere with how they do their job.
Less so.

426
00:25:28.811 --> 00:25:33.020
Could you imagine if that was your boss?
That's the crazy part.
Can't be real.

427
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.660
It's real as fuck.
So that'd be funny.
In fact,
on how will they do the job.

428
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:40.570
So that's,
that's,
that's fine.

429
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.460
And it's [inaudible] nomination.

430
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.730
What has gotten us to this recession?

431
00:25:48.731 --> 00:25:51.760
So we just have to keep that in mind that the Mitt started the recession.

432
00:25:51.761 --> 00:25:56.650
And how did it,
how to demand personally start the recession?

433
00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:02.320
Good question.
Good question.
Irresponsible spending.
Um,

434
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.810
um,
record cuts to education.
Um,
the um,

435
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.970
supporting the um,
Bush tax plan and

436
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:19.210
um,
mismanagement of the federal resources.
Um,

437
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.630
look at,
um,

438
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:27.970
the royals in the release that I'm just out and the wars and managed,
um,

439
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.680
in Iraq and Afghanistan.
And um,

440
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.790
so we just see this irresponsible spending in this mismanagement of government

441
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:41.020
resources,
federal government and,
and just mismanagement of resources.
It's,

442
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.770
it's destroyed this country and I see that he's responsible for,

443
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.750
and that's fat Internet started the recession.

444
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.070
He's responsible for the recession and it doesn't make any sense then someone

445
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:57.720
back to Washington and just messing things up every day.
Well,
I gotta tell you,

446
00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.390
I don't think Jim dement personally started the recession,

447
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:05.040
but I do think Alvin Green still better than Jim dement.

448
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.760
Alvin Green,
Democratic candidate set for Senate for South Carolina.

449
00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:10.980
Thanks for joining.
He said he thinks he's better.

450
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.410
He's charming jr I'm guessing,
right?

451
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:20.260
<v 2>They ever do not know they did that.
Dudes do that.
What did you say?</v>

452
00:27:20.261 --> 00:27:22.760
I think you're better.
I like you better,
obviously.

453
00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.900
Probably if you hate somebody like anyone's better than this guy,

454
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.410
so anyone's better than the other guy.
The other guys are that bad,
I guess.

455
00:27:29.411 --> 00:27:33.910
I guess this dementia real asshole.
Wow.
Dement you might've fucked up,
son.

456
00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:39.130
If this guy beats you.
This guy just gets all the way through.
Fuck.

457
00:27:39.131 --> 00:27:42.190
We don't know man.
She know.
That's what I've always said about Sarah Pailin.

458
00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.820
When you know people talk about Sarah Palin stupid.
I'm like,
she's stupid to you.

459
00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.790
Okay,
but if you're stupid than her,
you don't even know she's stupid.
And there's,

460
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.330
and there's a lot of people that are stupider than her.

461
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.300
Most people I think are stupid or than her.
It's like,

462
00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:59.000
how many people are stupid than this guy?
This is the big question,
right?

463
00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.930
Because if they are stupid than this guy and they've got to go for him.

464
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:07.120
I liked that boy,
that boy,
I speak the truth.
I won't go NASCAR.

465
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:11.670
That boy.
Yeah.
It's like no,
those people guy man.
Okay,

466
00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.580
what guy am a boy?
Yeah,
but those people that Nascar people,

467
00:28:15.581 --> 00:28:17.590
I think those are white people.
I think that's a different thing.

468
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:21.700
Is there a lot of,
well,
we'll Dale Wright who's black is a NASCAR fan.
Really?

469
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.930
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Daryl Daryl loves NASCAR.
Weird.

470
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.030
You don't usually see that south park at it.

471
00:28:28.031 --> 00:28:31.420
Their last episode is all about Nascar and that the stipulation was that like

472
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:35.020
any to be getting a NASCAR you have to be poor and dumb.

473
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.480
And that was the whole episode in Cartman's.

474
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.010
Like I could never be a NASCAR driver.
And you're like,

475
00:28:39.011 --> 00:28:41.740
you could do anything you want to.
He goes,
no,
I'm not pouring down.

476
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.910
So it takes to start to taking badges hill and eating tons of fat.

477
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.660
So because this is slight memory loss,
you know,

478
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.470
it's one of the things to just fucking taking
seven bad.

479
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.730
Oh my God,

480
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.000
I've got to check out south park studios.com still to try to get dumber.
Yeah,

481
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.330
those guys are brilliant.
Yeah.
South Park Studios.
God,
they're alive.

482
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:04.210
Thank God they exist because of terrible didn't exist.

483
00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:08.650
There'd be nothing like this week,
this week's about a jersey shore.
Oh,

484
00:29:08.651 --> 00:29:12.430
I can't fucking wait.
Oh,
I watched a whole episode the other day.

485
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.910
You know if Jersey shore still have never watched a whole episode,

486
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.720
I watched the whole episode.
Wow.
I was like,
this is fucking fascinating.

487
00:29:19.721 --> 00:29:22.030
This is wild kingdom.
That's what this is.

488
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.110
This is just like watching wild kingdom.
I hate that shit.
I can't even get it.

489
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.910
Watch more than five minutes of that show.
Fascinating.
It's fascinating.

490
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.340
Can't help it.
It is.
What book?
What is the reason though?

491
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.640
Why do we fucking get glued to train wrecks?
You know,

492
00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:40.410
like why is like the flavor flave show whenever we had those girls who are

493
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.510
trying to marry,
right,

494
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.510
<v 0>or Brett Rogers,
you know,
watching the poisoned dude,
I'll know the bus of love.</v>

495
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:47.170
Right?

496
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.380
What the fuck is it about those shows that would just suck up all your time.

497
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.670
There's,
they just fixate.

498
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.390
You just keep getting completely fixated on these idiots in their lives.

499
00:29:55.391 --> 00:29:58.000
The problem though is a of those shows that even the Bret Michaels one had been

500
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:02.890
told is completely fake.
These,
they set it up and there's even a channel,
right?

501
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.001
Bret Michaels,

502
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:06.670
like married or something that he has a person that lives with him.

503
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.640
I don't know if he's married or it's just as longterm girlfriend that lives in

504
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:13.120
the house that they had the show on.
So this is all,
it's all just all fake.

505
00:30:13.121 --> 00:30:16.340
A plot.
Totally.
It's like a reality sitcoms.

506
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.260
It's gotten so bad that there's actually a channel now called Tru TV,

507
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.590
which even has the word true in it and all their fucking shows are fake.

508
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.320
Like there's one about,
uh,
what's that?
Where you pawn shop,
a pawn shop,

509
00:30:27.321 --> 00:30:29.710
something pawnshop wars show is fake.

510
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.770
Then there's one about guys that take cars when you owe money on a car,
a,

511
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.880
what's that called?
A repo man repellent.

512
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.530
It's like a repo man show and like they always get in fights,

513
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:42.820
but if you watch it every time they can fight.
Not One punch.
It's always pushing,

514
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.320
hugging,
grabbing,
throw.
No punches are thrown and it's like,
come on.

515
00:30:47.321 --> 00:30:48.860
Just total horseshit,
total horseshit.

516
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.910
You could smell the acting with these guys too.
When you watch it,

517
00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:55.510
it's just pure acting,
so all these reality shows aren't really reality.

518
00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.820
They're not anymore,
man.
It's crazy.
Even there's,

519
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:00.880
you know what it is that is that production.
Like people get in say,
listen,

520
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:02.650
there's only one way to make this work.
Okay,

521
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.590
we can't just follow you around while you go to the mall.
Right?

522
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.790
You have to make things happen.
Okay?
We have to create some drama.

523
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:08.400
Do understand this.
There's an art to this.
Okay,

524
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.230
sit down and then they get them into some fucking conversation.

525
00:31:11.231 --> 00:31:12.064
This is what we're going to do.

526
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.070
Like I remember Duncan was involved in the Polish shore one,

527
00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.940
the the one that we're doing in mind.
Finding stories create things like,

528
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:19.970
like this is what you're going to do.

529
00:31:19.971 --> 00:31:22.270
You're going to go out and you going to try and get all these different foods

530
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:24.550
for lunch and eventually going to get Mexican food.

531
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:27.310
Everything's going to go wrong.
Then you can get Mexican food.
Well,
it's the,

532
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.240
I think the simple thing is,

533
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:31.540
is that you have to do that because unless you had something like where we went

534
00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:31.990
to,

535
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:36.940
like I used to film you every single weekend for three days in a row on tons of

536
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.600
hours of video.

537
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.370
Every couple months we'd get like this really cool 10 minutes or something.

538
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.000
Exactly.
You can,

539
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:45.270
you can't have every reality show and just like an hour every week.

540
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.350
This is not going to be that.
You know what happened?
Oh we had a show.

541
00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:50.830
It was really good.
And then we've got some neat,
then we went to sleep,
right?

542
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.380
Cause that happens and look,

543
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.810
oh and then we played pool and Brian got bored and we went to sleep.
Right.

544
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.251
You look at the hills.

545
00:31:57.251 --> 00:31:59.890
I mean look how successful the hills is and that's completely scripted.

546
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:03.640
There's even now there's a whatever,
16 and pregnant and teen mom and stuff.

547
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.160
And I always thought that was real.
I'm not 100% on this,

548
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:07.770
but I watched it the other day and night.

549
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.090
But I imagine the formula of the hills in it.

550
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:14.020
It's just like the fucking hills with teen moms and babies.

551
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.160
And I almost want to think that that shit is all completely famous.

552
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.400
Here's my problem with any teen mom show is that if you have a show where you

553
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:24.070
have some girl and she goes on and you know,

554
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:27.040
and she talks about how you know she doesn't want to give up her baby and she

555
00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:31.390
was like 16 or 17 years old and just I'm going to do the best I can and you
know,

556
00:32:31.391 --> 00:32:34.750
together we're going to be fine.
And then you have people going,
you're so strong.

557
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.020
I'm amazed at you.
I'm so proud of you and this girls on TV.

558
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.100
Do you know how many girls are going to get pregnant because they want to be

559
00:32:40.101 --> 00:32:43.670
like that girl.
That's real.
Totally,
totally.

560
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.360
I mean this girl was irresponsible.
Yeah.
It's,
you know,
for people magazine,
these,

561
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:50.900
that teen mom,
girl,
if you,
you should have something like that.

562
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:52.850
If you want to do something like that responsibly,

563
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.350
you should do it in like a DVD.

564
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.220
You want to do like a documentary on teen moms where you haven't,
you know,

565
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.040
you see this is what it's like.
It's very difficult and now you say,

566
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:05.140
but to have it on a TV show,
the problem,
the TV shows,

567
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.490
then it's on all the time they're on every week.

568
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:11.120
It becomes a part of your like programming.
You know when you find a show,

569
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:14.060
like whatever it is,
Dexter,
whatever it is you get into,
it's like,
oh,

570
00:33:14.061 --> 00:33:16.700
it's fucking Monday night.
It's time for my show.
It's Tuesday night.

571
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:18.680
It's time for my show.
Right.
You get excited.
You know,

572
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:19.850
you get like into a little rhythm.

573
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.060
If you're getting into a rhythm with this fucking teen pregnancy thing and

574
00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:26.810
you're 15 and you want to be special and you want to be like these girls that

575
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:28.010
are getting all this attention for,

576
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.880
for being strong and having their babies and showing how hard it is and see all

577
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:35.500
the drama and all the,
you know,
come on man,
what the fuck is that?
Yeah,

578
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.860
it's fucking crazy.
It's weird if you look at what your own TV shows,
because I'm,

579
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.240
I,
I'm addicted all the time.

580
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:43.310
Like I got to think they did that little midget show.
I'm like,

581
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:44.500
why the fuck am I care about?

582
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.350
Is a little midget shows small world are not smelling real.
But,
uh,

583
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.050
the one with the dad and the wife and they have all the kids and I've seen the

584
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.140
ads,
but I've never seen a show big people little road or something like that.

585
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.320
I mean,
it's obviously,
I'm sure it's a very challenging thing to be like that,

586
00:33:57.321 --> 00:34:00.530
but you know,
have you heard that the show,
what is it,

587
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.760
19 and counting or 21 and counting?
No,
this is a show where the,
this is,

588
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:08.570
this husband and wife have like 19 kids are 21 kids and they all are

589
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:11.560
homeschooled and stuff like that.
And they,
uh,

590
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.940
the whole show is based on it and the,

591
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.250
the title of the show actually goes up every couple of years because they have

592
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.080
new babies.
Like they just had a new ones.

593
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:21.200
They changed the title of this show to like 21 in county.
Oh,
right.
Okay.

594
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:24.110
I know you're talking about this family is so fucking crazy.
I mean,

595
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.930
they're positive,
nice people.
So I don't want to bash your super nice.
Yeah,
yeah,

596
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:30.140
yeah.
But it's so crazy.
They won't let their kids outside wearing shorts.

597
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.030
Like you can't like have really religious.
Yeah.

598
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:36.140
Like you can't show like parts of your skin and stuff like that.
Sure.

599
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.520
About that 100% survey.
I,

600
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.770
that's one of those shows that got addicted to watching cause I liked the

601
00:34:39.771 --> 00:34:43.860
positive vibe of the show.
So they're Super Christian.
What are they?

602
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.690
Super Christian.
Super Christian.
Yeah,
the worst kind.

603
00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:49.820
They seem really happy though.
You know,
it's like,

604
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.580
I understand that it's what they're doing as loony,
but,

605
00:34:52.581 --> 00:34:54.280
and I understand that it's like a type of program,

606
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.710
but even when you get like you watch like real Super Christian programming and

607
00:34:57.711 --> 00:35:01.070
action,
like the real shit,
I gotta go,
wow,
look how positive it is.

608
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:06.290
You know?
I mean,
look,
I mean,
they're fucking,
they're making babies.

609
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.860
You know,
there's a lot of people that haven't fucked her wife 19 times ever.

610
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.920
Totally.
This guy's got 19 babies.
Right.
You know,
I mean for real,

611
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.280
there's one way of looking at it like that.
You could look at it like,
you know,

612
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.560
religion is just some sort of a way to stay sane,

613
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.500
like some sort of a path that you can follow.
Some people need it.

614
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.430
I think some people do.
I Dunno man.

615
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.300
19 kids is a motherfucker famous for that though.
You know?
I mean,

616
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:31.820
did they do drama in their shell?
Do they create fake drama?
Yeah,

617
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:32.481
it's totally fake.

618
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:35.210
Like it's not fake to the point where they're telling like acting.

619
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:38.130
It's for like today we're going to go riding here.
Like,

620
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.970
<v 5>you know,
create events,
create reality.
Yeah.</v>

621
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.970
Well that's kind of reasonable.
As long as it's not scripted.

622
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.180
I don't mind if they give them things to do,
you know?

623
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.420
But I don't want to watch you just cause you have a bunch of kids,
you know?
Yeah.

624
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:53.640
I'm sure it sucks.
It looks like it's crazy.

625
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.830
Like I used to watch John and Kate plus eight.
You know what?

626
00:35:55.831 --> 00:35:58.530
I would think there's fucking eight kids that aren't getting enough attention.

627
00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.910
You know?
That's what I would think.
I would get sad.
I was like,
you know what,

628
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.060
it should be like,
you know,

629
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:05.790
daddy should be able to spend some time just with you.
You know,

630
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:09.060
mommy should be able to spend some time just with you and when there's fucking

631
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:11.370
seven other kids around all the time screaming at Goggin,

632
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.520
how often do you ever get to sit on your mom's lap or what do you get a once

633
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:17.850
every five minutes.
You know,
they,
they switch people.
What do they do?

634
00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.950
You get a four minute spot on mom's lap.
Yeah.

635
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:23.610
What do you have to like reserve like laying on the couch with your dad,

636
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:27.930
like watching TV for you to go to the iPhone genius store.

637
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.380
Genius counter and you have to give your name up when you want to get your

638
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:35.040
iPhone fixed.
Like what?
I have to make an appointment.
Can you just fix this?

639
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.610
That would suck.
It is.
Yeah man,
it's gotta be brutal.

640
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.830
It's gotta be hard for those kids.
It's cool.
I mean,

641
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:46.010
and much harder that they were publicly humiliated.
Like they,
they,

642
00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.600
they were all together as this family and everybody's happy.

643
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:50.100
And then all of a sudden,
boom,

644
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.660
there's pictures of daddy with another girl and these magazines and daddy's gone

645
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.820
and daddy doesn't live in mom and yard and boom.

646
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:01.500
Now Mommy goes to California and she's on some fucking crazy dancing show,

647
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.500
you know,
and she's not home for like two months.
You know?

648
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.950
Why is everyone making fun of my dad's clothes?
Fucking,
you know,

649
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:11.370
they're just constantly just needy.
It's sad.

650
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:14.700
Kate plus eight now that's another name I was at the new show that's changed the

651
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:18.270
name,
does he?
He's not in it at all anymore,
I think.

652
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.530
I think he's like a bartender at the Applebee's now.
They shut him down,
man.

653
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.700
It's crazy that he was going to try to say that he didn't want his kids on the

654
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:30.350
show.
It's really quite tragic.
Like if you look at that,
the,

655
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:35.370
the whole story of them getting on that show,
their marriage,

656
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.550
you know,
the whole deal.
It's really tragic.

657
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.070
It's very tragic on him from his point of view.

658
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:45.510
It would be a fascinating fucking movie if he got real with everybody about what

659
00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:50.370
it was like.
Because when,
when people first saw on the show,
like when I saw the,

660
00:37:50.371 --> 00:37:52.170
uh,
the very first episode,
I only watched,

661
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.710
I think the first one was like a special and then it was so well received,

662
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:59.980
they decided to do a series.
Um,
and so they're,
they're,
you know,

663
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.870
they're together and you know,
she's this giant stomach and I mean it's crazy.

664
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:06.060
It looks like some sort of an animal's inside of her.

665
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.650
I mean she had like six babies in there.
I mean,
it's just enormous,
insane.

666
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.510
And when they showed them my taking care of the kids and everybody,

667
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.330
she's like always bitching at him.
Like,
oh,
always yapping at them.
Always done.

668
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:23.130
Well,
she's just conti.
She can't even help it.
Like with the camera's on,

669
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:24.240
it's just like,
whoa.

670
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.980
And I think that's so many fucking chicks must've seen that guy just seeing them

671
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:33.210
on TV and saw how she's treating him and must've been like,
you know,

672
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.920
I think it's bullshit the way she treats you.

673
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.300
<v 0>I think you're really awesome.
I love the way you are with your kids.</v>

674
00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:43.900
And I would never cheat you that way.
Well,
you know what,
me and my wife,
it's a,

675
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:45.340
it's not really working out so good right now.

676
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.870
And next thing you know he's making out with her at a bar and get all sloppy

677
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:54.160
cigarette phase on her.
Oh,
the guy just started bawling,
man.

678
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.940
He was just like Chubby half Asian,
goofy looking dude.
You know,

679
00:38:57.941 --> 00:39:01.510
it wasn't very handsome.
Wasn't ever too on top of that,

680
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.770
we went straight ed hardy out of box once,
once the show became successful,

681
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.520
he went crazy at hardy or it was like,
come on,
I get it.
I get it.

682
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:10.690
The companion to wear the clothes,

683
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.430
you can wear something else every now and then.

684
00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:17.020
Do they have Ed ed hardy water at my time at the store by my house.

685
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.680
And I'm just thinking like,
I hoped ed hardy dunked his balls and every bottle

686
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.570
bucks.
If you go out of your way to buy Ed hardy bought her.

687
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:30.520
I hope you're getting the salt from his sack is dipped into every fucking
bottle.

688
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:32.860
Can you imagine if you only drink ed hardy water?

689
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:36.040
Like he really were that big of a fans.
You remember?
Um,

690
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:40.720
what was that other brand?
Von Dutch.
Remember von Dutch Douche.
You remember that?

691
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.690
That was like the Ed hardy of the,
well,
the Ed hardy is the Ed Hardy,

692
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.300
the past and Hardee's gone right.
Pretty much gone.

693
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.340
They still have ed hardy stores though.
Yeah,

694
00:39:48.341 --> 00:39:51.010
but people aren't really into it anymore.
It's like von Dutch.
It's like,

695
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:54.490
it's like this burst that just got an,
everybody's facing him like,
yeah.

696
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.040
It's like everybody gets excited and yeah,

697
00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:01.060
it's a weird thing about like really trendy things like that.

698
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:01.990
Like the von Dutch thing.

699
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:06.880
To me it was very strange because people just love this logo that just says von

700
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.720
Dutch.
And they would wear it and I would be like,
okay,
I get it.
Sort of like,

701
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:14.290
what is it?
Is it looked cool?
Does it look old?
Tiny?
Like what is it?

702
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.800
What is it about that logo that makes you want to advertise this person's

703
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:20.980
clothing company?
You're just wearing a regular shirt.
It's just a shirt.

704
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:25.000
It says von Dutch on it.
Like in this like big,
you know,

705
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:29.440
it's like proclaiming von Dutch,
right?
Like this is weird.
And the hats.

706
00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:32.300
Everybody was wearing these trucker hats at set on it.
I'm like,
I don't,
I'm,
I'm,

707
00:40:32.301 --> 00:40:34.950
I'm missing something here.
Like,
what do you,
why is,

708
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.740
why are people fixating on a logo?
And I,
I look that old navy,

709
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:41.950
remember when old navy first hit the street and everyone's like old navy and now

710
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:42.760
it's embarrassing.

711
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.650
Can you imagine being wearing an old navy shirt to weigh in at the UFC?
Oh,

712
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.500
the bad.
You can't work this old navy really big.
Oh,
well.
Like I never wore those,

713
00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:53.230
but yeah,
I know what you're talking about.
Like a logo shirt.
Yeah.

714
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.290
Gap was another one word.
Like skin,
cause I,
you know,
yeah.

715
00:40:56.291 --> 00:41:00.360
But that's cooler than fall into the gap with me.
You know,
logo.
I'll allow,

716
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.680
it wasn't under,
I don't think I'd wear a gap logo either.

717
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.990
I only wear logos if it's like dudes,
I know their shirt companies or something.

718
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.490
Chicken.
Oh,
higher dash primate is open.
Um,
and they're,
they're uh,
yeah,

719
00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:14.690
I got 'em during the,
of the room there.
I don't have,

720
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.640
I should've brought them out for the podcast man.
Totally.
But,
uh,
so that uh,

721
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.280
it's higher dash primate,
is that what it is?
Yeah,

722
00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.860
higher dash a in the Middle Dash I believe.

723
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:25.660
It's not one of those underscore dashes.

724
00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:30.610
If it's a regular-higher-primate.com.
And this is my,

725
00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:33.980
a clothing company.
You know what my favorite one is?
What?
It's the

726
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.270
<v 2>one with the face that looks like,
uh,
like something crazy.</v>

727
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.770
Tron type video game.
I don't know if you know which one I'm talking about.
Oh,

728
00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:45.380
the the crazy monkey.
Yeah.
It's hired-primate.com.

729
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:50.110
And it's all like psychedelic inspired monkey stuff.
Yeah,
it's complicated.

730
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:54.980
That's the one I like,
which is what fascinates me more than anything.

731
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.770
Psychedelics and monkeys or I like the art.
Yeah.

732
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:01.640
It's the guys who did it or fucking Badass.
They did an awesome job.

733
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.550
They put together site too.
It's pretty sweet.

734
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.510
I wonder who these people are that are modeling your shirts though.
Freaks.

735
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:11.180
Freaks are crazy.
Tattoos.
That's what I like.
I told him,

736
00:42:11.181 --> 00:42:13.340
get somebody that looks like someone I would hang out with.

737
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.060
His dirty bitch would have crazy tattoos.
I bet she's got some good stories.

738
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.100
Yeah,
but people like shit on them,
like on the underground,

739
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:26.750
like pupil or lose fucking Fergie fucking to twos.
His troops go loner.

740
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:30.200
Eh?
People are so negative,
man.
People are negative.

741
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.200
I've been experiencing much more negativity lately.

742
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:36.890
I think something's going on really.
I think there's a shift in the access.

743
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.290
I think the earth is going through a change.
Brian,

744
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.760
I think that's what 2012 is all about.
It's all happening right now.

745
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.640
I've been hanging out with happy people lately and it's just happy and life has

746
00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:50.330
had the best mum.
The people I've been hanging around with,
I've been very happy,

747
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:54.260
but I've been noticing a lot more negativity online.
Oh yeah.
It's a lot of,

748
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.050
a lot of angry cut faces online.
Totally.

749
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:02.360
It's a unnecessary folks.
I'm those teacher gym.

750
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.690
There's teachers that you made,
I know they're going to make more,

751
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.630
or is this just like a.
Dot.
Yeah,
we're selling them now.

752
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:12.410
Let's go her clothing line.
Cool.
I'm a businessman now,
Brian.
That's cool.

753
00:43:12.411 --> 00:43:14.000
I'm be involved in business.

754
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.160
I've already sold hundreds and I haven't even advertised hundreds.
I tell you.
Oh,

755
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:21.830
we shouldn't bring up Nick squirts and has a show coming out tonight.

756
00:43:21.831 --> 00:43:24.410
That's hilarious.
You've got to check out loud with your friends are in it.

757
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.220
Nick Swardson's brilliant.
He's,
he's a great guy too.
And uh,

758
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.170
what's the show called?
Nick's silly.

759
00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:34.650
What a play time I played to something like that.
Yeah.
Something in time.

760
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:39.560
How tell Nick Swardson Nick Swardson.
I love that dude.
They have this one skit.

761
00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:43.610
It's all about a cat that was in,
that's in a wheelchair.

762
00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:47.160
It's called trust fund and Katie and he's just like,
uh,

763
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.300
what's that guy's name with that has the robot voice that Stephen Hawking,

764
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.080
Stephen Hawking style where he has like,
hello,
how you doing and stuff like that.

765
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:58.150
And it's Nick Swardson doing that.
Fucking strange.
I,
yeah.
Pretend Times.
Wait,

766
00:43:58.151 --> 00:44:02.300
it's called next worth and pretend time.
That sounds like a good idea.
Yeah.

767
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.540
For him.
That's a fun vehicle.
He actually has been busy as fuck.

768
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.770
I think he found like four movies this year.
So bad mother fucker.
Yeah,

769
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.770
he's a bad motherfucker.
He's a good dude too.
He's a great guy to hang out with.

770
00:44:12.771 --> 00:44:16.940
He's a lot of fun.
Um,
so,
uh,
here's another thing that I want to talk about.

771
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:21.941
There's this guy got busted in Ohio and he's a tea party candidate and uh,

772
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:28.110
it turns out homeboy likes to trust up like a Nazi.
Um,
it's,
uh,

773
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.030
he's,
uh,
it's described as millionaire rich IOD,
a tea party back candidate.

774
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.160
He's been outed as a war,
an actor,

775
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.590
and he plays a part of a Nazi and he's been doing it for years.
And,
uh,

776
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.370
he takes his son and he and his son dressed up like Nazis.

777
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.770
Why listen.
And they,
uh,

778
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:51.390
they call them on it on CNN and when they call it on the,
they call them on it,

779
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:56.260
he,
uh,
he is very nervous.
It's very obvious that he's nervous,
right?

780
00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:00.240
And it's very obvious that he's trying to like make paint this in the best light

781
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:03.000
possible.
But there's something wrong with this dude to,
okay,

782
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:03.900
I'm going to play this.
Okay.

783
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:08.440
<v 8>Ohio Republicans learn something new about one of their congressional
candidates.</v>

784
00:45:08.441 --> 00:45:11.860
He has had a habit of dressing up as a Nazi.

785
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:16.240
This is handled hobby.
And third from the left,

786
00:45:16.241 --> 00:45:18.730
you can count over with me.
His name is rich [inaudible].

787
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:23.350
He's running in Ohio's ninth congressional district and this Nazi thing,

788
00:45:23.351 --> 00:45:25.810
not something he mentions on his website.

789
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.190
We checked it Lennik monthly reports that I,
it has done this for years.

790
00:45:30.191 --> 00:45:35.191
Dress as a member of the Waffen s s and take part in Nazi reenactments.

791
00:45:36.101 --> 00:45:38.620
I Republican rich IUT.
Good enough to join me.

792
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.850
I have to get the story straight from him.
Uh,
here in Toledo.
Mr [inaudible],

793
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:47.820
thanks for coming on.
Let's get straight out of the gate here,
sir.
Let me,

794
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.080
why Indian dress up as a nice evening?
Like a white haired Indian?
Yeah.

795
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.520
<v 9>Well,
you know,
for years,
going back to my college days,</v>

796
00:45:56.521 --> 00:46:00.910
I got involved in historical reenacting a doing civil war and I,

797
00:46:00.911 --> 00:46:04.260
over the years I've done a civil war,
first world war,

798
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.810
Second World War and both sides,
uh,
you know,
union and confederate and,

799
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.320
and Ben Involved,
uh,
uh,
on both sides in historical reenactments.

800
00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:16.940
Now the purpose of historical reenactment is,
uh,

801
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.580
is not to glorify war necessarily or the size.

802
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:23.300
What is to to educate people to learn about,
uh,

803
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:26.970
what happened and to keep those memories alive so that we don't,

804
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.110
we don't let it happen again.

805
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.350
<v 8>Now let me interrupt you.
I know I was interrupting.
The reason</v>

806
00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.630
<v 2>I would tell him,
dude,
you've got a weak voice,
son.
Yeah,
it's seriously,</v>

807
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.110
what's wrong with just pictures of Hitler in reading about Hitler?

808
00:46:38.111 --> 00:46:39.850
Why do you have to reenact it?
You know,
like,
yeah,

809
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.940
it's not that we're going to forget.
You're gonna like the way you talk either.

810
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:46.270
You don't talk very confidently,
sir.
You don't talk like a man,
right?

811
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.670
You talk about a week,
bitch,
we have Schindler's list.

812
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.370
Why don't you just let somebody watch it?
If they,
if they start forgetting,

813
00:46:51.371 --> 00:46:52.550
just put it on center's list.
Eric,

814
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.990
you remembered while I've been involved in reenactment,

815
00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.880
I just picture him with black socks on and nothing else holding his dick in his

816
00:47:00.881 --> 00:47:04.630
hand doing something crazy.
Guys that do reenactments,
just gay hunters,

817
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:08.260
gay hunters.
How's that work?
You know,
like,
like the civil war guys.

818
00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:10.460
Like what do they do?
Like the gay ones,
like rent,

819
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.020
do reenactments or who does these reenactments?
That gay people.

820
00:47:14.021 --> 00:47:16.810
It's just people who are worn nuts.
What do you think,
why do you think the gay,

821
00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.010
cause they're dressing,
they're,
yeah,

822
00:47:18.011 --> 00:47:20.660
they're just an up and makeup and stuff like that.
Or Hey,

823
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.460
let's all right this time,
let's go around this side and go,
that's,

824
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:26.530
that is kind of funny that they do wear the outfits and everything.

825
00:47:26.531 --> 00:47:30.040
They get so silly.
They bring their,
their like,
like actual,

826
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.830
<v 0>like,
oh,
this is a powder bag that they would have used.</v>

827
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:37.290
And he's so actual dimensions.
I sewed it myself.
Yeah.
I see.
There's sewing shit.

828
00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.430
I made sure I got it.
Only with the natural leather.

829
00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:41.650
A lot of times a you'd want to use chemically treated leather,

830
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:43.600
but that won't be authentic.
Exactly.

831
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.860
They're wearing wigs and fucking sewing and hanging out in the middle of a

832
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:50.010
forest re playing play reality.

833
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.350
I can understand being fascinated by history.

834
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:56.560
I've had a bunch of friends that were history majors in college and you know,

835
00:47:56.561 --> 00:48:00.940
and they uh,
they get into like,
you know,
errors,
you know,

836
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:03.970
like some people are Greek history and it's fascinating history man.

837
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.190
A lot of crazy shit went down.
You know,

838
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:08.930
it's really interesting stuff to think that this was like,
you know,

839
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.920
civilization being born.
But getting into it,

840
00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:14.830
I totally understand getting into the civil war,
it's fucking fascinating,

841
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.640
but dressing up and acting it out.
What's that all about?

842
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.480
Gay Hunters.
What is that all about?
And this is what we did.

843
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.850
Maybe you're doing it for your kids so they could see,

844
00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:28.190
well this is what it must've been like back then.
Call it.

845
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.330
It's called call of duty.
Let the kid play call of duty.

846
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:35.350
So what the fuck people are all fallen down holding on to their chest and shit.

847
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:38.050
How nutty is it that America likes to fight so much?

848
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.390
We've only been around for like a couple of hundred years.

849
00:48:40.391 --> 00:48:45.340
We've already fought ourselves,
you know,
that's how fucked up we are.

850
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:49.450
We have only been around for like 250 years or something.

851
00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:51.730
Not even what was 1776 come on man.

852
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:56.710
We've been around for that long and we've very far so
that's funny.

853
00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.760
We're fucking,
we're constantly are still fighting ourselves with shit.
Oh,

854
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:03.820
there's tea party bullshit.
I don't even know what they want.

855
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.810
I hate them because I hear them all the time and I see him in interviews.

856
00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:10.360
I don't even want to know their position.
I think you're all cunts.

857
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.380
Where did these guys come from?

858
00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:14.470
I haven't heard about the tea party since like elementary school.

859
00:49:14.471 --> 00:49:17.230
Like people who don't like black people.
That's really what it is.

860
00:49:17.231 --> 00:49:20.230
They don't want a black guy at office.
They're freaking the fuck out.
Look,

861
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:23.980
there's a bunch of extenuating circumstances as to why this economy is fucked up

862
00:49:23.981 --> 00:49:27.640
and Obama is not there to blame nor to,
you know,

863
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.960
he's not like he's a one part of a giant fucked up system,
you know?

864
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:35.140
And yeah,
he's not doing a perfect job,
but who the fuck would,

865
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:39.010
this economy is fucked.
There's a lot of crazy shit going on.

866
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.670
They got got into officer's two wars going on.
I don't understand it.

867
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.430
None of it makes sense to me.
It's all chaos and you know,

868
00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:48.820
people like he's not qualified and he wasn't even born here and blah blah blah

869
00:49:48.821 --> 00:49:50.350
blah blah.
They talk on this crazy shit about it.

870
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:55.120
But the bottom line is nobody can handle this.
Who the fucking handle this.

871
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:55.361
You know,

872
00:49:55.361 --> 00:49:58.750
they think someone's going to come in and fix this and having like this idea

873
00:49:58.751 --> 00:50:03.260
that they're gonna like take back all these,
you know,
these,
these tax cuts and,

874
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.850
and and,
and start like ta one of their,
they start trying to do,

875
00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:11.170
they're trying to like give the middle class a chance to rebound.

876
00:50:11.171 --> 00:50:14.170
That's the idea.
Right?
Is that the idea?
I don't follow this shit.

877
00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:18.640
You're losing that middle ground
because you don't follow it at all.
No,

878
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:23.290
of course not.
I barely follow fucking my favorite TV shows.

879
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.230
Well,
I know that there's a lot of issues about taxes.

880
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:28.100
They definitely feel there's too much taxes and then definitely

881
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.400
<v 5>fillers,</v>

882
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.670
too much spending and it's irresponsible and that's what's caused the economy.

883
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.990
You know,
I don't know if that's true.
You know,
I know that that's a part of it.

884
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:40.280
I know that for sure people being shitty with money has been a problem in all

885
00:50:40.281 --> 00:50:42.770
governments.
It's always,
there was always corruption.

886
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:44.180
There's always money falling up,

887
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:46.670
but that's not exactly why there's economies fucked up.

888
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:49.040
This economy is fucked up cause it was based on bullshit.

889
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:53.060
This economy is fucked up cause there was a gigantic housing bubble that didn't

890
00:50:53.061 --> 00:50:56.030
make any sense.
It's a fucked up cause we don't make anything anymore.

891
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.950
It's fucked up because we're going to Detroit,

892
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.260
we're going to do a UFC in Detroit.

893
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.970
Detroit's like 30 something percent unemployment.

894
00:51:02.971 --> 00:51:06.140
That seems like the scariest UFC in the whole entire world.

895
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.490
Detroit's Grazie we in.
This is what's wrong with the economy.
The United States,

896
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:14.900
you know,
Putin said this once before the economy hit the shitter.
He said,

897
00:51:14.901 --> 00:51:16.610
I don't understand the United States economy.

898
00:51:16.611 --> 00:51:19.160
It seems all they do is buy and sell each other's houses.

899
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.570
So you know all these tea party assholes,
all this crazy,
we're going to do it.

900
00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:29.920
And you know,
we're gonna fucking,
I mean,
I'm not even standing there.

901
00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.170
Their positions,
I don't even know what the positions are.
I know that,
you know,

902
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.950
the whole idea is the same thing as what happened in the tea party of way back

903
00:51:36.951 --> 00:51:40.310
when they want to overthrow the current government.
They want to put,
you know,

904
00:51:40.311 --> 00:51:43.580
a better government in place.
They want to whatever the fuck they want to do.

905
00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:46.280
What do they want to do?
I don't know.
Why are they so concerned about,

906
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:49.610
well anyway,
shit,
whatever the fuck they want to do.
This guy,

907
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.060
this guy wants to be a Nazi.
That's ridiculous.

908
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:56.900
That's let's do more of them because I'm not making any sense.

909
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:58.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

910
00:51:59.460 --> 00:51:59.870
<v 8>I'm wrong.</v>

911
00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:02.990
Part of the reason you chose to do this is more of a teaching moment with your

912
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:07.610
son.
You participating with this group,
this weekend group.
It was also your son.

913
00:52:07.611 --> 00:52:08.444
Is that right?

914
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:10.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

915
00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.270
<v 9>Uh,
that's correct.
We did civil war together and uh,</v>

916
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.580
we also did a World War II redneck.
We're reenacting.
Look at these crazy ass.

917
00:52:17.581 --> 00:52:18.414
All right.
Together.

918
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.950
<v 8>So has your son dressed up as a Nazi in addition to you?</v>

919
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.180
<v 9>Uh,
he's participated as well.
Yes.</v>

920
00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.430
<v 5>Can follow up?
Where were you wearing your hands?
Question or two?</v>

921
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:35.870
<v 8>Let me ask you this.
How do you then explain to your son,</v>

922
00:52:35.871 --> 00:52:38.600
how old was your son when he was dressing up like this?

923
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

924
00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.540
<v 9>Uh,
when he first got involved,
uh,
he was,
uh,
15.</v>

925
00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:47.640
<v 8>So when his team,
and how did you,</v>

926
00:52:47.641 --> 00:52:51.000
and explaining why you would want your son,
um,

927
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:54.720
dressing up in Nazi uniform in ss uniform.

928
00:52:54.721 --> 00:52:57.660
How did you explain Nazi-ism to him

929
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:00.670
<v 9>here you were at Roddy.</v>

930
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:04.770
He from an early age had been interested in history and because I'm a,

931
00:53:04.771 --> 00:53:09.540
I'm very involved in,
in history and I'm teaching history,
uh,
and uh,

932
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:13.790
and learning more about history.
He had always been nervous as fuck and a,

933
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.060
on many,
many occasions we talked about,
you know,

934
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.230
the horrific things that happened during World War II.

935
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:23.710
[inaudible] terrific people.
One of the low points of a,
I think in,

936
00:53:23.711 --> 00:53:26.250
in human history is photos showing of them all dress

937
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.870
<v 2>up as Nazis smiling.</v>

938
00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:33.140
<v 8>Yeah.
Sweep it under the rug with boners.
Did indeed happen.
Uh,
but it was very,</v>

939
00:53:33.141 --> 00:53:35.960
very much a,
we can't sweep it under the rug.
Low Point,

940
00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:37.880
which I think probably many people,

941
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:40.130
many people who know their history would agree with you.

942
00:53:40.131 --> 00:53:43.220
Was there any ever appoint Mr Iot where you said,
hey,

943
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.230
this isn't such a great thing to do.

944
00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:50.090
<v 2>You know what's the best thing?
This chick is hot as fuck.</v>

945
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:53.480
Look at the chick that's asking that question.
We back that up a second.

946
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.520
She's like,
she's like weathermen and La.
Once shit gets down,
she can't.

947
00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:03.400
She's got that hot when you blow the picture up.
Big unregular Ustream.
Ustream,

948
00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:07.520
so she has her skin is so compressed.
See?
Well I think that's just that.

949
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:09.180
<v 8>Okay sir,
you would agree with you.</v>

950
00:54:09.181 --> 00:54:11.500
Was there any ever appoint Mr Iot where you said,

951
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:16.320
<v 2>you know she is hot as fuck,
she's hot as fuck.
Oh yeah.
That was just a bad angle.</v>

952
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.950
Was frozen in a bag.
She seen me,
me,
this is institute.

953
00:54:19.951 --> 00:54:24.630
Great thing you do and she's saying it with this beautiful face about the

954
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:28.110
tragedies happened Dervis years ago.
Creepy in a big closet.

955
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.930
Nazi fog and Ackman is education.

956
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.700
A lot of times if a store or in their pocket,
just that skirt,
that dude's wearing

957
00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:39.350
<v 8>exhibits and giving the public a chance to come in,
ask questions,
uh,
and,</v>

958
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.270
and learn,
learn his,

959
00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:41.810
<v 2>listen,</v>

960
00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:44.780
this certain shit you're allowed to get away with in this life dressing up like

961
00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:47.810
a Nazi ain't one of them.
Or is kilts.

962
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:52.040
I am tired of seeing grown men wearing kilts out at the mall and I am supposed

963
00:54:52.041 --> 00:54:54.920
to just take it as,
oh,
it's a cultural thing.
No,

964
00:54:54.921 --> 00:54:57.980
you look like you're fucking wearing a dress and you should not be wearing what

965
00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:01.070
you care if he's wearing as killed.
I don't care if guys were killed.
Yeah,

966
00:55:01.071 --> 00:55:03.950
but when you're at the mall hanging out,
you know,
I can see where you're like,

967
00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.750
like playing a German bar and you're like,
like,
you know,
singing or something or,

968
00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:12.830
but just walking around a mall,
it could kill you.
Why not?
Because it's a dress,

969
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.860
but it's so what?
Why can't I do wear a dress?
No,
it's fine,

970
00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:20.620
but just let Julie know that I'm Jewish.
You do.

971
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:25.230
She is [inaudible] because he's not wearing the chose chosen garments,

972
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:30.620
garments to garments.
We all agreed on.
I will allow us Celt.
You will.

973
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.260
I will.
I'll kill.
So you and you would go with on them,

974
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:36.060
you would go to a UFC with a guy wearing a coat.
I don't know if you want,

975
00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.960
if Doug Stan hope wanted to wear a kilt and go to the UFC,
I would go with him.

976
00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:42.790
Okay.
For,
yeah,
for sure.
Any you guys sat next to each other?
Why not?

977
00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:45.160
Who gives a fuck?
It's killed.
Really?
What is it?
Kill.

978
00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:48.230
It's like a dress or would you wear it?
So what's the difference in that?

979
00:55:48.231 --> 00:55:51.060
In shorts,
man.
Would you wear a coat?
I would wear a kilt for why?

980
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:53.590
Would have to do with it?
Yeah.
Wind blows up and then yours.

981
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.000
Everyone see your underwear.
I was,
see my Dick Yo killed.

982
00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.430
You're not supposed to wear underwear.
No.

983
00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:02.360
If you're going to be the fucking man and be walking around with a dress,

984
00:56:02.361 --> 00:56:05.150
you've gotta go.
You gotta frame.
You've got gotta be free.
He just,

985
00:56:05.151 --> 00:56:06.830
there's some things I just don't buy that.

986
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:10.190
But that to me is that like look at me attention to certainly is,
you know,

987
00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:13.640
it's certainly not what I would choose.
I would choose to blend in.
Right.

988
00:56:13.641 --> 00:56:17.570
But you know,
I mean if I had to wear it and wear it,
what'd you wear?
Capris?

989
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.810
What are Capris Capris or where they stay?

990
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:24.130
They go down right below your knee like right here.
Like pants don't fit me dude.

991
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.250
They don't make them my size.
I'm felt like a troll,

992
00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:29.800
male Capris dudes that are built like me.

993
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:34.420
Troll like very chimpanzee.
Like I can't wear skinny jeans out.
Really?

994
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:38.200
They don't fit.
I can't get any of that fit me.
Yeah.
You like those,
Huh?

995
00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:41.260
Skinny jeans.
Now I just try to have genes that make me look skinny.
Now

996
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:46.960
are you still rocking weight watchers?
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.

997
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:51.310
I've been eating Vegan late.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well Deacon Cox,
you sucked today.

998
00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:53.680
The truth.
Not again.

999
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.160
I'm going to get so many emails that are angry at me for two reasons.
For one.

1000
00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:57.941
Does tea party thing,

1001
00:56:57.941 --> 00:57:01.150
cause you don't even know the position you have proven to port?
Of course.
I do.

1002
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.070
You guys have Glenn Beck talking for you.
Okay.

1003
00:57:03.071 --> 00:57:06.310
You guys have fucking Sarah Palin and Glenn back giving big speeches and of

1004
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:08.230
course I have a problem with you.
You sound like idiots,

1005
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:10.180
but I don't know the position.

1006
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.400
I'm not really that interested in to be honest with you.

1007
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.570
So people are going to be upset me about that.
And the Vegan sucking cock thing.

1008
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:20.970
Why?
Cause I'm just joking,
but people are so God damn sensitive.
You know.
Uh,

1009
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.540
somebody sent me an email,
just dude sent me an email,
you know,

1010
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:27.640
about how he was a very upset because uh,
I,
uh,

1011
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:31.470
somehow or another equated vegetarianism to,
uh,
in,

1012
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.830
in quotes faggotry but I don't really mean that,
you know,

1013
00:57:35.831 --> 00:57:38.110
when I say that it's just,
I'm just saying that,
you know,
like you're,

1014
00:57:38.111 --> 00:57:41.050
you're upset enough that you're gonna write something down.
You're a vegetarian.

1015
00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:43.210
You're offended.
I used to be a fan and like,

1016
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:47.090
what are you on team vegetarian set that I'm shitting on vegetables.
Shit.

1017
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.050
Why is that something that's crazy?

1018
00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:53.110
Like I would not be pissed if you hated Lasagna.
Made fun of Lasagna but joking,

1019
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:55.990
you know,
if I say,
you know the,
you know,
you're vegetarian,

1020
00:57:55.991 --> 00:57:58.420
that is sheer faggotry.
Boy,
you need to get a stake in you.

1021
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:02.590
Do you think I really give a fuck what you eat?
Right?
You know,
whatever you want,

1022
00:58:02.591 --> 00:58:06.040
man.
I'm just joking around.
I went on a Vegan kick just because,
uh,

1023
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:07.720
last week that grocery store I went to,

1024
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:11.220
they had New York strips usually for $15 each and I was like once in a while

1025
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.700
treating myself,
I'll go get a steak.

1026
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:17.200
They had this crazy sale like 75% off all their stakes.
That's never good.

1027
00:58:17.201 --> 00:58:18.940
I bought six steaks.

1028
00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:23.690
I fucking had like I had lunch one day and ate steak and then had dinner and

1029
00:58:23.691 --> 00:58:27.400
then create some nuclear meet boy.
I just couldn't get a giant sail.

1030
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:31.300
I murdered animal meat juice.
How much they got leftover.
I don't know man.

1031
00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:33.940
I know it was last week,
but I ate them all.
Is that what you're talking about?

1032
00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:37.040
Yeah.
Do,
do you think something wrong with it?
Maybe it was just no,
no,

1033
00:58:37.041 --> 00:58:38.440
no reason there's no,
no,
not at all.

1034
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:42.250
They just had a crazy say on New York strips so they just had too many of them

1035
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:46.390
and I get,
but at that $15 steak was like $4 so I was like,

1036
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:49.780
I spent 20 bucks,
25 bucks or something ridiculous on state.

1037
00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:51.910
Where the fuck would we be without supermarkets?

1038
00:58:51.911 --> 00:58:55.270
If you ever thought about how difficult it would be to go hunt and get your own

1039
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:59.980
food,
eating so many cats and dogs,
dude you'd have two cats and dogs would be,

1040
00:58:59.981 --> 00:59:03.820
you'd keep them around like like chickens,
you know,
I might have to eat.

1041
00:59:03.821 --> 00:59:07.750
You just stay right here.
You get a lot of meat off of a good dog.
Totally.

1042
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.820
I was looking at this,
it's funny you said that.

1043
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:12.560
I was looking at my dog's leg the other day was I was just like petting a

1044
00:59:12.561 --> 00:59:15.520
stomach and I just started playing with his leg and kind of like massaging his

1045
00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:18.520
leg,
you know,
just a nice dog stuff.
And I looked at his leg and I'm like,

1046
00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:22.220
this looks so much like a chicken leg.
You know,
like if you go to like,

1047
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.890
and I was like,
wait a second,
I'm thinking like Elmer Fudd now,

1048
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:28.660
you know like those old cartoons where they look at it like an animal and then

1049
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:32.180
they turn into a Turkey.
I was doing that with my dog.
I was like,

1050
00:59:32.181 --> 00:59:33.290
what the Fuck's wrong with me?

1051
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:37.070
And the Turkey always had like the bones sticking up out of the legs and there's

1052
00:59:37.071 --> 00:59:39.180
steam coming off of it.
Right?
Yeah.

1053
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:44.090
I guess that's something really funny is we all grew up with those hyper violent

1054
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:47.490
cartoons.
Right?
But today that you,

1055
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.330
you can't make a cartoon like that are so pussy down.

1056
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:53.830
The shit that we used to watch,
like,
like Donald would not know.
Who is it?

1057
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.150
Daffy duck who used to get shot in the face all the time.

1058
00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:00.920
Donald or Daffy daffy duck.
Daffy duck used to get shot in the face all the time.

1059
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:02.210
And it's fucking,
yeah,

1060
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:05.330
he's be could be around the back of his head and he would have to turn it

1061
01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:07.280
towards the front.
And it would be funny.

1062
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.070
It would be funny when you were a little kid.
I loved those shows.

1063
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.200
The fucking road runner and wile e coyote,

1064
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:15.590
Wiley Coyote was always getting fucked up,
dude.

1065
01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.160
He would always try to blow up bridges and shit.
He was a terrorist.

1066
01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.490
That fucking coyote was a terrorist all to get this one bird.

1067
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:27.200
He was dropping anvils but it would always fuck up and crush him always.

1068
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:30.620
And Pepe Le Pew has got laid even though he smelled.
That's true.

1069
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:32.420
Pepe was always hitting it totally.

1070
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.930
It was always sexual deviant that there's like a fucking pervert.

1071
01:00:35.931 --> 01:00:38.750
He was like a little day paper.
French.
It was right.
He wasn't like,

1072
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:40.800
get all up in them and climb all on that.

1073
01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.310
If that was your fucking your cat and you know,
and this,

1074
01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:46.900
this guy is trying to fuck your cat,
that's fucked up.
Well back off,
dude.
Yeah,

1075
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.080
that's wrong.
But you can't have a cartoon like that today.
Any of those cartoons.

1076
01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:53.260
You can't have bugs bunny.
You can't have.
We,
we,

1077
01:00:53.261 --> 01:00:56.870
we've toned back on what we allow kids to watch and see.

1078
01:00:57.050 --> 01:01:01.680
But does anybody really believe that watching daffy duck and shot in the face is

1079
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:02.950
going to make people want,
Oh,
mine.

1080
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.680
Obviously they have because they've edited in censored a lot of those tunes they

1081
01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:09.200
even take it doesn't mean it makes people do things.

1082
01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:11.870
Do you think anybody's ever done but violence because they watched daffy duck?

1083
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:13.370
That's what I'm saying.
Well I think that,
you know,

1084
01:01:13.371 --> 01:01:17.930
they edited out cigars and cigarettes out of the old bugs bunny cartoons and I

1085
01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:21.260
could kind of see that because that's how I learned what a cigarette was back in

1086
01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.140
the dizzy you learned from bugs bunny?
Probably.

1087
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:25.880
That's probably my first introduction to cigarettes.

1088
01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:29.270
Reimagine watch bugs bunny and like nonstop for an,
I was a kid,

1089
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.370
I didn't know bugs bunny smoked a lot of cigarettes.

1090
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.820
They always had cigarettes and gags.
Yeah,
like there was,

1091
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:37.130
I don't know exactly which episodes and stuff like that,

1092
01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:40.640
but there has been sick tons of cigarettes in bugs bunny's and even like that

1093
01:01:40.641 --> 01:01:44.630
one dog,
the bulldog used to always have a cigar and stuff like that.
You know,

1094
01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:48.050
why is it that those cartoons are not offensive?
Even if you watch them now,

1095
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:50.240
like if you watch Donald Duck,
if you're,

1096
01:01:50.241 --> 01:01:53.750
if we're watching a looney tunes cartoon,
it's kind of fun to watch.
Yeah,

1097
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.850
there's still kind of fun to watch.
Right.
You know,

1098
01:01:55.851 --> 01:01:59.180
but like I guess it's cause it's animals,
you know,

1099
01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:02.630
it's not people for them and letting us Elmer Fudd but he wears,

1100
01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:06.050
he got was black face after getting shot and if,
you know what I'm saying is why,

1101
01:02:06.051 --> 01:02:08.930
why are they still entertaining,
you know,
do you think the cartoons of today,

1102
01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:09.930
I mean,
is anybody going to be,

1103
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.040
could it be watching Dora the explorer when they grow up?
I don't know.

1104
01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:15.230
I think it's just because we grew up with it,
you know,

1105
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:18.450
I don't think our kids are going to be as big a bugs bunny fans.

1106
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.540
Are they allowed to show like all those violent ones,

1107
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:24.510
like the end volts falling on people's heads?
Do they show all that stuff?

1108
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.440
It's mostly like the cigars that their cigarettes,
they're taken out.

1109
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:29.430
And when can you watch looney tunes?

1110
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:32.730
Like is it on like cable or something and the cartoon network during the days,

1111
01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.660
stuff like that.
And so they'll play all the violent ones,
gunshots,

1112
01:02:36.661 --> 01:02:37.840
all that crazy shit.
Yeah.

1113
01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:41.400
But they've censored it so much that they definitely have a pilot that they

1114
01:02:41.401 --> 01:02:45.270
choose from,
uh,
in a pilot that they don't really show too much anymore.

1115
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.390
Do you ever see the commercials where Fred Flintstone and Barney rubble or

1116
01:02:48.391 --> 01:02:51.570
sitting around smoking?
Winston's totally.
There's a lot of those commercials.

1117
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:55.980
There's a lot of them.
There's a Winston Winston's,
and it was like,
uh,

1118
01:02:56.010 --> 01:03:00.540
maybe six episodes they did where they used to do commercials.
Like,
Hey Bernie,

1119
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:03.960
is that a Wednesday and ulterior light?
So strange.

1120
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.010
Did you know that they had to take out?

1121
01:03:05.011 --> 01:03:07.800
I don't know if it's just in California near that,
I think,
maybe not.

1122
01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:11.400
But they took lights out a cigarette.
So now there's no more Marlboro lights.

1123
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.870
No more camel lights because they're not allowed to call it lights anymore.
Yeah.

1124
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:17.010
The light thing was ridiculous.

1125
01:03:17.011 --> 01:03:20.040
It's still a fucking cigarettes and now it's like Marlboro silver or something

1126
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:21.180
stupid.
Like,
really?
Yeah.

1127
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.990
So what was the difference in light is that light tar is less strong,

1128
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.890
but there's the,
it was actually just more holes perforation into the filters.

1129
01:03:28.891 --> 01:03:32.880
So what they are saying that you're sucking more air in and it kind of diluted

1130
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:35.720
it.
But the problem is that some everyone smokes different.
So if I,

1131
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:40.410
if I a wigger lipped it,
you know,
like as I'm a white guy,

1132
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.240
if I'm Wingard lifted and covered up all the holes,
uh,

1133
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.790
then in the light part doesn't work,
you know,
so it's the same tobacco,

1134
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.780
same exact cigarette with just more perforation in the filter.
Wait a minute.

1135
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:54.960
Really?
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
How many people buy it?
Like,

1136
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:57.860
cause they just feel like that's,
it's not so bad.
Yeah,
it's nice people.

1137
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:59.550
It's like diet coke.
Yeah,
I do it.

1138
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:03.110
So there's no difference in the amount of nicotine?
Uh,
no.

1139
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.430
Between the light and the regular secrets,
supposedly not.

1140
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.800
Supposedly Tobacco's tobacco is,
I'm not a hundred percent sure,

1141
01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:11.760
but I know that's what made it a light cigarette was the holes,
the perforation.

1142
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:16.290
The scariest thing to me about cigarettes is the 599 different things that

1143
01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:19.410
they've added to tobacco.
The cigarette company,

1144
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:23.790
natural spirits is the one that brought that advertising campaign to it where

1145
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:28.200
they just have this list of every single extra chemicals inside a cigarette and

1146
01:04:28.201 --> 01:04:30.390
they were like,
we only have tobacco period.
You know,

1147
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.940
they don't use chemicals to grow their tobacco.
They do it like that.

1148
01:04:32.941 --> 01:04:36.430
Would you smoke?
That's what I used to smoke when you would say like,
ah,

1149
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:39.470
I'm quitting cigarettes,
you know I'm going to smoke natural spirits instead.

1150
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:42.410
You do smoke less cause they're so strong.
Yeah.

1151
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.970
But the problem I had with it was that after some Megan knows,

1152
01:04:44.971 --> 01:04:49.540
I felt like I was just coughing up black shit like it.
Yeah.

1153
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:54.530
It was just like the 599 chemicals to keep you alive.
They diluted,
you know,

1154
01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:58.080
looks,
if you were smart and you were owning a cigarette company,

1155
01:04:58.081 --> 01:05:01.560
you would want to create cigarettes to keep these fucks alive,
right?
You know,

1156
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:04.430
so some shit that they need,
they're addicted to it.

1157
01:05:04.431 --> 01:05:06.460
We've got a two problems we want to keep alive,
right?

1158
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:09.180
But we want them addicted as fuck.
What can we do?
This is what we got,

1159
01:05:09.181 --> 01:05:11.100
and I got this thing right here.
This is going to preserve them.

1160
01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:13.140
This additive is going to kill the cancer.

1161
01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:15.840
This additive is going to rebuild the tissue surrounding it,
okay?

1162
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:17.980
I'll look at Alicia.
This ad,
it was going to make

1163
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.060
<v 5>it stronger.
It's going to make it bigger.
Nicotine rush,
Edgar detective,</v>

1164
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.320
bigger Dick Filters,
bigger dick filters if you just called it bigger de filters,

1165
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:28.450
right?
Those extends tablets that they sell.

1166
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.780
You know those those tablets or you know,

1167
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:32.500
they have them at the gas station over here,
right?

1168
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.270
You got to get gas and right in front of you is like,

1169
01:05:34.271 --> 01:05:37.600
do you want your Dick Bigger?
That's what it is.
I can fucking still look.

1170
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.730
They don't do anything.
It doesn't do anything.

1171
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:41.980
It's like tribulus and a bunch of other stupid shit,

1172
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.510
but it doesn't make your Dick Bigger.

1173
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:45.490
There's not a Goddamn pilled that makes your Dick Bigger.

1174
01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.990
Makes your eyes smaller.
Oh,
Brian.

1175
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:54.580
Brian,
Brian.
So a California,
um,

1176
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:59.170
the deadline is the 18th,
which is a what is today?
So six days from today,

1177
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:04.620
the deadline is next Monday for a registering to vote in California is going to

1178
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:08.920
be,
they're going to the number one thing for,
you know,

1179
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.720
a lot of people is the legalization of marijuana.
Yeah.

1180
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:17.650
And you could actually registered online to vote for it.
Uh,

1181
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.620
let me see if I can find a website.
Um,

1182
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.310
so you don't even have to leave your house if you need to register.
Is that,

1183
01:06:23.311 --> 01:06:27.280
and this crazy.
Meg Whitman and what's his name?
Brown.

1184
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.710
What the Hell's his name?
Jerry Brown.
Ebay versus,
what is his name?
Jerry Brown.

1185
01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:36.340
Yeah.
You don't even get this fly on go.

1186
01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:40.570
You don't even pretend to give a fuck about politics,
which is hilarious.
Yeah.

1187
01:06:40.571 --> 01:06:44.380
You can just feel like an adult do.
Yeah.
Do you ever feel like an adult?
No.
No.

1188
01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:48.790
I like being as young as possible.
But what happens when you're 50 that's great.

1189
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.220
And you still took like that?
That'd be awesome.
Yeah.

1190
01:06:51.221 --> 01:06:54.670
Jerry Brown was running for president back back in weighing the,

1191
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.510
in the does a back when I was a young lad.
Hmm.
And now,

1192
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.800
and he was at one point in time,
I believe he was governor of California.

1193
01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:07.450
Hmm.
And now he is,
uh,
trying to be governor again,

1194
01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.310
but he's an interesting dude.

1195
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.240
He's a fucking strange guy

1196
01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:19.540
to the website to go to is www dot s o s.
Dot.
C A.
Dot.

1197
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:23.290
G O v Backslash or stop that.
No one's going to remember that shit.

1198
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:27.130
You asshole people trying to,
scrambling to write that shit down.
We'll Google it.

1199
01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:31.720
What are we googling to register to vote online for a prop 19?
Yeah,

1200
01:07:31.721 --> 01:07:33.760
just figure it out,
man.
You can figure it out.
But,

1201
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.900
but do it by Monday if you're in California because you have to vote.
Uh,

1202
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:39.400
you got to do two things.
One.

1203
01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.870
You've got to vote for Jerry Brown because you don't want this crazy meg Whitman

1204
01:07:42.871 --> 01:07:46.210
broad being the governor of California all at all.

1205
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:50.620
<v 10>I mean some salty language in the race phones,
California governor.</v>

1206
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:54.230
It's difficult to hear,
but it's a voicemail recording.
That was really funny.

1207
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.420
Jerry Brown.
Meg Whitman was called a whore clans.
Jerry Brown phone message.

1208
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:03.110
Wow.
Laddering word to describe Republican megabit.
Here.
We can hear you.

1209
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:09.400
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1210
01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:13.110
<v 5>what an</v>

1211
01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:15.980
<v 10>insult to the women of California and insulted the Women in</v>

1212
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.570
<v 5>California.
No,
it's an insult to you.
You fucking whore.
How ridiculous.</v>

1213
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.260
An insult to the women of California and that called her a whore.

1214
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:27.590
It's ridiculous.
How can she stand up for all the women in California?

1215
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.960
Because that's what kind of powers.
Yeah.

1216
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.420
I can't vote for you just based on that alone.
On that alone.

1217
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:36.050
I can see that you're crazy.
That is not an insult to the women of California.

1218
01:08:36.051 --> 01:08:41.000
You're silly that someone called you a whore did cause they think you have very

1219
01:08:41.001 --> 01:08:45.350
Horlick instincts and this Jerry Brown character,
I'm pretty sure he smokes weed.

1220
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:49.640
Yeah,
I'm looking at him.
I don't think he swung suede.
I'm not sure.

1221
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:53.540
It's just guesswork is California.
So that's the only thing I should look at.

1222
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:55.940
Do vote on for whatever the fuck you want.

1223
01:08:55.941 --> 01:09:00.560
But I'm voting for Jerry Brown and I'm voting yes on the weed thing.

1224
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:04.700
Are you really going to routine?
Fuck yeah,
I'm voting on this.
You've added,
yes,

1225
01:09:04.701 --> 01:09:09.170
of course I have.
I think state voting is probably pretty real.
You know,

1226
01:09:09.171 --> 01:09:10.890
I think when you start voting,
you know,

1227
01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:15.560
voting for president and that's when the mad crazy corruption is in place,

1228
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.770
you know?
But I think you could really get things changed in states.

1229
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:21.510
I mean even bad things like the gay marriage thing,
you know,
they,

1230
01:09:21.511 --> 01:09:24.440
they really did get it.
So the gay people couldn't get married anymore.

1231
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.190
I mean they really,
they did it.
They organize,
they put it together and they,

1232
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:31.250
they fixed it.
They changed it in their opinion.
You know,
you can get things done.

1233
01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:34.490
Like marijuana's legal basically in California already.

1234
01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:38.300
Medicus decriminalized at the other day.
That's awesome.
Decriminalize it.

1235
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:40.880
And because it's on the road to to being legal.

1236
01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:42.410
It should have been legal a long time ago.

1237
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:46.000
We don't have to get over this story again.
Uh,
go over the story gala.

1238
01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.070
It's a ridiculous law that doesn't,

1239
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.140
it doesn't make any sense in anybody's fighting against it.

1240
01:09:51.141 --> 01:09:55.070
Like Meg Whitman is meg Whitman broad things that they should shut down all

1241
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:58.040
these medical marijuana dispensary.
Exactly.

1242
01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.510
So I got to vote for you or against you on that too.
You crazy shit.

1243
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.430
One of his girls like who brought that check to the party?
Well,

1244
01:10:04.431 --> 01:10:07.550
she's really rich too.
She had something to do with Ebay,
right?
Yes.

1245
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.780
She so she got that paper and she just want to be running shit.

1246
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.560
She got that paper and she was like,
I'm going to fix the world from my babies.

1247
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:20.270
She's just going to go out there.
She's going to,
we don't need medical marijuana.

1248
01:10:20.271 --> 01:10:21.920
We need hugs in Jesus.

1249
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:27.980
How much money do you have?
High have our billion dollars.

1250
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.660
The most important thing though is if California passes,

1251
01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:37.400
it's medical marijuana law.
Excuse me,
the legalization of marijuana,

1252
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.353
if they pass it,

1253
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.030
what's going to happen is you're going to be able to get pot everywhere in

1254
01:10:41.031 --> 01:10:41.864
California.

1255
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:45.350
It's going to be something where you can get it responsible adults over 21 just

1256
01:10:45.351 --> 01:10:48.380
like drinking,
just like it should be anything else.
You know,

1257
01:10:48.381 --> 01:10:51.020
once you become an adult and you can take responsibility for your own self,

1258
01:10:51.021 --> 01:10:53.270
we hope that you were raised enough so that you can,

1259
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.690
you know well enough rather so you can understand what happens when you have too

1260
01:10:56.691 --> 01:10:59.420
many beers or too much to drink and you know,

1261
01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:04.370
we hope you fucking conduct yourself in a gentlemanly fashion.
You know,

1262
01:11:04.371 --> 01:11:07.190
keep your shit together.
You should be able to do that with pot too.
Yeah,

1263
01:11:07.191 --> 01:11:09.320
there's going to be problems.
It's going to be problems with everything.

1264
01:11:09.321 --> 01:11:12.110
There's problems with Starbucks.
I drive by Starbucks.
I go,
damn,

1265
01:11:12.111 --> 01:11:15.450
I go for coffee right now.
I don't even want a coffee.
I'm not tired.

1266
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.200
There's nothing wrong with me.
But that Shit's addictive.
It's delicious.

1267
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:24.350
I'm going to debt that Burt's deep like hot liquid and you pour the cream in it

1268
01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:30.270
and ah,
no it Tate said best Tait Fletcher.
He goes,
why I get a coffee?

1269
01:11:30.271 --> 01:11:34.440
It's like ugh.
And now he does like it's a hug in a cup.

1270
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:39.300
He used to drink fucking four vintages a day.
I do take,
did not fuck around.

1271
01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:41.980
He did some serious training too.
Yeah.

1272
01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.630
That's one of the reasons why he's body was able to take that giant jolt of

1273
01:11:45.631 --> 01:11:48.150
caffeine every day.
Who's in such awesome shape?

1274
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:53.540
What is this shit that gene Simmons out wants to sue all at MP3 downloaders

1275
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.590
yeah.
Gene Simmons is apparently,

1276
01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:59.610
I'm saying that all people that steal music online,

1277
01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:03.450
he wants to sue them all and go after them all and that's doesn't his son go,

1278
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:04.620
Hey dad,
dad,
dad come here.

1279
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:09.330
His son [inaudible] his son has the ability to talk to him.
I mean,

1280
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.550
I wouldn't let my son tell me what I can and can't say.

1281
01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:14.160
If I made a billion dollar empire out of music,
I would say,

1282
01:12:14.161 --> 01:12:18.300
I know what the fuck I'm doing,
dude,
just relax.
This is part of my character,

1283
01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:22.140
part of my characters and I'm a business span asshole and then I go after
people.

1284
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.270
You know what I'm saying?
I mean he's always been like that.

1285
01:12:24.271 --> 01:12:28.470
I mean [inaudible] I think they have been selling kiss merchandise from the get

1286
01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:30.330
go back when no bands were doing it.

1287
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:33.540
They had kiss army and you get into the kiss army and you fucking,

1288
01:12:33.541 --> 01:12:34.740
I was in the kiss army dude,

1289
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:38.550
I had a kiss army tee shirt and shit and you get a sticker and a patch and shit

1290
01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.220
and you become part of the kiss army.
You know,

1291
01:12:41.221 --> 01:12:44.730
he's just been a one of those guys.
It's always been very business minded,

1292
01:12:44.731 --> 01:12:47.100
which is kind of rare for artists.
Right.

1293
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.950
So I understand where all these guys are coming from.

1294
01:12:49.951 --> 01:12:52.800
I understood where the Metallica Dude,
Lars Earl rich,

1295
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.220
I understood where he was coming from.
He's saying people are stealing,

1296
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.700
people are stealing when people are staying on.
Yes,
but here's the problem.

1297
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:04.260
Yeah it is.
Technically they shouldn't be able to do it,
but they can.

1298
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:09.060
So they will and it's that simple.
They can.
So they will,

1299
01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:10.620
and it's your job.

1300
01:13:10.621 --> 01:13:15.621
All you can do is put out great music and if you cannot be legally protected,

1301
01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:18.030
like in a certain sense of the Internet,
I don't think you can.

1302
01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.580
They're going to go after a few people here and there and they're going to sue

1303
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:22.470
them.
But people are always going to download your shit.

1304
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:27.300
Just form a relationship between the artists and the fans.

1305
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:29.580
Former relationship with these people.
Appreciate you.

1306
01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:32.760
And if they enjoy your shit,
they,
they'll go and buy it.

1307
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.320
They'll go and buy it once they download.

1308
01:13:34.321 --> 01:13:39.321
I have a lot of friends who will download either a movie or a or songs and

1309
01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.350
always not just by the CACD on iTunes,

1310
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:46.190
but tell everybody they bought the CD because I,
they'll say like,

1311
01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.740
I downloaded it,
dude.
It was so good.
I went out and I bought it on iTunes.

1312
01:13:49.741 --> 01:13:52.230
I'm telling everybody,
go buy this.
It's the Shit,
you know?

1313
01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.550
It's like you get more fans.
It's just going to expose more people to your shit.

1314
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:59.490
Yeah,
it's gonna fuck up record stores,
but they're already dead.
You know,

1315
01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:01.800
tower records is dead.
There's a place right down here.

1316
01:14:01.801 --> 01:14:04.110
I used to drive and I used to go,
there's a CD store.

1317
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.220
That shit is going to be like,

1318
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.130
like we're talking about like buffalo skinning factories.

1319
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:09.780
You know what I'm saying?
Like that's gone.

1320
01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:14.140
There's no CD stores used to be able to go.
Like there was a giant store.

1321
01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:17.320
You would walk through the rock section.
Oh look at this.

1322
01:14:17.321 --> 01:14:19.240
They got juniors previous greatest heads,
you know,

1323
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:22.780
and you would go through this store that had all these physical cds in him.

1324
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:24.820
That's,
that's dinosaur shit.
Yeah.

1325
01:14:24.821 --> 01:14:28.520
The only thing I think there's money for is used CD stores.
You know,
cause I,

1326
01:14:28.521 --> 01:14:32.140
I still go into USC and he stores,
I'll buy like $10 worth.
They use cds.

1327
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:33.770
Listen man,
it killed it.
Yeah.

1328
01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:38.110
Mean the downloading on the Internet killed those CD stores.
But guess what?

1329
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.460
They were going to die anyway.

1330
01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:42.150
They were going to die anyway because the Internet,
they have to die there.

1331
01:14:42.151 --> 01:14:47.020
They're silly when I can have everything in your fucking store on my phone.

1332
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.050
Okay.
You have a store,
you have a giant store.

1333
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.450
Everything in your stores on my phone.

1334
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:56.170
You need to quit what you're doing because you're doing something stupid.

1335
01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.970
That's a dumb way to do it.

1336
01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:02.971
You a giant store where it's all fucking inboxes and these little plastic crates

1337
01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:05.530
and like this will waste.
This is all wasteful stuff.

1338
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.210
It's must go to the clouds.
It's crazy.
I'd like,

1339
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:13.610
there's a lot of things are going fucking digital or like Google TV.
He,

1340
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.770
you know when people are like,

1341
01:15:14.771 --> 01:15:17.570
you know like it's like that's the argument that you know in,

1342
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:18.640
in Gene Simmons said this too,

1343
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:21.730
that it crushed the music business because they were asleep at the wheel and

1344
01:15:21.731 --> 01:15:22.160
then the digital,

1345
01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.310
I don't think it crushed them because they were sleeping at the wheel.

1346
01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:26.860
It crushed him because they were irrelevant.
Right.
They didn't,

1347
01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:30.010
they didn't need to sell it like that anymore.
It was too,

1348
01:15:30.011 --> 01:15:33.430
it's too readily available to easy to access to,
easy to get.

1349
01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:37.270
So now it becomes more artists based and more becomes more about seeing live

1350
01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:41.080
performances and supporting the artists by buying merchandise and shit like
that.

1351
01:15:41.081 --> 01:15:45.880
It becomes more of like that like and making it a legal avenue that's very

1352
01:15:45.881 --> 01:15:47.710
convenient.
Like the iTunes store.

1353
01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:50.890
I buy all my shit on the iTunes store cause it's super easy.

1354
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:54.310
It's very rare I ever have to look anywhere else to find some songs in the best

1355
01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:57.330
is when you're driving down the street,
just open up iTunes while you're driving,

1356
01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.020
you search do that,
you fall,

1357
01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:02.050
you could totally do it and then you just find the song you want and download it

1358
01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:05.270
while you're driving and automatically play it within 30 seconds.
Yeah,

1359
01:16:05.271 --> 01:16:06.160
that's pretty fascinating.

1360
01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:09.550
It's pretty fascinating that this is all happening inside our lifetime,
you know?

1361
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:11.920
So the,
the,
the iTunes,
the way they got it.

1362
01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:13.990
I like it because it's nice and easy and you know,

1363
01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:17.260
you don't have to go searching,
you know,
I'm like,
it's right there.
What I want,

1364
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:20.110
James Brown,
ch Bam or what?
I don't even know what he's on there.

1365
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.820
I'm sure he is right.
Probably.
Anyway,
the point is that as long as it's,

1366
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.940
if people can,
they'll,
they'll always support the artists,
man.

1367
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.670
You gotta you gotta you gotta appreciate that.

1368
01:16:30.671 --> 01:16:32.920
The only reason why you're able to do all this as,

1369
01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.960
because people enjoy what you do.
And yeah,

1370
01:16:34.961 --> 01:16:36.550
there's going to be some people that get your shit.

1371
01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:39.940
But that's just because that's what technology is all about today.

1372
01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.570
It's all about easy access to information and music is basically just

1373
01:16:43.571 --> 01:16:45.280
information.
It's just ones and Zeros.

1374
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:49.810
You can't stop that shit but you can damage the way people like look at you and

1375
01:16:49.811 --> 01:16:51.040
like you don't appreciate,

1376
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.110
you know the fact that sometimes people don't have money.

1377
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:55.810
You don't appreciate the fact that you know there's going to be people that
need,

1378
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.320
you know,

1379
01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.190
to support their families and they need to like spend money on important shit

1380
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.540
and they really don't.

1381
01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:05.980
They can't really make room for another 12 bucks for your fucking CD,
you know?

1382
01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:08.950
So they just download it for free but they still love you and then like a year

1383
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:09.980
later they come see you in concert.

1384
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.700
<v 2>Like it all balances out I think.
I think so too.
I mean,
I don't know.</v>

1385
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:18.140
I'm not a fucking tower records executive.

1386
01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:21.050
Cause if you were at tower records executive or Warner brothers or any of these

1387
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:25.700
big labels that got fucking crushed by all this,
uh,
this MP3 business,
I mean,

1388
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:28.690
what do they do now?
How do they,
how are they even making money?
You know,

1389
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:33.650
mostly iTunes muscly and selling it to TV shows and movies and commercials.

1390
01:17:33.651 --> 01:17:37.280
And I think the,
instead of selling it in w two a record,

1391
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:39.790
you're now selling it to all these other things,
you know?
I know.

1392
01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:44.820
That's why I don't understand like how much money cds and records east to make.

1393
01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:48.350
Because back then they weren't selling it at,
you know,
like fucking,

1394
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:51.110
you didn't watch all in the family and then have,
you know,

1395
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.040
the black eyed peas playing in the background,
you know,
so things like that,

1396
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:59.620
you know,
iTunes and it seems like they're,
they're everywhere.

1397
01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.050
So you think licensing is where they're making their,

1398
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.240
I think that's has to be where they're making their money.
You know,
I mean there,

1399
01:18:05.241 --> 01:18:07.370
there licensing,
fucking ringtones there.

1400
01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.400
Lysing singing music and video games and movies and fucking commercials.

1401
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:16.850
It just seems like all that shit didn't exist back in the 70s when,

1402
01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.540
when supposedly that,
that,
that,

1403
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:23.240
but back then there was zero piracy back when there was vinyl albums.

1404
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.880
That's what you get.
You've got a vinyl album.
Have,
you know,
you could,

1405
01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:30.500
there's no piracy find going to do well in 1980 there was,
I'm not sure actually.

1406
01:18:30.501 --> 01:18:31.334
But even then,

1407
01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:36.080
what do you mean 1980 [inaudible] when fucking a cassette tape came out,

1408
01:18:36.081 --> 01:18:39.740
when was so sure.
But it was never as good.
Didn't sound as good.
Dual cassette.

1409
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:43.460
It made it pretty good copy if you've got a good Maxwell in there.
Yeah.

1410
01:18:43.530 --> 01:18:46.470
Cause that's like the second concept.
The concept was good.
Yeah it was.

1411
01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:49.640
You do that all the time.
And the cassettes that they sound really good,

1412
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:53.360
like good quality stereo I think pretty much as good as the it copied as good as

1413
01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:55.100
it was.
If he bought a quality cassette,

1414
01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:58.010
did a cassette ever sounds good as a CD or CD is better.
Oh,

1415
01:18:58.030 --> 01:19:00.680
cities way better sound quality and yeah,

1416
01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:04.460
so there was album was number one,
cassette was number two,

1417
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:08.750
but CD is not as good as album.
Right.
So the people say,
yeah,

1418
01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.350
there's like an analog quality to s to music.
Yeah,

1419
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.910
I guess there's like whatever deeper sounds stuff,
but you also don't have

1420
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.670
every 30 seconds,
you know?
Sometimes I liked that man.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
totally.

1421
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.810
Sometimes I like that,
you know,
like the hisses and pumps and shit.
You know,

1422
01:19:23.811 --> 01:19:26.530
there's something cool about old music if you listen through headphones.

1423
01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:27.200
But absolutely.

1424
01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.290
I don't have the patience to be sitting there with headphones on while a record

1425
01:19:30.291 --> 01:19:33.710
spins around the needle on it.
I don't have that kind of patients,
you know?

1426
01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.000
I'm not that into music.

1427
01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:38.120
Fucking changing those needles with a pain in the ass to remember that shit.

1428
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:41.300
You had to advise a new needle.
Barely.
Man,
I barely remember it,

1429
01:19:41.301 --> 01:19:44.980
but I do remember being a kid being absolutely fucking fascinating to do here to

1430
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:47.510
somehow or another get all this music into this desk.

1431
01:19:47.511 --> 01:19:51.060
I thought it was like magic to me.
You know,
lines.
Yeah.
I,

1432
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:55.340
this left one day they left me alone and I had a stack of their records.

1433
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.410
My parents was just leave me alone.
I'll be like eight.

1434
01:19:57.411 --> 01:20:00.290
And they would just go places.
That's cool.
No it's not cool.

1435
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.320
I gotta been sticking knives into electrical sockets and shit,

1436
01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.620
but I was fucking around with their record player and I remember just being

1437
01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:08.130
absolutely

1438
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:08.671
<v 5>fascinating.</v>

1439
01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:10.860
I was doing a bunch of shit I shouldn't have been doing like going backwards and

1440
01:20:10.861 --> 01:20:14.400
forwards with it and fucking with the needle I'm sure.
But um,

1441
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:18.930
I was just thinking how insane it is that somehow or another this needle

1442
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:23.250
interacts with this surface and it brings this incredibly rich music out of,

1443
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.630
out of this black plastic thing.
Like how did that come about?

1444
01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:32.310
That is some alien shit right there.
That is nuts.
That somehow or another,

1445
01:20:32.311 --> 01:20:35.130
they figured this out a long time ago.
Like in the 19.

1446
01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:38.280
What does it like forties like when did they have CD or a record of vinyl?

1447
01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:39.150
Long time ago.
Yeah.

1448
01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:42.480
Used to be on the wet middle plates or something like that in the old days or

1449
01:20:42.481 --> 01:20:45.900
was it a real ever on wax or is,
what does that mean by put it down on wax?

1450
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.530
Doesn't that mean like the,
yeah.
Well I think the record's considered where

1451
01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:58.530
maybe,
yeah,
I don't know how the fuck they did it,

1452
01:20:58.531 --> 01:21:01.680
but it's pretty amazing.
You know,

1453
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:03.810
it's almost more amazing to me than,

1454
01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.070
than what we can do today because we do so much other cool shit today.
You know,

1455
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:09.960
there's so many things you could do today,
but like,
you know,

1456
01:21:09.961 --> 01:21:13.920
cell phone messaging and you know,
fit watching youtube videos on your phone,

1457
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.320
there's all sorts of fascinating shit you could do today.

1458
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.460
So the idea of storing music on some piece of plastic doesn't seem insane at
all.

1459
01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.490
But God damn back in the forties I must've been the craziest thing ever.

1460
01:21:23.491 --> 01:21:24.900
Like there was nothing like that.

1461
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.280
Like there's a ghost inside this disk and you just rub a,

1462
01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:33.900
a pointed piece of metal on it and it lifts up and comes through the speakers

1463
01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.280
and it's incredible.

1464
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.580
And I don't like whole lot of love and just a needle scratching on a piece of

1465
01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:42.330
plastic in this small ones had to be played at a different speed for some
reason,

1466
01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:45.900
which made no sense to me.
How different would life be if we didn't have that?

1467
01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.120
How different would life be if there was no music?

1468
01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:50.760
If they never figured out a way to record music,

1469
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.430
which if you and I were alive back then,

1470
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.500
they never would have figured out a way to record music.
Right.

1471
01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:57.870
You'll just have that one friend that was really good at singing that you would

1472
01:21:57.871 --> 01:22:01.260
invite to at parties if you like.
Really for real,

1473
01:22:01.261 --> 01:22:05.310
it feels like if like you and I were responsible for coming up with a way to

1474
01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:07.560
record music,
it would never happen.
No,
it would never take place.

1475
01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:12.050
There has to be like a gigantic evolution of people who are science minded and

1476
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:15.910
understand technology and recording sounds and they have to put it together and

1477
01:22:15.911 --> 01:22:19.530
it just figure out a way to get it onto this piece of plastic and make it sound

1478
01:22:19.531 --> 01:22:23.400
realistic.
And they did all this shit before they were internet,

1479
01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:24.780
but before there was the internet,

1480
01:22:24.781 --> 01:22:27.540
before there was like cell phones before anything,

1481
01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:32.070
the computers were gigantic computers.
It would fill up entire rooms,
you know,

1482
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:34.080
that was the computers they had in the fifties what they have,

1483
01:22:34.570 --> 01:22:38.050
it's just really like buildings was a computer.
Yeah,
I mean the,

1484
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.190
and it's nothing compared to your iPhone doesn't even have nearly the processing

1485
01:22:41.191 --> 01:22:42.210
power that your iPhone has.

1486
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:46.980
And back then they figured out how to put music down in these plastic discs is

1487
01:22:46.981 --> 01:22:51.150
crazy.
Guys.
If they'd ever figured it out,
man,
what?
Life would be so strange.

1488
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:55.420
We would always have music.
But if you had no music in your car,
you went,

1489
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.520
no music and movies.
Just have to have a friend come with you in the car.
Yeah.

1490
01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:01.350
What if there was no way to record music?

1491
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:06.100
There's no way to actually record sounds.
What would

1492
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:11.110
<v 2>have King Kong for clouds and they were both in outer space and neither one had</v>

1493
01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:13.660
a speed advantage cause there were weightless.

1494
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:22.350
We might have smoked too much pot before we did this podcast.

1495
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:24.280
That's what it's going to be.
My new song.

1496
01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.430
Well I'm going to play that back and we're going to take that as a chunk.

1497
01:23:27.431 --> 01:23:30.040
That will be a little blip that going to use whenever we get on one of those

1498
01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:33.100
little strange conversations.
It doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.

1499
01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:38.380
Just play that we might have smoked too much pot before we did this podcast.

1500
01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:44.110
Definitely smoked too much pot today.
Uh,
yes you have Brian.

1501
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:49.510
That's why I'm out here.
Uh,
so trying to explain to you about Meg Whitman said,

1502
01:23:49.511 --> 01:23:51.850
I've been doing a lot of standup lately and I know you have been,

1503
01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:55.930
one of the hardest things I've keep on catching myself doing is doing the cheesy

1504
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:59.230
one liners that sound like Jaylin and or the next day like know the next day

1505
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:00.460
I'll read it and be like,
ah,

1506
01:24:00.461 --> 01:24:05.380
it's so Jay Leno really like what my light like.
Hey,

1507
01:24:05.381 --> 01:24:09.550
my name's Brian and I do stand up comedy when I'm single.
So ladies,

1508
01:24:09.551 --> 01:24:12.810
if you don't like my comedy date me,
I didn't tell him,
hey,

1509
01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.140
I now know how much of,
what are you willing to explain,

1510
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.490
um,
that you're,
you're getting out of a relationship and that like,

1511
01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:29.170
I'm doing comedy is a new way to spend your social time.
Oh,

1512
01:24:29.171 --> 01:24:31.180
it's awesome.
Like at first,
you know,

1513
01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:33.980
getting on a relationship you have nothing to do,
you're lonely.

1514
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:36.160
You were like devastated.
Like let's,

1515
01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:40.780
without going into details for folks who don't know,
my buddy Brian.
Okay.

1516
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:45.900
It was a crazy hot and heavy and then gone right and on a whirlwind fashion.

1517
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.890
Yeah.
It was literally a head fuck.
Definitely.
No,

1518
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:52.930
I mean it was a head fuck to the point that your list,
like I give up,

1519
01:24:52.931 --> 01:24:53.651
this is ridiculous.

1520
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:57.550
And then it got to the point where I was just at home all the time and then I

1521
01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.380
was like,
all right,
I have to get out of this fucking house.

1522
01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:02.800
So I started going on like binge drinking,
you know,
for like,
like a week.

1523
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:05.650
And I was like right,
that's binge or Bangerz Bettinger drinking,

1524
01:25:05.651 --> 01:25:08.050
whatever that means.
That sounds we want to binge drinking.
Yeah.

1525
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:10.360
So you went on vendors,
vendors,

1526
01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:13.900
you got fucked up every day and then on every day and getting drunk.
No,

1527
01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:16.180
for like five days I did it straight go.
God,
I just went,

1528
01:25:16.181 --> 01:25:18.940
not because I didn't have anything to do.
So then I was like,
all right,

1529
01:25:18.941 --> 01:25:22.000
this can't continue it cause that's,
that's,
that'll kill you.
I can gross.

1530
01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.130
And so I started doing stand up comedy and then immediately you get put in the

1531
01:25:25.131 --> 01:25:27.580
standup comedy road,
you realize,
all right,

1532
01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:29.830
there's a bunch of people that were on the same team as you,

1533
01:25:29.831 --> 01:25:31.300
all at the same level as you.

1534
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:35.260
And everywhere you go there at the same mix as you and stuff,

1535
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:40.270
immediately you just become like groups with these people.
It's pretty awesome.

1536
01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:44.440
So you just found a bunch of friends.
I'm trying to punch your freelance.
So um,

1537
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:48.490
it's so it started out as like a social thing,
like yeah,
go out and do something.

1538
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.530
Fucking let out my anger on stage and meet some people to be,

1539
01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:53.740
are you telling jokes about her?

1540
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.560
I have one joke and it's not even finished yet.
It was just that a,

1541
01:25:59.561 --> 01:26:04.300
yeah,
my girl,
my ex girlfriend has a fake vagina and crazy cause on the box.

1542
01:26:04.301 --> 01:26:06.590
This is,
you know,
ultra realistic,

1543
01:26:06.591 --> 01:26:11.000
which is bullshit because fake vaginas don't have mom issues or HIV scares.

1544
01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:19.670
Brian's just start now folks,
you know,
like comedies off for everybody.

1545
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:23.330
That's what I'm saying.
It turns into that Jaylen job,
it turns into j Lo,
listen,

1546
01:26:23.331 --> 01:26:25.970
you've got to learn how to beat yourself up there.
That's the hardest part.

1547
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.540
The hardest part of comedy is learning how to relax and you get these crazy

1548
01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:30.500
spots where it's like,

1549
01:26:30.501 --> 01:26:33.420
it's much more difficult because you get like five minutes spots or 10 minutes

1550
01:26:33.421 --> 01:26:36.590
spots like right.
Yeah.
That's like ready go.
Like you don't know,

1551
01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.050
you have all these ideas that you maybe want to talk about.

1552
01:26:39.051 --> 01:26:41.440
Maybe I should do this bit.
No,
I'm gonna try this one.
You,

1553
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:44.660
none of them are totally proven to you.
It's very tricky.
You know,

1554
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:48.170
I did Molly the other day and I think it really opened up this whole thing on

1555
01:26:48.171 --> 01:26:51.050
stage for me though because I was having a hard time being on stage,

1556
01:26:51.051 --> 01:26:54.070
being myself.
Like,
like how I just did that joke.
It's not how I say it to Molly.

1557
01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.110
Is that what you said?
Yeah.
Molly,
it's what does your model is here?
Uh,
ecstasy.

1558
01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:01.010
Oh,
well we expect us to know that you fucking junkie.

1559
01:27:01.011 --> 01:27:02.840
You don't know this club shit.
He just goes,

1560
01:27:02.841 --> 01:27:05.840
what did all of the other day all like casual and shit.
And I was like,

1561
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.230
do I need to stop this and find out what Molly is like?
Yes I do.

1562
01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:12.640
He's not going to explain it.
What the fuck is Molly that I told you that?
Well,

1563
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.790
even if you did tell me,
we're doing a podcast right now,
fellow,

1564
01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:19.430
and there's a lot of people listening.
So that's Molly.
Molly is pure ecstasy.

1565
01:27:19.431 --> 01:27:21.080
It's called like MD empty.

1566
01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:23.780
This is stuff you go from that Russian scientist and scientists.

1567
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:28.020
A chick with the red hair was really long legs,
hot shot.
Don't get the details,

1568
01:27:28.021 --> 01:27:31.190
man.
Give her up.
She was like,
do you want it?
Okay.

1569
01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:35.180
So the Russian scientists gives you this stuff called Molly.
Yeah.
And uh,

1570
01:27:35.190 --> 01:27:38.030
and I'm like,
well what is it?
Ecstasy?
And she goes,
well,
no,

1571
01:27:38.031 --> 01:27:41.480
it's just pure ecstasy.
It has no idea of their chemicals.
It's just,
you said,

1572
01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:44.360
is it Exede?
She said,
no,
it's pure ecstasy.
Well,

1573
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:48.480
she meaning it's not like the typical ecstasy.
You buy it like a club or you,
you,

1574
01:27:48.481 --> 01:27:52.490
you know,
get off a gentleman and behind seven 11.
So that stuff's like,

1575
01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:56.270
got like meth in it.
Yeah.
It hasn't like straight nine usually.

1576
01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.450
And crazy shit in it like that.
Why?
I mean,
it's bad for you.

1577
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.850
Supposedly this is actually good for you.
Not really.

1578
01:28:01.851 --> 01:28:05.870
But what it does though is it comes in a capsule form and there's like a powder

1579
01:28:05.871 --> 01:28:09.530
in it by the way.
We don't just don't do this shit,
but don't listen to him.
Yeah.

1580
01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:12.170
So the rest of the chick was like,
Hey,
uh,
you know,
do you want to do it?

1581
01:28:12.171 --> 01:28:14.480
And I'm like,
you know,
I'm kind of scared.
You know,
I'll just take a little,

1582
01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:18.740
so she just took open the capsule and put a little in my drink and I drank it.

1583
01:28:18.741 --> 01:28:20.570
And then like within like 30 minutes,

1584
01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.690
it felt like every single pour of my body was vibrating.

1585
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:25.370
It felt like when you're half asleep,

1586
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.590
you know when you're in that first rem sleep or whatever it is,

1587
01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:30.110
what you'd like your body,
your mind's awake,
but your body's not.

1588
01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.600
So I would've felt like,
but I was being able to walk,

1589
01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:35.960
I was being able to talk and I,
it wasn't like the ecstasy,

1590
01:28:35.961 --> 01:28:39.410
like where you're just like,
ah,
you know,
like kind of out of it.

1591
01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:44.390
This was just like pure fucking orgasms.
It was amazing.
So anyways,

1592
01:28:44.391 --> 01:28:45.224
after that,

1593
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:49.600
a couple of days after I went back on stage and I felt this weird groove when on

1594
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:53.060
stage of that I always just like,
hey,
you know,
hey like really relaxed.
Like I,

1595
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:56.990
it's kind of like still kind of feeling kind of like a looseness or uh,

1596
01:28:57.350 --> 01:29:01.760
a comfortability and it was weird cause ever since then totally how I so

1597
01:29:01.761 --> 01:29:02.160
something

1598
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:07.160
<v 5>comfortable from the ecstasy experience that it was so loving and loose and fun.</v>

1599
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:12.120
Maybe more loving and loose.
I guess for some reason on stage.
Well relaxed you,

1600
01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.880
it puts you all in perspective too.
It makes you understand what,

1601
01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:15.960
what ecstasy did for me.

1602
01:29:15.961 --> 01:29:19.890
I only did it once and I don't know what was in it cause I was jack the next
day.

1603
01:29:19.891 --> 01:29:24.450
Dude I was jacked the next day.
I felt really bad.
Like I felt really dumb.

1604
01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.860
See I didn't have that there wasn't hip.

1605
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:28.480
That's one of the good things about that cause it's pure,
you don't have that.

1606
01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:33.120
Then the next day shit I got woke up fine as fuck and I went to bed easy as
hell.

1607
01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.860
Yeah.
I don't know what was in the thing.
I mean,

1608
01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:36.540
I know there was definitely some ecstasy in it,

1609
01:29:36.541 --> 01:29:38.520
but what I got out of it when I was,

1610
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:42.990
when the experience was happening was that so much of the way we interact with

1611
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:47.700
each other is based on insecurity.
And when no one has insecurities,
you know,

1612
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:48.960
and everyone's just hanging out.

1613
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:51.720
Like it's like people can be so much more friendly to each other,

1614
01:29:51.721 --> 01:29:53.520
so much more loving to each other and so much fun.

1615
01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:58.020
I mean it sounds so hippy faggy bullshit,
but you know,
I was like,
wow.

1616
01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:01.860
Like could you imagine if this state could be recreated all the time?
I was like,

1617
01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:03.840
look at,
look at the way we're interacting.
Like now,

1618
01:30:03.841 --> 01:30:08.640
like this is a really like the best way you could ever enjoy a bunch of people's

1619
01:30:08.641 --> 01:30:12.750
company.
But if we were like this all the time,
nothing would get done.
You know,

1620
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.290
you would have no reason you would,

1621
01:30:14.291 --> 01:30:16.550
would you just need enough food to stay alive?
Right.

1622
01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.110
And we'd be living like Indians out there and tents and shit.

1623
01:30:19.111 --> 01:30:20.880
And I could see myself getting addicted to that drug.

1624
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.430
And how was the first time where,
I mean,
I don't know if I could do it every day,

1625
01:30:23.431 --> 01:30:26.770
but it felt so good that I want to do it again where most drugs I'm like,
ah,

1626
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.890
that was good.
You know?
Yeah.

1627
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:30.090
It feels like you're going to hold people's hands and shit.

1628
01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:33.720
Like you don't even know why.
Give people a hug and it's just like radiates.

1629
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.480
It's very strange,
you know,
why,
why does that exist in our brains?
You know?

1630
01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:40.710
I mean,
basically what we're doing is we're,
we're hijacking our reward system,

1631
01:30:40.711 --> 01:30:44.070
right?
And we were injecting,
you know,
all these,
uh,

1632
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:48.900
new chemical rewards into our whole system that our brain has to process it and

1633
01:30:48.901 --> 01:30:51.180
it's not making any of its own.
And while this is processing it,

1634
01:30:51.181 --> 01:30:54.510
and then after it's over,
that's why you have like this drop off,
you know?

1635
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:55.770
And the next day they tell you,

1636
01:30:55.771 --> 01:31:00.150
you're supposed to take things to try to re stimulate your brain's production of

1637
01:31:00.151 --> 01:31:04.710
chemicals.
You know,
dopamine or Serotonin,
whatever the fuck it is.
Right.
But you,

1638
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:05.280
you know,
you,

1639
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:09.420
you experienced a drop off after the big flood and the drop off from me the next

1640
01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:10.201
day,
whatever it was,

1641
01:31:10.201 --> 01:31:13.410
whether it was because of the crystal meth in it or who the fuck knows what was

1642
01:31:13.411 --> 01:31:17.130
really in black tar heroin.
But the drop off was too much from Amen.
It was just,

1643
01:31:17.131 --> 01:31:19.560
it was too crazy.
I was too dumb.
The next day I was like,

1644
01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:20.970
this is like brain damage,
Tom.
Like,

1645
01:31:20.971 --> 01:31:23.070
imagine if I had to go through the rest of my life being this dumb.

1646
01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:25.350
This is like a lot of people do.
You know,

1647
01:31:25.351 --> 01:31:27.300
a lot of people go through the rest of their life,
you know,
just,

1648
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:30.240
they're just not there anymore.
That's fucked up.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1649
01:31:30.241 --> 01:31:33.990
You get hit in the head with a fucking fastball.
Things happen.
All of a sudden.

1650
01:31:33.991 --> 01:31:37.470
You're not the same.
Right.
You could have been smoking meth the whole time.
Well,

1651
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.071
you know,

1652
01:31:38.071 --> 01:31:41.430
I knew the dude who had it had this stuff and they had done it a bunch of times

1653
01:31:41.431 --> 01:31:45.550
and so I knew it was wasn't going to kill me,
but I didn't really know.
Solid.

1654
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:49.830
Got busted out of fucking Ph kit and started testing it with saliva.

1655
01:31:49.831 --> 01:31:50.700
Let's see what we've got here.

1656
01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:53.910
Do you think you'll ever do that again or any kind of magic mushrooms?
Yes,

1657
01:31:53.911 --> 01:31:58.440
definitely.
Yeah.
I've,
I've done them certain recently,
but um,
yeah,

1658
01:31:58.470 --> 01:32:03.090
but the,
the um,
Mtma is too much.
Oh,

1659
01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:05.320
I don't know.
I don't know.
Then the next day is too hard.

1660
01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.700
I'm so freaked out about mushrooms now and like I'm more afraid mushrooms then

1661
01:32:09.701 --> 01:32:14.620
that just from like molds and stuff like that.
It's illegal,
man.
That's all it is.

1662
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.730
If it was legal,
it would be so easy to control and grow.
Right.

1663
01:32:18.731 --> 01:32:20.020
So fucking easy.

1664
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.590
And all they have to do is you have all these pain management centers that you

1665
01:32:23.591 --> 01:32:27.220
have set up all throughout Florida that they have these oxycontin problems,

1666
01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:30.430
you know,
I mean,
we have chiropractors everywhere.

1667
01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:33.760
We have all sorts of people that deal with all sorts of different,

1668
01:32:33.761 --> 01:32:36.670
various health issues in it.
And even in the Chiropractic,

1669
01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:39.460
a sense a lot of people think that's quackery.

1670
01:32:39.461 --> 01:32:42.190
A lot of people don't even Glengary they did.
They don't even believe it.

1671
01:32:42.191 --> 01:32:45.670
You never heard that word.
Never.
It's a really common word.
They,
they believed,

1672
01:32:45.671 --> 01:32:49.810
they don't even believe in Chiropractic.
Well,
another thing that is,
you know,

1673
01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.410
that different cultures have used to try to heal people,

1674
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:57.160
try to get people straight for thousands of years.
It's psychedelics.

1675
01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:00.670
You can't say that all these cultures that have used this thing like,
oh,

1676
01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:05.260
they used,
they used,
um,
uh,
you know,

1677
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:08.980
acupressure or these acupuncture or they used,
you know,

1678
01:33:08.981 --> 01:33:12.280
the various tantric methods.
Okay.
You can practice all of these.

1679
01:33:12.281 --> 01:33:15.820
All these are all ancient things that people find relief from stress.
And I see,

1680
01:33:15.821 --> 01:33:20.710
I see,
I see.
Well,
we also use these mushrooms.
Nope.
Nope,
nope,
nope.
Oh,
well no,

1681
01:33:20.711 --> 01:33:23.560
they're okay.
We've been using it for 10,000 years.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1682
01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:28.060
Don't bring them in.
I mean,
it's like they'll stop at a certain thing,
you know,

1683
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:31.630
they'll go through all these other different things that you're allowed to do

1684
01:33:31.631 --> 01:33:34.930
that ancient people have done and you can practice all these shamonic rituals as

1685
01:33:34.931 --> 01:33:38.860
long as you're just blowing tobacco smoke in the air and chanting like a retard

1686
01:33:38.861 --> 01:33:42.280
without the IOWASCA.
When you add the Iowasca,
then things get strange.

1687
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:45.100
Then they want to lock you in a cage for doing something that people have found

1688
01:33:45.101 --> 01:33:48.130
relief with for thousands of years.
If mushrooms were legal,

1689
01:33:48.131 --> 01:33:52.060
they would sell them all over the place and people in the community would set up

1690
01:33:52.061 --> 01:33:53.170
shamonic centers.

1691
01:33:53.171 --> 01:33:56.710
They would set up centers where people who have already had these experiences

1692
01:33:56.711 --> 01:34:00.100
can talk you through it and help you out and even go with you on the first time

1693
01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:03.760
you do it.
So you'll take like,
you know,
they'll start you off slow.

1694
01:34:03.761 --> 01:34:06.760
We're going to take one gram today and this is what a one gram experience is

1695
01:34:06.761 --> 01:34:07.270
like.

1696
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:10.480
And then just does the guy who's done it for fucking a thousand times and he

1697
01:34:10.481 --> 01:34:13.390
knows what he's doing and he'll,
you know,
they can make sure they're not creepy.

1698
01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:16.720
Then I tried to date rape anybody I need just set up these centers because that

1699
01:34:16.721 --> 01:34:17.290
does happen.

1700
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:20.600
Even in the Shamana community as a lot of dudes are just in it for posing right

1701
01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.220
now.

1702
01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:24.280
They want to be thought of as like the main wise man and they tried to bang on

1703
01:34:24.281 --> 01:34:28.000
these checks.
It's really tripping.
It's kind of funny cause even inside this,

1704
01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:29.470
you know whole psychedelic community,

1705
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:33.580
there's a bunch of people that are still kind of like lost halfway pretending

1706
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:35.080
they're halfway that guy.

1707
01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:37.450
But there are also halfway full of shit because they're really just trying to

1708
01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:40.780
get laid and and come off like some like enlightened guy.

1709
01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.920
But if they set that up,
man,
if it was legal,
if that's the next step,

1710
01:34:44.921 --> 01:34:48.310
if this marijuana thing passes and then next thing let's go after mushrooms man.

1711
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:50.590
Because mushrooms have only helped everybody that I know.

1712
01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:54.220
The only problem with mushrooms is that actually takes you out,

1713
01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:58.220
take you out now that you're not going to be driving a half on mushrooms.

1714
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:02.240
You Know Eddie Bravo did that.
He did the needle of this story.

1715
01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:08.200
Yeah,
us.
So crazy.
I don't know if he wants this.
Tell,
told total,
um,

1716
01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:12.350
let's say this is what he heard from somebody else.
Okay.
Okay.

1717
01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:16.490
It's not really ready to buy now.
I can,
yes.
I'm just,

1718
01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:20.930
I'm going to tell you a different story now.
So this,
he goes to the zoo.
Okay.

1719
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.190
They take five grams a month rooms and they got five grams is what Terence

1720
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:30.050
Mckenna would call a heroic dose.
That's a line from a bill Hicks,
a CD,

1721
01:35:30.051 --> 01:35:31.940
but it's also a Terence Mckenna really called it.

1722
01:35:31.941 --> 01:35:35.750
He called it a heroic dose and anything about five grams because you just

1723
01:35:35.751 --> 01:35:39.920
dissolve,
you don't exist anymore.
When you hit that apex at five grams,

1724
01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:45.190
you become a part of some fucking much larger mosaic.

1725
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:46.360
It's like [inaudible].

1726
01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:50.180
There's like this incredible amount of artwork that you see,

1727
01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.530
incredible amount of visuals that connectivity,
the,
the communication.

1728
01:35:54.650 --> 01:35:57.470
It's like you feel like you're communicating with like some super ultra

1729
01:35:57.471 --> 01:36:01.340
intelligent life form that's explaining everything and it all makes sense.

1730
01:36:01.341 --> 01:36:04.640
I mean it is a fucking mind blower of an experience.

1731
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.390
So he takes this five grams,
this is what five grams does to you.

1732
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:09.620
And he goes to the zoo.

1733
01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:16.790
I mean it's like classic like that.
Bill Hicks had a joke about doing that,

1734
01:36:16.791 --> 01:36:19.280
about going to a fucking amusing park.

1735
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:24.870
So he goes to the fucking zoo and gets super depressed.
I would to like,

1736
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:26.450
he's like the negative energy.

1737
01:36:26.451 --> 01:36:29.300
So it was overwhelming because they get all these monkeys,
man,

1738
01:36:29.301 --> 01:36:31.610
that can think and they're all in these cages.

1739
01:36:31.611 --> 01:36:36.611
I went to one in Colorado with this monkey was screaming like a mental patient,

1740
01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:41.630
like screaming,
like in agony.
He was in a small cage and it was a corner cage.

1741
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.980
So it was around this Ben.

1742
01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:46.550
So everybody just walked in front of his cage back and forth,
back and forth,

1743
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.593
and he was like,

1744
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.720
it was dark dude.
It was dark.
I was like,

1745
01:36:55.721 --> 01:36:59.770
you cannot make any argument for keeping monkeys and cages after this guy.

1746
01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:01.240
That guy's being tortured.

1747
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:04.870
This is an intelligent little animal stuck by itself in a metal box and he's

1748
01:37:04.871 --> 01:37:09.310
been stared at all day by bigger monkeys and he's freaking the fuck out.

1749
01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.100
So any is tripping out.
He's,

1750
01:37:11.101 --> 01:37:16.101
he's in a five gram full blown trip feeling just waves of negative energy,

1751
01:37:17.141 --> 01:37:19.780
you know,
just splashing into them constantly.

1752
01:37:19.781 --> 01:37:23.980
Every time he goes by all these different animal cages and sees them the reality

1753
01:37:23.981 --> 01:37:26.130
of their miserable existence there.
So he's like,

1754
01:37:26.131 --> 01:37:27.220
we gotta get the fuck out of here.

1755
01:37:27.370 --> 01:37:31.660
So he takes his girlfriend and they get in the car and start driving.

1756
01:37:31.810 --> 01:37:35.740
And as he's driving,
it's a full blown mushroom trip.

1757
01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:36.933
He said the,

1758
01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:41.530
the ground in front of his car became pedals of roses,

1759
01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:44.050
rose laterals.
And it was like everywhere.

1760
01:37:44.051 --> 01:37:48.250
They were splashing all up and around the car.
He said the entire,

1761
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:52.330
he was on the highway.
He went on the highway,
son.
He had a,

1762
01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.190
I think he got off of what?
I lost you all together eventually,

1763
01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:56.100
but he was driving on the fucking

1764
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.280
<v 2>on,</v>

1765
01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:00.720
on the highway and seem like rose petals in front of his car has not cool man.

1766
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:05.520
It's really not glow.
He's lucky or she,
whoever that person's talking about,

1767
01:38:05.521 --> 01:38:10.210
you're talking over this guy is,
we're saying Russian lady.
Yeah,

1768
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:14.880
man.
It was,
it was a dark moment in his,
in his existence.
I've driven,

1769
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:18.060
the first time I tripped on acid,
I drove,
uh,
on the way home,

1770
01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:21.150
but it was like eight,
six hours after I dosed.

1771
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:24.960
And so I wasn't really still though,
but I was having sex at the same time.

1772
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:29.020
I think I talked about this on one of the earlier podcasts I went to go see.

1773
01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:33.700
Tell you that happened.
Well,
I went to on acid having sex and driving.
Well,

1774
01:38:33.701 --> 01:38:37.230
why aren't you doing nirvana concert met Kurt Cobain.
He'd gave me Cheetos,

1775
01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:40.590
cursing God at the same time.
No,
no,
I remember it was,

1776
01:38:40.591 --> 01:38:44.430
I had a big station wagon with one of the wood on the thing we had to drive back

1777
01:38:44.431 --> 01:38:47.960
to Columbus to show is in Dayton.
And so your dosed up with us.
Right?

1778
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:51.450
So with your girl driving and she starts rubbing me or doing something like
that.

1779
01:38:51.451 --> 01:38:54.430
Dirty Bitch.
She climbs on me.
Oh my God.

1780
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.710
The back of the car and I'm facing the front of the cool.

1781
01:38:57.711 --> 01:39:00.240
That's real good for your peripheral vision on the right side.
Yeah.

1782
01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:03.280
Can you see pastor hair?
I don't.
Yeah.
Someone's trying to change.

1783
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.160
She was a very tiny girl.
Very tiny.
Very tiny girls.
She was eight.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1784
01:39:08.161 --> 01:39:11.850
I mean she was just a small girl.
She's a woman.
Yes.
Let's say woman's model.

1785
01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:16.710
How old was she?
Uh,
I think we were about 17.
So she was a girl.
Sure.

1786
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.640
How old were you?
17.
Okay.
So yeah,
she was in my class.

1787
01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:24.460
Who's letting you drive at 17?
Uh,
on assay.

1788
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:29.160
I know where the girl on top of you.
You crazy.
Crazy.
And then what was so crazy?

1789
01:39:29.161 --> 01:39:31.830
I was like,
the sex got really good.

1790
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:35.340
So then we decided to pull off into a church parking lot off the side of the

1791
01:39:35.341 --> 01:39:39.990
highway and finish it at the parking lot.
Take up busted in a church parking lot.

1792
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:43.280
Who?
Tate.
Oh,
that's right.
I remember that.
My friends got budget.

1793
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:45.530
Maybe we should sue told until the story who,

1794
01:39:45.531 --> 01:39:48.480
who got busted smoking pot in the church parking lot of friends from high school

1795
01:39:48.481 --> 01:39:50.460
and there were 17 used to always go to the uh,

1796
01:39:50.461 --> 01:39:54.660
this church to smoke pie and they got arrested and had to do community service

1797
01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.890
and it was like some crazy,

1798
01:39:55.891 --> 01:40:00.510
like 60 hours of community service at the Columbus just for smoking pot at the

1799
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:03.360
Columbus Zoo and their job was shoveling shit.
Wow.

1800
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.310
That's a fascinating thing man.

1801
01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:09.240
It's fascinating that people can force you to do things because you got caught

1802
01:40:09.241 --> 01:40:10.470
doing something that you wanted to do.

1803
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:13.500
So all you do want to do that and we say you can't do that.

1804
01:40:13.501 --> 01:40:17.730
So now you have to do this community service for smoking weed is the most

1805
01:40:17.731 --> 01:40:18.750
ridiculous thing ever.

1806
01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:21.930
If you give someone community service for smoking weed for sure.

1807
01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.770
You need to smoke weed for sure.
Totally.
That should be your reward.

1808
01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.410
You know you should.
Okay,
I'll do the community service,

1809
01:40:28.411 --> 01:40:32.880
but you have to smoke some pot too now.
Don't you feel bad?
You smoke the pot.

1810
01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:36.270
Yeah.
How do you feel about me and this orange jumpsuit picking up garbage.

1811
01:40:36.271 --> 01:40:39.390
You fucking douchebag.
If you ever had to just cause I wanted to get high.
No,

1812
01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:43.680
I've never been arrested Brian.
I'm an outstanding citizen.
My taxes.
No,

1813
01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:47.430
that seems so crazy to me.
Why?
I don't know.
I keep it together.

1814
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.200
You've been a good boy.
I've keep it together.

1815
01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:52.410
I'm very good at keeping it together and that's great.
It's very hard.

1816
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.550
I have crazy instincts.

1817
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:58.980
<v 5>My instincts aren't so good.
My instincts are so good.
My bike,
my brain,</v>

1818
01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:03.670
the very last line goes down.
No,
no,
no.

1819
01:41:03.730 --> 01:41:08.570
This is gonna put you in jail.
Don't do anything stupid.
Yeah.

1820
01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:12.040
Well I think if I tape it really close to my body,
I can get through the customs.

1821
01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:16.500
Right.
Ralphie May,
I ended up on getting a hundred dollars ticket,

1822
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:19.460
by the way from that Guam.
And that was actually an accident.
Yeah.
Ralph,

1823
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:22.210
he told Joe he could've been fucked.
If you don't know what this is,

1824
01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:25.810
we're talking about Ralphie mega bus with pot,
but he could get like,
you know,

1825
01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:28.390
some countries you have like a marijuana seed and you're in prison for eight

1826
01:41:28.391 --> 01:41:32.110
years in Guam is America.
Oh it is.
I'm going to wake Guam isn't,

1827
01:41:32.170 --> 01:41:35.950
I don't think it's America,
but I think it's like so closely related.
Standby.

1828
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.120
Puerto Rico's America.
I don't know where Guam is.
I think it's more Pacific.

1829
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:44.140
I think it's more near,
um,
I think Puerto Rico is the Atlantic side,
right?

1830
01:41:44.170 --> 01:41:46.870
Because that's where so many Puerto Rican,
east coast.
Yes.
It's below Florida's.

1831
01:41:46.871 --> 01:41:51.340
Yeah.
And Guam or other,
yeah,
I think qualm is near Hawaii.

1832
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:56.200
I think it's on the way to Hawaii.
Oh,
on the way.
Like from the other side.

1833
01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:58.630
Cool.
No,
I think it's near Hawaii.
I'm pretty sure.

1834
01:41:59.350 --> 01:42:03.910
But I think it's like it's the whole idea that Hawaii and you know Puerto Rico

1835
01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.130
that then could somehow under,

1836
01:42:05.131 --> 01:42:07.240
there'd be a part of the United States that's so silly.

1837
01:42:07.241 --> 01:42:09.880
Like you're way over there.
Like how do we fit in?

1838
01:42:10.330 --> 01:42:14.500
Well I do understand that we must take over as many countries as possible so we

1839
01:42:14.501 --> 01:42:16.450
can destroy everybody.
You know,
kind of thing.

1840
01:42:16.451 --> 01:42:20.080
Like we have Alaska way over here just as a retreat just in case of the country

1841
01:42:20.081 --> 01:42:22.510
believes that we're all going to allow it.
That's why they got Alaska.

1842
01:42:22.511 --> 01:42:25.990
You don't even know your history son.
Doesn't it seem like they would do that?

1843
01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:29.980
Like they have to keep us protected from the Soviet Union?
I don't know.

1844
01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:33.070
This isn't that one.
Sarah Palin,
he used to say that she could see Alaska,
right?

1845
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:38.200
Yes.
Yeah.
I don't think that's why they got Alaska,
Brian.
No,
no,
don't think so.

1846
01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:43.600
I learn I'd be buying all this shit.
You can't buy countries anymore.

1847
01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:44.680
Do they stopped doing that?

1848
01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:50.010
You know that North America used to be under a one sheet of ice that was a mile

1849
01:42:50.261 --> 01:42:54.090
high.
That covered like half the country just 10,000 years ago.
Really?

1850
01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:58.240
10,000 fucking years ago,
10,000 years ago,
North America half covered a nice,

1851
01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:01.930
that's crazy.
Woolly mammoths and fucking saber tooth tigers running around.

1852
01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:07.000
They had,
they all died.
They all died off.
They don't know why.

1853
01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.390
I've been watching all these documentaries on meteor impacts.

1854
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:15.790
Food is without a doubt the scariest thing that could happen at any second

1855
01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.510
anytime.
They literally have no idea how many are up there.

1856
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:22.450
They have no idea which ones are coming towards us.

1857
01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.630
Every now and then somebody spots one.
It's usually amateurs who's amateur.

1858
01:43:25.631 --> 01:43:28.420
Astronomers are just staring at the sky all night and they'll notice there's

1859
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:30.310
like a light in the sky that wasn't there before.

1860
01:43:30.311 --> 01:43:32.080
And then they'll notice it again.
Like,
you know,

1861
01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:34.690
they take photos of it and they'll take a photo with the next day and I go,
okay,

1862
01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:36.550
this is moving and it's moving in this direction.

1863
01:43:36.551 --> 01:43:39.520
And the contact someone and they start tracking this thing.

1864
01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:43.540
What's the coordinates in the sky?
Oh Shit,
this is a fucking asteroid.
You know?

1865
01:43:43.541 --> 01:43:45.220
And that's how we find a lot of them.

1866
01:43:45.221 --> 01:43:48.820
There's like hundreds of thousands of near Earth objects between Mars and

1867
01:43:48.821 --> 01:43:52.130
Jupiter and every now and then when one of them will collide with another one

1868
01:43:52.131 --> 01:43:56.960
and it'll just go rocketing towards earth,
45,000 miles an hour.

1869
01:43:56.961 --> 01:44:01.630
Some of them are just solid iron and they were like a mile wide shot.

1870
01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:06.650
Thank you for being generous dude.

1871
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:11.000
Do you have any idea how fucking crazy that would be if we were all standing

1872
01:44:11.001 --> 01:44:16.001
outside and all of a sudden you could see in the distance the fireball that was

1873
01:44:16.011 --> 01:44:20.360
going to kill you in three days?
Could you imagine?
You could see it coming.

1874
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:21.440
You see it rounding?
Yeah.

1875
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:25.190
<v 2>Mars.
You definitely get your way.
You're going to just start fucking I crazy.</v>

1876
01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.990
What would you I think I would just start crying.

1877
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.180
I didn't think you'd fuck like just start fucking like crazy.

1878
01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:32.870
I think everyone would just go crazy orgy mode because I know I've talked about

1879
01:44:32.871 --> 01:44:35.650
this with many people before.
What would you do?
And it was just like,

1880
01:44:35.651 --> 01:44:38.270
like if you saw it as like an asteroid,
he had like one hour,
what do you do?

1881
01:44:38.271 --> 01:44:40.570
You start fucking,
he started going like,
all right,
it's time to do the anal.

1882
01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:44.540
Everybody says [inaudible] you going to be the catcher?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1883
01:44:44.541 --> 01:44:47.150
I mean to the girl,
like,
all right,
you can finally do it.
I guess I'm,

1884
01:44:47.151 --> 01:44:48.950
I'm not gonna feel anything later.
He said,
wow,

1885
01:44:48.951 --> 01:44:52.210
you'd want to fuck her in the ass and her life.
No,

1886
01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:54.650
but I'm saying everyone has that,
that same thing.

1887
01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:59.320
I think the last moments of her life and you want it to be all you take it.

1888
01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:02.570
No,
I'm just saying though,
everyone says that they would go fucking,

1889
01:45:02.571 --> 01:45:04.140
if there was like one hour left you,

1890
01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:07.530
you think of to turn in this huge ball of bodies on the streets and everyone

1891
01:45:07.531 --> 01:45:08.460
says,
gee is everywhere.

1892
01:45:08.461 --> 01:45:12.290
It just becomes like a Catamari of fucking orgy sex going down the street.

1893
01:45:12.291 --> 01:45:15.190
I don't think it's possible for everyone to do.
I think everyone will do it.

1894
01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.800
I don't think it's possible.
I think most people are going to panic.

1895
01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:21.800
Most people are gonna they're not going to be able to,
yeah,

1896
01:45:21.801 --> 01:45:23.720
they're not going to be a little bit sorry to keep it together.

1897
01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.140
I don't think they're going to be able to just get hard on.

1898
01:45:26.141 --> 01:45:28.260
So just start banging,
you know,
hard ons,

1899
01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.190
<v 5>choir,
like,
you know,
the feeling the need to breed,</v>

1900
01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:35.090
like to need to be comfortable.
You have to be like secure.
You know,

1901
01:45:35.091 --> 01:45:39.290
a fucking rock is going to come and slam into the earth.
You know,

1902
01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:44.320
within the first second that the meteor impact the one that,

1903
01:45:45.111 --> 01:45:48.890
uh,
hit the Yucatan and killed the dinosaurs within the first second.

1904
01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:54.160
It was five miles deep into the earth within the first second.

1905
01:45:55.581 --> 01:45:59.180
Dude.
That's crazy dude.
Stop and think about that.

1906
01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:04.250
Within the first second,
it was five miles deep into the earth.

1907
01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.580
It killed everything.

1908
01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:12.410
It killed everything on earth is like some rats and shit survived some bugs,

1909
01:46:12.411 --> 01:46:15.230
a few bugs and some rats and they had to rebuild from scratch.

1910
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:19.940
It killed everything 65 million years ago.
Wow.
And it's happened many times.

1911
01:46:19.941 --> 01:46:21.770
There's been several extinction events on earth.

1912
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:25.130
They know there's another one from 250 million years ago that is another one

1913
01:46:25.131 --> 01:46:30.131
killed everybody shot Boehm and people will try to tell you like there's a way

1914
01:46:30.171 --> 01:46:31.550
they're going to be able to deflect them.

1915
01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:33.200
They don't even know they're common man.

1916
01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:37.190
Some of them come from behind the sun and yeah,
you can't see them.

1917
01:46:37.191 --> 01:46:40.730
Some of them come from weird places that no one's watching.
They're just,

1918
01:46:40.731 --> 01:46:43.280
they're all out there man.
And if they hit

1919
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:45.950
<v 2>would go right to sex though.
I think I could get it up.</v>

1920
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:50.100
I think I would like go over to my neighbor's house

1921
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.310
<v 5>and ask the girl like,
Hey,
do you want to join us?
I think I would think I would.</v>

1922
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:57.210
I would want to find out when they were thinking that it was going to hit and

1923
01:46:57.211 --> 01:47:01.470
then I'd do mushrooms.
Yeah,
that'd be good.
Mushrooms some faster though.

1924
01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:04.950
Full blown when it hit,
I try to do something faster.
Yeah.

1925
01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:07.290
But mushrooms seems like the right thing to do.

1926
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:09.630
I understand about doing something faster,

1927
01:47:09.631 --> 01:47:12.300
but it seems like if you could get the timing right,
right.

1928
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:16.620
Mushrooms [inaudible] bad ass.
Yeah.
Just keep eating them,
you know,
GPA,

1929
01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:20.010
get to get to like,
you know,
the hour and 20 minutes in.

1930
01:47:20.011 --> 01:47:23.790
And if it's still like the size of the moon in the sky,
I would shoot up heroin.

1931
01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:25.740
That would be the only time I would shoot up heroin.

1932
01:47:25.741 --> 01:47:29.820
I would just go right to heroin.
Fucking do a shitload of it has sex.

1933
01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.450
It's very fascinating to me that we have this horrifying fear of,

1934
01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:35.820
of dying something like something like that.

1935
01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:39.810
Any sort of a natural disaster or any big crazy thing as tsunami,

1936
01:47:39.811 --> 01:47:43.480
a meteor crash or,
but we all know that we're going to die.
Right?

1937
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.950
It's like for some reason we don't want to address that.

1938
01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:49.710
We don't want to think about that.
We,
we want to think like,

1939
01:47:49.711 --> 01:47:51.180
how crazy would it be if it's going to die?

1940
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:56.270
Catastrophe is that worse somehow than dying slow because your body stops

1941
01:47:56.671 --> 01:48:00.870
working,
right?
Or getting cancer or you know,

1942
01:48:00.871 --> 01:48:02.570
you look at some old people that,
you know,
you know,

1943
01:48:02.610 --> 01:48:05.310
every now and then you'll be out there like a,
I was in,
um,

1944
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:08.580
I forget what city it was.
Montreal maybe.
And,
uh,
we were,

1945
01:48:08.581 --> 01:48:10.770
we were outside and there was a lady that was walking by,

1946
01:48:10.771 --> 01:48:15.330
I think it was Montreal and she had the,
the worst posture I've ever seen ever.

1947
01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.270
She was literally like bending at the waist.

1948
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:21.020
Like she was doing it like an exercise like her,

1949
01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:24.930
her upper body was touching almost her legs and she was walking forward and she

1950
01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:28.540
was walking around.
I was like,
man,
that's a tough way to to die,
you know,

1951
01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:32.530
to die slow where your body just starts giving out and things start going wrong

1952
01:48:32.531 --> 01:48:35.730
and you have all these health issues in your organism is barely keeping it

1953
01:48:35.731 --> 01:48:39.900
together.
Wouldn't it be cool to die in a meteor impact dude,

1954
01:48:39.901 --> 01:48:44.390
if you're there where it hits five miles into the ground,
show

1955
01:48:46.230 --> 01:48:50.760
that the last,
the last 10 seconds and be so cool.
God,

1956
01:48:50.761 --> 01:48:54.780
you can know about.
You feel like you'd probably just burn up first or something.

1957
01:48:54.781 --> 01:48:58.380
I don't know.
I think the impact is like a billion nuclear explosion.

1958
01:48:58.381 --> 01:49:01.610
There's probably a lot of suction to when it comes at you so fast.

1959
01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:05.190
It's probably some weird vacuum that happens and then you just start flying
away.

1960
01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:09.120
You know?
Maybe,
maybe I don't have to be something weird like that.
Whatever.

1961
01:49:09.121 --> 01:49:10.770
The impact would probably kill everybody.

1962
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:14.340
The [inaudible] they said that that one in Nevada.
Have you ever seen that one?

1963
01:49:14.341 --> 01:49:17.580
You fly over it.
It's like a mile wide.
You know that one?
Yeah.

1964
01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:20.460
That one was like not that big.

1965
01:49:20.461 --> 01:49:25.461
It wasn't a big thing and it killed everything within 800 miles.

1966
01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.590
Wow.
Everything.
That's crazy.

1967
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:32.640
Everything 800 miles away from that thing just was evaporated.

1968
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:36.510
Can you imagine me an 800 miles away from a meteor impact and you still get

1969
01:49:36.511 --> 01:49:39.840
jacked,
like you're watching it in the distance.
Where's it going to hit?

1970
01:49:39.841 --> 01:49:41.610
It's like 800 miles from that will be fine.

1971
01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:47.130
800 miles away it hits boom and you just disintegrate your thought.
Fuck.

1972
01:49:49.210 --> 01:49:53.020
<v 2>It seems like something that you would talk about more often.</v>

1973
01:49:53.021 --> 01:49:54.790
It seems like something that we would be addressing,

1974
01:49:54.791 --> 01:49:57.850
but I guess people just feel helpless and it hasn't really happened.

1975
01:49:57.851 --> 01:50:00.430
While we've been here and there's no reason to stress on it,
you know,

1976
01:50:00.590 --> 01:50:04.150
cause of your stress on anything too much.
It's just,
you know why stress on that.

1977
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:06.220
It's true.
There's no reason to stress on it,
but it's still,

1978
01:50:06.221 --> 01:50:08.410
you would think that more people would want to discuss it.

1979
01:50:08.890 --> 01:50:11.620
We know another one hit Jupiter recently.
Really recently,

1980
01:50:11.621 --> 01:50:14.650
like within the last couple of years,
huge asteroid hit Jupiter.

1981
01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:17.080
There's probably groups of people that you know meet at places.

1982
01:50:17.081 --> 01:50:21.460
I can talk about asteroids if you're to do,
I can do some googling for you.

1983
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:23.640
I wouldn't,
why would it go to groups when I could just talk to them online?

1984
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:24.580
I'm not sure.

1985
01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:28.330
You know you could go to any a billion websites where guys were famous for

1986
01:50:28.331 --> 01:50:30.920
finding,
but they might make it fun.
They might get pizzas.

1987
01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:35.380
Staring at the stars is fun as fuck.
Yeah,
don't get me wrong.

1988
01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:40.270
I'm not an asteroid efficient.
I know he should be.
Brian,

1989
01:50:40.271 --> 01:50:44.540
I'm going to hit you fucking crazy asshole kind of podcast.

1990
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:48.430
You try to present here,
boy,
it just too fucking weird man.
You wear people out,

1991
01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:52.260
whatever.
And now that you're on the hunt again,
weird.

1992
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:56.290
All the bitches are you weird down to bitches or they take your style.

1993
01:50:56.650 --> 01:51:00.790
I seeing you and a,
I see,
I see what you've been doing and I'm very impressed.

1994
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:04.720
You're doing good work.
How's that working?
Great.

1995
01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:06.850
Do you like being in second life?
Do you like having a girlfriend?

1996
01:51:06.851 --> 01:51:10.960
What do you know?
You know,
I,
I like having both.
I think being single is fun.

1997
01:51:10.961 --> 01:51:14.470
I think dating,
you want to kind bond.
Right now I'm just having fun because my,

1998
01:51:14.471 --> 01:51:17.980
I'm still motivated with stand up comedy that I'm just excited about that right

1999
01:51:17.981 --> 01:51:21.280
now,
so I don't even,
where can the folks here go stock you?

2000
01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:24.700
When are you gonna do standup again?
Well,
I,
I'm my Twitter.

2001
01:51:24.701 --> 01:51:27.250
I always announce if I'm usually doing the twitters,
redbox,

2002
01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:32.280
they have a show October 27th I have a part of this competition at a flappers

2003
01:51:32.861 --> 01:51:37.060
comedy club in Burbank.
It's called like Clyde's comedy content stack.
The deck.

2004
01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:39.870
Yeah.
We're going to stack the deck.
It's a couple of two for ones will stay,

2005
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:43.330
will stack the audience with people listening to the park.
That would be awesome.

2006
01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:45.880
Yeah.
But 80% will be haters.
Yeah,
they would all be,

2007
01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:50.970
<v 13>I'm fucking,
you were telling me,
say something Jay,
you ruin the whole show room.</v>

2008
01:51:50.971 --> 01:51:53.550
The momentum.
We're trying to talk about some MMA.

2009
01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:58.020
You had to put your gay shit in.
You got to start talking.

2010
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.903
KCA Pauline.

2011
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:05.170
<v 2>I love to hate.
Um,
so uh,
have you bombed yet?
Uh,
and your return?
No,</v>

2012
01:52:05.171 --> 01:52:05.711
not really.

2013
01:52:05.711 --> 01:52:08.230
I mean it's really hard to bomb it or something like five people in there,

2014
01:52:08.250 --> 01:52:09.880
you know,
it's more of just like,

2015
01:52:09.881 --> 01:52:12.400
so these are like sort of like open mic night shows.

2016
01:52:12.401 --> 01:52:14.800
There was a lot of open makers in the audience.
Well yeah,

2017
01:52:14.801 --> 01:52:17.770
there's shows that I do.
They're like five people or this show supposedly,

2018
01:52:17.771 --> 01:52:19.030
I don't know how many people are going to get it,

2019
01:52:19.031 --> 01:52:20.410
but this is going to be like a legit show.

2020
01:52:20.411 --> 01:52:22.630
I did that like a show the other day in front of like 40,

2021
01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:25.780
40 people are so fucking destroyed.
It destroyed.

2022
01:52:25.781 --> 01:52:27.100
That was the first time I destroyed Everett,

2023
01:52:27.101 --> 01:52:28.870
like I came off and people were like,
yeah,

2024
01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:34.320
so did you say October 22nd October 27th I believe would day is that it's,

2025
01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:38.500
I believe a Wednesday if if it's the right date that I did.
Right,

2026
01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:41.340
and that's at flappers comedy club,

2027
01:52:41.410 --> 01:52:44.020
which is an awesome comedy club in downtown Burbank.

2028
01:52:44.021 --> 01:52:47.630
They took an old 27th it's a Wednesday.
Yeah,
so I'm going to be there too.

2029
01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:51.110
I'll be so hoarding Brian in this endeavor and,

2030
01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:53.960
and even you got to clap and cheer it.

2031
01:52:53.961 --> 01:52:56.510
Oh my gay jokes and act like they're really cool.
I can't do that.

2032
01:52:57.230 --> 01:52:59.540
You have to be fake.
If it's not,
it was not good.
I'm not going to laugh.

2033
01:52:59.810 --> 01:53:03.130
I'm not going to lie to you.
I can't treat you with kid gloves he to,

2034
01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:07.220
but if I get super high,
I'll probably think most things will fall away.

2035
01:53:07.670 --> 01:53:11.900
So I'll just go there.
Completely inebriated and laugh.

2036
01:53:11.901 --> 01:53:14.540
Just try to remember your jokes.
I saw Joey Diaz,

2037
01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:18.740
he did a CD recording the other day in Hollywood.
He didn't want us go in there.

2038
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:23.360
Yeah,
it's actually going to go on a date there and every snuck in.
Man.

2039
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:27.560
I heard.
I wasn't,
um,
uh,

2040
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:30.020
well he was really good,
you know,
it was,
and it was interesting.

2041
01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:32.390
He told a bunch of stories that I hadn't heard before,

2042
01:53:32.391 --> 01:53:34.940
which I really didn't think was possible.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's cool.
Yeah,

2043
01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:39.740
it was the craziest thing ever.
Um,
he told some crazy fucking stories,
you know,

2044
01:53:39.741 --> 01:53:42.950
I don't want to,
uh,
give it away.
But one of them was about mugging a hooker.

2045
01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:47.180
I don't know how bad he felt about it for years later.
It was really fun.

2046
01:53:47.181 --> 01:53:50.210
Or Morris?
It was,
yeah,
it was good though.
It was a,
it was a good bit.

2047
01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:53.600
It's like funny how he lives,
like guilt and I have the same kind of guilt,

2048
01:53:53.601 --> 01:53:56.780
but my shit.
And I was like throwing rocks at it at Cardinal,
you know,

2049
01:53:56.781 --> 01:53:59.210
when I was at a kid and they threw a rock at a cardinal.
Yeah.

2050
01:53:59.211 --> 01:54:02.300
Like there's a little injured bird and it was a kid would throw rocks at it.

2051
01:54:02.301 --> 01:54:05.700
And I,
I think about that and that,
that shit all the time.
And,
uh,

2052
01:54:05.770 --> 01:54:08.570
his shit's like fucking mugged a hooker.
Do you know that?

2053
01:54:08.571 --> 01:54:12.650
They just pulled the miners out of the,
uh,
the shaft and Chile.
Are they alive?

2054
01:54:12.710 --> 01:54:17.450
Last minute worked on,
look,
this is CNN.
CNN is getting crushed.
This is cnn.com.

2055
01:54:17.451 --> 01:54:20.750
Look at it.
It's getting crushed.
They sh they cut all the,

2056
01:54:20.751 --> 01:54:24.020
they changed their whole page because they're getting so many hits.

2057
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:27.410
I think cremate,
everything's smaller.
Look at their imagery of refresh.

2058
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:31.070
Is that browser thing?
That's just when I'm brought for hitting a refresh.

2059
01:54:31.071 --> 01:54:34.310
I got it right here while the browser's fucking up because they're getting hit

2060
01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:38.420
so many times because the last minute work done ahead of Chilean mine rescue.

2061
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:40.670
Yeah.
The descent capsule.

2062
01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.670
The descent of the capsule that will carry 33 miners trapped.

2063
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:47.570
What are these guys doing for poop down there?
They just shitting in a corner.

2064
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:48.710
Probably eating it.

2065
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.360
It's probably like a never ending cycle of eating your own poop.

2066
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:56.840
Just to stay alive in your own piss and eat your own cooking.

2067
01:54:56.841 --> 01:55:00.440
I had corn before I went into this mind.
Well you can do,
um,

2068
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:02.870
you can eat your own poop.
Indians used to do it,

2069
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:07.820
they just call it second harvest actually had,
this is 100% true story.

2070
01:55:07.821 --> 01:55:10.930
I had to write a paper about ways to help,
uh,

2071
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:14.580
like it was like Africa or something like that and I was seriously read a paper.

2072
01:55:14.581 --> 01:55:17.060
It was like we used to send them a whole bunch of corn can,

2073
01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:21.050
they could wash it out and it read it twice probably.
And it was completely,

2074
01:55:21.051 --> 01:55:22.490
I tried to be completely legit.

2075
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:25.910
I was in fifth grade and I got in so much trouble for that fucking report

2076
01:55:25.911 --> 01:55:28.340
because they thought it was just being an asshole on gross and stuff like that.

2077
01:55:28.341 --> 01:55:31.790
He was being completely serious.
Like I wrote it all fancy.
I see that movie.

2078
01:55:31.791 --> 01:55:36.440
The yes man.
No.
Yes.
Men was a movie.
Yes they did.

2079
01:55:36.441 --> 01:55:38.720
That parody where they were,
they said they were going to take,
you know,

2080
01:55:38.721 --> 01:55:42.200
make burgers at a poofter came out of the toilet.
They're going to filter it.
Yes.

2081
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:44.010
No,
I didn't see you didn't see it.
It was like a

2082
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.680
<v 5>parody.
They did.
Well,
they did this,</v>

2083
01:55:45.681 --> 01:55:48.540
they trolled people and they pretended that they were going to open up this

2084
01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:51.870
plant and they going gonna make cheeseburgers that are made out of poop cow.
Wow.

2085
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:55.650
Yeah.
Seems familiar,
but,
well,
you know what man?
Uh,
it's,
it's a,

2086
01:55:55.651 --> 01:55:58.440
it's a brilliant movie.
You got to watch it.
A billion documentary.

2087
01:55:58.441 --> 01:56:00.700
I think they're doing something else too.
But you know,

2088
01:56:00.810 --> 01:56:04.440
think about how hard life has to be before you start eating your own shit.

2089
01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:07.710
You know,
the American Indians,

2090
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:11.460
that was the roughest way to live ever.
You know,

2091
01:56:11.461 --> 01:56:14.330
before the Europeans came in,
think about what,

2092
01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.830
what it must've been like before there was even horses.

2093
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:20.880
These fucking people were all on foot and they're eating their own poop.

2094
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.030
<v 2>I just is alive though.
Yeah,
they're,
mine was 33 of them,
man,</v>

2095
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:29.850
that's just jacked.
Nobody died.
And I went down.
Wow.
Yeah.
I don't know.

2096
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:34.760
<v 5>I don't understand what they were doing down there.
I don't know.
Uh,
I mean,</v>

2097
01:56:34.761 --> 01:56:36.560
I understand what they were doing.
That's how,
I mean,
I mean,

2098
01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:38.180
I don't understand how they were staying alive.

2099
01:56:38.210 --> 01:56:39.940
They must've been in some sort of a,
um,

2100
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:44.240
they might have places down there like where they can go in case or some sort of

2101
01:56:44.241 --> 01:56:46.500
a collapse of,
it's not collapsed with the whole mind,
you know,

2102
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:49.070
it's called collapse of part of the mind.
They have like a rescue center.

2103
01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.060
All right.

2104
01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:53.510
Cause it seemed like there was some place they were going that was like set up

2105
01:56:53.511 --> 01:56:56.180
for,
you know,
if something like this happen,

2106
01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:00.550
<v 2>there's a movie that came out is kind of on the subject that I recently came out</v>

2107
01:57:00.551 --> 01:57:03.310
that you should I heard is disturbing as fuck.

2108
01:57:03.311 --> 01:57:07.720
It's called the human centipede and it's based,
it's based on uh,

2109
01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:11.310
I guess real science scientific experiments.
Have you heard of this base?

2110
01:57:11.370 --> 01:57:14.120
The real side to the experience that it was.
All right.

2111
01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:17.260
So that part of the trolley,
yeah,
I heard it was actually based on facts.

2112
01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:20.380
Well maybe the Nazis might've done something like that or like Japanese,

2113
01:57:20.381 --> 01:57:23.430
some crazy experience.
World War Two,
they did some crazy shit right.

2114
01:57:23.590 --> 01:57:24.970
Where they transfused horse

2115
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:27.040
<v 5>blood into people and there's a lot of,</v>

2116
01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:30.290
they did amputation exercises and you try to,
you know,

2117
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:32.590
put people's heads on other people's bodies and show that there's a lot of

2118
01:57:32.591 --> 01:57:32.980
things.
You

2119
01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:33.551
<v 2>know what the,</v>

2120
01:57:33.551 --> 01:57:38.050
the centipede connect people's butts to their mouths and they see if they could

2121
01:57:38.230 --> 01:57:41.790
keep making it a lot.
Yeah.
It's a hard movie,
Bro.
Yeah,

2122
01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:44.530
it is a horror movie that's supposed to be a terrible horror movie.

2123
01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:48.730
It's all based on scientific.
I swear to God that that was real.

2124
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:52.150
So they're pulling people out,
man.
Wow.
They lowered the capsule.

2125
01:57:52.630 --> 01:57:54.490
I wonder how many people gave in and fucked each other.

2126
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:58.830
Like let's have some minor sex.
Might as well [inaudible] there.

2127
01:57:59.230 --> 01:58:00.620
I'll give you black lung with mine.

2128
01:58:00.650 --> 01:58:03.970
I wonder how long it takes before people start doing shit like that.
You know?

2129
01:58:03.971 --> 01:58:07.420
I think some people would have different time tables and make it like,
to me,

2130
01:58:07.630 --> 01:58:10.300
I'd be happy masturbating forever for life.

2131
01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:14.150
I would look at a canary or if you went to jail for life.
For Life,
yeah.

2132
01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:17.380
I would totally just be happy masturbating.
Just like some sweet,

2133
01:58:17.381 --> 01:58:19.890
sweet boy wants to suck your Dick did.
Unless it was like,

2134
01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:22.010
like Justin Bieber style or something like that.

2135
01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:25.810
So you would do it if it was a little boy.
So do it if you looked under it.
Yeah.

2136
01:58:25.811 --> 01:58:28.430
No,
I'm just kidding.
No,
to me,
I am happy with masturbation.

2137
01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.430
I think masturbation is great.
I have no problem.

2138
01:58:30.450 --> 01:58:32.350
Now if I'm in jail and I have nothing to look at it,

2139
01:58:32.351 --> 01:58:34.990
I'd probably have to draw my own women and stuff like that,
you know?

2140
01:58:34.991 --> 01:58:36.820
And that would draw you.
We'll just go from memory.

2141
01:58:36.821 --> 01:58:39.640
You'd go for your own after a while you won't have memory anymore.
Would you?

2142
01:58:39.710 --> 01:58:42.310
Would you kind of get to foggy?
Have some memories from my childhood.

2143
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:45.850
I would drop right when he got in there and draw a vagina and boobs and stuff

2144
01:58:45.851 --> 01:58:50.250
just so I have references.
Never what they look like.
Yeah.

2145
01:58:50.251 --> 01:58:52.810
You would think that at least they could get them some fucking pulling her in

2146
01:58:52.811 --> 01:58:54.790
jail,
man.
That shit was fake,
right?

2147
01:58:54.791 --> 01:58:58.240
Like that where you're allowed to have sex dates or is that Rio?
No.

2148
01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:00.900
In some prisons they have it set up like that.
They would,

2149
01:59:00.901 --> 01:59:04.630
they would allow them to have conjugal visits where they're allowed to have sex.

2150
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:08.740
Yeah.
Yeah.
They do that in some places,
but I don't know if that happens anymore.

2151
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:11.410
Does that still going on?
I don't know.
I see.

2152
01:59:11.411 --> 01:59:14.920
I never knew he existed to begin with,
so yeah,
it was a real deal.
I don't know.

2153
01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:19.150
I'm not,
I'm not hip to what's going on in prison these days.

2154
01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.670
There's a lot of God damn prison shows on TV though.

2155
01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:25.510
Have you seen the one with the booty bandit?

2156
01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:28.960
You gotta talks about booty [inaudible] one of the most frightening things ever.

2157
01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:33.010
I'm going to load it up because,
uh,
you need to,
to know that this,

2158
01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:36.710
these guys like this waiting for you.
There's guys like this guy.

2159
01:59:36.711 --> 01:59:37.930
I'm waiting for you in prison.

2160
01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:42.310
<v 6>I can only,
yeah,</v>

2161
01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:47.890
<v 2>yeah,
the Buddhi warrior.
Okay.
I'm going to load this shit up.</v>

2162
01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:51.693
<v 6>Wasn't that,</v>

2163
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:56.740
that's fine.

2164
01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:59.720
<v 14>Buried deeper homosexuality areas,</v>

2165
02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.313
sexuality.

2166
02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.750
You have it on twice somewhere.

2167
02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:12.830
<v 6>No,
I only have it on here.
You have to eat your windows up.
Yeah,</v>

2168
02:00:12.831 --> 02:00:16.730
but it's not the same thing.
This is something else.
That's something else.

2169
02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:20.960
I only have it in here.
Oh,
what's this one?
All right.
Yes,
this is it.

2170
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:25.850
I said plain twice.
I don't know.
You're the fake tech support here.

2171
02:00:27.650 --> 02:00:28.483
I bet.

2172
02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:33.700
<v 14>Police told us about the place police told us was,</v>

2173
02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:37.820
you have the use that's,
oh,
is that what it is?

2174
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:41.583
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2175
02:00:42.610 --> 02:00:43.443
<v 14>Jesus.</v>

2176
02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:47.840
<v 2>This is the most unprofessional setup ever.
Tow free.</v>

2177
02:00:47.841 --> 02:00:50.480
Call you console free.
They're trying to sell me real estate.

2178
02:00:50.481 --> 02:00:51.820
Order that answer that.

2179
02:00:52.670 --> 02:00:55.640
<v 14>No,
but when lockup visited Kentucky state penitentiary,</v>

2180
02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:01.300
we met police jobs a long time in men who practices are very different kind of

2181
02:01:02.241 --> 02:01:07.180
homosexuality.
Well,
we have sexual desires.
Right?

2182
02:01:08.810 --> 02:01:12.820
Locked up.
You got warm place all along.

2183
02:01:13.090 --> 02:01:13.923
<v 1>Oh Lord.</v>

2184
02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:18.560
<v 14>Oh,
hold on.
I'm calling him out on that safety.
Do Five.
So when I'd be home,</v>

2185
02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:20.660
do all made them happen.

2186
02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.160
[inaudible] is going out to people's mood.

2187
02:01:25.610 --> 02:01:30.610
Does it say the most memorable story that the police told us?

2188
02:01:31.570 --> 02:01:35.220
This is why David Hale,
one of the producers and I met this dude.

2189
02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:40.240
He talked to them about this meeting within a maximum security penitentiary and

2190
02:01:40.791 --> 02:01:44.210
he went on about it and on about it.
And it's prison.

2191
02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:47.920
Do you want,
um,

2192
02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:51.650
more important for Armenians,
but,

2193
02:01:53.590 --> 02:01:54.423
<v 11>hmm.</v>

2194
02:01:55.710 --> 02:01:59.290
<v 14>It was more broad job,
sir.
It looked booming.</v>

2195
02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.060
I have lots of booty.

2196
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:07.310
One more drink and drinking water.

2197
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:13.760
<v 0>Was that guy projecting like as I no feeling and he's just like,
yeah,</v>

2198
02:02:13.770 --> 02:02:15.870
everybody likes it more than water.
I don't know

2199
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:20.000
<v 2>whether he's just trying to beat sensational for the TV show and just like</v>

2200
02:02:20.001 --> 02:02:21.290
really freak everybody out.

2201
02:02:21.690 --> 02:02:24.440
I don't know if he just likes fucking people that much.

2202
02:02:24.441 --> 02:02:25.910
He just loves beauty that much I think.

2203
02:02:25.911 --> 02:02:29.240
I think he personally would like to ask some more than anything.

2204
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:33.500
Well he's talking about how it's,
that's how they rock it in jail.
I mean you got,

2205
02:02:33.501 --> 02:02:34.550
he's the only one in jail.

2206
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:37.580
You got to think there's a possibility that he's telling the truth that

2207
02:02:37.581 --> 02:02:39.550
everybody's just running around fucking everybody.

2208
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.360
Is that if you have probably like a life sentence,

2209
02:02:41.361 --> 02:02:45.710
there's probably a good 70% of people that just flip over.
I don't.
Yeah,

2210
02:02:45.711 --> 02:02:48.550
I don't think I would,
but I don't,
I'm not putting that situation.

2211
02:02:48.590 --> 02:02:51.260
You were in jail with this guy though,
that guy.
You will.

2212
02:02:51.261 --> 02:02:53.950
You got to give up the booty.
You think you can fight them off?
Yeah,

2213
02:02:53.951 --> 02:02:57.310
he's got a weak chin.
I don't like that.
You think you can fight them off or no,

2214
02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:00.620
you don't like to wait?
Like if he attacks me,
give up the booty.
If he attacks me,

2215
02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:05.420
raped you.
Ah,
fuck.
I don't know that guy.
I can beat that guy.
Really?

2216
02:03:05.421 --> 02:03:08.560
You think you could beat this big black dangerous rape dude?

2217
02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:11.050
If he likes asked that much,
I could totally beat that guy.
Well,

2218
02:03:11.070 --> 02:03:11.691
let's see what this is.

2219
02:03:11.691 --> 02:03:14.240
How he would take the pussy tells guys how it takes the boy pussy.

2220
02:03:14.650 --> 02:03:19.650
<v 14>I like boot Johnson went on to tell our crew how we used to satisfy his sexual</v>

2221
02:03:19.781 --> 02:03:20.614
desires,

2222
02:03:21.370 --> 02:03:26.370
especially during the 1970s and eighties when he was most active in personal

2223
02:03:26.411 --> 02:03:30.510
security was more lax one out to see one.

2224
02:03:32.090 --> 02:03:35.610
Any school to me when I go see him,
I'll say

2225
02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:41.270
mountain,
you are.
Um,

2226
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:43.130
I like you mulch

2227
02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:50.370
and we can do it the easy way out a hallway.
Solid.

2228
02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:53.300
Chauncey,
y'all on the phone.
We can do this thing

2229
02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:58.290
<v 2>easy way or the hard way.
The choice is yours,
right?
What'd you do,</v>

2230
02:03:58.291 --> 02:04:01.980
Brian?
If he said that to me,
I'd be like,
all right,

2231
02:04:01.981 --> 02:04:06.390
but let me get down on your first and then like you'll take his pants off,
right?

2232
02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:09.630
And I would just like fucking start karate chopping his dick as hard as I could.

2233
02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:10.740
Do you really think that's gonna work?

2234
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:17.900
<v 0>First of all,
you'd probably be hypnotized by it.
Like a Cobra to a flute.</v>

2235
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:21.750
I would probably look at that big giant black fucking snake in front of you.

2236
02:04:21.751 --> 02:04:23.510
You might start [inaudible] out of fear.

2237
02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:27.920
I would probably grab it as hard as I could run as fast as I could.

2238
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:29.630
You would tap it off

2239
02:04:35.170 --> 02:04:38.580
to the worst Magog class ever.

2240
02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:45.360
You would be though the worst self defense instructor of all time.
Okay.

2241
02:04:45.361 --> 02:04:48.360
This is what we want to do.
No,
I probably would do some tech story.

2242
02:04:48.361 --> 02:04:51.360
I'd probably like,
could you imagine if you had,
this is your fucking plan.

2243
02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:55.440
Imagine if somebody hired someone to do like a rape prevention course and you

2244
02:04:55.441 --> 02:04:58.260
were the guy and that you would come in and you were totally unqualified.

2245
02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:01.380
I W we're going to grab the Dick.
We're going to run as hard as we can.

2246
02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:04.710
We're going to try to rip it off.
You'd have all these people were practicing,

2247
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:08.370
like if he's got his dick and it's on the floor,

2248
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:11.040
do you think he's going to be worried about hurting you or getting his ticket

2249
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:14.820
tach back to his body?
He's not going to spend the time to kick your ass.

2250
02:05:14.850 --> 02:05:19.290
Trust me.
If you pull his dick off,
the fight is over.
I called this move.

2251
02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:21.420
Picking up the phone book,
take the grab,

2252
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:25.770
grab the balls as hard as you can and just pull it up as fast as you can own

2253
02:05:25.771 --> 02:05:29.040
book.
Yeah,
imagine that.
Imagine if you were to do that.
Like if you're like,

2254
02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:30.750
all right,
let me go down on you and you take,

2255
02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:34.810
you take his balls in both of your hand and take two handfuls is hard as you can

2256
02:05:34.811 --> 02:05:39.080
crab and you just dig your claws in and just like Paul and,

2257
02:05:39.230 --> 02:05:40.860
and rip as fast as you can.
Well,

2258
02:05:40.861 --> 02:05:43.550
you might be able to rip someone's testicles off,
right?
It might be possible.

2259
02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:45.960
Someone's test scores.
You have a good grip.

2260
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:48.210
If you knew you were going to get raped in prison,

2261
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:50.350
wouldn't you do something like this?
Balls were all sweaty.

2262
02:05:50.351 --> 02:05:53.430
Then they slipped right out.
Oh,
that's what you have to dig.
My nails are courts,

2263
02:05:53.431 --> 02:05:56.700
ankle slips right out.
And then you've got,
what are you going to do now?

2264
02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:59.300
He's going to beat the fuck out.
He tried to grab his balls.
Yeah.

2265
02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:02.640
Dig your nails in,
man.
Go for it.
Put your finger underneath the vein.

2266
02:06:02.641 --> 02:06:05.310
That's where that would be.
Your self defense would always be attack the ball,

2267
02:06:05.610 --> 02:06:09.750
the ball off with two hands.
It's that dude in prison.
Decimal that style.
Yeah.

2268
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:12.660
What if he punches you first?
Uh,
I don't care about you first.

2269
02:06:12.661 --> 02:06:14.060
I'm going to write for his shit.

2270
02:06:14.090 --> 02:06:17.100
He punches you in the face before he even makes you suck his dick just Bob
Bland.

2271
02:06:17.101 --> 02:06:18.870
Just to let you know,
this is how it's going down.
Well,

2272
02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:21.270
I probably wouldn't wipe my ass too much when I was in prison.

2273
02:06:21.271 --> 02:06:24.000
So even if he did knock me down and he went for,
you'd be like,
oh,

2274
02:06:24.001 --> 02:06:25.860
this shit stinks.
I can't go from the chest.

2275
02:06:26.130 --> 02:06:28.680
You would sacrifice and you'd be itchy all to get used to it.

2276
02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:31.540
Probably get used to it.
This guy scares the fuck out of me,
man.

2277
02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:34.480
That guy is crazy.
It's fucking crazy for me.

2278
02:06:34.570 --> 02:06:37.950
Things like half of me thinks he's just all fucking fake.
I don't think so,
dude.

2279
02:06:38.110 --> 02:06:39.780
I'm willing.
I think it's true.
You know?
I mean,

2280
02:06:39.930 --> 02:06:42.750
I don't think there's a whole lot of rape and he looks like cee Lo green though.

2281
02:06:42.810 --> 02:06:44.240
Can,
he's like,
I'm on,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.

2282
02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:47.750
<v 14>[inaudible] kit in general was also had a ward,</v>

2283
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:49.790
but the new generation of inmates,

2284
02:06:50.150 --> 02:06:53.040
they might be asking for trouble from old timers and old.

2285
02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:58.060
They get this by what they say the pain is they for this will stay on in

2286
02:06:59.391 --> 02:07:03.660
college.
Some.
Some of them will stay on if you know this too.
All right.

2287
02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:08.850
See what they want for pile up.
It's my fault.
You said you'll pray with it.

2288
02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:13.020
Her man,
somebody be up in your cart,
you know,
and it did that.
So

2289
02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:16.880
<v 0>it looks like Randy from American idol.
I'm not scared of that guy.
When</v>

2290
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:20.720
<v 14>he was in his prime,
they wouldn't be saved from Ajay advantages either.</v>

2291
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.823
The camera man,

2292
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:26.830
he's saying [inaudible] in her back then and as much starlight booty off

2293
02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:31.300
probably that want to know,
but hey,

2294
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:36.150
now we're bronco pains and then do the,
this

2295
02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:42.250
[inaudible] got no shame in my game.
This is nothing that I'm ashamed to admit.

2296
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:47.730
I am what I am to you and all of a sudden warrior [inaudible],

2297
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:51.520
I'm a warrior.

2298
02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:53.890
<v 2>I'm a booty stealing warrior.
See to me,</v>

2299
02:07:53.891 --> 02:07:57.220
I see the gay in that guy and to me it just sounds like he's just like,

2300
02:07:57.221 --> 02:08:00.610
I'm going to get him.
I want to get his butt hole.
He and I'm like,

2301
02:08:00.611 --> 02:08:03.400
that doesn't scare me in jail for life.
Are you crazy?

2302
02:08:03.401 --> 02:08:07.150
He's probably murdered of gang of people and he will fuck you up if you were

2303
02:08:07.151 --> 02:08:08.590
alone in a cage with that guy.

2304
02:08:08.591 --> 02:08:11.560
And he pulled out his black digging and we go and do this.
The easy way,

2305
02:08:11.561 --> 02:08:15.730
all the hobbies,
weight started dropping fucking knuckles on your face.

2306
02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:18.360
You think you can jack up his balls off so you'd be willing to,

2307
02:08:18.361 --> 02:08:19.350
if I can get this guy parole,

2308
02:08:19.351 --> 02:08:22.300
do you'd be willing to do I occasion match with him?
No.
No,

2309
02:08:22.301 --> 02:08:23.200
I'm not saying cage match.

2310
02:08:23.201 --> 02:08:25.860
I'm just saying if I'm in a cell with him and he approaches me,
I'll be,

2311
02:08:25.890 --> 02:08:27.790
I'll go for it.
Oh,

2312
02:08:27.791 --> 02:08:30.970
I will totally suck your big black day and then I'll go down like I'm going to

2313
02:08:30.971 --> 02:08:34.330
do it.
Just start ripping shit up.
And you think that would work.
Totally.

2314
02:08:34.331 --> 02:08:37.200
We're totally fucking snap his dick and happen every good boy.

2315
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:40.570
He's still in the cage with you and now he's hurt.
Yeah.
In doing it.

2316
02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.450
I'm going to keep on doing it.
You're going to start crying.

2317
02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:43.480
Nobody comes to your rescue.

2318
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:47.050
Never start kicking his little ball hole wherever it falls were

2319
02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:53.680
fucking,
I'm Geez.
Little Boho murder him from the Dick.
So yes,
totally.

2320
02:08:53.681 --> 02:08:57.370
But what if as you're going down to go to his dick,
he needs you in the face?
No,

2321
02:08:57.371 --> 02:08:57.971
because he doesn't know.

2322
02:08:57.971 --> 02:09:00.490
He thinks I'm going down on him to suck his dick and I was good actor.

2323
02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:04.450
I'm a totally good,
I don't think you're going to come off.
She never asked.

2324
02:09:06.130 --> 02:09:09.460
You'll throw on a gay voice.
Oh,
totally.
I'll totally break out and everything.

2325
02:09:09.461 --> 02:09:13.390
I would fucking as an analyst of a altercations,
which I am,

2326
02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:16.240
I'm an altercation at a an altercation analyst.

2327
02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:18.760
I think you're fucked in this one.
Yeah,

2328
02:09:19.090 --> 02:09:21.380
I think he's going to be looking for you to do something like that.

2329
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:24.070
It's probably other guys tried to grab his dick before you think you gotta be

2330
02:09:24.071 --> 02:09:26.570
the first person.
I'll drag them if I can look these guys,

2331
02:09:26.571 --> 02:09:28.240
he's going to punch you in your face a few times.

2332
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:30.910
If I look them in the eyes and be released,
sincere with my voice and I'm like,

2333
02:09:30.911 --> 02:09:33.970
look,
I really think we should do this because we're going to be in here while he

2334
02:09:33.971 --> 02:09:37.330
likes rape.
What have you,
doesn't get hard.
Look the normal way.
I'll be like,
look,

2335
02:09:37.331 --> 02:09:40.090
first I want to lick you off.
You know?
I'll say so I can.

2336
02:09:40.710 --> 02:09:44.290
He's obviously not bright guy.
I could trick him with my words and my eyes.

2337
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:47.530
We doesn't seem that dumb.
He just seemed to fuck.
He's in prison.
He got caught.

2338
02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:51.700
Well,
he's a criminal,
Brian.
A lot of them are just,
they're doing so much crime.

2339
02:09:51.701 --> 02:09:56.020
They just will get caught.
You gotta be smart.
Dexter didn't get caught.
Oh,

2340
02:09:56.021 --> 02:10:00.850
Brian,
I think he would rape you.
All right.
Okay.
I don't think he'd raped me,

2341
02:10:01.150 --> 02:10:02.770
but I think he'd raped you.
I think a,

2342
02:10:02.771 --> 02:10:05.600
we'd have a problem though if he and I were in jail together.
Hmm.

2343
02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:10.050
I don't think you would not try to rape me.
I think he definitely works.
I think.

2344
02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:14.350
Yeah,
I think you'd probably tried to,
everybody smoked cigarettes though.
Sorry,

2345
02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:15.790
I've got a question.
His gas tank.

2346
02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:20.180
Why are we always talking about gay sex on this shit?
Cause we're,

2347
02:10:20.181 --> 02:10:24.910
we're targeting how many people are like assholes until this is fascinating

2348
02:10:24.911 --> 02:10:28.180
fucking guy man.
This isn't just talking about gay sex.

2349
02:10:28.181 --> 02:10:32.020
What's fascinating to me is about this guy being so brazen about it,

2350
02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:34.100
but he's just talking about it and like

2351
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.160
<v 5>he's obviously loving the attention at all.
Those cameras are putting on them.</v>

2352
02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:39.920
So I'm trying to figure out how much of this is true.

2353
02:10:40.130 --> 02:10:43.400
I'm trying to figure out how much of it is just he's,
you know,

2354
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:46.940
exaggerating everything to seem even cooler for this TV show because he knows

2355
02:10:46.941 --> 02:10:49.040
they're going to air them and he's probably a fucking star now.

2356
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:53.170
They have TV in prison so they probably have seen this show and som saying I,

2357
02:10:53.171 --> 02:10:55.760
he probably went out and tried to rape somebody that night just to fucking

2358
02:10:55.761 --> 02:10:58.280
celebrate.
Right.
I don't know.

2359
02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.740
What if he can probably listen to this podcast and he's sitting there fucking

2360
02:11:00.741 --> 02:11:05.600
like,
if I get ever get out here,
I'm going to show this boy,
I'll beat that dude.

2361
02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:08.920
Don't worry about it bro.
We'll get him.
We'll get him before he comes near you.

2362
02:11:09.010 --> 02:11:12.050
Thanks.
I would suck.

2363
02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:17.360
There's no way we can end the show this way,
but yet we are doing it.

2364
02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.940
I would buy that guy a fleshlight like,
dude,
wait,
calm down second.

2365
02:11:19.941 --> 02:11:22.250
That's not what he wants.
Or the Guy Asshole.
Maybe he likes it.

2366
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:24.980
They have butthole flashlights.
It doesn't feel as good.

2367
02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:28.700
Holding a person down the whole.
You'd be in panic and your blood,

2368
02:11:28.701 --> 02:11:31.550
sweat and all that.
He'd probably,
that's what you probably looked forward to.

2369
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:36.200
Probably looks forward to the whole domination aspect of it is we've officially

2370
02:11:36.201 --> 02:11:40.640
crossed the line and uh,
talked about way too much gay shit on this podcast.

2371
02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:44.690
No more gay shit.
The entire next podcast.
Yes.
Next.

2372
02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:49.400
Next podcast has to be a all gay humor free.
Yes.

2373
02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:54.050
Um,
uh,
Brody Stevens.
Uh,

2374
02:11:54.051 --> 02:11:57.470
you guys are great.
Thank you for tuning in.
This was a very strange,

2375
02:11:57.530 --> 02:12:00.230
like this podcast.
What are strange?

2376
02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:03.470
I think we did get a little bit too high because when I started talking about

2377
02:12:03.471 --> 02:12:06.320
the,
um,
the tea party,
I started talking about it.
I was like,
you know what?

2378
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:07.820
I don't really even know what they like.

2379
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:11.070
I started talking shit about them and I'm like,
I don't even know what a,

2380
02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:14.150
what's annoying me about them?
They may be delightful people.
No,

2381
02:12:14.151 --> 02:12:17.120
they're definitely not delighting people there.
They're ridiculous.

2382
02:12:17.590 --> 02:12:20.930
You're fucking ridiculous.
It,
it's just gave voters,
they're all crazy.

2383
02:12:21.170 --> 02:12:24.340
I don't know what their stance is,
but I know they're crazy personally here.

2384
02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:26.240
Glenn Beck and fucking Sarah Palin talking farm.

2385
02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.430
So I wouldn't have even gone down that road.

2386
02:12:28.431 --> 02:12:32.180
I don't think you felt wasn't so high.
But since I've been high,

2387
02:12:32.181 --> 02:12:34.610
I've been forced to take a position.
My position is,
they're crazy.

2388
02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:38.390
When that guy who dresses up like a Nazi,
uh,
for sure,

2389
02:12:38.391 --> 02:12:42.430
he said nigger somewhere in his life for sure.
Right?
He doesn't like Jews.

2390
02:12:42.450 --> 02:12:46.160
You think that he has ever touched a child?
It could be.

2391
02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:49.070
It could be touched a child.
He's,
something's wrong with that dude.

2392
02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:53.300
There's definitely something very,
very wrong with him.
Um,
you know,
you,
you don't,

2393
02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:57.080
you don't go around dressing like the most evil fucks that ever existed when

2394
02:12:57.081 --> 02:13:02.081
people still alive were detained by these people and their families were killed.

2395
02:13:04.210 --> 02:13:06.050
That's,
that's,
that's like people that are alive right now.

2396
02:13:06.230 --> 02:13:09.030
It's one thing if you want to dress up like a fucking barbarian,
you know,

2397
02:13:09.031 --> 02:13:14.031
and put a big bear skin fucking thing on and crazy bone like teeth,

2398
02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:17.030
like necklaces and stuff.

2399
02:13:17.031 --> 02:13:19.560
Do you want to dress like somebody who looks like who was the enemy,
right?

2400
02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:24.370
10,000 years ago,
but not in 1945.
All right.
Stop.
Right,

2401
02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:28.010
right.
Can you imagine the future when they have like browser reenactments?

2402
02:13:28.011 --> 02:13:31.500
Like they,
you know,
like reenactments from like companies.
Like,
all right,

2403
02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:32.100
I'm going to play

2404
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.710
<v 2>the role of Microsoft.
Yeah.
I'm going to play a role as you know,</v>

2405
02:13:35.590 --> 02:13:39.960
and we're going to mildly bore each other for the next two hours to teach our

2406
02:13:39.961 --> 02:13:41.890
kids what happened.
That's why.

2407
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:46.050
Could you imagine if someone who wants to play Steve Jobs or I'm Steve Jobs and

2408
02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:48.300
I'm Steve Wasniak and we created apple.
Right?

2409
02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:52.420
And they're dressing the part.
Yeah.
I'll reenactments

2410
02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:53.111
<v 5>tarted.</v>

2411
02:13:53.111 --> 02:13:56.710
It doesn't matter what you're reenacting with its software wars or civil wars,

2412
02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:58.430
like what are you doing?
You're,
you're,

2413
02:13:58.431 --> 02:14:03.010
you're getting together and play pretending.
Don't you have a family?
You Fuck,

2414
02:14:03.370 --> 02:14:07.480
you know,
don't you have a life?
Don't you have things to do?
Nope.
No,
no.

2415
02:14:07.630 --> 02:14:10.030
We don't either.
That's why we did the podcast today.
That's right.

2416
02:14:10.330 --> 02:14:15.020
And you're going to be going to London for UFC.
Yes.
Going to London and,
uh,

2417
02:14:15.070 --> 02:14:17.620
we'll be back next Tuesday with Bobby Lee.

2418
02:14:18.070 --> 02:14:22.570
Bobby Lee wants to do it next Tuesday and maybe Joe Diaz will join us again if

2419
02:14:22.571 --> 02:14:25.690
he can break free of his other,
uh,
commitments.

2420
02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:29.020
Joe Dia's is a wanted man these days though.
He's got a lot of shit going on.

2421
02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:33.730
[inaudible] he,
uh,
you know,
did the CD taping the other night,
right?

2422
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:35.980
The other thing he's going to do more of them.
There was only like,
you know,

2423
02:14:35.981 --> 02:14:37.240
it wasn't like the biggest crowd there.

2424
02:14:37.241 --> 02:14:38.830
They weren't sure whether or not they were going to record.

2425
02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:41.620
They weren't sure whether or not they're going to have the room because it's,
um,

2426
02:14:41.950 --> 02:14:45.500
it's all,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
south comedy hall has,

2427
02:14:45.730 --> 02:14:49.120
they lost their liquor license or some sort of occupancy problem cause something

2428
02:14:49.121 --> 02:14:50.890
that landlord did.
So they're opening up a new club.

2429
02:14:50.891 --> 02:14:52.570
So he's going to have a new club and like a couple of weeks.

2430
02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:55.750
<v 2>And if you live anywhere near Santa Ana and 10 days are going to be at this</v>

2431
02:14:55.751 --> 02:14:58.880
sweet ass theater called the galaxy theater.
It looks bad ass.

2432
02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:01.860
<v 5>The Santa Ana Galaxy Theater is,
um,</v>

2433
02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:05.970
that is on the 22nd at 10.
Uh,
yeah,

2434
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:08.680
I think there's still some tickets available for that.
And uh,

2435
02:15:08.681 --> 02:15:09.570
that's going to be a good time.

2436
02:15:09.571 --> 02:15:12.270
I don't even know how I'm doing it with probably Joey,
if Joey's around,

2437
02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:16.530
if he's free that night.
And uh,
that weekend is the UFC.
So this weekend to UFC,

2438
02:15:16.531 --> 02:15:18.120
weekends in a row,
this one's in London.

2439
02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:22.230
I got two shows at the Lester Square theater.
And um,

2440
02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.330
then of course the 16th,

2441
02:15:24.331 --> 02:15:29.331
it's on Spike TV and then UFC one 21 is the 23rd.

2442
02:15:29.610 --> 02:15:33.330
And that one is,
uh,
on paper view and it's going to be fucking crazy.

2443
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:37.620
So that's it.
That's the end of the program.
Thank you very much for tuning in,

2444
02:15:37.650 --> 02:15:41.700
ladies and gentlemen.
Um,

uh,
enjoy you all.

2445
02:15:41.850 --> 02:15:46.350
We appreciate you all.
We wish we had something to end the show with.

2446
02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:50.520
Let's do that.
That,
that,
uh,
Deanwood song.
Yeah,
hit me.

2447
02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:55.560
Hit me with that shit cause it just came out today.
