00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.520
&gt;&gt; Nicole Chung: Good afternoon.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.430
My name's Nicole Chung, and
I'm with "The Washington Post,"

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.060
which is a charter sponsor of
The National Book Festival.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.910
First, a word of thanks for our
co-chairman of the festival,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.210
David Rubenstein
[assumed spelling],

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.440
and the other generous sponsors
who've made this event possible.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.830
please note the information
in your program.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.720
We'll have some time after this
presentation for your questions,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.550
and I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.980
to the microphone, you will

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.910
of this event, which may be
broadcast at a later date.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.360
Our guest this afternoon
is Brendan Kiely,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.620
who is an amazing young
adult author about books all

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.600
about love in different
shapes and forms.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.950
His most recent book is
<i>Tradition </i>, and before that,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.070
he was a co-author of
<i>All American Boys </i>with

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.370
Jason Reynolds.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.410
In addition, he also wrote
<i>The Last True Love Story </i>.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.710
And without further ado,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.510
please welcome Brendan
Kiely to the stage.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.060
[ Applause ]

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.360
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely:
How's it going?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.760
All right.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.940
I can't see you at all,
so if I can hear you,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.910
it just makes me feel like
I'm not alone in the room.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.780
So I appreciate that.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.020
Thanks, everyone.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.050
It is such an honor
to be invited to speak

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.830
at The National Book Festival.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.630
I think a lot about how
sometimes we read articles,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.360
and they're, you
know, threatening.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.240
Oh, you know, books are dying.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.540
Publishing is dying.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.840
People aren't reading.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.800
And then you read other
articles, and you, I think,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.940
have to look to young
folks, as we often do,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.670
to think about how
there's so much passion

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.490
for so much literature
right now.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.540
Especially as we think
about a publishing industry

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.960
that is ever-so-slowly thinking
about how to broaden the scope

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.130
of the kinds of stories that
we hear, the kinds of stories

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.900
that we publish, and
the kinds of stories

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.710
that have always existed
out there, and just needed

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.860
to be published to
a wider audience.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.390
And so, for me to say all
this in context as being part

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.770
of The National Book Festival
I think is really important --

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.700
that we think about what it
means to be writing books

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.110
for the entire nation, and to
be thinking about what it means

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.830
to be part of that tradition, as
opposed to some other traditions

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.990
that I will get into
in a moment.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.350
But before I talk
about tradition,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.440
I want to just give you
a little bit of context

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.150
about Brendan Kiely,
and who I am,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.230
and sort of where I come from,
and how I became a writer.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.070
And to do that, I want to take
you back to my very first book,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.340
which was called <i>The
Gospel of Winter </i>.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.880
I'm from the Boston area,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.170
and I grew up in an Irish
Catholic community, household,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.810
big family, went to
Catholic schools.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.610
And I was dismayed when

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.770
"The Boston Globe" broke the
news story on January 6th

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.130
of 2002 about the scandal of
abuse in the Catholic Church --

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.290
the vast cover-up of scandal --
of abuse in the Catholic Church.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.070
I watched at dinner
table conversations

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.450
as family members would
go to war with each other,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.190
some people saying, "This is
now a time to double-down,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.990
and show our faith," other
people saying, "Now is the time

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.310
where I say good-bye
to this church,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.660
and I never return ever again."

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.380
And to see families
at war with each other

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.780
in that way made me think
a lot about what it means

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.630
to be a young person
watching their families at war

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.350
in this way, or watching their
communities at war in this way.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.780
And what does it mean to be
a young person who's trying

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.740
to navigate all of that
struggle and that strife?

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.370
And it was really important to
me, especially, because of all

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.850
that particular connection
that I had to that news story.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.560
So when I wrote my book
<i>The Gospel of Winter </i>,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.950
which is about a 16-year-old
boy who's struggling

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.210
to decide whether or not he
should tell the world he's been

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.850
abused by his priest,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.450
I was really nervous,
as you can imagine.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.680
I was especially nervous what
my family would say, right?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.610
"Brendan, you shouldn't be
talking about that stuff!"

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.120
Instead, I felt like I had to,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.440
but I did one wise thing
while working on this book.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.940
I gave an early copy to my
grandmother, the matriarch

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.080
of the family, Grandma Kiely.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.640
We call her St. Jane in
the family [laughter],

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.490
and she is St. Jane
in so many ways.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.470
And I was nervous.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.400
What is Grandma going
to think of this book?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.450
She wrote back to me after she'd
read the early advance copy

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.170
of the book, and she wrote
this note to me, by the way,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.770
on Facebook -- Cyber
Grandma [laughter].

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.700
It was pretty remarkable
to receive her note,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.190
because she said, "Brendan,
this book reminds me

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.180
of Solomon asking God
for a listening heart."

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.140
And I think about that line, and
I will probably choke up halfway

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.970
through saying this now.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.010
I think about that line,
about what it means

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.030
to have a listening heart.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.680
And I realized that Grandma
-- Grandma was, as always,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.460
so much wiser than
I will ever be.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.810
And she put to words what
I realized was my mission

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.410
in writing books for young
folks, writing books for adults,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.690
writing books for anyone
who wants to think about --

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.120
how do we voice the
emotional experience of living

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.320
in communities that
feel like they're at war

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.650
with each other in so many ways?

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.720
Maybe what we need is to
find these listening hearts.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.810
And so, I try to write books
with a listening heart,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.800
and I try to write
books about people

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.650
who are discovering what it
means to look for and find,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.660
and to embrace their
own listening hearts.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.960
And so, the second book

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.310
that I wrote is called <i>The
Last True Love Story </i>,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.530
and of course, who do I
want to write this book for?

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.130
My grandmother, because
it was a story about --

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.960
in short, it's a story about
a family that's grappling

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.340
with a grandfather who
has Alzheimer's disease.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.660
And I wrote that book because my
grandmother was there as a rock

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.970
as my grandfather was passing
away from Alzheimer's disease.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.400
And <i>The Last True Love
Story </i>is about two teens

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.470
who spring an
Alzheimer's-afflicted

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.600
grandfather from an
assisted-living facility

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.310
in Los Angeles, and take him

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.710
on a cross-country road
trip to Ithaca, New York.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.350
To the hill where he
first kissed his wife,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.200
so that he can try to
hold onto the memories

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.370
of her before the disease
takes them all away.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.990
And, meanwhile, the two
teens are falling in love

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.780
for the first time, because my
grandmother was 19 years old

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.570
when she married my grandfather.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.100
And I think about that fact,
because I think about --

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.380
regardless of how we feel about
those laws, or those customs,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.370
or those traditions, or
whatever it might be,

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.550
I think about the capacity of
young folks to fall in love.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.950
That's a real thing
that I want to honor.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.020
There are some of you in
this room who might be teens

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.000
who are falling in love.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.490
Awesome! I'm excited for you!

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.790
It's a great feeling!

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.530
And as my grandfather
told me one night,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.260
when I was interviewing
him, as he was passing away

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.330
from Alzheimer's disease -- I
was trying to get his stories

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.120
of the sort of hard-scrabble
Irish immigrant stories

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.110
in western Massachusetts.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.640
I really wanted to write a
historical novel, you see.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.940
But that's not what he
wanted to talk about.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.480
All he wanted to talk
about every night

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.310
as I interviewed him, as
his mind wandered around,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.640
and he lost his place
in his storytelling --

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.290
all he wanted to talk
about was my grandmother,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.710
and how they fell in love.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.010
He'd get lost in his stories,

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.510
and he'd reach over,
and he'd hold my arm.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.710
And he'd say, "Brendan, this
is why I love your grandmother.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.790
This is why I love
your grandmother.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.830
She was the rock."

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.220
And so I thought about -- well,
I have to write this story

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.640
about what it means to try to
talk about love near the end

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.990
of life, and how maybe the
one thing you want to talk

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.590
about are those moments
when you first learned how

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.950
to fall in love.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.840
Those moments where you
first learned what it meant

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.820
to open your heart
up to somebody else,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.710
and to have them open
their heart up to you.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.170
And so, <i>The Last True Love
Story </i>is that dual narrative

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.350
of trying to hold onto
love at the end of life,

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.720
and what it means to be falling
in love for the first time,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.520
and travelling across
the country.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.780
But love, as -- I really
appreciate your introduction

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.230
so much, because so
often, people want to say,

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.060
"Brendan writes about
social justice."

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.040
And yes, I do, and I care about
that, but I think at the first

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.380
of social justice is love.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.610
And so, I so appreciate that
introduction, because as I begin

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.120
to talk about these next
two books, I want folks

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.660
to understand that
the place I'm speaking

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.960
from is a place of love.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.330
Because the next
book that I wrote,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.380
though it was published before
<i>The Last True Love Story </i>,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.680
I co-wrote with Jason Reynolds,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.580
and it's called <i>All
American Boys </i>.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.560
And I'm stoked to be a part
of that book and that project,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.090
because as I was a high-school
teacher in New York City,

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.780
and I was looking around at
-- trying to think about --

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:06.000
how do I engage my classroom in
a more race-conscious fashion?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.370
How do I adjust my
curriculum to begin to think

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.320
about being race-conscious,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.100
as opposed to that distorted
disease of colorblindness?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.770
I was looking around for
texts that would talk

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.490
about white privilege, and what
it meant for a teen who's white,

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.020
like me, to begin to process
what that privilege means.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.480
And I was having a
hard time, actually,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.260
finding a novel about that.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.670
And as Jason and I were --

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.710
we were friends at the time
already before we started

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.070
working on the book, and as
we were thinking about the --

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.310
you know, we were talking
about writing a book together,

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.640
and talking about
what it would mean

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.750
to write a race-conscious book.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.070
We thought a lot about what
it meant to then try to write

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.250
from an authentic
experience of each

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.460
of our own individual
cultural experiences.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.260
And I want to explain to you why
I think that's important before

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.390
I explain why I think
tradition's important.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.580
Because Jason and I, as
probably many of you know,

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.970
have had an amazing opportunity
to travel around the country

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.230
and talk to kids all
across the country.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.560
We've talked to more than 50,000
young people around the country

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.540
to tell them about our
book, <i>All American Boys </i>,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.280
about two boys, one
black, one white.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.540
Both of whom go to the same high
school, live in the same town,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.440
are going to the same
Friday-night party,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.700
stop at the same corner store
on the way to that party.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.760
And at that corner store, Rashad
Butler, the young black boy,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.670
is brutalized by a white police
officer, and Quinn Collins,

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.800
the young white boy,
witnesses this event,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.270
and knows the police officer.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.640
The police officer's a
father figure for him.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.900
And the story is about how
these two teens then process

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.380
that experience afterwards, and
process it with their families,

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.940
and process it in
their community,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.450
and process it in
their high school.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.410
Jason and I were thinking
a lot about the speech

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.710
that Martin Luther King,

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.800
Jr. gave at Grosse Pointe High
School in 1968, where he spoke

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.740
about two Americas
living side-by-side.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.560
We thought about how <i>All
American Boys </i>would talk

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.240
about how that's so true today,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.900
two Americas living
side-by-side.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.000
We might, in fact, talk
about the multiple Americas

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.490
that are living side-by-side.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.250
But again, this comes
from a place of love.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.950
To actually talk about the
truth of what's happening

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.450
in our lives is important,

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.120
and it's really important
for young folks.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.740
Because they're experiencing
it, and to shelter them

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.970
from it is our own problem of
censorship, because we're afraid

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.610
of the world that we have
failed to do better to shape.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.530
They're living in the world that
we've failed to shape better.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.920
So we deserve -- they
deserve our strength

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.420
to give them the real
stories of their lives.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.930
As Jason and I traveled
around talking

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.230
about <i>All American Boys </i>--

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.530
I'll share this with
you for one moment,

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.640
because sometimes people talk
to me and say, "Hey, Brendan,

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.200
you know, it's really
hard to hear you talk

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.630
about white privilege so often."

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.770
Oh, my God [laughter].

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.080
There are so many reasons that
that is demented [laughter].

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.110
But one of the things that I
think is really important for me

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.410
to share with you all --

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.270
and then I'm going to
get into <i>Tradition </i>.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.180
Because I think this
is the lead-in --

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:22.310
is that in one conversation
Jason and I were providing

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.810
for a school, at the
end of the presentation,

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.550
as so often is the case,
a number of the students

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.300
of color come and
speak to Jason.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.460
A number of the white students
come speak to me, and at the end

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.290
of this particular presentation,
I was left alone in the room

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.560
with a white supremacist.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.860
And I was having
this conversation

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.350
with a white supremacist,
as she was talking to me

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.150
about how she didn't
believe in white privilege.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.930
And I won't get into
all the particulars,

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.610
because we don't have time
for it today, but the issue --

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.500
the first thing I was
wondering, in fact, was --

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.840
what are the gun laws in
this particular state?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.890
Because it's terrifying to
think about that, and to think

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.080
about all the students of color
who were in that community

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.730
with a white supremacist,
who's out-and-out,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:09.470
and feels emboldened enough to
come speak to me afterwards --

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.650
brave enough, doesn't feel
threatened in any way.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.030
And I thought about our
conversation quite a bit,

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.960
and I thought a lot about
Brendan Kiely, white boy,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.310
and how easy it was for me
to want to distance myself

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.510
from her, and say, "Well, I'm
not that kind of white person."

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.580
I wouldn't want to be
that kind of white person.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.880
I would never want
to be associated

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.180
with that kind of white person.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:38.580
And she was doing
the same thing to me.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.880
She didn't want to be
associated with me.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.520
She wanted to distance
herself from me.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.280
But if that white
supremacist and I walk

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.590
onto an elevator together,
walk into a bank together,

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.150
walk into a grocery store
together, walk into any

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.550
of these public spaces together,
the experience that she

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:59.800
and I have walking in side
by side is so similar.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.010
Whereas -- and I know Jason
doesn't mind if I share this.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.950
When Jason and I walk into a
space together, when we walk

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.000
into an elevator together, when
we walk into a bank together,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.780
when we walk into a grocery
store together, the experience

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.310
that he and I are having
are very different.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:20.880
That's white privilege, and
to think about denying that is

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.270
to be denying a truth of
our cultural experience.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.340
To deny those truths
and to tell kids

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.290
that doesn't exist is a lie
I will not participate in.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.240
I write for kids,
because I care about them.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.540
I love them.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.350
I was a teacher for many years.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.650
I miss it.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.950
I want to get back in the
classroom, because I feel

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.210
like I miss my time with them.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.080
Because they're bold
enough to ask the questions

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.870
that sometimes us older
folks are too afraid to ask.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.810
And I tell that story to you
all about my time on the road

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.800
with Jason, because as I begin
to think about <i>Tradition </i>,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.040
and to tell you a little bit why
I wanted to write <i>Tradition </i>,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.530
I want you to hold that
notion of privilege

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.530
in your minds for a moment.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.830
Because there's another
privilege

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.130
that I want to grapple with.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.520
I want to grapple with my white
privilege every single day,

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.800
because there's no point that I
arrive at where I understand it.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.120
There's no point that I arrive

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.530
at where I understand the
impact of racism in America.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:27.630
It's more that I have to be
committed -- because I'm white,

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:31.320
I have to be committed every
day to try to do something

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.830
to be anti-racist,
to do something

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.000
to address what it means to
be a white person in America.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.210
Because the minute I don't do
that, I'm succumbing to all

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.620
that privilege, and
all that it offers,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.920
and all the harm that it causes.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.940
I have to work against it.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.820
But likewise, I think about
how I was taught to be a man,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.290
and I think about
our world today.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:59.390
And I think about how often I've
heard people say things like --

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:05.530
when a young woman is maybe
saying, "I've had enough

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.160
of these jokes in the
hallway," I've heard people say,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.950
"Can't you just take a joke?"

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:15.410
I think about that,
because, again,

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:21.700
as I think to my grandmother's
line about a listening heart,

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.740
and what it means to
have a listening heart,

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.480
I think about how
we, as a society,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.080
could do a better
job listening to many

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.490
of the folks in our society.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.200
I think about me as a man who
could do a better job listening

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.510
to the women in my life.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.960
As I listen to my wife tell
me stories about how --

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.840
where we live in New
York City, there's a lot

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.720
of construction around
where we live.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.000
If she walks two
blocks this way,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.450
it's all new buildings going up.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.930
If she walks two
blocks this way,

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.550
it's all new buildings going up.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:58.610
And as she walks by, so
often, she gets the catcalls.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:04.090
If she walks by, so often, she
gets comments, or whistles.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.200
Now, when I walk by, none
of that happens, right?

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.500
In fact, more often than not,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.800
the construction
workers are looking

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.100
down at their phones
or whatever.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.030
Now, it's not just
construction workers.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.650
That would be way too
easy, just to throw

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.740
that out there and let that go.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.520
Because my grandmother -- she,
too, has a story she shared

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.130
with me, one that I listened to.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.070
She talked about what it meant
to join the workforce right

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.100
as she graduated
from high school.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.620
My grandmother was
the valedictorian

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.630
of her high school.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:32.930
It's amazing to me.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.350
So think about this -- from
a small town in Pennsylvania.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:39.700
When my grandmother got
her first job after that,

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.590
she worked at a doctor's office.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:47.320
In that doctor's office,
there was a doctor

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.880
who would take the youngest,
newest female employee

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.930
of that office with him

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.600
to whatever conference he
was going to, travelling away

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.060
to some conference
somewhere else in the country.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.360
And my grandmother
told me this story,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.510
because she said she felt
really lucky that one

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.670
of the other women in the
office had shared that with her,

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.500
and said, "If he
invites you, don't go.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.870
If he invites you, don't go.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.670
That doctor -- don't
go with him."

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.830
But think about all the
women before my grandmother

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.370
who hadn't been warned.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.850
And I think about that,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.510
listening to those
stories, to those truths.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.850
When I sat down to
write <i>Tradition </i>--

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:29.650
I sat down to write <i>Tradition</i>
-- I began writing it in 2015.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.120
2015, some of you
may remember --

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.980
Emma Sulkowicz graduated
from Columbia University.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.620
For those of you who don't
remember who Emma Sulkowicz was,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.760
Emma Sulkowicz was assaulted --
sexually assaulted on the campus

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.060
of Columbia University.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.680
The university didn't
want to talk about it.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.000
The university really didn't
want to embrace the story

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.140
in the way that she
wanted them to embrace it,

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.880
to recognize the harm, the
truth of that experience.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.020
And so, in an act of
defiance and protest,

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.790
she dragged her mattress
around campus.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.240
Some of you may remember
those images

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.330
of this enormously courageous
young woman dragging her

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.630
mattress around campus.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.890
And in 2015, she
dragged her mattress

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:18.320
up onto the graduation
stage in an act of defiance,

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.280
in an act to say, "I
will not be silenced.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.350
My story will not go unheard."

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:27.420
That's tremendous
strength and courage,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.540
and I also don't think we should
be burdening her with that need

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.840
to have to do that, right?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.000
What if we were just
better listeners?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.960
What if we embraced
our listening hearts?

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.030
I think about that,
because I think

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.290
about how I was raised
to be a man.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:46.480
I think about how,
when I was growing up,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.130
and I was in high school,
I had a guidance counselor

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.280
at my school, my high
school, who came into class

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.150
in ninth grade to say, 'Hey,
I'm going to teach you guys --

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.980
" because I went to an
all-boys high school --

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.590
"I'm going to teach you guys
how to be better scholars.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.890
Going to teach you
how to be better --

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.190
have better study habits.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:06.730
Let me tell you a
little anecdote

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.030
that I always share
with the young men.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.720
Families would often invite
me to come into their house,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.000
and take a look at how
their sons are studying

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.580
or not studying, and I
would give them tips.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.650
And so, I went into
this one house one day,

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.290
and I went upstairs.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.370
And the kid's doing his
homework in his bedroom, and --

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.250
" I'm not going to go on to
finish the story in his voice,

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.870
because I don't want
to repeat the words.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.190
But the gist of it is this.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.540
He began to tell us how this
student wasn't studying,

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.840
but looking out the window

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.590
and ogling the girls'
cross-country team

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.940
as they ran by in the street.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.810
But the man didn't
just tell the story.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.550
He acted it out.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.610
He pantomimed what that
experience might be.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.640
He caricatured the
act of ogling.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.690
That guidance counselor of mine
wasn't teaching me how to study.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.870
He was teaching me how
to be a misogynist.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.140
He was teaching me how
to objectify women.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.780
And I think about
that, because think

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:13.450
about the forward trajectory
of those kinds of cues,

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.480
about how often young men are
given these kinds of cues.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.110
When we talk about male
privilege, when we talk

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.060
about toxic masculinity,
that's not a made-up thing.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.420
It's not a myth.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.010
The preponderance of those
kinds of cues are devastating.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.560
They're devastating because the
ultimate result could be harmful

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.120
for young women, and
women of all ages,

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.310
and they can also be
harmful to young men.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.530
Because the young -- they
rob all of these young men

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.620
of the opportunity to
become their full --

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.470
the full human that they can be.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.750
And I wanted to write
about that.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.240
I wanted to write about
the strong young women

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.630
who are standing up to
the misogyny of our world,

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.240
and the young men who
maybe want to listen,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.860
but haven't been
told how to yet.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.950
They don't have the
models to yet.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.710
I think about that teacher who
taught me how to objectify women

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.590
and ogle women, because I think
about that same high school

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:13.260
when I was a senior -- we were
preparing for the senior prom.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.210
And the school allowed a
tuxedo rental company to hang

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.730
up posters around the school,

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:24.000
and these posters were
all the same image.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.460
It was three boys in tuxedoes
from the tuxedo rental company,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.720
and it was young -- one
young woman in a prom dress.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.540
And the three boys were
around the young woman.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.320
The young woman was
tipped upside down,

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.650
so that her head
was on the ground

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.080
and her legs were in the air.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.120
She was leaning against
a surfboard,

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.030
and two of the boys each had a
hand around one of her ankles.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.480
I don't -- I hope I don't have

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.000
to explain the subtext
of that message.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.670
But to a young man who's been
taught over and over and over

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.830
and over and over again how
to ogle and objectify women,

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.480
the message seems pretty
clear that prom equals sex,

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.220
and you're entitled to it.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.850
That kind of messaging,
I think, is destructive.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.700
It's horrible, right?

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.190
I'm not promoting this.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.770
I'm being honest, just
like I am when I'm talking

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.260
about what it means to have
white privilege, just like I am

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.210
to say, "Look, when that
white supremacist and I walk

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.860
into an elevator
together, we don't --

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.460
we have a similar experience.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.010
We share a privilege."

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:36.470
Well, likewise, guys, we
have to think about reflect

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.210
on what our privileges are.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.710
You have to think
about and reflect

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.600
on how we have been too often
taught to be misogynists,

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.660
and what effect that
has in our culture.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:51.230
When I sat down to write
<i>Tradition </i>, I wanted to write

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.260
about those two voices
that I was saying before.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.000
Because if I'm going to
write about love, right,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.730
I want to write about
the love that it takes

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.640
to have the courage to stand
up and say something about it,

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.320
as so many women have
been saying for so long.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.090
I think about how we talk
about the Me Too movement,

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.390
and I'm very grateful

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.440
that <i>Tradition </i>has been called
<i>A Separate Peace </i>for the Me

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.740
Too generation.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.580
I really appreciate that very
much, but I can't stand up here

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.010
and talk about that
without thinking

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.500
about the Me Too movement.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.650
And how, while I was
introduced to it originally

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.690
because of Hollywood, in fact,
Tarana Burke, a black women

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.810
from the Bronx, started Me
Too more than a decade ago.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.270
And I think about how people
have been talking about this --

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.400
women have been talking
about this for so long,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.760
and I want to honor the Emma
Sulkowiczs of the world.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.290
I want to honor the
Tarana Burkes of the world

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.790
by writing Jules
Deveraux's half of this book.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.490
This is a book told
in two voices --

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.140
Jules Devereaux and
James Baxter.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.250
James Baxter is a boy.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:58.500
James Baxter -- part of the
inspiration for his story --

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:06.990
that same year, in 2015,
as we moved into 2016,

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:13.050
you may remember a
presidential campaign.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:17.160
You may remember, during
that presidential campaign,

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.830
the "Hollywood Access" tapes.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.770
And you may remember that, on
those "Hollywood Access" tapes,

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.890
we heard Donald Trump's
disgustingly violent language,

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.490
attitude, and behavior
towards women exposed

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.360
for us all to hear.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.660
No one can say it didn't happen.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.960
It happened.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.860
We heard it.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.560
We heard that, and there was
a lot of chatter in the world

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.570
of media about -- oh, that's
just locker-room talk.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.310
Don't get over --
worked up about that.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.070
That's just -- can't
you take a joke?

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.450
Or, it doesn't really
mean anything.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.640
It doesn't have any effect.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.300
Well, look at the
news this week.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.350
It has effects.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.500
And locker-room talk
is something

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.800
that I was really accustomed

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.570
to as a three-sport
athlete growing up.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:05.940
I know about that locker-room
talk, but also, after I heard

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.270
and saw the "Hollywood
Access" tape, I saw boys --

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.550
a photo of a boys' football
team in Portland, Oregon.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.580
This boys' football
team all were wearing

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.570
"Wild Feminist" t-shirts, and
the caption below the photo was,

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.560
"Not in our locker room.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.430
Not in our locker room.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.810
Not in our locker room."

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.610
Right?

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.290
[ Applause ]

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.520
And so, James Baxter -- the
other half of this book --

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.930
I wrote James Baxter for
all those boys out there

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.580
who are saying, "Not in our
locker room," for all the boys

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.770
who are willing to listen
to those other boys and say,

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.300
"Not in our locker room,"

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.730
and to join all the
women who've been saying,

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.690
"Enough is enough is enough."

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.210
We can do better, and I believe
books can help us get there.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.510
I believe in books, because --

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.810
I'll share this one
last anecdote,

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.110
and they'll open
up for a quick Q&amp;A.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.580
When I was in 10th grade,

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.100
I remember reading
<i>Frankenstein </i>.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.230
I remember reading <i>Frankenstein</i>
with Mr. Reilly [assumed

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.860
spelling], one of my
favorite teachers,

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.330
because I remember a scene

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.790
in the novel <i>Frankenstein</i>
where Dr. Frankenstein's

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.510
creation is running
into a village.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.950
And the villagers are all
screaming at the creation,

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.240
screaming and saying, "We
don't -- " you know, basically,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.520
the subtext is, we
don't know you.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.810
You scare us because
we don't know you.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.110
You scare us because
we don't know you.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.210
And they're yelling, you know,
phrases at him and whatnot,

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.630
and chasing him out
of the village.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:35.980
And I will never forget reading
that scene in class, looking up,

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.050
terrified, at Mr. Reilly.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.630
You're my Mr. Reilly
right now [laughter].

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:46.410
Looking up at Mr. Reilly, and
kind of mumbling to myself,

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.480
but saying, "When am I
one of those villagers?

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.840
When am I chasing someone
away from the cafeteria table?

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.340
When am I chasing
someone out of the room?

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.600
When am I not listening
to people

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.340
who are asking to be heard?"

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:05.030
I think books can change
perspectives, can change lives.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.790
In that moment, I
thought a lot more,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.240
though I didn't have the
words for it at the time.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.530
I thought a lot more
about how I wanted to work

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.000
on my listening heart,
and not be one

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.550
of those villagers chasing the
creation out of the village.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.660
And so, because there's
not a lot of time left,

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.490
I do want to open it up for Q&amp;A.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.950
And before I do, I just also
want to say thank-you to all

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.050
of you for listening, because it
takes listening in order for us

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.350
to have a conversation.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.550
So if you want to now talk
to me, and I'll listen,

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.520
come to the signing
line, and I'll listen

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.820
to you all you want [laughter].

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.370
But we have about -- a little
less than 10 minutes left.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.080
So, like, let's open
it up to Q&amp;A if we can.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.510
But thank you very much.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:50.710
[ Applause ]

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.370
And it's hard for me
to see, so if you get

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.880
to a microphone,
just start talking.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:03.230
&gt;&gt; If you weren't an author,
what would you do in your life?

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.530
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Thanks!

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.060
If I weren't an author,
what would I do?

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.280
So I'm really grateful to be
an author, and in other talks,

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.150
I talk a lot more about
the writing process.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.670
But given the space we're in,

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:17.490
I wanted to make sure I
said what I had to say.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.990
The truth is, I called
my mother when I --

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:26.310
after my first day of teaching,
and I had many jobs before that.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.710
And I called my mother,
and I said, "Ma,

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.730
I finally found a job I like."

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.930
[Laughter] I love teaching,
and if I'm not an author,

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.910
if I can find a way to
go back into teaching

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.370
with a more regular schedule,
I'll go back to that.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.860
Because for me, teaching
is a social experience

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.920
in which I'm learning along
with all the students,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.660
and I want to do that more.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.300
I want to do a lot less
one person on a stage,

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.010
and a lot more group
working together [laughter].

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.310
So thank you.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:30:00.110
&gt;&gt; Hi. Last time I saw you,
you were wearing that t-shirt,

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.600
and I thought, I like this guy.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.900
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Wild Feminist?

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.200
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.500
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Nice!

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.800
&gt;&gt; And I feel like we're all
friends now, because I come talk

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.310
to you after every
lecture that I see.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.000
But I just wanted to
share that when --

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.750
I teach in a middle school, and
when my son was there, I said,

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.730
"You know, of all the places
in the middle school I would --

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:24.430
don't ever want to be in
the room is during FLE,"

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.770
which is what we call
the sex ed in the boys --

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:29.620
they split it, you know.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.110
And I said, "I can just
imagine what the room is like."

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.810
And my son -- he's a very
sort of tender, kind person.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.240
And I said all that
innuendo, and the jokes --

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.420
and he said, "Yeah, it's worse
when the teachers do it."

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.730
And it just broke my heart,
and I'm just so pleased

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.030
that you've written this book.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.330
So I just want to thank you.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.630
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Thank you.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.930
Thank you for sharing that.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:56.060
&gt;&gt; If you love teaching so much,

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.250
what made you decide
to become an author?

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.780
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Well,
that is a great question.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.480
When I went back to the school
where I was a teacher --

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.520
Jason and I went to
do a presentation

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.870
about <i>All American Boys </i>there.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:12.820
And there was a student who
stood up and said, "Come back!"

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.820
And I was -- like, that
was an awesome moment.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.610
I felt really, you know,
grateful, and it was hard to do

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.960
at the time because of the
demands of travelling around

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.740
and talking about the
books and whatnot.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.630
But the reason why I left is

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.180
because I -- I mean,
I love books.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.940
I love teaching.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.240
I love Jason.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.540
I love travelling
around with one

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.840
of the closest friends
of my life.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.140
I love that guy.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.640
But I also love my wife,
and Jessie, my wife,

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.170
who's also an author -- and she
had an opportunity to go work

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.790
for one year in Italy.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.630
And so, she was going
to go to Italy,

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.930
and I was going to go with her.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.930
And so, that meant I had
to leave the classroom

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.230
so I could go be with her,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.700
and that's how things
got started, actually.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.820
So I'm going to find a way to
try to bring it all together,

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.910
but I went because I
love my wife [laughter].

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.210
Yes?

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.520
&gt;&gt; What do you like, and
what are the challenges,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.570
of co-writing a book?

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.870
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Nice!

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.350
So what do I like?

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.580
Aside from only having
to write half a book,

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:21.020
which is pretty cool -- so,
to make a sports analogy,

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.220
which I know is wild --
but I still love sports.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.940
I don't -- I mean, this is
a book that has, you know,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.860
a discussion about problems
in some sports culture,

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.530
but I love sports,
and I'm not going

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.990
to throw sports under the bus.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.290
When I played basketball,
one of the best feelings

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.740
in the world is on a fast break,
and being able to pass the ball,

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.130
and you know that
person's going to be there

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.430
without even having to look.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.980
And while co-writing <i>All
American Boys </i>with Jason,

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.460
we felt that experience,
being able to pass the ball,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.600
and knowing the other
person's going to be there.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.850
That's a remarkable experience
as an artist, because so much

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.790
of your time is spent alone,
and in agony [laughter].

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:04.290
And to have a friend to share
that with is tremendous,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.850
and again, if we're going to
talk about listening hearts --

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.150
if you're going to be writing

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.570
about stuff that's really
important, and really serious,

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:14.510
and really hard, it's pretty
powerful to have someone

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.820
that you love with whom
to share that experience.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:21.080
So collaborating is amazing.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.380
Yeah?

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.480
&gt;&gt; With all your social
changes, does it increase

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:29.090
or decrease in your faith?

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.020
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely:
Wow [laughter].

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.840
That is going to be the last --

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.890
second-to-last question,
thankfully.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:42.300
The -- I have a complicated
relationship with faith,

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.390
and it's much more
than I can say

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.560
in the one minute I have left.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.970
But I will say this -- that I
see no reason not to have faith

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:58.330
in humanity, and there are
many of us that find our faith

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:03.400
in humanity through a faith
in another, higher power.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.550
And right now, I'm choosing
to see the higher power that's

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:11.520
within social groups who
decide to work together,

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.980
and listen to each other,

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.100
and make the world a
place that's more just

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.990
and more equitable.

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:20.660
That's where I have faith,
but faith requires work.

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.660
And so therefore, if I
want to believe in it,

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.140
have faith in that community,

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.650
I have to be an active
participant in that community.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.110
I can't just want it to exist.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.420
I have to work for it.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.600
And so, for me, any question
of faith is a question of work,

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.900
and I want to believe
in that community,

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.520
so I want to help
be a part of it.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.550
So, thanks.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.850
Last question?

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.150
&gt;&gt; Over here.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.450
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah?

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:44.750
&gt;&gt; I just want to thank you all

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.050
for saving the best
for last [laughter].

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.350
But --

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.650
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yes!

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:49.950
See, I have faith!

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:51.250
&gt;&gt; -- yeah, sorry, my heart's
beating really fast [laughter].

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:58.650
But do you think it would
impact a lot on the news if --

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:03.120
and help stop victim-blaming,
while we watch the news,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:08.340
to stop using passive voice,
and instead using active voice?

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.030
Like, for example, I remember
once in <i>All American Boys </i>,

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.190
it was like -- it was like --

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.140
no, but, like, in any act of
violence on the news, I mean,

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.540
like -- like, for
example, it was like --

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.840
I'm sorry, I'm really nervous.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.140
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: No,
no, no, no, keep going.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.440
You're awesome.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.740
You're awesome.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:32.010
&gt;&gt; Okay. It was, like, Rashad
was beaten, but it's like, no,

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.280
the cop -- sorry --
the cop beat Rashad.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.580
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yes.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.880
&gt;&gt; You know?

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.180
And, like, do you think it
would help us a lot to, like --

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.450
to help stop victim
blaming, and instead, like,

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.830
see the real picture, and,
like, be truthful, not neutral,

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:47.610
like Amanpour's phrase?

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.630
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: So I -- you're
framing this as a question,

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.170
but I hear it as a statement,
and I agree with you.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.470
I'm with you.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:57.770
No, I'm serious.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.070
I'm not saying this to be coy.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.720
I'm saying, I think what you're
saying is really important,

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.020
right?

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.320
So I'm backing you up on that.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.330
Because absolutely,
I agree with you.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.420
We have to be -- accountability
is in the active voice.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.860
And if we want to work
on that community,

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.160
if we want to be active
participants in that community,

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.890
we have to be bold and
speak in the active voice.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:19.320
And that's why I have to talk
about the privilege that I have

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.570
as a thing that is a part of
my everyday experience, right?

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.160
I have to -- we have to
speak in the active voice.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.050
That is so awesome that
you brought that up,

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.520
and what a great way to end.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.820
Let's go out there
and read, be inspired,

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.070
and then go do something
about it all.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.370
Thank you.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:37.520
