00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.660
By taking comet ice, recreating the conditions
in space and observing the results in infrared,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.150
researchers discovered a possible precursor
of amino acids.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.680
This research is to try to uncover how comets
crashing into Earth could have carried the

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.790
building blocks of life.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.970
And PawBot automatically opens and serves
wet cat food.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.449
It grabs a bowl, opens one of the 18 cans,
dumps the food, pushes out the bowl, and then

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.390
washes its robot hands.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.390
Vsauce!

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.390
Kevin here.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.189
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.340
Say hello to the OctopusGripper.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.030
The phenomenal folks at Festo , who have been
featured on Mind Blow for their bionic ants

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.290
and bionic butterflies, have now turned their
attention to tentacles.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.719
The soft silicone structure is controlled
with air pressure and can grip objects with

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.790
the help of two large vacuum suction cups.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.580
Since the tentacle is soft it's ideal for
human/robot interaction in places like factories.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.160
Also I think it just looks really cool.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.330
Ybrain is developing a wearable headset to
electrically optimize your brain.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.479
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation works
by sending a weak electronic signal to specific

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.920
areas of the scalp.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.520
While the creators suggest someday this treatment
could be beneficial to a sufferers of a range

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.619
of neurological disorders from addiction,
dieting, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s,

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.370
a comprehensive review of hundreds of tDCS
studies suggests one area that may be effective

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.070
right now is in treating depression.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.450
The amount of current to use and for how many
sessions is still being studied but Ybrain

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.229
is rolling out in 70 Korean hospitals in 2017
and hope to use their findings to fine tune

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.200
the inexpensive, take-home device and eventually
bring it to Europe and then the United States.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.409
In other transracial direct current stimulation
news, a study out of Zurich found it can be

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.990
used to increase honesty.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.430
They asked participants to roll die and and
get paid depending on the outcome — allowing

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.260
them the opportunity to lie to get more money.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.261
Those who struggled between being honest and
getting more money were more honest when the

00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:08.329
electrical stimulation was applied to their
brains.

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.659
Where this gets really interesting is the
concept that honesty represents an organic

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.319
condition based on biological predispositions.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.169
So sorry judge, my brain is liar.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:27.019
A new brain imaging process allows researchers
to see neuronal connections better than ever

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.019
before.

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.989
Clarity, developed at Stanford University
chemically dissolves the milky opaque tissue

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.629
that coats much of the brain and replaces
it with a transparent hydrogel.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.359
This allows a window into brains to look at
individual neurons like in this mouse brain

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.249
and they attribute different colors to different
kinds of cells.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:51.519
Creating 3D brain maps will allow researchers
to compare brains and hopefully observe and

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.050
correct problems.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.269
The imaging technique could also be applied
to observe the electrical pathways in the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.879
heart and better understanding damaged fibers
in the spinal cord.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.419
High-powered lasers are allowing us to reconstruct
feathered dinosaurs with unprecedented accuracy.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.269
Dr Pittman at the University Of Hong Kong
used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence on soft

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.900
tissues in dinosaur bones, making the few
skin atoms left glow in the dark.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.069
This has helped reveal the shape of the dinosaur
and examining over 200 specimens allowed this

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.680
awesome revised life reconstruction.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.889
And they’re taking this technology around
the world so expect a lot more accurate dinosaurs.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.099
A lab on a glove could detect nerve agents
with a swipe.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.010
Stretchable, flexible inks were created to
print sample collectors and biosensors on

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.099
the gloves.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.889
By swiping the thumb featuring the collector
and touching the index finger with the sensors,

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.620
an electrochemical signal is sent through
the glove to a smartphone.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.849
And the plan is to use this to better increase
security.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.069
NASA has prototyped new robots to explore
ocean worlds like Jupiter’s moon Europa.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.489
The robots will need tires to traverse the
ice, heated claws to grip the ice while a

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.290
drill penetrates the surface.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.680
Probes would then return with samples through
pneumatic tubes.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.749
Please do this.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.959
We all wanna know what's down there.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:11.959
Thanks.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.959
Finally, scientists at Pacific Northwest Laboratory
can now covert methane which is produced by

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.759
landfills, dairy farms and oil wells into
a green goo that can be used as biofuel or

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.810
cow feed.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.370
This is a way for us to find two organisms
willfully coordinate their metabolism for

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.800
an application such as capturing wasted methane
and converting it into transportation fuel,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.530
specialty bio products, or agricultural feed
stocks.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.370
It doesn't smell good and it doesn't look
tasty but it is valuable.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.879
I’m gonna leave you with ROBO-ONE the world’s
first biped robot fighting tournament.

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.199
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:05:13.169
To meet the need for even greater mobility,
the army is experimenting with the aero cycle.

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.740
A one man flying platform capable of carrying
a fully equipped soldier at 40 MPH.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.520
The wrist radio, long the dream of comic book
detectives, is now a reality with an Army

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520
rogue.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.590
And a handy talkie set has a one mile range.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.139
Here again, science is providing new and better
methods.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.320
Experiments in radiating food with atomic
energy have pointed to new ways of prolonging

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.479
the life of food.

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:46.490
Never before has man stood so precariously
on the brink of his own destruction.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.120
By striving for ever-greater superiority,
the United States Army dedicates itself to

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.580
deter that end.
