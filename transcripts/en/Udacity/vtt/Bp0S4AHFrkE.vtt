00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.250
For this quiz, you're going to be putting your name and

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.520
your role to the top of your resume using the same technique James just used.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.850
You'll start by replacing %data% in

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.710
HTMLheaderName and HTMLheaderRole with your name and your role.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.790
In this case, the role is the type of job your looking for.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.590
So for me, I would have Web Developer.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.810
You can find the strings HTMLheaderName and HTMLheaderRole within helper JS.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.847
Once you're done, you will either append or prepend the formatted name and

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:36.650
formatted role to the page header.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.915
Now, append adds something to the end of HTML.

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.690
While prepend adds something to the beginning of HTML.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.000
For this quiz, you might need to experiment with append and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.630
prepend to get a feel for both of them.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.220
Once you see your name in roll appear on the page correctly, check this box.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.920
And when you do it right, your resume should look something like this.
