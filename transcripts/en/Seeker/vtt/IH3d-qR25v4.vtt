00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.250
Eight years ago, President Barack Obama looked
fresh-faced and young, now he looks like someone's

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.250
pop-pop.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.210
Does holding the highest office in the land
age people faster?

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.780
Hey village elders, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.230
The President of the United States of America
is likely one of the most stressful jobs around,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.570
on-call 24 hours a day, constantly visible
by the world's media, citizens, and of course,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.570
enemies.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.789
Being the Leader of the Free World is bound
to take it's toll after four or eight years.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.640
Commonly, people cite pictures of presidents
and how greyer, or aged they end up looking.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.019
Obama quipped to the fresh faced Canadian
PM Justin Trudeau, "if you don’t want to

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.339
go grey like me, you need to start dying [your
hair] soon before it’s too late!"

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.980
But DO presidents age faster?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.699
Today, the president never goes anywhere without
the Physician to the President, and meticulous

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.899
records of the president's health care, of
course, kept.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.499
So, Dr. Michael Roizen (chief wellness officer
at the Cleveland Clinic) looked at records

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.520
from every president from Teddy Roosevelt
to George W. Bush to find a pattern, and he

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.580
thinks, "presidents age twice as fast."

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.530
Roizen looked at the Commanders in Chief's
diet, blood pressure, physical activity, and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.760
lifestyle finding the level chronic stress
was high, and the ability to blow off steam

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.320
with friends and family (which would lessen
stress) was low.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.530
Stress has huge effects on the human body!

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.930
Things like immune system response, cardiovascular
function, motivation and mood, not to mention

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.700
how your body processes food and how much
fat you store are all worsened by stress,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.980
and… it also affects aging.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.870
A study in Nature Genetics found chronic exposure
to stress will shorten telomeres.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.250
Telomeres are a chunk of DNA on the end of
each of our chromosomes, think... the things

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.820
on the tips of your shoelaces (called aglets,
btw).

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.590
As they replicate, the telomeres shrink, and
the DNA eventually becomes more easily damaged!

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.590
Scientists think this is what causes aging.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.590
And according to many studies, stress increases
the telomere shortening process!

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.600
And thus, increases the speed of aging!

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.030
The thing is, Roizen is just one opinion.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.490
Another doctor, Jay Olshansky of the University
of Illinois-Chicago, disagrees with him.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.110
Olshansky believed wealth, education and healthcare-access
all increase presidential lifespan.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.910
And modern-day presidents definitely have
those.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.140
Is incredible how much wealth, education and
healthcare access helps people live longer,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.299
healthier lives, amirite?

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.810
But, what if they're both right?

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.581
What if because of chronic stress while in
the White House, presidents age faster, but

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:33.120
then because of their access to wealth and
health care -- they live "better" lives after

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120
their terms end?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.510
This may be true… but, according to a study
in the British Medical Journal they die sooner.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.180
Researchers tracked how many years they lived
AFTER a candidate's last election.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.200
279 national leaders in 17 countries from
1722 until 2015 were studied and researchers

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.859
found: elected leaders lived 4.4 fewer years
than their unelected brethren.

00:02:58.859 --> 00:02:59.859
Yikes.

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.239
One thing is without a doubt, over the last
eight years, Barack Obama is getting greyer

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.239
up top.

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.040
In fact, a study in Proceedings of the Natural
Institute of Science compared his hair over

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.040
time.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.669
They found, he was, in fact, getting greyer
at point-452 percent more per year (when compared

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.639
to actor Morgan Freeman).

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.639
Science is so awesome.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.889
Look, there have only been 44 presidents so
far, and only a handful alive at any given

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:22.889
time.

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.170
To study them as a group is reallllly difficult,
and it might just all be in our heads.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.180
According to Dr. Olshansky, Obama is not necessarily
aging faster, we just notice because he's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.400
ALWAYS out there.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:49.400
We are watching him change, so when we see
an old picture it is just… a shock.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.590
See?

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:10.959
Crazy, right?
