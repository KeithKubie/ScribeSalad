00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.896
The more common deployment strategy for

00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:06.620
network IDS is to deploy
them as passive sensors.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.230
A passive sensor only takes
a copy of the traffic.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.270
That is, the traffic continues
to reach it's destination

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.590
without passing through the device.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.690
Therefore, from the point of
view of network performance,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.960
a passive sensor does not add
any overhead to network traffic.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.900
This illustrates a typical
passive sensor configuration.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.040
The sensor connects to
the network transmission medium,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.330
such as a ethernet cable,
through a direct physical tap.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.290
The tap provides the sensor with
a copy of all network traffic

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.450
being carried by the medium.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.890
The network interface card for

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.550
this tab usually does not have
an IP address configured for it.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.310
Therefore, all traffic into
this network interface card

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.360
is simply collected with no protocol
interaction with the network.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.060
The sensor has a second
network interface card

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.530
that connects to the network
with an IP address so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.580
that it can communicate with
a backhand management server.
