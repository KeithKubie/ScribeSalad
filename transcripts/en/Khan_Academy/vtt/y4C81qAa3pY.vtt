00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
We're asked to solve for x.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.050
And we have this radical
equation.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.800
1 is equal to the principal root
or the positive square

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.510
root of x divided
by 3 minus 2.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.320
And the best way to solve these
is to just isolate the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.129
radical and then square
both sides.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.280
And then hopefully we'll
be able to solve for x.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.420
This is a pretty straightforward
one.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.650
But in general, once you solve
for your x, sometimes you get

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.060
more than one solution.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.550
And then you always want to
substitute them back in to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.070
make sure that they all work.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.190
And in other videos, I've
actually explained why

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.110
sometimes you end up with a
solution that does not work.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.940
But let's just do this.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.640
It should be pretty
straightforward.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.260
So the first thing to do if
we want to get rid of this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.890
negative 2.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.080
We could add 2 to both sides
of this equation.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.380
Let's add 2 to both sides
of this equation.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.900
The left-hand side becomes 1
plus 2 is 3 is equal to-- this

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.290
negative 2 and positive 2 cancel
out-- so we have the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.800
square root of x over 3.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.190
Then we could multiply both
sides of this equation by 3.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.040
Let's multiply both
sides by 3.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.890
And so we get 9 is equal to
the square root of x.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.120
And then we can just square both
sides of this equation.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.350
And if you square both sides of
this equation you get 81 is

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.350
equal to x.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.770
Now, we only got one
solution here.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.470
Let's just try it out.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.530
Let's make sure that it works
for this equation.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.380
So let's just evaluate the
right-hand side with x is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.890
equal to 81 and make
sure it equals 1.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.940
So if we take the square root of
81-- that's our x-- over 3.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.730
This is our 81 right there.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.470
Minus 2.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.070
What is this?

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.340
Square root of 81.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.440
We're taking the principal
root, the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.680
positive square root.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.455
So we're only going to think
about the positive square

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:56.820
root, which is 9.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.580
9 over 3 minus 2.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.680
9 over 3 is clearly, 3.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.900
3 minus 2 is indeed
equal to 1.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.000
So x equals 81 is indeed
the solution for

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.250
this radical equation.
