JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
Well, good evening.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.220
Hello.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.950
My name is Jonathan
Zittrain, and I

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.620
am so pleased to be
here with you all today

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.379
to hear from John Palfrey on
the occasion of the release

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.150
of his book, BiblioTech-- Why
Libraries Matter More Than

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.930
Ever in The Age of Google.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.470
Nicely focused group to get
Google in there, as well.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.240
It's very nice, a
googleable term.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.580
JOHN PALFREY: It's all SEO.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.538
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Yes.

00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:34.360
First just logistics--
this is being recorded.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.760
So your image, if not soul, are
being captured for posterity.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.600
It is not being live
webcast, but it will probably

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.060
go up later unless something
truly substantively

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.610
catastrophic happens.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.790
And what else should we know?

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.309
We're going to go into around
7:00, 7:15, at which point

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.350
there will be a reception
next door that can also

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.055
spill over onto
the outdoor patio,

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:59.290
to which everybody is invited.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.560
And John has done about
a dozen talks so far

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.190
on the road for this
book, so our challenge

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.940
is to ask him questions
that he has yet

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.160
to hear from the road,
which is very exciting.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.120
He's spoken to a group as
small as about 30 or 40

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.240
at the Andover Bookstore,
and as big as 1,000

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.194
at a conference called
Computers and Libraries?

00:01:24.194 --> 00:01:25.360
JOHN PALFREY: Yes, that was.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.026
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
Good eponymous title,

00:01:27.026 --> 00:01:32.150
a solid non-focused group--
Computers and Libraries.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.090
They ought to alternate every
year, Libraries and Computers.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.620
Anyway.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.495
JOHN PALFREY: I'll send
them that suggestion.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:39.070
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
Yes, very good.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.400
So how to introduce John?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.920
John is a lawyer-- that gets
a chortle through the room.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.160
But that's OK, he's an
unpracticing lawyer,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.730
unless you think of practicing
in the larger sense.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.460
Now, he did do a turn
at Ropes and Gray

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.524
before being rescued
by the Berkman Center.

00:01:57.524 --> 00:01:59.190
JOHN PALFREY: I was
there almost as long

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.384
as Yochai Benkler,
who is also here.

00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:02.300
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Ah.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.840
I forget that Yochai also
did a turn at Ropes and Gray.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.980
Good times.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.930
But John worked for the EPA
for a while, regional office.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.221
You were kind of in a
political sort of role, yes?

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.220
Anything more you want
to tell us about the EPA?

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.011
JOHN PALFREY: Nope.

00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:20.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.090
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: As you can
see, it was a political role.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.230
And John was Executive
Director of the Berkman Center

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.000
and was the one who really
put the center into workdrive

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.660
and took it from a kind of
small place in a hallway

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.350
to a larger place that met fire
codes much better than it did

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.860
before, and that really had
an inclusiveness to his way

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.790
of running the place that has
been reflected in the substance

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.680
that he has thought about
since, a book on interop

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.706
and interoperability.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.690
And this in a way is a
book about interoperability

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.800
and thinking about
the mortar that

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.750
cements the various
bricks we have together

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.610
in ways that keep civil society.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.980
That's so much, I think,
of what John thinks about.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.240
And of course, day to
day now, after having

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.590
done a turn as a
professor here, director

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.870
of the library here at
the law school, and now

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.500
is the head of school at
Phillips Andover, which

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.880
he is in the process completely
reinventing and doing

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.930
all sorts of cool things
which we might hear about.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.790
So John is just
one of these people

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.400
who is not a podium thumper,
doesn't shout to be heard.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.050
He simply has really persuasive
and interesting and thoughtful

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.890
things to say, and
the kindest ethos,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.040
both at the institutional
and personal level,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.510
somebody that I find
myself going to for counsel

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.830
and many, many others as well.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.250
And I have yet to
receive a bill.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.510
So that's how I know he's
really not a practicing lawyer.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.760
So John, we're so
pleased to see you.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.960
Note that in some
quirk of things,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.581
there are exactly three copies
of this book available for sale

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.330
around the corner.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.270
JOHN PALFREY: That's either a
good sign or a really bad sign.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.228
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Yes.

00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:13.670
But they will also, because
they only have three copies,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.410
put you on the list to order one
on layaway at a 30% discount.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.480
So that's a good
deal of the evening.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.310
John, you are 100% here.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.520
Thank you so much for
spending time with us tonight.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.127
We're so excited
what you have to say.

00:04:27.127 --> 00:04:28.460
JOHN PALFREY: Thank you so much.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.090
And thank you all for coming.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.330
This is very touching to
see such a great crowd.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.010
I feel like I'm
coming home in a way,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.132
and to see so many
people that I've

00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:43.590
worked with, both at the Berkman
Center and the Harvard Law

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.750
School Library and the
Harvard libraries broadly.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.380
I'm truly, truly
grateful to see you here.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.330
This book that I have
written is a love letter

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.410
to libraries and to
those who work in them,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.125
the librarians in particular.

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:58.030
It is also, I hope,
an argument for why

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.650
libraries are so
crucial, especially

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.850
in the age of Google.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.440
And all of that I learned from
those people in this room,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.542
and I'm really grateful for
all of your help in doing it.

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:10.000
I'm going to try to talk for
no more than 20 or 25 minutes,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.708
and then hopefully
get into conversation.

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:14.200
I would love to hear much
of what is on your minds

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.700
and be challenged,
as Jonathan said,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.090
with questions I haven't
yet heard on this book tour.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.550
This may the only
place on my book tour

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.530
where somebody will know
what this actually is.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.374
Is there anybody who
recognizes this picture?

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:27.290
AUDIENCE: Your office?

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.998
JOHN PALFREY: No.

00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:30.128
It comes from--
yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:31.880
AUDIENCE: Oliver
Wendell Holmes' library?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.338
JOHN PALFREY: Yes,
that's so great.

00:05:33.338 --> 00:05:34.880
This is the first
time someone has

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.390
known the answer
to that question,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.910
and I ask it everywhere.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.780
This is the personal library of
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.960
of course was a professor here.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.880
But this was actually his
home in Washington, DC.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.600
And I love this picture for
a whole bunch of reasons.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.250
It reminds me of the Harvard Law
School Library and the awesome

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.290
librarians and archivists
who work in it,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.930
and the fact that they digitized
this amazing collection

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.200
of Oliver Wendell Holmes'.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.620
But it also to me is a
great challenge to all of us

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.620
when we think about
libraries and the libraries

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.203
of the future.

00:06:04.203 --> 00:06:07.410
And the reason I see it as a
challenge is this room to me

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.080
is really, really
appealing-- the idea

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.520
that you could have
a space in your home

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.630
that is surrounded by books in
this way and sit in that chair

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.450
and think of all
the great opinions

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.464
that Holmes thought up.

00:06:18.464 --> 00:06:19.880
Now, we know he
had a few clangers

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.280
and so forth, so he
thought up some bad ones.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.970
And maybe he didn't do it here.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.710
But just the idea that he was
inspired by sitting there.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.910
And for many of us, we
work with young people.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.690
I now live with and work
with about 1,100 teenagers,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.090
and I think a ton about
what inspires them.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.940
What kind of space
would inspire them?

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.000
What kind of a
library space would?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.050
And for most of our
teenagers, my guess

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.870
is that this might be a
cool and inspiring space,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.090
but for almost none of
them would they sit up,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.830
swirl around that chair,
and then pull one of those

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.794
off the shelf.

00:06:49.794 --> 00:06:52.460
For those of us who've worked in
the Harvard Law School Library,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.990
I was always struck by the
fact that we were almost always

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.190
full as a library.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.340
Cheek by jowl those
kids were there.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.190
Very often they
had those approved

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.709
Harvard Law School Library mugs.

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:03.000
And they had a casebook, right?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.070
And they were highlighting
away on the casebook,

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.590
but they weren't doing a
ton of pulling statutes

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.650
or other things off
the shelves-- almost

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.170
never, at least in the big
reading room, literally never.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.000
And maybe if they had a
great reference librarian

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.040
they might have found something.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.170
But by and large, they were
there for other reasons.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.670
Right?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.801
They are there probably
right now studying away

00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:20.550
for other reasons.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.236
And I think our challenge,
in a way, in a digital era

00:07:23.236 --> 00:07:24.610
is to come up with
something that

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.890
is as powerful and
appealing a space for kids

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.221
as a learning space and as
an environment in libraries.

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.470
And I think that's the
challenge back on all of us who

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.655
are trying to design and
to create these spaces

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:37.000
in an exciting way.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.120
And I think we do this against
a backdrop where libraries

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.110
are to some extent in peril.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.430
Now, I stand in a room,
I realize, at Harvard,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.780
the place where unbelievable
support for libraries exists.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.887
But even within Harvard,
we know that there

00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:51.720
are different schools
that support libraries

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.920
at different levels.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.700
Our dean is here.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.450
Meet Dean Minow.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.600
Thank you for being here.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.901
Thank you for being a lover of
libraries, not just evidenced

00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:01.150
by the fact that you're here
but because of all you do

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.020
to make libraries great here.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.830
But even within the
context of Harvard,

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.710
we went through
several year period

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.940
of quite a bit of transition.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.430
And I was a part of that too.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.880
And we know that there are
times when libraries are

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.380
under a great deal of pressure.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.840
That is true in
academic settings,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.325
and obviously this is a
difficult context for many.

00:08:19.325 --> 00:08:21.700
But it's particularly true,
I think, in public libraries.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.875
And as I've traveled around
in school libraries--

00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:26.610
the 100,000 or so school
libraries around the country--

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.300
very often people
have a funny view

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.540
that libraries aren't maybe
as useful as they once

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.090
were, which I think
is exactly wrong,

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.600
which is why I wrote this book.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.607
This is a quote from
an Amazon review

00:08:35.607 --> 00:08:36.690
by somebody I do not know.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.815
His name is David Weinberg.

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:39.919
It is not David
Weinberger our friend.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.710
But this was a not
particularly flattering review

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.372
on Amazon of my book, and
it was disagreeing basically

00:08:46.372 --> 00:08:48.080
with the premise of
the importance of it.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.570
But I thought it was a
particularly good view that

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.410
sums up what some
people think, and it

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.240
is a prevailing view out there.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.110
I realized often also when
I was reading the book

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.950
that one of the most common
conversations that I had

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.930
after becoming the Director of
the Harvard Law School Library

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.080
was one at a backyard
barbecue or a cocktail

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.050
party, and someone would
come up to me and say,

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:08.966
so what are you up to?

00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:10.750
And I would say,
I'm just becoming

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.000
the director of this library.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.830
And then two seconds later
the person would interrupt me

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.520
and say, oh, wait
a minute, libraries

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.210
aren't as useful anymore.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.186
You're the digital guy.

00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:19.310
You're getting rid of them.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.400
You're getting rid
of all the books.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.640
And then they'd
have walked away.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.780
In this sense, I never had the
chance to kind of grab them

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.160
and say, no, no, no, libraries
are more important than ever

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.160
and here's what we have to do.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.530
And so that's why I
wrote the book in a way,

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.696
was to answer that question
for all those people who

00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:34.037
walked away from me at parties.

00:09:34.037 --> 00:09:36.120
They're not probably going
to be reading the book.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.430
I get the irony of that.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.005
But I still felt I had
to win the argument.

00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:43.020
But I say it in a
serious tone, which

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.940
is we recognize that in
many communities, when

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.540
there is a choice between
money for police and fire

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.360
and education and other
important things--

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.390
and this is true in my
hometown now of Andover,

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.410
too-- the library doesn't
get as much support.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.290
The support is eroding for
libraries in these communities,

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.570
and I think we need to
reverse that polarity.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.710
We do this also, though, I
think, in the context, at least

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.440
in the United States,
of an amazing culture

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.710
of support for libraries
and a history of support

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.750
for libraries.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.370
This image comes from our
hometown of Boston right

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.620
across the river.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.510
Every time I see
this I get chills

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.960
down my spine, the
idea of free to all;

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.620
the idea that the big municipal
public libraries started right

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.870
here about 150 years ago,
and with an incredibly

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.810
simple democratic premise--
the basic idea that information

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.950
should be free, knowledge should
be free, to anyone, regardless

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.230
of their ability to pay.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.860
And this was something that
is in the cradle of the Athens

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.530
that we created here in
Boston, the middle of our city

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.400
in Copley Square.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.670
And so we have a
history of making

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.160
this kind of amazing
support for our communities,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.430
for our democracies.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.760
And part of what I worry
about in this moment of peril

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.430
for libraries is that we
will lose sight of that,

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.910
and that oddly, we
actually might backtrack.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.920
We might actually have less
access in our democracy

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.516
to information in the digital
age than in an analog age.

00:10:59.516 --> 00:11:00.640
And that would be terrible.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.060
That would be, I
think, perverse.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.620
I think that's true for
a variety of reasons.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.710
And a simplistic
version of that argument

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.850
is to say, increasingly, as
knowledge moves to the cloud,

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.680
one could imagine it being
vastly more available,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.600
that anybody with
one of these devices

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.740
could get access to
whatever they wanted.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.448
But there are a couple
reasons why that's

00:11:19.448 --> 00:11:21.250
not so simple or so true.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.050
One is if you look at the
owners of the cloud in essence,

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.470
they're almost
all private firms.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.840
They're almost all parties that
are private companies and doing

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.790
it for profit-- which
is not a bad thing,

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.630
and this is not an
anti-corporate screed so much

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.746
as to say public
spaces in cyberspace

00:11:37.746 --> 00:11:39.370
have been things that
we've had to win.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.953
It's what Jonathan Zittrain and
Yochai Benkler and the Berkman

00:11:41.953 --> 00:11:46.080
Center have had to create and
really care for and establish.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.430
As we hurtle to a
cloud-based environment,

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.360
by and large we turn to private
players like Amazon and others

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.300
to store our stuff.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.050
So in a very simple
mode, if we increasingly

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.740
create our materials and
put them in private hands

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.650
as opposed to, say, in the
public hands-- or roughly

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.130
speaking, public-spirited
hands of libraries

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.320
and the research universities
that have libraries--

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.815
I think that is a
dangerous thing.

00:12:10.815 --> 00:12:12.900
There are many other ways
in which it's tricky,

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.108
and we can come back to that.

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:15.880
But I think it is
something worth worrying

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.290
about a little bit.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.760
There's a way to make
this a bit more precise,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.140
which is for those who've
worked in libraries,

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.320
you know that it's not
always possible for libraries

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.780
to do exactly in the
digital age what they've

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.250
done in the physical age.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.340
One of the ways in which this is
true is the lending of ebooks.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.450
So by and large,
publishers have made

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.060
it tricky to lend
ebooks on the same terms

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.110
that you could lend
a physical book.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.660
This is where it
is relevant that we

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.770
are at a school, of course,
because in fact they're treated

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.190
in two really different ways.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.857
The background law for
lending stuff like this

00:12:47.857 --> 00:12:49.190
is actually really, really good.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.230
The background copyright, in
a simple sense, is positive.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.190
Which is, libraries
for hundreds of years

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.000
have been able to buy
something like this

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.496
and then do more
or less whatever

00:12:57.496 --> 00:12:58.620
they wanted with it, right?

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.453
You could bring it to
a secondhand book shop

00:13:00.453 --> 00:13:02.510
and sell it, or you could
lend it as many times

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.051
as you wanted or
you could tear it up

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:06.480
or you could digitize it
and do lots of things.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.700
But it turns out that if
you get that same book

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.740
and you put it on
one of these devices

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.890
and a library is wishing to get
it on terms that it can license

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.050
to someone else, all of a
sudden it is governed not

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.424
by the background copyright
law so much as it is governed

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.020
by the contract law that
the company sets up,

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.880
the publisher sets
up with the library.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.754
And for all those who've
worked in libraries,

00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:28.870
you know that you can't always
get e-books on as good terms

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.220
as you can get physical books.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.920
And some of the outcomes
are perverse and bizarre,

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.720
like you can't read it aloud.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.970
Those are some of the
worst of the terms.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.000
Some of the other terms
have been the 26-lend rule.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.730
Does anybody remember
that great offering

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.330
from a publisher,
the notion that you

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.090
could get one of these for
whatever the full price was

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.482
and Jonathan and I could lend
it back and forth 26 times,

00:13:49.482 --> 00:13:50.940
and then of course
it would go away

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.600
because it would have worn out.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.590
Right?

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.340
That premise didn't
work out all that well.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.140
The basic idea, though,
is that it has not

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.550
been possible for libraries
to get digital materials on as

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.130
good a deal, or
in fact, as often,

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.670
as they could get
it in physical form.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.820
And this, I think, is
a dangerous premise.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.720
It's also the case
that when it is

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.370
a contract between the
company and the library,

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.780
there's also something
tricky behind it with respect

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.200
to the ability to store it
over a long period of time too.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.300
So if the point
is we're paying it

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.080
as though we were leasing for
it, when we stop paying for it,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.946
it could go away.

00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:28.570
So in fact, libraries
might in fact not

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.430
have collections if we were
only turning from owners

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.020
of the information
and the knowledge

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.232
into those who are
leasing it, or renters.

00:14:35.232 --> 00:14:36.690
And many people
have worked on this

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.190
from many different angles.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.970
Here, I would say, in the cradle
of the open access movement.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.000
That is one great answer
to it, where at the FAS

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.477
level and Bob Darnton and
others led the effort there,

00:14:46.477 --> 00:14:48.060
and at Harvard Law
School, where we've

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.555
committed to putting our
materials in the commons

00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:51.740
in an open access way.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.230
That's not such a big deal.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.810
But for the vast majority of
what is created and published,

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.390
we actually have potentially
a less good arrangement

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.970
going forward if we don't
change the deal that is being

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.260
offered for digital materials.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.020
Just out of curiosity, if
you were reading something,

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.410
how many people still prefer
this, a hard-copy kind of book?

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.400
Vast majority.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.780
How many people prefer an ebook?

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.700
Relatively few.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.660
And how many people are
more or less agnostic,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.750
you kind of do both?

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.550
Interesting.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.666
I think that may be the
growing group actually,

00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:26.290
is those who want to
read this at night

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.373
but carry this on a plane.

00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:29.445
I think that's kind
of the growth of it.

00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:31.570
Oh, Stuart Schieber, also
the open access champion.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.460
I'm sorry, I didn't you
see you there before.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.430
Congratulations and thank you.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.690
But the basic
point being that we

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.320
need to ensure that
in a digital age

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.250
there is just as much access
from a democratic perspective

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.050
as there's been, if not more so.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.959
So this picture shows
a moment in time

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:50.000
when we were actually
building that Boston Public

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.580
Library, when we were putting
up this amazing edifice

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.020
in the middle of Copley Square.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.240
It was a few decades
after the library started.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.070
It was 1890.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.900
And the reason I
love this picture is

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.260
because I think that's,
roughly speaking, the moment

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.550
we find ourselves in now.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.480
We have a moment where we
are building for the future

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.316
the next set of libraries.

00:16:08.316 --> 00:16:09.690
And it is a set
of libraries that

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.730
will exist both in digital
form and in physical form.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.390
And I think we actually ought
to be thinking about this

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.130
in architectural form.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.610
So does anybody
recognize this one?

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.280
A lot of people work
in this building.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.410
This is a side elevation
of Langdell Hall.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.510
And it is to my mind the
moment that we're in right now,

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.382
which is where we are
convening together,

00:16:31.382 --> 00:16:33.590
I think-- or ought to be
convening-- those people who

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.600
think about information
architecture and the importance

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.040
of the digital era
and how we actually

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.870
frame and make
accessible information

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.940
with the analog era.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.700
I think that future will
be a hybrid of libraries

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.190
that are very much physical
spaces, but also which

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.890
connect to the cyberspace
that we are creating.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.340
And I think in order to do
that well, what we need to do

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.684
is actually convene all
of these people together

00:16:55.684 --> 00:16:58.100
and actually work in a way
that is much more collaborative

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.305
than we've done in the past.

00:17:00.305 --> 00:17:02.305
One of the ways in which
we've been doing that--

00:17:02.305 --> 00:17:05.860
and many people in this
room are to thank for that;

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.329
Bob Darnton called together a
group of 40 people at Radcliffe

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:13.960
Institute a few years ago
to convene an effort really

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.109
to say, can we in fact
come up with the design

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:21.099
for a combined public
and private effort

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:24.130
to create a combined
hybrid digital

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.630
and physical infrastructure?

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.440
That has become the idea
behind the Digital Public

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.770
Library of America.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.890
40 people in that room actually
agreed to this sentence,

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.580
"To create an open
distributed network

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.930
of comprehensive
online resources."

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.130
And that's sort of a
crazy ambitious thing

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.272
that nobody thought in fact
could work, but somehow it has.

00:17:42.272 --> 00:17:43.730
And Rebecca Haycock
and many people

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.270
here have made it come together.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.150
I think it's one
example of what we

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.440
can do to solve this problem.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.640
OK, so pause there
for a second and say,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.690
what are the elements of
a library in a digital age

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.750
that the Digital Public Library
of America and other things

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.100
might be able to bring about?

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.430
I think fundamentally,
libraries remain about people.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.600
So I think that the
crucial aspect of libraries

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.890
is keeping the humanity
in the transaction

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.540
between people and information,
people and knowledge.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.219
I think one of the challenges
that people often throw out

00:18:17.219 --> 00:18:19.760
about libraries is we don't need
them so much, because people

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.250
can help themselves so easily
through these kinds of devices.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.330
One example of
this that struck me

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.320
as I was writing a book about
the importance of librarians

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.030
happened in a small-town
library in Andover, Mass.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.332
I was editing one chapter
and it was about 3:00

00:18:33.332 --> 00:18:34.040
in the afternoon.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.384
A whole pile of kids came
in after school, which

00:18:36.384 --> 00:18:37.550
is a fun thing that happens.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.065
Libraries fill up with
students who are spilling out

00:18:40.065 --> 00:18:41.640
of schools when they close.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.182
And the kids all went into the
teen section, and some of them

00:18:44.182 --> 00:18:46.598
were doing their homework and
others were gaming and doing

00:18:46.598 --> 00:18:47.300
other things.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.090
And one of them was trying
to do a science thing.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.540
And the kid turned to
his iPhone he said,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.010
Siri, what does
terminal velocity mean?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.690
This was in the
middle of a library.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.690
And Siri, it turned
out, did not know

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.096
what terminal velocity meant.

00:19:00.096 --> 00:19:00.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.430
But like three feet away
was an amazing librarian.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.730
And I was sure that that woman
could have either told him

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.489
exactly what terminal velocity
meant or at least shown him--

00:19:09.489 --> 00:19:11.030
probably better--
the way to find out

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.660
about terminal velocity.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.070
You see these examples
over and over again,

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.570
but I think it is
important to note.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.080
And this is one of the
aspects of this book that

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.280
is a little challenging.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.040
There is a tough-love
story here,

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.780
which is when we
study young people

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.530
and how they look
for information,

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.420
librarians are pretty
low on that list.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.400
The project information
literacy studies

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.820
are probably the
clearest in that zone,

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.276
that kids often do look
to Google and Wikipedia.

00:19:34.276 --> 00:19:35.650
They often look
to their teachers

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.074
in that particular class.

00:19:37.074 --> 00:19:38.740
But we have to do a
better job, I think,

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.180
as librarians and people who
work in libraries, to ensure

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.370
that kids actually do go
and use these resources

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.900
and know to do that,
and we actually

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.500
have to prompt them to do it
and to teach them to do it.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.700
But I start with the
humanity as a key element

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.490
of libraries in a digital age.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.020
Second, I think
libraries have to shift

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.530
from being standalone silos--
which I think there have been

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.140
lots of reasons for them
to be-- to being platforms

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.160
and to being connected entities.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.030
So this, I think,
invokes a lot of the work

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.960
that Yochai has done in
the wealth of networks

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.607
and otherwise.

00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:09.440
If you think about the
history of libraries,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.660
go back thousands of
years to the library

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.160
at the Palace of
Ebla, for instance,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.170
in modern day Syria, or
the Library of Alexandria--

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.695
the idea behind the
library in a way

00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:19.150
was you brought
all that material.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.733
Whatever you could
get, you brought it

00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:21.710
to a particular place.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.460
And now you may think
about it as bringing

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.500
to a particular school,
a particular zip code,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.760
all of those materials.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.215
And that was understandable
as a previous iteration

00:20:29.215 --> 00:20:30.450
of libraries.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.890
I still think to some extent
we do that, and too often

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.655
I sometimes hear of schools
bragging about how many volumes

00:20:36.655 --> 00:20:38.780
they have or how much they
spend on their libraries

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.660
in order to attract
kids or people.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.230
I think that misses the point.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.080
I think it misses the point
that by working much more

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.200
together and actually
by seeing libraries

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.010
as a connected
series of platforms,

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.590
as part of the network, they
can accomplish much more.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.760
This particular
design of a platform

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.950
is the DPLA's rough
structure, the Digital Public

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.400
Library of America.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.420
And the key to it,
in a way, is the fact

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.140
that it is just a whole
pile of open source

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.280
code with a whole pile of
open metadata and as much open

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.040
access material as
you possibly can have,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.520
and a bunch of
different parties.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.230
In this case, service
hubs are states

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.075
by and large, Content hubs are
things like Harvard University.

00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:17.700
Thank you, [? Sara ?]
Thomas and others

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.110
for contributing material in.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.940
And the ability to export on
a bulk basis for anybody who

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.350
wishes to do it.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.490
And as you see from the
top, the notion that nobody

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.090
has yet figured
out the right way

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.250
to present library
material in a digital age.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.740
And the point is
that we can have

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.250
lots of potential frontends.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.650
We can have lots of different
applications and ways

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.770
to share our materials,
especially if we think of them

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.070
as platforms, pool the
materials together,

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:49.950
and make it possible through
an open API, an ability

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.810
to create any front-end
that you would like.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.480
So today there is one way
to get it, which is dp.la.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.370
You could go on your mobile
device or your computer,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.840
and you can find a
search engine and a way

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.320
into all of these materials.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.010
But likewise, if you
go back a screen,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.520
that's just this
particular front-end.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.950
I think the ultimate
success of the project

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.040
is that any library could
create on this open API

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.280
the ability to find a better
way to do this presentation,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.410
to find a way to
present this material.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.370
And any library could create an
application or a front-end that

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.670
would in fact make it
so that nobody even

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.580
knew that the DPLA was there.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.140
The DPLA could be,
ultimately, entirely plumbing,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.980
and the success be in the way
in which different communities

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.569
have presented this material.

00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:36.860
That's a very different way
of thinking about libraries

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.850
as institutions, but it's
about taking advantage

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.890
of what the miracles
of the web have

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.550
made possible and that magic.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.300
And that, I think, requires
us to be a little bit less

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.680
egocentric as
institutions and much more

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.390
seeing it as a way to share.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:56.010
As of right now, just a small
plug for where the DPLA is.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.860
We have filled up about a third
of the map in terms of places

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.350
contributing materials
into this Digital Public

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.110
Library of America.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.800
The red states-- I
suppose that's maybe

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.310
not the colors we should have
used for this in this room--

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.820
are the ones that do have up
and running-- actually it's

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.190
perfect, Harvard colors, in
that way-- have service hubs.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.700
So if you look at
Massachusetts, we

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.337
have the Digital Commonwealth.

00:23:19.337 --> 00:23:21.670
And if you think about what
the Digital Commonwealth is,

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.640
it's a fabulous example for
what the rest of the country

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.480
could do.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.820
So at the Boston
Public Library there

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.590
are people like [? I, ?]
Tom Blake and a team,

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.170
and what they do is they go out
to all the 351 cities and towns

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.870
in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:39.030
and help them digitize materials
and add metadata to it,

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.940
and then share it up
through a statewide portal.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.260
What the DPLA does is it
creates a way to share

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.706
that on a national basis.

00:23:45.706 --> 00:23:47.080
So if you imagine,
if every state

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.380
had a Digital
Commonwealth equivalent,

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.090
we would in fact be
building for the country

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.600
an amazing series of
on-ramps into something

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.860
that everybody could access.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.940
We're about a third
of the way there.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.940
Dan Cohen, who's the
current executive director,

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.307
and others are doing a fabulous
job of filling out this map.

00:24:03.307 --> 00:24:05.890
If you happen to come from any
of these states that do not yet

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.920
have a DPLA hub and
you'd like to be one,

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.959
let us know because we can
get you signed right up.

00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:13.750
The other thing that's
important to look at

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.190
are these yellow ones,
the content hubs.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.230
Those are the big
institutions like Harvard

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.770
and others-- bless you-- who
are in the process of digitizing

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.020
tons of material and making them
available in this particular

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.710
way to the rest of the country.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.067
And my hunch is, if we could
have every institution doing

00:24:30.067 --> 00:24:31.900
what the National Archive
is doing and doing

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.274
what Smithsonian is doing and
New York Public and Harvard

00:24:34.274 --> 00:24:36.750
and so forth, we would
be creating potentially

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.690
the most amazing library that
has ever existed in the world.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.040
And that, I think, is a
very exciting premise.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.100
Much of it does come
from the work of people

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.120
who are literally in this room.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.800
This is the Oliver
Wendell Holmes suite,

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.550
which is all of those
materials, including

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.090
that first image that I showed.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.650
And if you think about
these collections that

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.750
once were called hidden
collections at Harvard--

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.800
they were sort of hidden away in
different places-- I think even

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.802
if we just put them
on the web and we

00:25:04.802 --> 00:25:06.260
have people come
find them, they're

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.485
still a little bit hidden.

00:25:07.485 --> 00:25:09.590
And I think part of
the key to the step

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.240
that we're taking right
now, and particularly

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.060
as we take amazing collections
like the Oliver Wendell Holmes

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.880
collection and other ones that
are extremely well-curated

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.200
and shared, we can
make them unhidden

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.370
in this same network model
by putting it in the DPLA.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.920
Now, of course, we should
caveat the problem of copyright.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.770
We'll come back to that later.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.320
But subject to any licenses that
we have that we can share it,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.880
I think putting things
in this shared repository

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.160
makes them much more valuable.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.820
Second, I think that by
doing it in this way,

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.620
in an open way with an open
API as a chance for people

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.790
to be able to do anything they
wish with the information,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.240
we'll be able to unleash
a whole lot of innovation.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.760
So this is an old schematic, but
one that came from the Harvard

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.970
Library Innovation Lab.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.080
I'm going to give a
couple examples from that.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.970
You may think about libraries
and worry about some

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.540
of the things we
would lose if we

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.500
were to go in a digital
direction, which

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.670
we continue to.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.190
I think one of those fears
has been serendipity,

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.597
the idea that if you do not
have physical libraries,

00:26:15.597 --> 00:26:16.930
you don't actually have a shelf.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.650
You don't have a place where
you can go and get a call number

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.720
and walk in and find
a book you want,

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.720
and then see all those
other amazing books that

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.930
are to the right and
the left of them.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.320
And you probably all
have that experience

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.153
of coming out with 10
books when you thought

00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:29.380
you were coming out with one.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.963
And I think that's
one of those things

00:26:30.963 --> 00:26:32.490
that we don't want
to lose when we

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.030
go from physical libraries
to whatever future

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.400
we're going toward.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.794
My hunch is that
even if we contract

00:26:38.794 --> 00:26:41.210
those stacks a little bit--
and we shouldn't contract them

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.626
anymore than we
already have, just

00:26:42.626 --> 00:26:46.290
to be clear-- we actually can
do some things that introduce

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.580
new forms of serendipity.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.960
We actually might be
able, in a hybrid world,

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.974
to do better than we have
done in just the analog.

00:26:52.974 --> 00:26:53.640
And why is that?

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.672
One reason, to take
the Harvard example--

00:26:55.672 --> 00:26:57.630
what is the current count
of Harvard libraries?

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.220
Is it still in the 70s?

00:26:59.220 --> 00:26:59.769
73?

00:26:59.769 --> 00:27:00.310
AUDIENCE: 73.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.700
JOHN PALFREY: 73 distinct
libraries within a system.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.920
The fact of the matter
is, when you also

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.960
add in the depository
25 miles away,

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.910
there's actually no
stack at Harvard.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.460
There's no place
where you could walk

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.860
in and see all the books, all
the collection, in the system.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.340
So if you could imagine
a world in which you

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.810
have the stacks that are
fabulous ones in Widener

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.900
and here and Langdell and so
forth as one place to walk in,

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.000
but you also could combine all
the materials from all those 73

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
libraries, plus all the
materials in the Harvard

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.254
depository in a virtual sense,
and create a virtual stack,

00:27:33.254 --> 00:27:34.920
you could have new
forms of serendipity.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.700
You could actually
find connections

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.530
that were not previously
possible or findable.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:40.930
This was an example.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.960
Stack View was a
rendering, a way

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.460
to put all of the
Harvard collection

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.940
together, as you may know.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.950
This was based on
2009 circulation data,

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.520
so circulation data
from a long time ago.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.325
And the basic idea
was very simple.

00:27:53.325 --> 00:27:55.330
The idea was you
could then search

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.142
on different forms of
metadata that people have

00:27:59.142 --> 00:28:00.350
added into their collections.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.895
So in this particular
case, someone

00:28:01.895 --> 00:28:04.000
is searching for
Gravity's Rainbow,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.150
and they can see how many
times that particular book has

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.799
circulated in a
certain period of time.

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:11.090
But you also might see that
another book has circulated

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.596
much more frequently.

00:28:12.596 --> 00:28:13.970
You could also
search, of course,

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.090
if you're a graduate student,
how many of your professors

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.970
have checked out this
version or another.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.594
You could imagine if
it were The Illiad

00:28:19.594 --> 00:28:21.640
and we had 40
examples of that, you

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.050
might want to search on
which of those translations

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.090
or which of those forwards
was most important.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.570
You could imagine ways in which
all of that great metadata that

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.700
librarians have could become
more valuable if it were

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.660
a combination of the digital
with the physical in somebody's

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.160
hands.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.410
And I think that is the
possibility that lies ahead

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.470
of us, and why this
research and development

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.680
effort, particularly on top of
open systems, is so important.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.440
I would add one other example
that I think is crucial.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.650
Also in the Harvard Library
innovation lab is perma.cc.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.070
For those who haven't followed
this particular effort,

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:58.060
I think it's an
amazing example of why

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.256
libraries have a crucial
role to play going forward.

00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:02.880
I've talked mostly
about the importance

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.405
in a democratic society
of access to information,

00:29:05.405 --> 00:29:08.820
and I think that is really
the primary one for libraries.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.206
But I think preservation of
information and preservation

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:13.580
of where the
information is found

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.470
is equally important in
many respects for libraries.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.840
One thing I fear is that if
we don't actually think ahead

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.950
to the kinds of
systems that we ought

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.610
to have for the
long-term, we're going

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.120
to make an enormous mistake.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.970
I think perma.cc is
one example of how

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.642
we can create permanent
forms of digital archiving,

00:29:31.642 --> 00:29:33.600
and where librarians
actually can lead in a way

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.187
that we have not
one as much before.

00:29:36.187 --> 00:29:38.020
This is a project that
is currently ongoing.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.228
I know Jonathan and his
team-- we could talk about it

00:29:40.228 --> 00:29:42.800
afterwards, so I won't explain
it entirely, and leave you

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.190
the chance to do it.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.690
But I think it's an example of
the amazing innovation that's

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.080
happening in libraries, and
the importance of libraries

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.460
playing this role.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.680
One of the challenges that we've
put out to libraries in general

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.500
is if you think about
in the information

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.280
era in the last
several years, I don't

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.840
think most of the
big innovations

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.155
have actually come
out of libraries.

00:30:00.155 --> 00:30:01.700
So if you think
about search, that

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.140
has come out of, obviously,
big companies like Google.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.690
If you think about
recommendations,

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.770
by and large that has
come out of big companies

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.725
like Amazon and Netflix, maybe.

00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.100
If you think about
encyclopedias,

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.800
that came out of a
commodity trader's head,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.090
and a bunch of people are
collaborating in Wikipedia.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.440
Lots of other examples of it.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.064
But I actually think
libraries have not

00:30:20.064 --> 00:30:22.240
been on the forefront of
the very big innovations,

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.950
and I still think that lies
ahead as a possibility.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.730
And with a series of open
systems and collaboration,

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.420
I think that's entirely,
entirely possible.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.170
I'm about to bring it
in for a landing, so

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.860
here's the windup to that.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.724
I think ultimately, the thing
that libraries need most to do

00:30:37.724 --> 00:30:39.390
and where I think
most of the excitement

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.011
is actually solving a series of
problems that face communities.

00:30:43.011 --> 00:30:45.260
And as I go around the country
talking about this book

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.760
or in the context of
DPLA, it's so clear

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.940
that from many,
many perspectives,

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.020
libraries have a crucial
role to play in communities.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.110
And that could be very simply,
providing access to kids

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.570
after school when they don't
have another place to access

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.403
information because
they actually don't have

00:31:01.403 --> 00:31:03.130
a broadband connection at home.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.682
You hear many kids getting
assigned kinds of homework

00:31:05.682 --> 00:31:07.640
that they actually can't
complete without being

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.290
able to go to a library.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:12.850
And I heard from kids who at
6:00 when the library closed

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.740
then had to go to
McDonald's or Starbucks,

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.470
because that's where
the free Wi-Fi was.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.530
I think there's an enormously
powerful role in bridging

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.130
this participation gap
and the digital divide

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.380
from the library perspective.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.002
I think that's true
for job seekers.

00:31:25.002 --> 00:31:27.460
It's true for people who are
new immigrants to the country.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.650
I think it's true for
elderly people who come

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.350
to libraries as a social place.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.460
These are hugely important roles
that libraries continue to play

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.300
outside of the scholarly realm.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.080
And I won't go through
all those examples,

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.610
because everybody knows
them so well here.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.660
I think in the end we do need
libraries as physical spaces.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.884
Does anybody recognize
this library?

00:31:46.884 --> 00:31:48.290
AUDIENCE: The John
Adams Library?

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:50.706
JOHN PALFREY: Yes, The John
Adams Library in Quincy, Mass.

00:31:50.706 --> 00:31:52.250
They're just such
amazing spaces that

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.360
have been created in libraries.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.756
So my argument in
no way is to say

00:31:56.756 --> 00:31:58.380
that we shouldn't
have physical spaces,

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.730
glorious physical spaces,
in our communities.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.730
I think libraries
play an essential role

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.980
in creating third spaces
that are open and public.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.810
I just think that
people may come to them

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.060
for different reasons, and
we may need to support them

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.329
for very different reasons.

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:13.120
One thing you see about
the Adams library--

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.950
you can imagine at
this table that these

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.320
were big reference tomes.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.092
I don't think people
are necessarily

00:32:18.092 --> 00:32:20.050
going to come to a library
for reference tomes.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.716
They're going to come
for other reasons.

00:32:21.716 --> 00:32:25.390
And I think part of our job is
to figure out what those are.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.740
I think we will continue
to have physical books.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.520
My argument is not in any
way that we won't actually

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.780
have physical and beautiful
objects that present material.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.060
I'm not positive that the market
will be exactly as it is today.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.050
My sense is we will have very
beautiful physical objects

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.480
and things that present in large
sizes and in beautiful formats,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.910
and we will have mostly
digital materials otherwise.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.860
I think things will be
mostly born digital.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.010
I suspect that e-books will
press on that paperback

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.440
market or the market of
less beautiful objects,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.250
but I think we still
do have a material

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.660
culture that people like.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.770
And even kids seem to continue
like those physical objects,

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.270
so I don't think
they're going away.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.810
But we do have to
figure out a way--

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.520
how do we support libraries
when patrons hold up

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.250
their hands just the way
you did in this room, many

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.440
saying I prefer the paper, some
saying you prefer the digital.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.110
And with a trend toward
increasingly digital, one

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.410
of the things that
we have put libraries

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.317
in such a tough
position with is saying,

00:33:19.317 --> 00:33:21.150
with the same amount
of money or less money,

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.780
you have to do both the digital
stuff and the physical stuff.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.539
That is an untenable position.

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:27.330
We've got to figure
out a way, whether it's

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.860
through collaboration
or continuing

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.920
to support through funding
or it's capital investment,

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.960
to allow libraries
to be able to thrive

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.620
in what is going to be
both physical and digital

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.340
as a world.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.885
I think we should do it in a
global context, to be sure.

00:33:41.885 --> 00:33:45.320
And this was one of the parts
of Bob's genius and others

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.370
as we started out with
the Digital Public

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.730
Library of America.

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.190
Yes, of course, it's been
seen as a national effort,

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.200
but it's been done in an
international context.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.760
The United States is actually
not the first country

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.515
to come up with a digital
strategy for their nation.

00:33:59.515 --> 00:34:02.350
The Europeans actually are
much further ahead, at least

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.430
time-wise, in the form of
Europeana, as an example.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.910
And very much the first
thing that DPLA did

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:11.800
was to find a way to
work with the Europeans.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.600
And the notion was
not to say, we're

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.130
just going to create one
worldwide library or one

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.550
worldwide digital
library of Alexandria,

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.419
but to say we can actually have
maybe 200 different countries

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:23.960
having theirs, but figure out
how to make them interoperable.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.790
How do you ensure
that from the user

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.710
perspective people actually
can access these materials?

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.630
So one of the first
things DPLA did

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.299
was to create an
exhibit on immigration

00:34:33.299 --> 00:34:35.090
that showed people
going from the old world

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.790
to the new and the
new world to the old,

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.370
to ensure that as we built
this system it would actually

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.594
work on a global level.

00:34:40.594 --> 00:34:42.260
We have the diversity
and the difference

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.843
and the innovation that happens
in all these different country

00:34:44.843 --> 00:34:48.416
levels, but we actually
connect it in a global vision.

00:34:48.416 --> 00:34:50.889
And in some ways
most importantly,

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.739
I put up here a map of Utopia.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:54.480
You can see it here.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.350
My view is we should
dream really, really big.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.810
This is the moment
when we are designing

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.890
what public libraries and
scholarly libraries and school

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.700
libraries can and should
be for the future.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.730
And I am not so pollyannish
to say that we are absolutely

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.040
going to become a utopia.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.916
That's not the point.

00:35:10.916 --> 00:35:13.331
But the point is we should
have something that we actually

00:35:13.331 --> 00:35:14.565
are building toward in mind.

00:35:14.565 --> 00:35:16.190
It should be a shared
vision that we're

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.260
really excited about.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.160
And I feel like that's
entirely, entirely possible,

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.130
to put that vision ahead of us
and to build as much toward it

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.130
as we can, and to
say that we are not

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:29.130
going to accept a digital
world or a digital hybrid

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.270
with the physical world that's
actually less good than what

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.050
we've had in the past
in terms of access,

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.460
in terms of preservation,
in terms of commitment

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.100
to democratic ideals.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.810
And I think that it's an
extremely exciting moment

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:41.970
to come together.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.812
So I hope very
much that you will

00:35:43.812 --> 00:35:45.020
share your questions with me.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.630
But most importantly,
thank you for being

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.880
engaged in a discussion about
the future of libraries.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.460
And I look forward to
working with all of you

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.639
to make it very bright.

00:35:52.639 --> 00:35:53.637
Thank you so much.

00:35:53.637 --> 00:35:57.629
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:06.150
Thank you indeed for this
sparkling call to action.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.270
We should take
questions, comments.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.420
So hands are going up.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.310
Microphones are
with Dan, at least.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:13.820
So Dan, get it going.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.440
And feel free to
tell us who you are.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.610
JOHN PALFREY: And
argument's most welcome.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.140
Hard questions go to Jonathan.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:18.550
AUDIENCE: Good evening.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.175
My name is
[? Yungtan Kamensky. ?]

00:36:20.175 --> 00:36:23.850
I'm an incoming student
at Simmons GSLIS,

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.480
and I was intrigued by
the discussion of trying

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.120
to replicate serendipity
in the digital world,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.210
particularly the slide
with Gravity's Rainbow,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.390
looking at metadata while trying
to replicate the experience

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.060
of viewing items on a stack.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.190
Has anyone looked at
doing the opposite?

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.580
And what I mean is
taking the digital

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.200
and putting it in the
physical stacks, probably

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.400
through augmented reality
technologies-- maybe

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.500
something as simple as QR codes.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.540
People all have fancy little
computers in their hands.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.590
It seems to me there'd
be some way to do that.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.310
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
Oculus Library.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.910
You'd be staggering around.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.590
You could do it right here
and just pull stuff off.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.321
Is that the idea?

00:37:08.321 --> 00:37:10.820
AUDIENCE: Something a little
bit less cumbersome, hopefully.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:11.845 --> 00:37:13.720
JOHN PALFREY: Sounds
like a fabulous project,

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.830
and a great one for you to do
during your master's degree,

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.950
for sure, or PhD--
whatever comes next.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.272
In a serious way,
I think the group

00:37:22.272 --> 00:37:24.480
that I've heard most talking
about this kind of thing

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.740
around here-- is
Jeffrey Schnapp here,

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.230
or others who worked with
the Library Test Kitchen?

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.100
This is very much
the kind of thing

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.651
that group was working on.

00:37:34.651 --> 00:37:36.900
I would restate a little bit
what I was trying to say,

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.740
which was not
entirely to replace

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.410
to take the physical
experience and put it online

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.300
but really to rethink what the
combination of those two things

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:45.800
would be.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.633
And I think that's
exactly your point, which

00:37:47.633 --> 00:37:50.420
is some of the things
that might actually work

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.880
would be looking
at what are some

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.500
of the pathways that
people use today

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.919
online that actually could
supplement or augment

00:37:57.919 --> 00:37:58.460
the physical?

00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.985
And I think that's where
excitement would lie,

00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:01.920
would be that interface
between those two

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.220
and trying to make an
experience that could be better

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.766
than what we've had to date.

00:38:06.766 --> 00:38:08.640
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Can
we navigate the mic up

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.560
to the next place?

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.860
Here's one from Armand, too.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.560
We can alternate
back and forth, so.

00:38:19.577 --> 00:38:21.160
BOB DARNTON: John,
I would like to ask

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.880
a self-interested
question, because I've

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.330
just written
something about that

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.719
is an attempt at an answer.

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:30.010
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: And you
should, just for the record,

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.220
identify yourself, Bob.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.380
BOB DARNTON: I'm Bob Darnton,
University Librarian.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.970
What do you think should be the
top priorities for the Library

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:45.140
of Congress, and what
should the new librarian,

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:50.726
who will assume his or her
position on January 1, do?

00:38:50.726 --> 00:38:52.642
JOHN PALFREY: Thats'
a wonderful question.

00:38:52.642 --> 00:38:54.850
Well, Professor Darnton, I
think the first thing that

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.300
should happen is that the
President should invite

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.196
you to take up that
post in a few months

00:38:58.196 --> 00:39:02.110
now that you're available,
which I think would be fun.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.570
I think the next
person should do

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.100
a couple things that I think
the Library of Congress

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.660
has not done.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.750
One is, in a fundamental
way, to see itself

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.714
as a national library.

00:39:12.714 --> 00:39:14.880
And I think the Library of
Congress in some respects

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.772
has dodged that for a long
time, by saying in part

00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:19.230
it's a research
arm of the Congress

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.310
and in part it's our national
library, but not quite.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.810
I think you have
to grab it and say,

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.890
this is the national library,
and we are not the whole thing

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.587
but we are connected
to the rest of it,

00:39:27.587 --> 00:39:29.420
and should actually
play nice with the rest.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.760
And to say that there in fact
is a really positive role

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.847
that the Library of Congress
can play in an interconnected

00:39:36.847 --> 00:39:37.680
and networked world.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.060
I think that would be one.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.602
I think two would
be then-- so that's

00:39:40.602 --> 00:39:42.643
sort of a conceptual shift,
but an important one.

00:39:42.643 --> 00:39:44.740
And two would be to take
on mass digitization

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.990
in a meaningful way.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:47.390
So I think that
people have often

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.100
pointed to the World
Digital Library

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.760
and the 11,000 or so objects
that have been digitized it it.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.290
That's too small a number,
I think, for internet scale.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:58.770
And I think for an entity
like the Library of Congress

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.420
to take up this job
of mass digitilization

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.410
and to work with the
National Archives, which

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:07.100
has been hard at work at it,
the Smithsonian, the GPO, lots

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.587
of other parties
in the government,

00:40:08.587 --> 00:40:10.670
and actually lead that
effort-- I think that could

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:11.990
be enormously powerful.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.480
A third thing would
be join the DPLA.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.270
So one of the
absurdities, I think,

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.670
of the process we've
had for five years

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.550
is that we have the
National Archives,

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.520
we have the Smithsonian,
we have the GPO,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.900
we have lots of other federal
agencies participating.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.720
And yet, the Library
of Congress has

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.610
resisted our invitations for
all that time, which seems to me

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:31.490
bizarre.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:32.920
Anyway, I could
go down the list.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.830
But I think the opportunities
for leadership--

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.280
particularly in
the digital realm,

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.940
but in that combination
of the digital

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.775
and the physical--
could be enormous.

00:40:41.775 --> 00:40:43.650
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
Wherever the other mic is.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.810
JOHN PALFREY: Ah, Dean Minow.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.620
MARTHA MINOW: Dean Minow.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.800
John, it's just so
fabulous, the book.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.320
Everyone should buy it.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.284
Don't take the 30% discount.

00:40:54.284 --> 00:40:55.450
Just give him all the money.

00:40:57.703 --> 00:40:59.494
JOHN PALFREY: You see
why we love our dean?

00:40:59.494 --> 00:41:00.601
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:00.601 --> 00:41:02.350
MARTHA MINOW: Well,
it's such a great book

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.180
because you open up
what the possibilities

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.940
that the digital world
offers to open up libraries,

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.180
while identifying what the
traditional libraries have that

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.220
are at risk.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.310
My question to you
is really threefold.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:20.030
One, what business models
do you see going forward

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.790
that can make the vision real?

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.100
Secondly, what
legal changes would

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.770
be necessary and feasible
to make the changes real?

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.850
And the third is, aren't there
possibilities that we never

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:34.010
saw before, like
makerspaces, where

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.790
the interactivity between
the digital and the physical

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.900
may open up something
we never had before?

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.900
JOHN PALFREY: Those are
three awesome questions.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.970
So the first one, which
is the hardest one,

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.220
is the business model question.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.130
My view is that by and
large, libraries shouldn't

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.650
have to have a business model.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.160
So by and large,
there is a public--

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.435
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:54.435 --> 00:41:54.976
Look at that.

00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:56.340
That's so good.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.320
Basically, I think
libraries are a public good.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.950
And I think that
the business should

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.740
be that through our
taxpayer dollars

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.930
we should support
public libraries.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.940
And the United States
really is the leader.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.540
And actually, Boston
really has been

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.850
the leader of that
since the BPL opened,

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:12.280
then lots of small-town
libraries-- all those great HH

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.196
Richardson buildings
that look like Sever Hall

00:42:14.196 --> 00:42:16.570
and look like parts
of the law school,

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.710
those are the early formation
of the public library

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.929
system in the country.

00:42:20.929 --> 00:42:22.970
And then of course there's
the Carnegie libraries

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.970
that spread out
1,600 communities

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.430
wide in the early 20th century.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.420
So I think they should
be publicly financed,

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.260
by and large.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.680
I do think that philanthropy
has a huge role to play,

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.680
and one of the arguments
that I make in the book

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.720
is to say that, at moments
of key transition--

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.170
as Mr. Carnegie
did; and there are

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:41.430
lots of reasons to
criticize Carnegie,

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.430
but one thing he did was
he put a lot of capital

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:46.490
into libraries that spread
them from big cities

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.510
into lots of small towns
at a crucial moment.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.990
So I actually
think it'd be great

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:51.870
if the Carnegie Corporation
or the MacArthur

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.036
Foundation or others would
in fact stand up and say,

00:42:54.036 --> 00:42:57.750
this is a moment to do a
big investment of that sort.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.750
After that, I think one of
the questions is to say,

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:02.320
should libraries
be in the business

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.180
of selling stuff
or having a revenue

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.200
model that looks otherwise?

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.660
I think that libraries,
archives, museums,

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.315
are all asking these
kinds of questions.

00:43:12.315 --> 00:43:14.690
There are, of course, things
that we can license and make

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:15.700
some money on.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.430
This library here, of course,
has made some amount of money

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:21.890
on royalties by virtue of
taking materials we had

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.860
and digitizing those, allowing
people then to sell them back

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.360
to us or other libraries.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.309
I think there's
something in that.

00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:30.350
But I would much rather
see a business model that

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:32.551
was focused on
collaboration, and one

00:43:32.551 --> 00:43:34.550
that was focused on open
access and other things

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.600
that I actually think we
have the seeds of here,

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.010
rather than see it
as something where

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.430
we actually have to have a
corporate-style business model.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.770
But others may disagree.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.510
Second of the three questions,
about legal changes--

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.380
I think just to
state it really fast,

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.270
Orphan Works legislation
should change.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.310
So to Bob's question,
one of the great things

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.930
about the Library of Congress
is that position overseas,

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:57.422
the Register of Copyrights.

00:43:57.422 --> 00:43:59.130
So the Library of
Congress could stand up

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:01.460
and say, look,
really simply, nobody

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.890
is hurt by having Orphan Works
legislation-- tens of millions

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.080
of works that could be
made available that are not

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:07.990
being made available.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:10.694
And if somebody finds that
they're the copyright holder,

00:44:10.694 --> 00:44:12.860
they then will be able to
put it back into copyright

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.730
if they wish to, or not.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.210
And in fact, I just can't see
how Orphan Works legislation

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.930
doesn't really help everyone.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.300
Section 108 reform--
there are special rules

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.370
that relate to libraries.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.910
There are special rules that
allow libraries to do things,

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.640
for instance, for those who
have different abilities-- so

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.880
for the blind and otherwise.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.730
There are specific rules that
are way out of date and ought

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:32.650
to be reformed.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:35.176
So we've gone a certain
distance on Section 108 reform.

00:44:35.176 --> 00:44:36.550
We could go further
and so forth.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.500
So there are a series
of things, I think,

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.980
in that area that are crucial.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.510
And the other piece
of legal reform

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.340
that needs to be tied to
that is privacy reform.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.810
I think libraries have
done such a great job

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.160
of being the places where
we protect reader privacy.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.670
We need to ensure that
the law allows libraries

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.520
to do that on an ongoing basis.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.397
And last, makerspaces--
yes, for sure.

00:44:56.397 --> 00:44:58.480
One of the things you
pushed me to do when I first

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.160
took this job was to focus
on co-production, the idea

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.410
that libraries are spaces
in which we are producing

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.910
new knowledge of various sorts.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.280
Makerspaces are one example.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.885
The new media labs popping up
around the country are another.

00:45:09.885 --> 00:45:12.170
I think they're great
examples of bringing people

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.070
into libraries to
create new knowledge.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.660
I feel like that's the
excitement of having

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.010
an open application
programming interface layer,

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.689
and so forth, which is
in-person and from afar

00:45:21.689 --> 00:45:23.730
we can create new things
that have never existed.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.450
Yeah?

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.540
AUDIENCE: Hi, John.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.670
Pat McCormick, former
student, Kennedy School grad.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:33.990
I can't wait to read the book.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.136
So excuse me if
this is in the book.

00:45:36.136 --> 00:45:38.196
JOHN PALFREY: No
problem. [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:38.196 --> 00:45:39.070
one way or the other.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.250
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:45.600
I'm very interested in the API
and the platform and all that,

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.829
but my question is more mundane.

00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:49.370
In the city where
I live, Somerville,

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:53.620
we're struggling to keep library
branches open, to restore them,

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.390
to create new spaces
that aren't traditional.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.160
And it seems like
this concept would

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:04.436
allow us to open a library with
fewer books-- assuming we have

00:46:04.436 --> 00:46:06.060
the platform as well;
that's not to say

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.060
we don't need the books--
in different spaces

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.210
to restore historic
buildings and reuse them

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.322
in different ways.

00:46:13.322 --> 00:46:14.780
And I was just
wondering the extent

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.730
to which you've
thought about this

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:20.460
as a way of creating more
flexibility, lower cost

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.492
barriers for physical
libraries in our cities.

00:46:23.492 --> 00:46:25.075
JOHN PALFREY: That's
a great question.

00:46:25.075 --> 00:46:27.470
And I understand Somerville
has a fabulous new librarian.

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.290
You've got-- it's
an exciting moment

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.850
for Somerville in particular.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.250
So my preferred answer was
that we fund libraries fully,

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:38.140
and that they have a fabulous
physical infrastructure

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.310
and branches that are open.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.726
Actually, one of the things
that Boston Public Library did

00:46:41.726 --> 00:46:43.630
was introduce the branch
system, as well-- so

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:45.610
have lots of
community-based libraries,

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:47.120
and support them well.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.400
I think the reality is that
we don't in communities often

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.190
make that full investment.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:55.260
And I think that's where we
have to say, so what can we do?

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.000
How do we embrace this future
while also doing as much

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.340
of the fabulous existing
stuff as we can?

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.800
I think the only answer
there is to collaborate,

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.910
is to say that we
don't need to bring

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:07.886
the same collection to every
one of these physical spaces.

00:47:07.886 --> 00:47:10.510
Librarians, of course, have done
this very well for a long time

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.218
with interlibrary loan
and with a variety

00:47:12.218 --> 00:47:14.020
of other forms of
sharing, but I think

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.680
those can be amped up and
done more extensively.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.650
And of course, as
I've argued, I think

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.840
from a digital
perspective, every library

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.721
should not be creating
its own iPad app.

00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:26.220
Not every library
should be creating

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.910
its own various digital systems.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:30.630
That is something
that we can, if we

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.980
take a page enough out of
the open source movement,

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.120
do in a collaborative way.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.310
And I think that would
allow for communities

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:41.850
to make choices as to how they
spend what are scarcer dollars.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:45.510
So would I rather see
fewer books in libraries?

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.140
Of course not.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.280
But I think where we have
to make that choice--

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.950
do as much collaboration
as possible

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:51.450
to allow as much
choice as possible.

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:52.658
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Over here.

00:47:52.658 --> 00:47:53.890
Did the mic find a new home?

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.910
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Ron [? Newman. ?]

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:07.170
I've been using libraries
for about 54 years.

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:12.280
I wanted to come back to that
slide and what it represents.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.290
It's very seductive.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:17.700
On the other hand, it also shows
a limitation of physical stacks

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.970
as they are now, which is
that a book, as it comes

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.670
into the library, gets one
Dewey decimal or Library

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.850
of Congress number and
forever that's the one

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:26.820
place where it is.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.500
In a digital system
you can do better

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.460
than that, because
that book can sit

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.760
on many different shelf lists.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.470
Is there opportunity
for some sort of wiki

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:40.100
kind of cataloging system
to emerge from this so

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.740
that many people can
collectively catalog material

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.819
better than one person can?

00:48:45.819 --> 00:48:47.610
JOHN PALFREY: There's
some people laughing.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.720
Tracy, do you want that one?

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.220
No?

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.910
Tracy does not wish it.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:52.680
Anyone else?

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.234
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:54.234 --> 00:48:55.400
JOHN PALFREY: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.450
So if somebody in the Harvard
Library System liked it--

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:58.460
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: It
would be fitting to have

00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:59.490
the answer crowdsourced.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:00.990
JOHN PALFREY: Yeah,
that's exactly--

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.681
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:07.770
AUDIENCE: I certainly
think that we

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.700
have catalog systems that do
allow different kinds of access

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.200
points.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.550
And they may not be as
seductive and as appealing

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.650
as this kind of
display, but they

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:22.710
are initial and in some ways
rudimentary attempts to combine

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.920
digital information and
physical information

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.100
into a wide variety of indexes
that give the user lots

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.260
of ways to get into it.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.820
The problem is they're
a little too complex.

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:33.380
And so we still
need to keep working

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.630
at figuring out how
to make it both simple

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:36.950
but complex at the same time.

00:49:39.734 --> 00:49:42.150
JOHN PALFREY: My answer-- Tracy
knows vastly more about it

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.700
than I do, and from a
technical perspective

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.610
there are a zillion
challenges behind it.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.460
But I think from a conceptual
perspective, the idea

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.150
that there's one indicator for
something in an old-school way,

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:55.860
as compared to saying you could
have many more data points that

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.610
allow different ways into it, I
think that conceptual shift is

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.470
actually very, very important.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:04.260
And I think the trend,
which is moving away

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.470
from having the knowledge
be in a particular catalog

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:10.730
or a particular catalog entry
to one where in fact there

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:13.975
are many more ways to
identify the information

00:50:13.975 --> 00:50:17.168
and then do more with it, is
sort of an obvious movement.

00:50:20.734 --> 00:50:22.650
MARCY MURNINGHAM: My
name is Marcy Murningham,

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:26.660
and my question
pertains to the theme

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:29.430
of hybrid and collaboration.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:33.520
There are vast pools of
financial assets swimming

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.720
around every community,
billions and billions of dollars

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.040
in the form of assets
under management

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.230
for tax-exempt
institutional investors.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:49.750
In theory, those
tax-exempt institutions

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.330
exist to advance
the public interest.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:55.350
That is the reason for
their tax-exempt status.

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:59.640
And Boston, as we know, is
very rich in those kinds

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.830
of institutions.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:06.870
According to my research, the
top 60 tax-exempt institutions

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:12.195
in Boston have combined
assets of over $50 billion.

00:51:12.195 --> 00:51:15.650
There are ways, it
seems to me, for tapping

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.630
into some of that
money and bending it

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:23.860
toward the public
interest-- that is to say,

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:27.940
institutions such as
public libraries that

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.660
otherwise rely on
taxpayer revenue streams

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.820
or even philanthropy.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.630
I'd just encourage you
to think more creatively

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:40.280
about revenue sources that
could be bent toward libraries

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.025
in our nation's communities.

00:51:42.025 --> 00:51:42.360
JOHN PALFREY: Thank you.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.651
I think that's very thoughtful.

00:51:43.651 --> 00:51:46.150
I would imagine that one
of those is this one,

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.560
is Harvard and others.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.440
Also one school that has
a fair amount of capital,

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.160
not the same amount
that this one does,

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.570
but I think that's
important to note.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:59.000
I think one of the
reasons why I think

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.310
it's incumbent upon
this institution

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:03.200
to do things like open
access, to do things

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.880
like digitize its materials
and share them more broadly,

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.190
even though there's not
a revenue stream back

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:10.767
to this institution,
is because I

00:52:10.767 --> 00:52:12.350
think we are private
institutions that

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:13.670
have a public purpose.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.760
And I think if we don't
see it that way we're

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.460
making a huge mistake.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.624
Whether or not there would be
a tax on these institutions

00:52:20.624 --> 00:52:22.290
that then goes back
to public libraries,

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:25.200
I'm not sure that that's
necessarily right either.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.290
But I think that it's a
very interesting question,

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.920
and I think it's one that
we have to figure out

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.910
how we are justifying,
in a sense,

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:34.300
holding this amount of
capital in a relatively

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.570
small number of institutions.

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:38.778
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Over here?

00:52:42.152 --> 00:52:42.860
ERICA CHARIS: Hi.

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.460
My name's Erica Charis,
and I'm a librarian over

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.626
at Berklee College of Music.

00:52:46.626 --> 00:52:48.774
JOHN PALFREY: Awesome.

00:52:48.774 --> 00:52:50.815
AUDIENCE: The ideas that
are something in my head

00:52:50.815 --> 00:52:54.600
that I'm hoping to hear
what your thoughts are on,

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.140
if libraries are about
people and libraries

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.780
are becoming more
digital, how do

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.790
we bridge the gap
between the kid talking

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:04.130
into his phone and the
librarian sitting at the desk

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.260
three feet away?

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:08.377
What does digital service
necessarily look like?

00:53:08.377 --> 00:53:09.960
JOHN PALFREY: That's
a great question.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.350
I suspect many
people in the room

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:14.290
have great thoughts
and answers to this.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:16.510
I think part of it is
actually as teachers

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.080
that we actually have
to tell that student

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.440
to go talk to that person.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.050
We need to make that
human connection happen.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.250
I've been teaching United
States history this year

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.354
to a group of 14 kids who
are in their junior year

00:53:29.354 --> 00:53:31.520
of high school, and I think
one of the things you do

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.760
is assign kids to go
talk to a librarian,

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.620
and to have them
interface therefore

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.830
with all these amazing
things as part of a paper.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:43.377
And I think that kind of thing
that many professors do here

00:53:43.377 --> 00:53:44.960
at the law school
[INAUDIBLE] actually

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.230
say, in the course of working on
something you actually must go

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:48.420
spend time with the librarian.

00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.670
I think that's actually a
really positive thing to do,

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.370
and I think it creates
connections and pathways that

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.220
are essential and
actually breaks down

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.380
what is happening, when
in the digital world

00:53:58.380 --> 00:53:59.297
we sometimes withdraw.

00:53:59.297 --> 00:54:00.880
Even though we think
it's more social,

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:04.674
sometimes we're withdrawing,
away from human contact.

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:06.090
So I actually
think, as educators,

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.190
in some sense we have
to construct ways

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:09.695
to bring people back together.

00:54:09.695 --> 00:54:12.344
Now, could it be-- go ahead.

00:54:12.344 --> 00:54:13.260
I would love to hear--

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.580
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: I think
you might be about to say

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.650
what I'm going to ask you.

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:18.040
JOHN PALFREY: So why don't you
say what was on my mind, yes?

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.914
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
Suppose Apple comes to you

00:54:19.914 --> 00:54:21.380
with a proposal for your advice.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.720
And Apple says, you know what?

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.690
We'd like to improve
the Siri experience.

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.400
The easiest part of
Siri is to answer

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.077
the 20% of possible questions
that 80% of the people

00:54:34.077 --> 00:54:35.910
ask, which is like,
what's the weather going

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:37.170
to be tomorrow or--

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:38.500
JOHN PALFREY: What's the
score on the Red Sox game?

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:39.625
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Exactly.

00:54:39.625 --> 00:54:40.860
Or, I'd like to buy a book.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:41.860
Maybe that won't happen.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.540
But anyway, there's a
bunch of other questions

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.890
that are long-tail questions.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:51.220
What if the way that we
used to route letters

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:55.250
that children wrote to Santa and
addressed to the North Pole--

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:56.754
and they got sent
somewhere, right?

00:54:56.754 --> 00:54:57.670
I think they still do.

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.550
They go to people who
answer the letters?

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.300
I don't know what the
liability policy is.

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:06.970
But what if similar
to that, we simply

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.240
arranged for people
asking Siri to route

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.270
those two reference librarians
around the country or the world

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:17.540
who would then answer
through the Siri pipeline

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.710
and be attributed to it.

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:21.310
By the way, this is brought
to you courtesy of a library.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.751
And if you'd like to be more
about it, blah, blah, blah.

00:55:23.751 --> 00:55:25.250
What would your
reaction be to that?

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:26.190
Is that like, no, no.

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.190
That's exactly the kind
of corporate mediated

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:30.015
dehumanization that
I rail against.

00:55:30.015 --> 00:55:31.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:34.000
Or would it be, this
is exactly the kind

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.770
of public-private partnership
that would put libraries back

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:39.860
at the center of the meaningful
questions people ask?

00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.620
JOHN PALFREY: So I will answer
that if I can ask my friend

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.490
Yochai to answer after I
do, because he's much more

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:46.890
about that kind of system--

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:49.098
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Yochai
is playing the role of Siri

00:55:49.098 --> 00:55:49.944
in this.

00:55:49.944 --> 00:55:52.110
JOHN PALFREY: This is the
advanced cold call request

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:53.730
to my friend in a moment.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:56.063
I was really interested-- did
you see The New York Times

00:55:56.063 --> 00:55:58.010
article about is
Wikipedia in trouble

00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:59.943
as the numbers are
declining and so forth?

00:55:59.943 --> 00:56:02.170
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: They run
that article about every year.

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:03.820
JOHN PALFREY: They do, but
it was in the Sunday Review

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:04.240
this week.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.864
We're seeing a little
bit more serious.

00:56:05.864 --> 00:56:08.850
It wasn't a great
article, but anyway.

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.980
So here are a couple of answers.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.370
I would be hesitant to do that
particular deal with Apple

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:14.744
for the reason
you're suggesting,

00:56:14.744 --> 00:56:21.180
which is I worry that
if what we keep doing

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.850
is creating systems
that do not have

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.845
the library as the
primary interface,

00:56:25.845 --> 00:56:27.970
whether it's a public
library or a research library

00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:31.530
or a special library or a school
library, I am troubled by that.

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:35.065
So the deal with Apple makes
me nervous for a really, really

00:56:35.065 --> 00:56:35.690
simple reason--

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.177
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: So the
model is free to all, so long

00:56:38.177 --> 00:56:39.510
as you come through our doorway.

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:41.567
JOHN PALFREY: Right.

00:56:41.567 --> 00:56:43.150
Well, so long as you
don't necessarily

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:44.983
have to come through
Apple's doorway, right?

00:56:44.983 --> 00:56:48.099
So if it were done in a
truly open source way,

00:56:48.099 --> 00:56:49.890
I could imagine that
being very attractive.

00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:51.970
If it's only
through Siri or it's

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:53.727
creating a system
that relies upon Siri

00:56:53.727 --> 00:56:56.310
and the iPhone as opposed to an
Android device or [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:57.810
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
You could imagine

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:00.040
it building into the DPLA
as part of that stack

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.520
and have an API call
to ask a librarian,

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.650
and Siri can plug in, and
Google Now can plug in.

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:08.260
JOHN PALFREY: That would be
much more interesting, for sure.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.460
But I wouldn't do a deal--
and I just think of Apple

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.070
as the ultimate in
exclusive-- somebody

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:16.310
has written about
this too, as have you.

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:21.670
So yes, but only according to a
structure that was truly open.

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:23.800
One thing that we've talked
a lot about with DPLA

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.240
that's a fun idea
which is like this

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.370
is the idea of the scannebago.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:30.530
I don't know if people
have heard this idea,

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.367
but it's called the scannebago.

00:57:32.367 --> 00:57:33.450
I did not come up with it.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:35.140
Emily Gore who
works at DPLA did.

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.080
But the idea of the scannebago--

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.164
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
He's making Emily Gore

00:57:37.164 --> 00:57:39.030
be the recipient of the
trademark infringement letter.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.910
JOHN PALFREY: No, no.

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:43.180
The idea of the scannebago
would be to get a Winnebago

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.330
and put in the back
of it a scanner

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:48.600
and drive it around the country
and have people bring out

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.355
the materials that
they have to scan them,

00:57:50.355 --> 00:57:51.980
and then the people
who were driving it

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.160
would help put in the
metadata and do the scanning.

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.590
And you could imagine the
documentary or the NPR piece

00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:59.630
sort of writes
itself, this notion

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:01.440
of driving around the country.

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.950
And you could imagine it tapping
into library students, people

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:08.160
who just care about libraries,
the sort of Wikipedia

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:08.960
equivalents.

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.760
You could see it also really
appealing to retired librarians

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.930
as something that people could
do as part of this network.

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:18.619
And I actually think about
when reference librarians

00:58:18.619 --> 00:58:20.285
retire, what are some
of the things that

00:58:20.285 --> 00:58:21.368
would be really fun to do?

00:58:21.368 --> 00:58:25.440
It might be occasionally to be
in this particular role, which

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.110
I think the DPLA
actually could mediate

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:28.360
in a really interesting way.

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.300
So I think there is
a version of what

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:34.110
has made Wikipedia so successful
that we could do for libraries.

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.590
It'd be really,
really fun frankly.

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:38.190
You think about Wikimania
coming to a place

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:40.170
like this, as it did
a bunch of years ago.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.800
Having DPLA Fest be a place
where people showed up

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.027
and actually edited metadata
and answered questions.

00:58:45.027 --> 00:58:45.860
It would be really--

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.190
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: It's like
a collective Antiques Roadshow

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.490
content.

00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:50.050
JOHN PALFREY: Yes, incredibly
geeky and incredibly fun.

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:50.140
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:
But there'd be

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.290
a triage area at
the beginning to see

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:53.670
if there's a copyright problem.

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:54.980
JOHN PALFREY: Well,
there could be that, too.

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:55.370
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: You'd
turn away a lot of stuff.

00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:56.142
JOHN PALFREY: That
could be true, too.

00:58:56.142 --> 00:58:58.270
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: These
Hardy Boys are too young.

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:00.330
JOHN PALFREY: [INAUDIBLE]
risk with respect

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:03.215
to the copyright, which would
be an interesting conversation.

00:59:03.215 --> 00:59:04.480
Y

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.315
JOHN PALFREY: Are
you willing to--

00:59:07.315 --> 00:59:10.150
YOCHAI BENKLER: Jet lag
from being away for awhile

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:12.800
notwithstanding, I'll try.

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:15.620
Something that came out in the
exchange between the two of you

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:20.490
and the scannebago
is let's not talk

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:23.900
about the corporate
culture of Apple and Siri.

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.822
Let's talk about the
isolation of the interaction

00:59:26.822 --> 00:59:27.530
with the machine.

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:29.750
And you had said
something earlier

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:35.310
about the human
experience of the library.

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:39.170
You talked about
the kids coming.

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:41.200
And as you start to talk
about the scannebago

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.050
and who would come
and who wouldn't come,

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:50.470
I'd love to hear more from you
about what the human platform

00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:54.790
element is, which is quite
distinct from the DPLA

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:56.930
platform, is much
more like that,

00:59:56.930 --> 01:00:00.280
and is a form of a response to
the Siri question that's about.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.210
Even if it were fine from
the corporate perspective,

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:06.420
it takes the service
aspect of the library

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:11.530
and makes it available
to isolated individuals.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.710
And the question is, can
you say a little bit more,

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.001
either from the book or your
experience with how you're

01:00:16.001 --> 01:00:19.880
thinking about building
the library at your school,

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:25.260
about what it is that we do to
support that human interaction

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.080
that libraries
traditionally have provided,

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.540
and how that
connects, if at all,

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:35.640
to this very powerful response
you began with Martha's

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.550
question of, don't
need a business model,

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:42.410
you need a story about the
core of the public service

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.240
and about the core
of human interaction?

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.449
Can you put a little bit
more flesh on those bones?

01:00:46.449 --> 01:00:48.740
JOHN PALFREY: So this is what
happens when you hang out

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.174
with your old professors.

01:00:50.174 --> 01:00:52.340
They answer your question
with a hard question back.

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.720
I totally didn't miss that
that's what just happened.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.840
I was hoping to glean some of
the brilliance of Yochai in it,

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.600
but we got it in
a different form.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.920
So thank you.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.580
So the hard question, I
think, is an important one.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.060
So step one, from
my perspective,

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.195
is the notion of
humanity, which is

01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:12.480
I actually think that
if we lose the notion

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.910
of the incredible, incredible
group of people who work

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:18.312
in libraries-- this is where
the love letter starts--

01:01:18.312 --> 01:01:20.645
and the experience of somebody
walking in-- whether it's

01:01:20.645 --> 01:01:23.490
a scholar or it's a kid or it's
an old person, whatever it is--

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:25.570
that is a hugely
important, I think,

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:28.330
democratic interaction
that actually doesn't have

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:29.699
to do with the transaction.

01:01:29.699 --> 01:01:31.990
It doesn't have to do with
the transaction in the sense

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:34.240
of Netflix wants you to think
about this movie instead

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:34.980
of this movie.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.810
It has to do with
people in a community

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:40.270
supporting one another and
doing what is civic work.

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:42.950
So there's something that's
just essential about that.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:45.660
And no matter how quickly we
hurtle towards the digital,

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.470
I want to be sure
that that humanity is

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.230
in the mix in a
really fundamental way

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:50.313
and that we don't lose it.

01:01:50.313 --> 01:01:52.740
So that is really,
really crucial to it.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.470
Your question, though, also
goes to what is the role

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:57.070
of the librarian going forward.

01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:59.310
I would say in the
tough love category

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:01.950
in this book is actually
saying to my friends who

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.860
work in libraries and
others that I actually

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.630
think the shift we have to
make is to see librarians

01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:09.540
as not necessarily working
for a single institution

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:14.492
so much as working in the public
grid in a networked way, right?

01:02:14.492 --> 01:02:16.283
So there are about
100,000 school libraries

01:02:16.283 --> 01:02:17.158
in the United States.

01:02:17.158 --> 01:02:19.800
There are, call it,
15,000 public libraries

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.140
and call it another 10,000
or 15,000 other kinds

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:22.920
of libraries.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.970
So we're talking about
more than 100,000,

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:26.990
but not 150,000, institutions.

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:29.330
To the extent that each
of these institutions

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:31.872
had some percentage--
if it's one person

01:02:31.872 --> 01:02:33.580
or it's a percentage
of somebody's time--

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.240
which is really devoted to this
network public effort, I think,

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.040
would be vastly more powerful
than as isolated institutions.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.260
And I realize that's a shift.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.920
That would be
saying to the dean,

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.370
you're paying for people to
be focused on your professor,

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:50.100
supporting the professor writing
this great book on cooperation

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.683
or whatever it might
be-- you actually

01:02:51.683 --> 01:02:53.620
have to divert a certain
percentage of that

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:54.970
to something that
is the public good.

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:56.590
And by the way, it
will boomerang back

01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:57.820
in really awesome ways.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.440
And actually, this
is a bad example

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.898
because I think this dean has
made exactly that enlightened

01:03:01.898 --> 01:03:03.790
decision at Harvard Law School.

01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:07.340
But I think if every library
were seeing itself in that way,

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.840
I think that could
be very powerful.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.420
I think there are lots of
librarians in this room who

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.250
actually lived that experience.

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:15.680
But I'm not positive that that's
exactly what every institution

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.560
sees itself as doing as every
town library, every school

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.600
library, and so forth.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.870
But I think that
networked approach

01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:23.690
could be enormously
powerful in ways

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:25.560
that we haven't yet experienced.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.830
And I feel like it's taking
some of the learning that

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:29.760
has made the exposure
on the web so exciting

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.010
and the kinds of things that
have developed from that,

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.900
and having that
apply in the library

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.080
space for all these
amazing principles all

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.210
this amazing
material that I think

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:40.355
is so exciting for
what could come.

01:03:40.355 --> 01:03:42.730
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: In both
the book and the presentation,

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:45.270
you've managed to kind
of capture your optimism

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:48.300
without being
pollyannish about really

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:52.150
what's so valuable about the
library and the community

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:53.640
it represents.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.140
But you also manage
to put in at least

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.360
two potential snakes
in the gardens that

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.140
are really worrisome.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.230
You did a little riff on
what we'd call the first sale

01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:11.930
doctrine that says the anchor,
the platform of that library,

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:14.029
for hundreds of years
has been the idea

01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:15.820
that once you've got
the physical artifact,

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.450
you can lend it to someone
else, which also became

01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:19.950
the anchor of the
physical community

01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:22.580
because you had to go to the
library to fetch the book.

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:26.030
So much of just that
lending is part of it.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:30.520
And you pointed out that
a bizarre paradox, but not

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.500
a necessary one, about
digital advancements

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.740
is, congratulations, now we have
a way of locking this stuff up

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:43.000
tight where I might have a
privilege if I could figure out

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.300
how to unlock it, but I can't
figure it out and unlocking it

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.360
itself may break the law.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.200
So that seems like one
snake in the garden.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.620
I just wanted to see, if
you follow the dotted line,

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.230
do we end up with more
and more stuff locked up

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:00.500
as fewer and fewer of these get
produced, because the economics

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.930
are just so simple?

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:05.160
You also said at the end, these
might be interesting artifacts,

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.420
but they're not going to be
mass-produced the way they

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.400
are even still today.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:15.920
And the second snake in the
garden is how you find stuff,

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.170
that previously the
way to find stuff

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:21.900
was through categorizations
done by librarians

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.880
who had professional ethics
and responsibilities about how

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.990
to order stuff and
truly try to make

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:30.560
it accessible without wondering
about who paid them for product

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.580
placement on the shelf?

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.760
And now, as you say,
again and again we're

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:39.380
going to Google, one in
a handful of companies,

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:42.000
for all information,
not just monographs.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.140
Follow that dotted line out,
and do you see any difference

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:50.650
from the trend that's
already kind of overcome us

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:55.060
of not going to the library
or the library system

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.100
for that kind of categorization?

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:00.300
Those two snakes in the garden,
if that's what they are--

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:01.430
what do you do about them?

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:03.674
JOHN PALFREY: I think that
is a very good summation,

01:06:03.674 --> 01:06:05.590
and maybe that's where
we should end so people

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:06.900
can go do something else.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.090
But I think--

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.420
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: They're
going to [INAUDIBLE] next door

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:09.820
while eating.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.445
JOHN PALFREY: I'm so
glad. [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:14.341
That's good, since this is
a celebration of libraries.

01:06:14.341 --> 01:06:14.840
No.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.560
I think those two
snakes in the grass,

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.010
as they went their way
through, are huge risks.

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:22.859
We didn't talk about the entire
mass of the rest of copyright

01:06:22.859 --> 01:06:24.400
and the difficulty
of doing something

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.770
like DPLA given the
strictures of copyright,

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:30.670
so I think that's more like
an elephant in the room

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:32.260
than a snake in the grass.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.580
It's so obvious.

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.450
But I think these
two, the notion

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:39.560
of the absence of a
digital first sale doctrine

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.030
and the requirement that
libraries increasingly

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:45.390
become leasers as opposed
to owners-- when you combine

01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:47.610
that with the sort of
general corporatization--

01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:49.610
this is something that
goes back to the earliest

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:51.490
days of the internet, and
what James Boyle and Yochai

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:53.790
and others who are writing
about the enclosure movement.

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:55.620
I think those are things,
those are lessons,

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.786
that we've learned in other
parts of our scholarship

01:06:57.786 --> 01:07:00.210
that we have to apply over
here in the world of libraries,

01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:03.580
and actually seek to
bend the arc of where

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.580
the future will go,
or the future that

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.170
will be history will go.

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:09.460
I think that's a really,
really important thing for us

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.290
to stand up and say, we
don't want that version

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:14.210
of what the future could hold.

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:16.140
And one of the reasons
we don't want that

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.070
is because I think it
will undermine support

01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:18.990
for libraries.

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:20.570
And I think if we undermine
support for libraries

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.150
and we don't support them
in the way that we should,

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:23.470
I think that will
undermine our democracy

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:26.120
and I think it will undermine
scholarship, which of course,

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.820
are not unrelated also.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.140
And so yes, I think
those two snakes

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.242
making their way through
the grass are worrisome.

01:07:32.242 --> 01:07:34.450
I don't know how to meld
the elephant stomping around

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.889
with snakes.

01:07:35.889 --> 01:07:37.680
You're better at these
metaphors than I am.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.880
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: No, I was
just thinking of a Mark Twain

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.690
quote, that everybody always
talks about the weather

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.460
but nobody ever does
anything about it.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.760
And John, you're a great
example of somebody

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.140
who is both talking
about the environment

01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:51.900
that we're in, and not
just remarking upon it

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.270
but building the
actual structures,

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.740
the roles you've played in each
of these examples-- of course,

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.950
something you wouldn't
naturally trumpet.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.590
But you have just been so
crucial to all of this.

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:05.360
And for those reasons, it's not
just what you're writing about

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.734
but what you're
doing that we are

01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:09.620
so lucky to have you in the
mix, and all of the things

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.130
that you've done for us.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.390
So if you'll allow us
the uncomfortable moment

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.320
of thanking you for
all your hard work.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:15.620
JOHN PALFREY: You're very kind.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.453
Thank you, everyone.

01:08:16.453 --> 01:08:19.220
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:21.962 --> 01:08:23.420
And thank you to
the Berkman Center

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.720
and to the Harvard Law
School Library for hosting.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.120
I look forward to
seeing you next door.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:29.720
Thank you.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.570
JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Thank you.
