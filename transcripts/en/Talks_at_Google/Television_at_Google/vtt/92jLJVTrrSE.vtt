00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.341
ALAN SEALES: Please
welcome Eric McCormack.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.810
ERIC MCCORMACK: Hello.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.330
ALAN SEALES: So the show is very
different from what I typically

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.690
watch in that I guess it deals
with a lot of mental illness

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.730
and people with those
sorts of disorders.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.444
I mean, what made you want
to tackle this kind of show?

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:26.860
ERIC MCCORMACK:
Well, I mean, it's

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.370
a bit of a throwback as
a show, in terms of it's

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.580
a crime solving
show at its heart,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.389
but the guy doing the solving
is the interesting character.

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.180
I mean, that there's
a long period of time,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.970
I think, with cop shows,
in the last 10, 15

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.684
years, where Dick Wolf
with "Law and Order" said,

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:45.350
we don't care about
their personalities,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.140
we don't go home with the
cops, it's all about the crime.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.750
And "CSI" took
that even further.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.310
But this is a throwback
to "Columbo" and "Quincy"

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.950
and stuff, where the central
character has quirks,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.335
he has downfalls.

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:01.570
And in this case, he has
paranoid schizophrenia.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.460
And also, he's not
a cop, nor is he

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.330
a lawyer-- he is a professor.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.370
Most episodes begin
in the classroom

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.680
with him teaching
university students.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.250
And in this one, in
fact, in a couple

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520
of-- perhaps even
in the next scene,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.730
we are actually in
the Sorbonne in Paris,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.190
and he's lecturing there.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.542
I was drawn to it
because as a character,

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:26.500
he is so multi-faceted.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.864
Like Dr. House, he can
be a bit of an asshole.

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:34.280
He's the smartest
guy in the room,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.690
but he can also, because
of his condition,

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.400
suddenly be terrified.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.720
He can be hallucinating
something that ultimately will

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.850
help him, but in the moment,
it can absolutely destroy him.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.790
ALAN SEALES: So your
character is who?

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.456
ERIC MCCORMACK: He
is Dr. Daniel Pierce.

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:51.067
He is a neuroscience professor.

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.275
ALAN SEALES: Eccentric--
eccentric neuropsychiatrist.

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:53.790
ERIC MCCORMACK: Well, yeah.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.290
Yeah.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.359
I mean, if paranoid
schizophrenia

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.150
is an eccentricity, I
guess he's eccentric.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.850
He's a brilliant, brilliant
guy that basically

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.289
had his first break with
reality at about the age of 21

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.320
and could very easily
have gone off the rails,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.210
as so often happens,
but he stayed

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.490
at the university he was
at and eventually started

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.440
teaching there.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.720
LeVar Burton plays
his old friend

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.477
who is the dean of
the university and is,

00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:23.810
at least, when we started the
series, two years ago, was

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.100
keeping Daniel's condition
kind of under wraps.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.390
It was pretty much a secret.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.180
Everyone thought of
him as eccentric,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.520
not realizing that he was
a diagnosed schizophrenic.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.692
And that's come
out in the series,

00:02:34.692 --> 00:02:36.400
since the beginning
of the second season.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.300
He was kind of outed
on the witness stand.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.380
But still it's amazing because
when I first read this,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.190
I thought, I wonder
how many people

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.400
living with this
condition hold down

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.430
such a position of
power and influence.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.930
ALAN SEALES: Without
people knowing?

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.200
ERIC MCCORMACK: Right.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.010
Without people knowing, or
even with people knowing.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.500
What we all know about
paranoid schizophrenia,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.430
if we know anything at all, is
the guy outside the 7-Eleven

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.080
is crazy and he's
talking to himself,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.660
and that's what the
average person sees,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.220
or they see the 6 o'clock news,
and someone's just shut up

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.860
a room full of people,
and guess what?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.026
He's probably schizophrenic.

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:15.170
So that is the stigma
that gets out there,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.120
when in fact, there's a
tremendous number of people

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.980
living with it that,
in fact, run companies.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.749
And my model-- after
I got the part,

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.040
I did a lot of research and
there's an incredible woman

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.760
named Elyn Saks who wrote a
book called "The Center Cannot

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.700
Hold."

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.080
She's a university professor.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.360
She's a law professor at USC.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.900
But she was full blown
schizophrenic in the early 70s,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.180
and without her meds,
would still be so now.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.365
And yet, she teaches students,
she writes books, she lectures.

00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:45.520
She's a brilliant lecturer.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.570
And I thought, it doesn't
hurt to show America

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.280
there's another side
of mental illness.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.740
ALAN SEALES: So
is that more what

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.031
appealed to you about the role?

00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:56.199
You just wanted to increase
education of the subject?

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.990
ERIC MCCORMACK: That's
kind of a byproduct.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.350
And it's a great one.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.600
Ultimately, you just want
to play an interesting part

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.770
that the audience is drawn to.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.680
I didn't think, when I
finished the sitcom, hey,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.200
I should solve
crimes, that's what

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.860
I should do, how can I do that?

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.900
But it is the most popular
form of television, cable

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.899
or network, and defined an
interesting way into that.

00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:26.040
He's drawn into the FBI.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.510
They use him, but he
is not an FBI agent.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.490
He's a professor whose
expertise is called upon.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.360
So I like the academic setting.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.040
Like I say, every episode
has university scenes.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.400
And you don't see a lot
of that on any series.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.800
We have high school shows,
but we don't necessarily

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.900
have a lot of college
shows and particularly

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.960
at that level of academia.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.620
So that drew me, too.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.000
ALAN SEALES: The TA in the
show-- he's been in nine years,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.500
I think, in the
college [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.752
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:05:00.752 --> 00:05:01.070
You're right.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.653
ALAN SEALES: Nine years and six
degrees and still won't leave.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.780
First of all, I love this story.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.990
I was cast early.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.090
Ken Biller, who created
the show-- we got together.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.510
And then I helped him cast
the rest of the parts.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.200
And my TA was to be
named Max Lewicki.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.490
And we took three
guys to network,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.650
two of them who
looked like Lewickis.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.250
And then this good
looking black guy,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.395
and of course, he walked
in, and he was great.

00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:28.020
We said, so he's got the part--
we're going to change the name,

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.520
right?

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.880
And Ken said, no,
no, let's leave it.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.640
Max Lewicki.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.410
ALAN SEALES: That
will throw them off.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.520
ERIC MCCORMACK: Exactly.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.855
So of course, we
waited a long time,

00:05:35.855 --> 00:05:36.950
and we were deep in
the second season

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.680
before we finally explained that
he was adopted by the Lewickis

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.430
or whatever.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.535
And I'm always yelling at him.

00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:44.820
He's quite beleaguered.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.942
But it's fun to shout, Lewicki,
and have that guy walk out.

00:05:47.942 --> 00:05:49.275
ALAN SEALES: Was it Arjay Smith?

00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:49.760
Right?

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.990
ERIC MCCORMACK: Arjay Smith.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.320
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.430
Yeah.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.420
ERIC MCCORMACK: He's just
a little [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.878
ALAN SEALES: From Nickelodeon's
"Journey of Allen Strange"?

00:05:53.878 --> 00:05:55.114
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:05:55.114 --> 00:05:56.530
ALAN SEALES: For
some people here.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.550
ERIC MCCORMACK: Apparently the
young people liked the show.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.905
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:05:58.905 --> 00:05:59.910
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.327
He was actually
like a kid actor--

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.160
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.640
ERIC MCCORMACK: That has
grown into this lovely guy.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.770
ALAN SEALES: Oh, yeah.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.300
I love him on the show.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.480
He's always right there--

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.010
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.170
ALAN SEALES: You know,
giving you the one-two punch.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.910
ERIC MCCORMACK: Exactly right.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.201
ALAN SEALES: But is that weird?

00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:12.100
Like, what in the
show made you decide

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.737
to make him kind of like,
sort of, a nurse to you?

00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:16.070
ERIC MCCORMACK: Well, actually--

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.332
ALAN SEALES: Because he
lives with you, on the show.

00:06:18.332 --> 00:06:20.540
ERIC MCCORMACK: It was
revealed in the second season,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.734
but we explore it
more this season

00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:24.150
that that's literally
what he was.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.930
We met because the
character, five years ago,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.320
had a complete-- he
went out of his mind

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.625
and was hospitalized for six
months and institutionalized.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:35.500
ALAN SEALES: Spoiler.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.665
Spoiler.

00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:36.164
Spoiler.

00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:37.664
ERIC MCCORMACK: Well, yeah.

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:38.830
We've always hinted at that.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.580
We've just never
exported it dramatically.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.720
And this season, we get
some great flashbacks where

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.285
we get to see him
meet Lewicki and while

00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:47.540
ALAN SEALES: In season three?

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.550
ERIC MCCORMACK: He gets
that job in season three.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.715
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:49.215
Yeah.

00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:52.115
ERIC MCCORMACK: So that's great
for Arjay to get to do that.

00:06:52.115 --> 00:06:52.420
ALAN SEALES: Oh, that's cool.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.211
That's really neat.

00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:55.460
So the show, going
into season three now,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.210
is-- I mean, it's popular.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.960
It's been renewed.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.240
TNT's liking it.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.791
What do you think really
is driving the fan base?

00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:04.290
What do you think
people are finding

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.472
so interesting about the show?

00:07:05.472 --> 00:07:07.430
ERIC MCCORMACK: Well,
I've seen with this today

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.830
that when I started,
20 years ago,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.130
and trying to get on
television, you still

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.529
needed a pretty big audience--

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:16.320
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.220
ERIC MCCORMACK: To be a success.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.730
And of course, as you all know,
it's changed entirely now.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.430
And you can be a successful
show with a very small group

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.340
of people if that
group of people

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.550
are rabid and
constantly googling you.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.560
If they do have a
rabid, devoted fanbase,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.040
and the particular
network you're on

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.319
doesn't demand a whole
lot of people-- I mean,

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.860
"Mad Men" had a
million people a year

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.210
for the first four
or five years, right?

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.980
So I think--

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.510
ALAN SEALES: Which is not a lot.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.420
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah,
which is not a lot.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.420
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.920
ERIC MCCORMACK:
This particular show

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.485
we have-- I think we
averaged about 5 million

00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:49.360
the last two seasons.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.780
And they're people that when
I first signed on with TNT,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.010
I said, who's your audience?

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.635
And Michael Wright,
who runs the thing,

00:07:56.635 --> 00:07:58.405
said, it's 50-year-old women.

00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:00.000
And I said, all right.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.230
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.950
ERIC MCCORMACK: There you go.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.694
They loved me.

00:08:01.694 --> 00:08:02.610
50-year-olds loved me.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.820
I mean, I'm the gay best
friend they never had.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.530
So that was kind of our way
in, which which was that.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.707
But also, TNT has a
lot of crime shows.

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:13.540
So there's people that
love to solve crimes.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.600
So you mix those
two things together.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.455
And we definitely
have our fanbase,

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.080
but we're trying to
expand it because I

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.700
love that beyond the
mystery of the week

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.030
is this very complex character.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.220
And we can do that in this clip.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.970
I don't know if you've
ever seen the show,

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.880
but him hallucinating is a
very big part of the show.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.454
He is basically off his meds,
not for any good reason.

00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:40.120
It's the hubris of--
and this is, again,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.260
part of the condition.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.106
People that get on
their meds sometimes

00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:46.480
cycle off because
they don't like

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.700
how they feel when
they're on them.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.720
They don't like
being controlled.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.770
He's definitely
someone that doesn't

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.250
like having his mind controlled.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.940
He's a brain guy.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.210
So he freely
hallucinates sometimes.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.620
And in the most of the
episodes, those hallucinations

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.230
are part of what's guiding
him towards-- they're

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.350
the reason he
hallucinates that woman

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.835
or we have one this season
where I hallucinate the devil.

00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:11.960
I actually have great
conversations with the devil.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.876
But there's a reason for
it that is leading me

00:09:13.876 --> 00:09:14.710
to solving the case.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.167
ALAN SEALES: Well
how much research

00:09:16.167 --> 00:09:17.350
did you do for the role?

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.250
I mean, did you just say,
oh, this person's imaginary,

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.150
so I'll pretend, or
what all did you do?

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.010
ERIC MCCORMACK: No.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.220
I didn't write the show.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.590
Ken and Mike Sussman wrote it.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.550
So a lot of that
was on the page.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.160
My research had to do with
what do symptoms look like,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.300
and what do they
feel like, and how?

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.270
You know, sometimes with
series, you can sort of get it

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.950
right in the pilot,
and then eventually,

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.560
by the second
season, maybe you've

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.700
figured out the character.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.574
I couldn't afford to.

00:09:41.574 --> 00:09:44.160
I thought the mental
health community would just

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.630
shut me down if I
came out half-cocked.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.590
So I did a lot of research
up front with Elyn's book

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.370
and Oliver Sacks'
books and just trying

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.840
to get a sense of--
because I not only had

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.381
to get his mental
health condition

00:09:57.381 --> 00:09:59.880
right-- I had to get him right
as a teacher, as an academic,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.220
as a neuroscientist.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.636
And there's a lot of-- I mean,
that's some of the most fun

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:07.979
stuff to say is ventromedial
prefrontal cortex.

00:10:07.979 --> 00:10:08.770
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.270
ERIC MCCORMACK: It's fun to say.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.042
So that kind of research
was crucial up front, too.

00:10:14.042 --> 00:10:16.000
ALAN SEALES: Well, you
meet any of the patients

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.690
with similar
symptoms or anything?

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.440
ERIC MCCORMACK: Well,
Ellen was a big one.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.490
I sat down to lunch with her.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.402
And I did ask.

00:10:22.402 --> 00:10:24.110
I mean, it was very
laid out in her book.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.720
But to hear her talk about it,
herself, and-- hers was more,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.120
as with a lot of people
with the condition,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.710
is more voices
than it is visual.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.560
But this is television,
so his voices

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.865
tend to have-- it's gonna
be actors we can cast,

00:10:41.865 --> 00:10:42.740
and you can see them.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.970
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.120
ERIC MCCORMACK: But so yeah,
I did a lot of research

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.281
in that department, to make sure
that we weren't doing anything

00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:52.780
hokey.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.280
Of course, it's
television-- there's

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.720
going to be an element of,
are you going to buy this?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.459
But there's nothing we've done--
there's no-- a lot of cases

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.750
that we look into, the reason
my character's brought on

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.284
is because there's
a mental illness,

00:11:06.284 --> 00:11:08.200
you know, so someone
looks like they're crazy.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.090
Well, actually,
they're not crazy.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.225
They have this
condition, which made

00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:12.340
it look like they were
confessing to something

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.490
that they didn't do.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.990
ALAN SEALES: Well,
it's always you--

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.850
it seems like it's you
convincing or changing

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.950
the mind of somebody
who was convinced of--

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.820
based on a preconceived
notion, I guess.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.140
ERIC MCCORMACK: Right.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:23.370
Right.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:23.900
ALAN SEALES: Right

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.399
ERIC MCCORMACK: And
so it's not just

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:27.850
that through the character,
we get to see layers of him.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.070
We get to see, through
his expertise, all

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.170
of these other conditions.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:35.330
And it's becoming, as we know,
a huge part of the legal system

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.580
now, that, you know, it's
not black and white anymore.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.900
You plead insanity or
not plead insanity.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.060
There are so many
conditions that

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.795
are now recognized
medically that

00:11:44.795 --> 00:11:46.670
are going to have--
they're going to come out

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.190
in the courtroom as a defense.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.610
And they're going to be
harder and harder to bat away.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.960
We're going to have to
face the fact that we

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.340
have to deal with
mental illness.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:56.860
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.568
ERIC MCCORMACK: We
can't just lock it up.

00:11:58.568 --> 00:12:01.310
ALAN SEALES: So you won an
award-- the Award of Courage--

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.720
for what they say, your
groundbreaking portrayal of Dr.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.120
Daniel Pierce, right?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.960
So what is that award?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.390
I mean, why do
they give that out?

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.550
ERIC MCCORMACK: It was the
neuroscience department at UCLA

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.380
that gives various
awards every year.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.190
But there's one for media
and accurate representations

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.240
of their work in the media.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.550
And this was more for the
portrayal of mental illness,

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.280
more than it was
the neuroscience,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.782
but because they
like it, I thought,

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:30.740
it kind of covers both.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.760
But the beautiful thing was
it was presented by Elyn Saks.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.580
So the fact that
she got up and said

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:44.010
to the world, what he's doing
is accurate and true to what

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.480
people living with it go
through, it meant a lot.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.250
ALAN SEALES: Hm.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.762
So how do you play
this character?

00:12:48.762 --> 00:12:50.220
I mean, I guess,
how do you prepare

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.960
for this character
differently from other things

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.916
that you've done?

00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:59.400
ERIC MCCORMACK: There's
a frantic state of mind

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.480
that is not hard for me
to be in, unfortunately.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.710
He just, he very
rarely is at peace.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.180
And so mostly,
it's about energy.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.640
It's about coming
in with a lot of it

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.677
and understanding
that that's what

00:13:15.677 --> 00:13:17.010
he's always trying to tamp down.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.420
It's not just the voices, but
the paranoia and the fear.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.510
The fear is very real.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.850
And the one-- I thought this
piece of writing was great,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.390
particularly, once I met
Ellen, was in the classroom,

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.450
he's a rock star.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.790
In the classroom,
he's got his students.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.590
They love him.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.442
It takes me back.

00:13:35.442 --> 00:13:36.150
I don't know if--

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.630
ALAN SEALES: Throwing
themselves at him?

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.010
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.260
I'm probably the oldest
person in the room,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.843
but there was a show called "The
Paper Chase" in the late '70s

00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:44.670
that John Houseman played
this legal professor.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.530
And I remember the
classroom scenes.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.030
He was very, very vat.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.130
He was very-- but you
were riveted to him

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.721
because you watched
students riveted to him.

00:13:53.721 --> 00:13:55.470
And it's kind of the
same thing here, too.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.390
He's fun and he's funny.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.010
And he loves the jargon.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.290
He loves teaching.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.320
He gets outside the classroom,
and in a group of people

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.810
he can be a complete
basket case.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.761
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:07.260
Right.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.937
So you also direct and
produce this, correct?

00:14:11.937 --> 00:14:13.520
ERIC MCCORMACK: I
am a producer on it.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.675
And I just directed an episode
this year, which was great.

00:14:16.675 --> 00:14:19.050
ALAN SEALES: The second episode
of season three, I think?

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:19.350
ERIC MCCORMACK:
Second is the one

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.660
that follows this Paris episode.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.160
Yeah.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.800
We're in Paris because at
the end of last season,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.940
I quit my job, as you can see,
and followed this woman that I

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.547
love, and--

00:14:29.547 --> 00:14:30.630
ALAN SEALES: Who is real--

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.585
ERIC MCCORMACK: Who is real.

00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:32.440
ALAN SEALES: Which confused me--

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:32.650
ERIC MCCORMACK: The blond girl.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:32.760
Yes.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.259
ALAN SEALES: Confused
me for awhile.

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:38.570
ERIC MCCORMACK: Well, she's
the girl-- the blond girl--

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.320
that was in the apartment
with me, saying,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.778
you know, you've
got to be careful,

00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:44.140
you're not on your
meds-- she's not real.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.170
I've hallucinated
her for 25 years.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.090
She is a girl that
I, as we learned

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.924
at the end of the first season--
because the whole first season,

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:52.340
the audience knew
she wasn't real,

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.650
but it's like why is she--
am I hallucinating someone

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.950
from my past, am I
hallucinating an ex-lover?

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.470
It turns out that she was a
girl I saw across a crowded room

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.730
and never met.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.250
But from that day-- that was
pretty much the day I had

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.390
my first break with reality
and I started, in my mind,

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.950
dating her and calling her and--

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:11.590
ALAN SEALES: You were
in love with the idea.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:12.940
ERIC MCCORMACK: I was
in love with this woman

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.065
who became very, very real.

00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:15.564
And at the end of
the first season--

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:17.290
it was a really cool
episode-- we met.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.390
Kelly Rowan played
both parts-- the woman

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.180
I had been hallucinating
for 25 years,

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.200
and the real woman, who I
never saw since that party,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.830
is my doctor, after I
lose my shit, one day.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.320
I'm taken to the hospital,
and there's Natalie.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.760
And I'm like, they're
giving me medication--

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.010
why am I still seeing you?

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.570
And she's like, we've
never met, Dr. Pierce,

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.740
my name is Caroline.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.534
And it was great just to
realize that sometimes,

00:15:42.534 --> 00:15:44.200
like I say, when you
see someone talking

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.699
to themselves in the street,
they're talking to someone very

00:15:46.699 --> 00:15:48.660
real-- maybe their own
father, maybe somebody

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.650
that is, as far as they're
concerned, very, very there.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.630
And I think that also helps
to remind an audience that--

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.482
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:15:56.482 --> 00:15:58.440
ERIC MCCORMACK: For what
they're going through,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.482
it's absolutely here now.

00:15:59.482 --> 00:16:00.856
ALAN SEALES: Well,
let's get back

00:16:00.856 --> 00:16:02.080
to the producing part of it.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.490
ERIC MCCORMACK: Oh,
the producing part.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.520
ALAN SEALES: That was
the original question.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.353
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:10.130
So when I came out with
Ken, I just said, look,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.430
you don't need my help
producing the show,

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:18.060
but I think I need to be a
guardian of this character

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.590
in a way that-- because
he's writing the show.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.130
Ken is up there
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.670
So as we're working with
different directors,

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.380
it's crucial that
somebody on set

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.640
be guarding the heart
of the show, and--

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.839
ALAN SEALES: So what does
a producer do, exactly?

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:36.130
ERIC MCCORMACK: A producer
can do any number of things.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.510
I mean, you can give money--
you can give a million bucks

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.620
and never do anything else.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.000
ALAN SEALES: Is that
the executive producer?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.870
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah,
well, exactly right.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.670
I just did a movie before
Christmas-- an independent film

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.500
with Parker Posey.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.140
And one of the producers
is Lars Ulrich,

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.260
the drummer from Metallica.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.607
He showed up one day to say, hi.

00:16:53.607 --> 00:16:54.940
I think he just gave some money.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.440
You know?

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.780
I mean, that's-- but
he's still a producer.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.690
You can be the person
that owns the property.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.380
You can buy a book
and say, I'm going

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.160
to make this into a movie.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.493
You never have to do anything
else except own that book,

00:17:04.493 --> 00:17:06.790
and you're still a producer,
whereas, the guys that

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:11.055
make our show happen day
after day after day after day

00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:12.430
are a different
kind of producer.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.534
I mean, they are hands on,
making the show happen.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.700
Ken, who created the show,
is the executive producer

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.096
because the words
come out of his head.

00:17:19.096 --> 00:17:22.200
And in my case, like
I said, I produce it

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.890
by helping to cast it and
by, when the show is shot,

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.810
helping to edit it and have
a say in how it comes out.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.872
ALAN SEALES: Hm.

00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:32.670
That's really neat.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.620
OK.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.197
So the show is set in Chicago.

00:17:38.197 --> 00:17:39.030
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.130
ALAN SEALES: You film in LA.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.963
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:17:40.963 --> 00:17:43.250
ALAN SEALES: Are there
any challenges with that?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.240
ERIC MCCORMACK:
Well, there's a few.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.690
There are no palm
trees in Chicago.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.310
So there's just
certain places we just

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.570
can't point the camera anywhere.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.736
We're like, oh, Christ,
what are we going to do now?

00:17:52.736 --> 00:17:54.040
But there's that.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.000
Plus, I decided-- we shot
the pilot in Toronto, which

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.765
is where I'm from,
which was great.

00:17:58.765 --> 00:18:01.390
All of those university shots
are the University of Toronto.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.880
ALAN SEALES: Oh, really?

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.381
OK.

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.588
ERIC MCCORMACK: And so we
had to recreate that in LA.

00:18:04.588 --> 00:18:06.420
There's no buildings
in Los Angeles that

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.820
look like that except for
one church in Pasadena.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.617
So that's where we shoot, now,
all of our university stuff.

00:18:11.617 --> 00:18:13.700
ALAN SEALES: In the
internal-- the internal shots?

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:13.830
ERIC MCCORMACK: No.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.050
The internal's all a set.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.980
But these external,
when I'm outside

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.550
on benches and
beautiful trees, that's

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.420
all this little church
courtyard, which is--

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.336
ALAN SEALES: Oh, cool.

00:18:22.336 --> 00:18:23.590
ERIC MCCORMACK: Hysterical.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:28.184
That, and I also decided that,
based on my research, someone

00:18:28.184 --> 00:18:29.600
with his condition--
particularly,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.190
someone not on their
meds-- they need routine.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.380
They need the comfort
of things not changing,

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.630
which is why-- I don't know
if you saw in that scene--

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.921
what I'm listening to on my
headphones, it's a Walkman.

00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:42.610
It's a Sony Walkman that
he's had for 25 years.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.950
The sneakers, he's
probably never changed.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.580
And that coat and scarf were
in the pilot, and I said,

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.430
I think he always wears this.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.570
This is his armor
against the world.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:59.305
And in Los Angeles, in June,
sometimes I hate myself.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.680
ALAN SEALES: So-- well, you're
saying that the character,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.780
I guess, the people with
schizophrenia like to have

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.302
stability and things
not changing--

00:19:06.302 --> 00:19:07.760
ERIC MCCORMACK:
Yeah, they need it.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.093
ALAN SEALES: Is there a link
to OCD, as well, with that,

00:19:10.093 --> 00:19:14.050
or is this
holistically different?

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.940
ERIC MCCORMACK: With OCD, it's--
and I'm not going to become

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.102
a scientist here because I just
play one on TV-- but I mean,

00:19:20.102 --> 00:19:21.810
yeah, I'm sure there's
definitely a link.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:27.495
And in this case, though,
it's more about just not

00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:31.940
letting fear rule you
and having control.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.365
Paranoid schizophrenics
generally feel out of control.

00:19:34.365 --> 00:19:34.690
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.240
ERIC MCCORMACK: They cannot
control what's around them.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.030
ALAN SEALES: Because
they legitimately

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.760
don't know what's
real and what's not?

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.259
Or--

00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:42.900
ERIC MCCORMACK: Well, I mean,
it does vary in degrees,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.330
like, for instance, most
paranoid schizophrenics--

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.890
and I shouldn't use that
term-- people living

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.610
with paranoid schizophrenia
don't necessarily

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.040
hallucinate visually.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.620
More common is voices-- sounds,
even-- that kind of thing.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.640
So it does vary.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.570
But what was the
previous thing you said?

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:04.970
Something about--

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.950
ALAN SEALES: The challenges
of filming in LA?

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:07.660
ERIC MCCORMACK: Oh, no, no.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:07.800
ALAN SEALES: Oh, no, no.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.449
The OCD.

00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:09.490
ERIC MCCORMACK: The OCD--

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:09.760
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.176
ERIC MCCORMACK:
Whereas, you know,

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:12.530
I think OCD is also a need.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.340
It's a need for
control, too-- a need

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.720
to control your environment
as best you can.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.686
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:20:17.686 --> 00:20:21.560
So the creator of
the show-- what

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.950
was his idea behind even
bringing it into conception?

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.670
I mean, does he have
somebody that he

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.120
knows that's living
with similar symptoms?

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.730
ERIC MCCORMACK: I think there
was someone close in his life

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.105
that-- I'd probably have to
let him answer that question.

00:20:33.105 --> 00:20:36.700
But Mike Sussman,
the other co-creator,

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.814
had actually come
to Ken and said,

00:20:38.814 --> 00:20:40.230
I don't know what
to do with this,

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.312
but I think at the
center of a show,

00:20:42.312 --> 00:20:43.770
someone with paranoid
schizophrenia

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:44.630
could be really interesting.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.129
And Ken was already
working with TNT

00:20:46.129 --> 00:20:49.960
on trying to come up with
another mystery solving show.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.420
And then he came
up with the idea

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.260
of setting it in-- making
him a neuroscientist.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.760
I mean, that's the
part that I love,

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.790
is that someone who knows more
about the brain than anybody

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.489
in the room, his own
brain is his worst enemy.

00:21:01.489 --> 00:21:02.280
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.905
I always feel like
there's a little bit

00:21:03.905 --> 00:21:05.960
of ice outside of the classroom.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.140
The character is always
slightly just holding back,

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.800
being incredibly
mean to somebody

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.730
because they feel
they're intellectually--

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:12.940
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.315
ALAN SEALES: Your
character feels

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.190
that the person is
intellectually inferior?

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.898
So you're like, why
are you bothering me,

00:21:17.898 --> 00:21:20.250
why don't you get this?

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.470
ERIC MCCORMACK: I
mean, it's nice.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.815
I was quite likable
on "Will and Grace,"

00:21:24.815 --> 00:21:27.640
and it's fun to
sometimes not be likable.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.830
I mean, Dr. Pierce is a dick
sometimes, which is really fun.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.610
And it is hubris.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.819
It is intellectual hubris.

00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:34.610
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.651
ERIC MCCORMACK: You know?

00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:38.710
And to see someone
behave that way

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.090
and lord his intelligence
over the room,

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.650
and then suddenly be terrified
because he saw someone there

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.030
who was not there is to remind
everyone of his humility,

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.580
as well.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.090
ALAN SEALES: Well, OK.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.710
So "Will and Grace" was the
first time on prime time TV

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.970
that two openly gay characters
were leads in a sitcom.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.580
So that was
groundbreaking, brought

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.030
all of this educational--

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.400
ERIC MCCORMACK: If you don't
include "The Odd Couple."

00:21:59.400 --> 00:21:59.610
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.305
Yes.

00:22:00.305 --> 00:22:01.220
Well, were they?

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.160
Yes, they specifically said.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.980
So that brought a
lot of awareness

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.670
and a lot of, I guess,
education to the gay community,

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.180
or focus on it,
which made people

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.150
more comfortable and whatnot.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.210
So do you think that playing
Dr. David Pierce on "Perception"

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.780
is going to do the same
thing for mental illness

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.225
or bring that to light?

00:22:23.225 --> 00:22:25.850
ERIC MCCORMACK: I mean, it would
be great if that was the case.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:30.770
I mean, certainly with "Will
and Grace," we never-- I mean,

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.930
it was a sitcom, and it was
an outrageous one, at times.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.970
So we didn't pat ourselves
on the back ever,

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.090
with hey, look what we're doing.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.910
Time took that and last
year, the Vice President

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.605
said, on "Meet the Press,"
that-- out of the blue,

00:22:44.605 --> 00:22:46.480
because they were talking
about gay marriage,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.350
and he said he thought that
"Will and Grace" had done more

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.870
to educate the American
public on them.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.850
And that took time.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.120
The show, we started in '98.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.470
So hopefully, with
a show like this,

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.780
there will be other shows, and
mental illness-- we'd have to.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.500
I mean, the last few weeks of
school shootings and everything

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.740
else, I mean, every time,
as soon as it happens,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.705
it's not the gun's fault--
it's mental illness.

00:23:13.705 --> 00:23:15.830
It's like, OK, guys, well,
if that's the case, then

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.830
what are we going to do?

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.480
How are we going to
increase the funding

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.680
and increase the awareness and
help these people before they

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.740
get lost in the system?

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.280
You know?

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.980
So this show is not going
to cure that overnight.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.080
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.990
ERIC MCCORMACK:
But hopefully it's

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.573
putting that idea
into people's minds,

00:23:31.573 --> 00:23:35.430
that not everyone with
the condition is dangerous

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.810
and that the more
educators that we have

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.167
and the more education
that we have, the better.

00:23:42.167 --> 00:23:44.750
ALAN SEALES: You know, it seems
to me that it's easy-- I mean,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.350
just like anything
else in the world--

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.310
I'm going to get on my political
high horse for a second--

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.540
that it's very easy to just
ignore things and pretend

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.956
they're OK, and let somebody
else deal with your problems.

00:23:52.956 --> 00:23:55.660
And then as soon as there's like
a school shooting or something

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.170
statistically relevant that
says we need to pay attention,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.760
those people are
like, I don't know

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.600
what they're talking about.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.250
Right?

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.150
So your character in
"Perception"-- I think it

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.070
speaks to that a lot.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.372
And you know, it might not, by
itself, make a big difference,

00:24:10.372 --> 00:24:12.580
but it could-- it's like
the very tip of the iceberg.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.602
ERIC MCCORMACK: What I
do like is that every,

00:24:14.602 --> 00:24:17.060
I would say out of-- say we're
doing 15 episodes this year.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.930
Probably out of
10 of those, there

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.540
is someone who is either
wrongly accused because

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.360
of a mental illness
or the mental illness

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.600
is not something
easily diagnosed.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.070
It's something that
takes his expertise,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.110
over the course of the
episode, to go, it's this.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.005
So in the end of an
episode, an audience

00:24:37.005 --> 00:24:40.035
has learned that much
more about a condition

00:24:40.035 --> 00:24:41.910
they would never otherwise
have heard about--

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:42.650
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.900
ERIC MCCORMACK: Much as
people do with physical things

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.210
on "ER" or "Grey's Anatomy."

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.020
You walk away going, oh,
I've never heard of that.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.395
But with this, it's like,
well, guess what-- there really

00:24:50.395 --> 00:24:55.950
is something called Aphasia,
where people can't recognize

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.110
a face, or whatever it is.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.260
Interesting.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.292
And it also helps people to feel
less alone because everybody's

00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:01.875
got something.

00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:02.300
I mean, like--

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.010
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.510
ERIC MCCORMACK: A
quarter of the country's

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.300
technically depressed.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:05.580
You know?

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.329
I mean, it's like
everyone's got something

00:25:07.329 --> 00:25:08.530
that actually qualifies as--

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:09.930
ALAN SEALES: Or falls on the
Asperger's syndrome somewhere.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:10.114
ERIC MCCORMACK: Mental illness.

00:25:10.114 --> 00:25:10.614
Yeah.

00:25:10.614 --> 00:25:11.880
Yeah, or in the spectrum.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.155
Yes.

00:25:12.155 --> 00:25:12.430
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.275
ERIC MCCORMACK: It's
becoming more and more

00:25:13.275 --> 00:25:15.816
a part of the conversation in
ways it never was 25 years ago.

00:25:15.816 --> 00:25:20.197
ALAN SEALES: So everything on
the show-- is it actually real?

00:25:20.197 --> 00:25:21.780
All of these diagnoses
and everything?

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.049
So do you have a
consultant that's

00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:26.090
with you in the writer's
room or on set with you?

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.530
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes, we do
have David Eagleman, who

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.460
wrote an incredible
book called "Incognito--

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.200
The Secret Lives of the
Brain," or "The Secret Life

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.430
of the Brain."

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:40.640
He is kind of what
Pierce would be, I guess,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.810
if Pierce didn't have this
condition because Eagleman's

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.980
in his '40s, and
he's kind of hip

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.900
neuroscience
professor and author.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.420
And his books are about the
aspects of the brain that we

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.091
don't think of, just
cool stuff like--

00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:57.840
I remember the first
time, when I read it,

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.610
the first fact that
jumped out at me,

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:06.110
that the brain cannot
process what's coming at you,

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:10.550
for instance, as fast as a
fast ball comes at a pitcher.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.305
So the idea--

00:26:11.305 --> 00:26:12.055
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:14.940
ERIC MCCORMACK: That a
pitcher chooses to swing,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.790
or chooses not to
swing, at a fast ball--

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.790
ALAN SEALES: The batter.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.930
ERIC MCCORMACK: --at the
batter, is a fallacy.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.780
There wouldn't be
enough time to choose.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.730
It's instinct.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.800
It's physical
instinct that makes

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.580
him go because the
brain is slower than--

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.145
ALAN SEALES: That's
why they get hit

00:26:29.145 --> 00:26:30.590
in the head when
it's a stray pitch.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.680
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:30.885
That kind of thing.

00:26:30.885 --> 00:26:32.220
ALAN SEALES: Because they don't
have enough time to react.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:32.530
ERIC MCCORMACK: Basically that.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.210
So to have a guy
like that, we know

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.620
the writers do their research.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.330
They come up with stuff.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:36.950
They write it.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.854
They write the lingo, the
lectures, the diagnoses.

00:26:39.854 --> 00:26:41.520
And then he will go
through every script

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.345
and say, nah, that's
not how he'd say it.

00:26:45.345 --> 00:26:47.220
ALAN SEALES: Well,
how does that work?

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.136
Did you go through and
you're like, all right,

00:26:49.136 --> 00:26:50.407
let's do this disorder.

00:26:50.407 --> 00:26:51.740
All right, let's write about it.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.740
ERIC MCCORMACK: Kind of.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.200
I mean, once you
realize, hey, they

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:59.247
picked us up for another season,
we need 15 disorders to film,

00:26:59.247 --> 00:27:00.955
you know, they start
trying to find some.

00:27:00.955 --> 00:27:05.000
And we just did one where
our most junior writer

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.630
was like, you finally
got a script, go.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:11.000
And she found something called
mirror-touch synesthesia which

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.770
is rare but exists
as a condition

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:20.285
where if you're feeling angry,
it's like the ultimate empath,

00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:22.880
like what's her name
from "Star Trek."

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.160
It's total empathy.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.920
So I would feel your anger.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.595
And if you were feeling
nauseous, I might throw up.

00:27:28.595 --> 00:27:31.990
And we did a whole episode
not on that condition,

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.650
but her condition leads us--
she's witness to a crime.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.804
Someone is stabbed in the
neck, and she goes down

00:27:37.804 --> 00:27:39.470
because she feels the
pain of the knife.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.380
ALAN SEALES: Oh,
that's so weird.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.504
I mean, I want to [INAUDIBLE]
on this for a second.

00:27:42.504 --> 00:27:45.092
But does she sense it?

00:27:45.092 --> 00:27:46.300
Does the person-- what is it?

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.340
ERIC MCCORMACK: She feels it.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.100
ALAN SEALES: Like,
the person senses--

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:48.630
ERIC MCCORMACK: She feels it.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.840
ALAN SEALES: So if you
just come in to me,

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.350
and you're acting all
happy and everything, like,

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.590
your pheromones--
you're letting off

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.260
that you're the angriest
person right now.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.093
But you're happy right
now, and I would just

00:27:56.093 --> 00:27:58.279
get really angry because of it?

00:27:58.279 --> 00:27:59.820
ERIC MCCORMACK: You
would take it on.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.660
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.790
ERIC MCCORMACK: You
would take it on.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.485
ALAN SEALES: There's so much
of the brain that baffles me,

00:28:04.485 --> 00:28:06.865
like by paying attention
to the five senses

00:28:06.865 --> 00:28:08.490
that we're just not
paying attention to

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.350
and we're not listening to.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.545
ERIC MCCORMACK: Exactly.

00:28:09.545 --> 00:28:09.610
Yeah.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.400
ALAN SEALES: That's really cool.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.842
I just totally got myself
sidetracked on that.

00:28:12.842 --> 00:28:14.060
Sorry.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.900
Let's see.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.400
Yeah, OK.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.290
I talked about that.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.555
All right, so speaking of "Star
Trek," LeVar Burton, right?

00:28:19.555 --> 00:28:20.763
ERIC MCCORMACK: LeVar Burton.

00:28:20.763 --> 00:28:22.152
ALAN SEALES: OK.

00:28:22.152 --> 00:28:24.360
Every time I look at him--
this is another side note,

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.443
but I always think it's
weird that he doesn't have

00:28:26.443 --> 00:28:28.460
the visor on, every time
I see him without it.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.482
And I grew up watching
"Reading Rainbow," right?

00:28:30.482 --> 00:28:32.690
ERIC MCCORMACK: Did you hear
about the whole "Reading

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:33.680
Rainbow" thing
that just happened?

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.648
ALAN SEALES: I invested in it.

00:28:34.648 --> 00:28:34.900
ERIC MCCORMACK: Oh, you did?

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.150
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:36.160
The kickstarter, yeah.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.863
ERIC MCCORMACK:
That's quite amazing.

00:28:36.863 --> 00:28:37.148
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:37.246
Yeah.

00:28:37.246 --> 00:28:38.170
I thought it was great.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.836
ERIC MCCORMACK: His
last day of shooting

00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:41.770
for this season
was that first day.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:42.680
ALAN SEALES: Oh,
really? [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.430
ERIC MCCORMACK: He
told me the day before.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.260
We're hoping to raise
$1 million in 30 days.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.120
And by 6 o'clock on the first
day, while we were shooting,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.000
they had $1 million.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.887
It was amazing.

00:28:54.887 --> 00:28:57.345
I don't know what they have
now-- five or six, or something

00:28:57.345 --> 00:28:57.845
crazy.

00:28:57.845 --> 00:29:01.047
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, I invested
in it a couple of days ago.

00:29:01.047 --> 00:29:01.880
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.104
So he owns the visor.

00:29:03.104 --> 00:29:04.270
ALAN SEALES: Does he really?

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:04.890
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:05.680
Well I love LeVar.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.020
LeVar directed two
episodes this year.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.440
ALAN SEALES: Have
you worn the visor?

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.930
ERIC MCCORMACK: We have so
much-- that, I have not--

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:09.620
ALAN SEALES: Have you worn it?

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.661
ERIC MCCORMACK: I think
he might let me if I ask.

00:29:11.661 --> 00:29:20.030
But-- but-- no one owns
his career like LeVar does.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.586
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:29:21.586 --> 00:29:22.960
ERIC MCCORMACK:
The other day, he

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.215
tweeted-- because I know
him from "Roots" in like '77

00:29:26.215 --> 00:29:27.340
when he played Kunta Kinte.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.420
And he literally tweeted
the other day, hey Denver,

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.340
Kunta's in town.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.050
Like, I can't even imagine
saying, hey, boys, Will's here.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.650
But I think he's
got a tattoo that

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.960
says-- if you read it
this way, it says "LeVar,"

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.920
but if you look at it
this way, it says "Kunta."

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.710
Amazing.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.250
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.000
I'm cool with that.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.580
ERIC MCCORMACK:
He's an awesome guy.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.079
ALAN SEALES: So what made you
reach out to him for the role?

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:54.130
Like, why does he make sense?

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.390
ERIC MCCORMACK: Ken Biller,
who created the show,

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.137
ran "Star Trek"
for several years.

00:29:58.137 --> 00:29:59.470
ALAN SEALES: Well, there you go.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:00.590
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah, he was
the show runner on that show

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.929
for like four years, I think.

00:30:02.929 --> 00:30:04.720
So he was already pretty
adept at coming up

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.011
with some crazy shit, you know?

00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:07.100
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.550
ERIC MCCORMACK: When you're
in season six of "Star Trek,"

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:14.340
and you're just making up
planets and races and language,

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.907
it's a pretty good
background for--

00:30:15.907 --> 00:30:17.240
ALAN SEALES: That's pretty cool.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.698
So for season four
of "Perception,"

00:30:18.698 --> 00:30:21.370
you have to, like, have some
character that thinks he's--

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:21.730
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:21.830
Exactly right.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.455
ALAN SEALES: Knock
on wood-- who thinks

00:30:23.455 --> 00:30:25.267
he's in a "Star Trek" episode.

00:30:25.267 --> 00:30:26.100
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.130
ALAN SEALES: That's my
writer's contribution--

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:27.450
ERIC MCCORMACK:
That's a good one.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:27.870
ALAN SEALES: For you.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:28.050
ERIC MCCORMACK: That's good.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:28.270
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.050
ERIC MCCORMACK: Wait,
actually, I've got to say,

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:30.660
we pretty much had that.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.810
And I'll tell you why.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:36.740
Beginning of last season, we set
an entire episode at Comic Con.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.560
So there was a crime
involved there.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.450
And I had to go.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.380
And I had to be at
Comic Con, surrounded

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.310
by Darth Vaders
and Princess Leias.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.400
And I hallucinate one of
the-- like a Comic Con

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.180
fan in some sort of space gear.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.870
And he was supposed to be
dressed as either something

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.820
"Star Trek" or-- no,
we had "Star Wars."

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.832
He was supposed to be dressed
as someone "Star Trek,"

00:30:56.832 --> 00:30:58.290
and then we couldn't
get the rights

00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.750
at the last minute or something.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.560
But I was supposed to he
hallucinating Leonard Nimoy.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.560
And we almost had
him playing himself.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.510
And then he backed out
at the last minute.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.110
ALAN SEALES: Oh, no.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.070
ERIC MCCORMACK: So instead
I hallucinated this man.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.010
ALAN SEALES: This person
cosplaying Leonard Nimoy?

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.551
ERIC MCCORMACK: What
I want to pitch,

00:31:11.551 --> 00:31:13.490
next season-- I want
to hallucinate someone

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.830
that thinks I'm a hallucination.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.984
So just whenever I
see him, I walk up,

00:31:18.984 --> 00:31:20.900
and he's like, leave me
alone, leave me alone!

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.810
And he's running from me.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:22.290
And I'm like, wait!

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:22.720
ALAN SEALES: No, I'm real!

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.220
I'm real!

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.380
ERIC MCCORMACK: I'm real!

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.590
I think that would be--

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.310
ALAN SEALES: What
if your character

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.510
is hallucinating a guy
who thinks you're fake.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.150
ERIC MCCORMACK: That's
what I'm saying.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:29.755
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:30.020
Yeah.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.966
I'm hallucinating a guy--

00:31:30.966 --> 00:31:31.490
ALAN SEALES: So every time you
walk up to your hallucination--

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.327
ERIC MCCORMACK: That
believes he's the real thing.

00:31:34.327 --> 00:31:35.660
ALAN SEALES: I would watch that.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.130
ERIC MCCORMACK: You see?

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.140
ALAN SEALES: In fact,
I am watching it.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.250
So the rest of the cast--

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.083
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:31:41.083 --> 00:31:43.170
ALAN SEALES: Is actually
very, very good.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.159
So you've got, who?

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:44.950
Rachael Leigh Cook.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.283
ERIC MCCORMACK: Rachael Leigh
Cook who was in "She's All

00:31:47.283 --> 00:31:51.595
That" that I don't know
if anybody [INAUDIBLE]--

00:31:51.595 --> 00:31:52.970
I guess I was
probably in my 30s,

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.050
by the time that movie was made.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.949
So I didn't-- it wasn't
a big one for me.

00:31:55.949 --> 00:31:58.240
But there are some, like,
younger women on our set that

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.110
work in different departments
for whom "She's All That"

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.140
was like this touchstone
movie of coming of age.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.590
So they love-- and
Rachel's awesome.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.740
ALAN SEALES: So the role has
obviously, probably got-- what?

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.990
The most screen time, second
to your character, right?

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.340
ERIC MCCORMACK: Mhm.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.350
ALAN SEALES: So it was obviously
an important role to cast.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.183
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes.

00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:16.741
ALAN SEALES: Like, why her?

00:32:16.741 --> 00:32:18.240
ERIC MCCORMACK:
She's the FBI agent.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.720
She's the one who has
these cases that there

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.480
is an element they
can't solve, and if it

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.490
seems to have a scientific
or a neuroscientific element,

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.425
she'll come to me,
which happens--

00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:28.550
ALAN SEALES: Every episode.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.211
ERIC MCCORMACK: Every week.

00:32:30.211 --> 00:32:32.210
ALAN SEALES: It seems
like the only people she--

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.668
ERIC MCCORMACK:
It's exactly right.

00:32:33.668 --> 00:32:34.870
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.160
ERIC MCCORMACK: And we
were seeing a lot of,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.111
like, tall,
beautiful, tough, you

00:32:40.111 --> 00:32:41.860
know, sort of almost
typical kind of women

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.120
they'd see on these
kind of shows.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.090
ALAN SEALES: Like
Jennifer Garner.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.300
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.010
And, like, really capable.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:52.450
And then in came Rachel, who's
quite petite and gorgeous.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:56.580
But you don't immediately
go, FBI agent.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.390
But it made me think of
"The Silence of the Lambs,"

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:01.817
when Judy-- Jodie-- Judy F--

00:33:01.817 --> 00:33:02.900
ALAN SEALES: Jodie Foster.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.108
ERIC MCCORMACK: Jodie Foster.

00:33:04.108 --> 00:33:04.710
Judy?

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.300
When Jodie Foster
was standing there--

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.633
I think was up there at the
morgue or the funeral home--

00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:11.220
and there's like five or six
state troopers standing around

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:11.350
her.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:12.683
And they're all, like, big guys.

00:33:12.683 --> 00:33:13.620
And she's this big.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.690
And they're all staring at her
like, what are-- who are you?

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:17.840
What are you going to do?

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.760
And I remember just
thinking how it illustrated

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.160
how much of a mountain
she had to climb.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.700
And that's kind
of what we wanted.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.570
We wanted someone who was
constantly trying to prove

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.800
herself in a man's world and
in this very sort of misogynist

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.500
FBI, and that bringing me in
helped-- that I wasn't, I mean,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.063
my characters hardly
macho, so it's--

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.290
She came in with a kind
of a sense of humor.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.750
She's has a very
ironic delivery.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.290
She's a very funny, funny girl.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.895
And her audition just
was-- it just sort of

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:52.270
set the room on
fire, originally.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.310
ALAN SEALES: So in your head,
when you saw the character

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.893
on paper first, did you have a
different idea of what it would

00:33:56.893 --> 00:33:59.227
be before she started putting
it out there in the real--

00:33:59.227 --> 00:34:00.768
ERIC MCCORMACK:
Well, the other thing

00:34:00.768 --> 00:34:03.205
was that she's supposed to
have been a student of mine.

00:34:03.205 --> 00:34:04.830
And there's a little
bit of that-- what

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.980
I call the don't stand so close
to me relationship which-- God,

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.520
my references are ancient today.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.396
What the fuck.

00:34:13.396 --> 00:34:14.270
I don't what that is.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:17.460
Let me tell you an
Al Jolson story.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.909
But so we needed somebody
of a certain age.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:21.790
She needed to be kind
of her early 30s,

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.500
for me to have taught her.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.340
And she appeared to still be
quite young which was great,

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.840
too.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.310
So that sort of romantic,
unrealized thing

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.520
has been a thread
throughout the show, too.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.449
So we need to find
someone not only who

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:40.389
would be an unlikely
but fascinating FBI

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:43.420
agent-- we needed someone
that you kind of root for.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:47.909
I learned early on-- you
know this term "shipping"?

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.190
So you know.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.550
You're on the internet.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:51.520
But I didn't know it.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.610
So for those that
don't know, it's

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.580
mostly young women that
watch shows like "Bones"

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.804
or "The Mentalist" and root
for these lead characters

00:34:59.804 --> 00:35:00.470
to get together.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.970
And they root for
the relationship.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.055
So they start
shipping these shows

00:35:05.055 --> 00:35:06.430
and tweeting them
all of the time

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.930
and creating blogs about them
and fan fiction and everything.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:13.310
So I thought, I want this
to happen right away.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:14.800
I am not wasting any time here.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.790
So as the show started-- the
show premiered two years ago,

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.410
and I was actually here in New
York doing a show on Broadway.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.104
And I got Twitter at that
point, for the first time.

00:35:23.104 --> 00:35:25.520
And I just started tweeting
constantly, start shipping us,

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.140
everybody, don't you want
to us to sleep together?

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.150
I know you haven't
seen the show yet,

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.740
but you're going to really
want us to sleep together

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.910
eventually, so tweet.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.530
And so it kind of started.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:36.210
And now that she's in the shower
with Donnie, with Scott Wolf

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.270
there, as we saw,
there's a lot of--

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.636
ALAN SEALES: "Party of Five."

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:39.969
ERIC MCCORMACK: "Party of Five."

00:35:39.969 --> 00:35:42.870
He's another awesome guy.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.510
There's a lot of shippers
going, why is she with Donnie?

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.650
I don't like her with him.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:48.170
ALAN SEALES: Hold it.

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.590
What is it from "Twilight"?

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.840
The club-- whatever in
the club underground.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.190
ERIC MCCORMACK: Exactly right.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:54.148
ALAN SEALES: Club Long
Hair and Club Shirtless,

00:35:54.148 --> 00:35:56.492
or-- I don't know who they are.

00:35:56.492 --> 00:35:57.450
I don't watch the show.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.160
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.493
ALAN SEALES: So if you guys
have any questions for Eric,

00:36:00.493 --> 00:36:01.970
please use the mics over here.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:03.610
Because we've got
a few minutes left,

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.310
I want to hit on the Broadway
that you just mentioned.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.096
So your past life, you've
been a Broadway star.

00:36:10.096 --> 00:36:11.470
ERIC MCCORMACK:
Well, the theater

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.570
was definitely my start.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.870
I didn't even audition
for television

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:14.786
until I was almost 30.

00:36:14.786 --> 00:36:17.130
It was my 20s were spent
in Canada at the Stratford

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:20.280
festival, doing Shakespeare,
and regional theaters

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.700
across that country.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:26.200
And I did "The Music
Man" here, years ago.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.360
And then this last one I
did was just incredible.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.090
It was a revival of Gore Vidal's
"The Best Man" with James Earl

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.430
Jones and Angela Lansbury and
John Larroquette and Candice

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.700
Bergen and Michael McKean-- this
incredibly big and wonderful

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.690
cast.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.275
And I got to play a real
asshole which was just awesome.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.220
It's a political piece.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.440
It's two guys running
for the same party,

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.220
though one seems
very, very liberal--

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.092
it was the John
Larroquette character--

00:36:54.092 --> 00:36:56.300
and I got to be kind of the
Republican asshole, which

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.037
was so great.

00:36:57.037 --> 00:36:58.870
ALAN SEALES: Do you
like playing the asshole

00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:59.804
versus the nice guy?

00:36:59.804 --> 00:37:01.220
ERIC MCCORMACK:
I've actually been

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.600
a villain in a lot of things.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.870
My first big television role was
on a western-- "Lonesome Dove,"

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.245
the spin-off from
the miniseries.

00:37:07.245 --> 00:37:12.070
And I got to play the
sort of badass Civil War

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:12.940
Confederate colonel.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.385
ALAN SEALES: That's fun.

00:37:13.385 --> 00:37:13.988
Yeah?

00:37:13.988 --> 00:37:14.571
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:37:14.571 --> 00:37:15.679
Well, thanks for coming.

00:37:15.679 --> 00:37:17.720
I used to watch "Will and
Grace" all of the time.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.200
And I remember one
episode that you guys had,

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.222
where you filmed it live.

00:37:22.222 --> 00:37:24.680
And you guys were hysterical
laughing the whole time, which

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.679
was very funny because--

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:27.600
ERIC MCCORMACK: I was not.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.530
Messing was dying
to be Carol Burnett.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.470
So she was determined
to fall apart.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.970
Yes.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.260
AUDIENCE: But I
assume that, always,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.830
filming "Will and
Grace" must been

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.610
the funniest thing every day.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.030
So I was just curious how
your experience filming

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.080
a more serious show
was, compared to some--

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.330
ERIC MCCORMACK: It's definitely
two different muscles.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:45.260
I started in drama.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.777
I mean, I started in--
that was my-- comedy was

00:37:48.777 --> 00:37:50.860
this other thing that I
thought, that must be fun.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.540
And when I finally
got to LA and started

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:57.780
auditioning for sitcoms, it
was an entirely other world.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.220
We had a tremendous
amount of fun,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.190
particularly because
everything was

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.565
shot in front of
a live audience.

00:38:01.565 --> 00:38:06.390
We shot an episode in four hours
in front of a studio audience

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.314
who by second and
third season had

00:38:09.314 --> 00:38:11.105
had their tickets for
six months, you know?

00:38:11.105 --> 00:38:12.820
And so they were
excited to be there.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.010
And I realized
very early on that

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:19.130
if you fuck up in the
first scene, they love it.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:23.020
So I just, I'd start
throwing F bombs around,

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.030
and they were like, oh
my God, [INAUDIBLE]--?

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.880
So it was fantastic.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.220
So that's why, if you google
"Will and Grace" outtakes,

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.660
sometimes they're funnier
than some of the episodes

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.510
because we had a lot of fun.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.400
And we still have a
lot of fun on this show

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.920
but it is an
entirely different--

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.170
it takes 14 hours to
shoot it in a day,

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.329
and it's not as funny a subject.

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:51.120
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.130
ALAN SEALES: So how did
you get your start, though?

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.865
So you started out doing
theater in high school?

00:38:57.865 --> 00:38:58.740
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.839
I did a play in first grade.

00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:01.880
It kept going from there.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.796
It was always theatre.

00:39:02.796 --> 00:39:05.190
I didn't do, like,
commercials or anything.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.810
I went to high school
with Mike Myers

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.130
on the south side of Toronto.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:09.330
ALAN SEALES: He's Canadian.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:09.790
Yeah.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.190
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah so we
knew each other a little bit.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.480
But he was already in
Canadian television

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.990
when he was like nine, ten.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.940
And then he was doing
commercials and episodes

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.370
of things.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:23.650
But I was strictly just theatre
at school and competitions--

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.480
you know, skit
competitions and stuff.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.125
But 11th grade is
when it sort of-- I

00:39:28.125 --> 00:39:31.224
did a production of "Godspell,"
and that was, you know.

00:39:31.224 --> 00:39:32.890
ALAN SEALES: Who were
you in "Godspell"?

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.848
ERIC MCCORMACK: Christ.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.130
As I affectionately
call him, Christ.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.194
That changed everything because
it's kind of a rock musical,

00:39:44.194 --> 00:39:46.360
compared to-- we had been
doing "Annie Get Your Gun"

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.265
and all of those
old-fashioned things.

00:39:47.265 --> 00:39:49.499
And all of a sudden, to
have my peers, who had never

00:39:49.499 --> 00:39:51.790
really accepted me-- I was
not an athlete or anything--

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:54.740
suddenly, like, forced
to watch one of the songs

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.347
at an assembly, you know,
and at the end of it,

00:39:57.347 --> 00:39:58.930
they jumped on their
feet and cheered.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.985
It was like, OK, I can do this.

00:40:00.985 --> 00:40:02.110
This I can do for a living.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:02.830
ALAN SEALES: So you sing.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:03.280
ERIC MCCORMACK: I sing.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.076
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, of
course, because you

00:40:04.076 --> 00:40:05.440
were in "Music Man" and
everything, as well.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.020
Yes.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.890
So you just did a
concert-- what was this?

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:11.662
A year or two ago?

00:40:11.662 --> 00:40:13.120
ERIC MCCORMACK: I
did a show that I

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.360
had been sort of creating
in my brain for 30 years.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.100
It was called "The Concert I
Never Gave-- except for, like,

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.820
2000 times in my
bedroom" because I did.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.132
I was that guy, at 16.

00:40:24.132 --> 00:40:25.590
When other people
were doing things

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.760
like dating and drinking,
I was in my bedroom

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.500
dressing up like Alice
Cooper and Freddie Mercury

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.870
and wishing that I
could be a rock star.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.480
So I really wanted
to be an actor.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.164
And I got to be.

00:40:38.164 --> 00:40:39.580
So that was no
longer the fantasy.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.560
The fantasy, to this day,
is still rock and roll.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.100
So I did this show where I sang.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.370
It was myself and my piano
player who is a friend of mine.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.010
He's the keyboard
player for The Who.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.117
So already, there's kind
of a fantasy level there.

00:40:52.117 --> 00:40:53.200
He put together this band.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.867
And I sang-- it was mostly songs
by popular artists but not.

00:40:57.867 --> 00:40:59.450
The songs themselves
were like B-sides

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.220
and, like, you know,
the last song on side

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.420
three of some album that--
but they were my favorites

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.470
when I was 16.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.040
And I had stories behind them.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.761
And when Elton John
did "Will and Grace,"

00:41:09.761 --> 00:41:11.010
there was a story behind that.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:11.730
So I'd tell that story.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.350
Then I did this rare
Elton John song.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:13.635
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:41:13.635 --> 00:41:14.490
Right.

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.915
I feel like doing a
sitcom-- this kind of plays

00:41:16.915 --> 00:41:18.790
on her question a little
bit-- doing a sitcom

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:23.030
would be more enjoyable for you
in that it is more theatresque.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.530
Right?

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.160
Because you're in front
of a live audience.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.445
You only do a couple takes.

00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:26.740
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.031
ALAN SEALES: I mean, in a
theatre, you have no retakes.

00:41:29.031 --> 00:41:30.780
ERIC MCCORMACK: Exactly.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.770
And as you were
pointing out, twice,

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.489
we did actually
live episodes, like,

00:41:34.489 --> 00:41:36.530
as America was watching
them, we were doing them.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.696
And those were-- they didn't
look as good because it

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:41.599
was videotaped, but
it was tremendous fun.

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.390
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.450
Well, do you prefer that?

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.694
Do you prefer the live
aspect, versus [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:45.694 --> 00:41:46.860
ERIC MCCORMACK: I really do.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.510
I mean, I'll always do back to
the theatre because I do love

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.010
that a lot.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.240
And a show like this
takes it out of you

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.350
because it's-- anyone that
does an hour drama, I mean,

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.710
it's non-stop.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.630
It's just--

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:58.830
ALAN SEALES: Do you
do an episode a week?

00:41:58.830 --> 00:41:59.670
Is that a typical schedule?

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.530
ERIC MCCORMACK: It's
a seven day schedule.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.640
But, you know, we
have weekends off.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.140
So yeah.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.400
But it's seven days.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:03.950
ALAN SEALES: So for how long?

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.110
You film for three months?

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.300
ERIC MCCORMACK: January to June.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.360
We're finished next week.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.120
ALAN SEALES: Oh, wow,
because you're still

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:08.660
filming the finale?

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:08.920
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.339
I go back and shoot tomorrow.

00:42:10.339 --> 00:42:11.380
ALAN SEALES: Well, sorry.

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.570
ERIC MCCORMACK: Now is
the time when I'm happy.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:14.194
No, because we premiere
tomorrow night,

00:42:14.194 --> 00:42:16.030
and it's so great
to get the word out.

00:42:18.474 --> 00:42:20.640
As I was saying before,
it's a smaller universe now,

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.214
but you still--
it puts everything

00:42:23.214 --> 00:42:24.630
you have into
something like this.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.070
And you just want people to
see it, and you want to--

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.210
ALAN SEALES: Well, speaking
of getting the word out,

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.460
you have a Twitter account
that you want to plug here?

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.070
ERIC MCCORMACK:
It's @EricMcCormack.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.810
And yes, please.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.090
I've got 70,000 loyal followers.

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:38.259
And I want more.

00:42:38.259 --> 00:42:40.050
ALAN SEALES: Oh, we
had a question jump up.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:40.370
Yeah?

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.690
ERIC MCCORMACK: Hello.

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:41.231
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:41.231 --> 00:42:43.200
So I'm a really big TV fan.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.750
So I watch a lot
of different shows.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.430
And "Will and Grace" is
one of the earlier ones

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.300
that I watched when I started,
about six years ago, just

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.130
watching all of the
seasons that I could.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.090
And the Emmys have changed a
lot since you and your show

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.167
have been nominated
and won and everything.

00:42:55.167 --> 00:42:57.500
And I was wondering what you
think about the Emmys today

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.970
and how television has kind
of changed since you've

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.660
kind of done sitcoms,
versus now, doing a drama.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.150
ERIC MCCORMACK: Well, you know,
Jim Parsons, from, I think

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.770
"Big Bang Theory"
is the closest thing

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.400
to what we used to do
that is on television now.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.380
And he's brilliant.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.250
And so when I see
that kind of show win,

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.980
I go, well, not that
much has changed.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.850
But certainly, in terms of
drama and what cable is doing,

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.680
it's changed entirely.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.560
I mean, I think almost
everything nominated

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.260
this year was not from
a network, you know?

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.050
But I think that's OK.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.695
That old the way has to go.

00:43:31.695 --> 00:43:33.820
It benefited those of us
that were on popular shows

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.403
because we got a big
number of people.

00:43:35.403 --> 00:43:36.580
It was less to choose from.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.250
But those days are gone.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:44.600
I mean, everyone in this
generation, with Google

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.927
and everything else, we can
choose whatever we want.

00:43:46.927 --> 00:43:48.260
ALAN SEALES: On your cell phone?

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.968
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah,
on your cell phone.

00:43:49.968 --> 00:43:52.070
So the Emmys are, in
and of themselves,

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:55.600
going to become less
representational of what's

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.670
really out there.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:01.720
I think nowadays, if I
were on a great cable show,

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.820
doing great work, and
still not nominated,

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.780
I wouldn't take it
all that personally.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:09.210
I mean, there's just too much
good stuff to choose from.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.790
So I don't know.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:12.767
That could change.

00:44:12.767 --> 00:44:14.850
There's still only ever
going to be five nominees.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.750
And they will not
necessarily represent

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:18.792
what everyone's watching.

00:44:18.792 --> 00:44:20.333
AUDIENCE: They
actually recently said

00:44:20.333 --> 00:44:22.940
that they might consider doing
a best show, which combines

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.965
both the best series categories
together, because there

00:44:25.965 --> 00:44:26.947
have been changes.

00:44:26.947 --> 00:44:28.280
What would you think about that?

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.110
ERIC MCCORMACK: What
do you mean best show?

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:33.210
AUDIENCE: Instead of best
comedy series, best drama,

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.260
they would combine it into 10.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.274
How do you think that would--

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:38.690
ERIC MCCORMACK: I
find that weird.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.620
AUDIENCE: It was a weird
little theory that people had,

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.386
out there.

00:44:41.386 --> 00:44:42.260
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.340
I find that strange.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.840
ALAN SEALES: Oh, is this the
Emmy fan of [INAUDIBLE] rumors?

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.570
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yeah, because
I think comedy and a drama

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:52.880
are very different animals.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.704
You know?

00:44:54.704 --> 00:44:56.792
You know what's very strange?

00:44:56.792 --> 00:44:59.130
It was the Golden
Globes or something.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.870
"Will and Grace" has
the record for the most

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.946
Golden Globe nominations
with no wins at all.

00:45:04.946 --> 00:45:05.720
It's true.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.220
Look it up.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.630
25 nominations, and
none of us ever won.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.560
And every year, we'd
go get the same table.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.730
And Max, who created the show,
every time somebody wouldn't

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:19.035
win, he would grab his
glass, and we'd all go, yeah!

00:45:19.035 --> 00:45:20.110
And we'd cheer.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.310
And so the cameras would always
come to us like we'd won.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.000
But we hadn't.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.860
Some other guy was walking
up and taking the thing.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:32.110
But I think it was at the
Globes that the category

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.460
for Supporting Actor
is for everything.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.720
Best Supporting Actor
on any television

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.320
show-- drama, miniseries.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.090
So Sean always managed to
get nominated [INAUDIBLE],

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.850
but always with this pool
of, like, opposite Vanessa

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.120
Redgrave or something.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.140
It was just madness.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.640
So when you start to
make it too small,

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.500
the award starts to have
less-- I mean, for me,

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.760
it meant so much because the
big show, for me, growing up,

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.339
was "Get Smart" which was--

00:45:56.339 --> 00:45:57.130
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:59.088
ERIC MCCORMACK: I didn't
see it's original run,

00:45:59.088 --> 00:46:00.940
but I saw reruns in the '70s.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.430
And Don Adams won that award.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.060
You know?

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.549
Actually, there's
a famous story--

00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:08.090
I don't know if it's apocryphal
that on Emmy night, you know,

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:11.664
the Emmys have the wings
that are really sharp.

00:46:11.664 --> 00:46:13.080
And apparently,
he and Don Rickles

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.660
got so drunk that Don Adams
fell asleep on his Emmy

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.494
and punctured his throat and
was bleeding all over his tux.

00:46:20.494 --> 00:46:21.660
I don't know if that's true.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.576
But I love that story.

00:46:22.576 --> 00:46:24.289
But just the fact that--

00:46:24.289 --> 00:46:26.330
ALAN SEALES: You said it
here, and now it's true.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:26.399
ERIC MCCORMACK: Exactly.

00:46:26.399 --> 00:46:26.470
Now it's back.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.490
ALAN SEALES: Now
it's on the internet.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:30.780
ERIC MCCORMACK: But the
fact that he won that award,

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.350
and then 35 years
later, I won that award.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.900
The fact that I shot "Will
and Grace" on the same lot

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.570
that Seinfeld shot on.

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:40.160
And on our stage, Bob
Newhart shot his show.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.630
I love that history.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:43.791
And the Emmys is part of that.

00:46:43.791 --> 00:46:44.790
Thanks for the question.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.030
ALAN SEALES: Great.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.032
So the show premieres
tomorrow, June 17th--

00:46:48.032 --> 00:46:49.240
ERIC MCCORMACK: Yes, it does.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.710
ALAN SEALES: On TNT which is
channel 103, here in New York,

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.250
at 10:00 PM.

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:58.270
