00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.170
I've just modified this Microwave Oven Transformer
into a dangerous little device. 800 amps of

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.330
electrical current is about to be bad news
for anything made of metal.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.980
Today I'm in the mood to melt some metal.
This Microwave Oven Transformer used to be

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.710
a dangerously high-voltage device, but I modified
it so the voltage is extremely low, and it's

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.750
the amps now that are insanely high. High
enough that when the electrodes touch this

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.800
screw, it melts into a little ball of steel.
This time I've hooked it up to a machine screw

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.280
for melting, and when it heats up it changes
color and the outer layer bursts into flames.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.660
If I hold the electrodes in constant contact,
you can see molten metal flowing down the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.160
screw, and within seconds it's completely
gone. I just love the way these light up and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.420
flash, throwing off sparks as they melt. This
bolt is longer so it's taking more time to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.140
melt. You can see an array of color changes
as the metal heats up to the point where it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.560
begins to glow a burning bright orange. Back
on my workbench, you can see the input voltage

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.810
to the primary coil is about 120 volts AC,
which is typical mains power in my area. And

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.730
with this modified secondary, you can see
I've stepped the potential down to only 3

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.560
volts. The voltage is so low that I can actually
touch the live wires with bare hands, and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.570
not feel anything. Even though the power being
generated is enough to completely incinerate

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.980
this wood screw on contact. This much power
has the potential to kill you, so don't ever

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.650
try this yourself. Now here's a 5/16" bolt
I'm trying to melt, and it's building up so

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.000
much heat that my 4 gauge electrode wires
are smoking. As it's cooling, I'll try a little

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.600
amateur blacksmithing while I have the chance,
because this got so hot, I just melted my

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.470
melter. 4 gauge wires just aren't enough to
handle the extreme current pumping through

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.360
these wires. That's ok though because the
primary coil is still good, so I'll just rip

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.650
off the secondary so I can use the rest of
this in another project, like making a makeshift

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.080
stick welder. Look for that in a future video.
In the meantime, I still have this other MOT

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.780
that was salvaged from a microwave in a previous
project, and after making the proper modifications,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.280
I've got a new metal melter sporting this
thicker 2 gauge wire. To fire it up, I'll

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.000
attach input wires to the primary coil, plug
those into a power bar, and flip on the switch.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.440
You can see the low voltage sparks off the
terminals, and I'm measuring their potential

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.640
at just over 2 volts. Once again, for your
entertainment, I'm holding the leads bare

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.050
handed, and you can clearly see there's power
to the system because of the electrical arcing.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.700
There's also a visible amount of current pumping
through this screw. The thicker wire should

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.160
be able to handle higher temperatures than
the first, so I'm gonna experiment on various

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.170
items around the house, like this iron nail.
And a drywall screw. How about some lead solder.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.040
Or a zinc washer. And various other objects
made of metal. One friend suggested I try

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.600
melting a padlock and that seemed like a fun
idea. It's at full power and the steel retaining

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.880
clip is getting extremely hot, but the metal
isn't melting. Something inside the casing

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.270
just caught fire though, and although the
retaining clip isn't melting, the lock is

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.400
so hot that the clip just fell open. Along
with the rest of it. I'll try a couple of

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.370
amateur spot welds on some stainless steel,
and i'm impressed at how much effort it takes

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.709
to get them to break. When experimenting with
an aluminum can, the electrodes cut through

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.750
the metal like butter, but this thicker aluminum
disc won't glow at all. I'm not sure how hot

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.990
it is but when I drip water on it, the water
is instantly boiled and vaporized. I did get

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.190
this steel coin pretty hot, and if it will
do that, i'm wondering what it will do to

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.599
steel wool. Amazingly, nothing happens unless
the electrodes are so close they're almost

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.709
touching. Aluminum foil isn't very exciting
either, but I've managed to reduce this sheet

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.190
down to a little blob of metal. I've got some
Neodymium magnets ready, but the voltage is

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.750
too low to get through all eight. However,
if tap onto two, it seems to be working really

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.599
well. They're getting so hot they've gone
totally incandescent, and apparently have

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.310
just been liquified. These are among the worlds
strongest magnets, but after exposure to temperatures

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.540
over 300ÂºC, they lose most of their magnetic
properties. Here's a large steel nut that's

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.000
harder to heat, but in the end it glows very
nicely as well. This one's just got so hot

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.170
that it's exploding liquid metal. As expected,
I got no visible reactions from a 250 volt

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.190
lightbulb, or this audio transformer. But
I did have a lot of fun melting down the tines

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.030
on this fork. This brings back memories of
curling plastic forks over the fire as a kid.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.569
It's not very useful anymore, but it looks
pretty neat. I'm applying a current to the

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.909
underside of this knife and can visibly see
the point of contact. The whole blade is glowing

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.620
and this is looking really cool. At this point,
the blade is really easy to bend. For my last

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.219
trick, I got a circuit board with some high
temperature solder that my desoldering iron

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.289
wouldn't melt. But hooking a couple of nails
to the electrodes gives me the ability to

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.699
instantly liquify the solder on these contact
points.. Well we cheated death again and destroyed

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.969
a lot of metal doing it. If you like these
