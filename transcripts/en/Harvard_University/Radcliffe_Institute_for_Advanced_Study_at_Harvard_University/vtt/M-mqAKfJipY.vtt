[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:10.170
- So our next session
is on ASL signing.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.350
And it will be
chaired and introduced

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.150
by Professor Amy
Szarkowski who is

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.800
a professor in the Department
of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.100
School, and a psychologist
who specializes

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.710
in working with children who
are deaf or hard of hearing

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.780
and their families.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.340
So, Professor Szarkowski?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.840
Amy?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.635
Where are you?

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:35.530
Oh, yes, great.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.030
Thank you.

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:41.790
- You guys ready?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
We're going to take a change
in topic at this moment.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.000
We're still under the
umbrella of communication,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.370
but now, a different
way of communicating

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.440
with sign language.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.070
We have two fabulous
presenters with us today.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.260
One of our presenters identifies
as deaf, as a performer.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.352
And second, we have a
sign language interpreter.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.180
Both these ladies are
brilliant and we're

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.562
thrilled to have them here
and share their perspectives.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.020
And that perspective
is going to be

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.810
about how sign language
in that communication

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.900
impacts interactions,
specifically pertaining

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.350
to beauty and gender.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.420
You guys ready?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.749
All right, let's go.

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:41.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.410
- Well you guys can see I am
a female with a male voice.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.650
Right here we have
a male interpreter,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.390
so I hope you guys
can kind of just

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.160
reconcile that with the
appearance versus the voice.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.890
But I think that it would
be a great actual match

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.400
for this topic on gender.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.970
ASL, the acronym for
American Sign Language.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.400
This language is complex,
rich, it is full of history.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.280
This linguistic,
beautiful language

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.470
is something that I've had--

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.676
and it's been part of American
culture for over 200 years.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:27.750
It has been down since
back in native times

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.490
and has transitioned
as a language,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.040
like many languages do,
over a 200 year period.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.830
Now there are formal
language systems, as we know,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.060
and how language develops
is by the culture,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.670
the community, sharing
knowledge, experiences.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.360
And therefore
emerges further uses

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.930
of language, language
choices, and signs,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.290
and those are based on
culture that were predating

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.680
those currently using it.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.100
American Sign Language has five
distinct and unique parameters.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.830
I'm going to show you these
to help you understand

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.680
how we communicate and
how it has developed

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.020
using a cultural framework.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.940
The first is hand shape.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.530
So, obviously,
for sign language,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.546
you need a hand shape
like this or this.

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:23.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.850
So that is the
shape of your hand--

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.500
it is very crucial.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.160
Now, which hand shape you use
really is dependent on context.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.990
Second parameter is location.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.130
Where is that hand going to?

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.450
Now there are various
categories within that.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.040
As an example, you
can start up here

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.300
in this location, versus this
location, versus this location,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.190
versus here, versus out here.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.900
All the signs that
we'll be doing--

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.100
and you'll see-- have
that specific objection.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.320
Objective in using that
location about what it's

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.390
going to indicate, and
the various categories

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.520
and what it means.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.310
The next parameter is movement.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.582
So remember we have the hand
shape, we have a location,

00:04:18.582 --> 00:04:20.540
and now we're going to
put some movement to it.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.060
Now what does this mean?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.630
Hello?

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.650
Right?

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.870
So there's where movement
is the characteristic

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.747
within the language--
that parameter.

00:04:31.747 --> 00:04:32.580
Now what about this?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.200
What does this mean?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.700
- Stop.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.690
- Stop.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.690
- That means stop, right?

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.770
Or, whoa.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.440
Hold on.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.320
Or you can be welcoming someone.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.260
So again, movement is
such a crucial aspect

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.960
of language in its expression.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.930
So the next parameter
is palm orientation.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.710
As I just demonstrated
as an example,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.900
using this hand shape,
which would mean, hey, wait,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.600
versus this, changing
my palm orientation,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.390
could say you, or
only you, or wait.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.530
It's the same movement, but
the palm orientation now

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.290
indicates a different
meaning in the language.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.600
So again, palm
orientation is crucial.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.170
And finally, but last but not
least, is facial expressions.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.560
This is how you communicate
feelings, thoughts--

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.440
also gives a sense of time.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.440
Also, as an example, using this.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.815
This is an example of
indicating someone walking.

00:05:45.815 --> 00:05:49.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.000
You get the picture.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.018
This is a long walk.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.310
Someone's going to be dragging.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.860
So simply by that
facial expression,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.140
we've been able to evoke
if someone is having

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.870
a good day, or a bad day.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.290
So all those are parameters
that are so crucial.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.290
And by the selection
of those parameters,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.750
can then craft your message
and convey your culture,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.269
your personality, your tone.

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:21.686
So now I'm going
to go back to one

00:06:21.686 --> 00:06:25.340
of those parameters
about location.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.270
These two are very unique along
with these other few locations

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.470
associated with gender.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.570
It's associated with
male and female.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.350
Gender has already been
assigned to those locations.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.780
Male is here.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.850
Any male oriented sign is
typically in this location.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.603
But why do you think up here?

00:06:47.603 --> 00:06:49.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.552
- Any guesses?

00:06:51.552 --> 00:06:54.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.130
- The brain, the
head, intellect.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.460
What else what else you got?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.960
- Hats.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.990
- Hats.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.790
OK.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.290
Yeah.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.590
So back in time where
gentlemen were wearing hats.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.250
Showing someone is a thinker,
as opposed to being emotive.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.290
Logic, intellect,
and, of course,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.120
going on with those
other adjectives.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.410
But again, that
orientation, that location.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.410
Now female.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.220
Any guesses what
location that would be?

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.080
Let me see.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.913
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:21.800
- Oh, interesting.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.380
I see a few.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.520
Nice, that's interesting.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.680
Why did you guys pick this as a
location I saw in the audience?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.430
Emotion, love,
nurturer, caregiver.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.120
It's actually this
location right here.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.920
This is the location for female.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.940
So again, female oriented
signs of that love,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.710
emotion, nurturing, typically
have these two locations.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.040
But primarily on the chin here.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.720
So there are subsets within just
the idea of location, which is,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.210
of course, indicating binary.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.580
You have boy, as girl,
because the bonnet.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.260
Boys because of
the baseball cap.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.358
So this is the sign for girl.

00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:09.150
So this is the kind of
the language we use.

00:08:11.078 --> 00:08:12.620
So I'm going to give
you guys-- we're

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.090
going to do a little
hands-on activity.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.590
So we're going to
pick a hand shape.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.090
Let's do this hand
shape right here.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.072
So I want everyone to copy
me, you in the audience.

00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:22.530
We're going to give
you a movement.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.169
Now the term is going to be mom.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:36.429
Where do you think that hand
shape movement should go?

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:38.830
Show me.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.549
Like this?

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.549
Perfect.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.500
Now, for the term
dad, where do you

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.200
think that hand shape
would go as far as location

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.100
is concerned?

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.210
Here?

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.320
Exactly.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.590
Great job.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:58.760
So, similar hand shape, similar
movement, different location.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.450
There demonstrating
the role of father

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:08.040
versus mother, boy
versus girl, grandparents

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.950
or grandpa, grandma.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.880
What about Grandpa?

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.340
What do you think?

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.600
Oh, wow yeah.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.920
Right off the bat.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.776
And this would be
grandmother, or grandma.

00:09:20.776 --> 00:09:22.240
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.270
- Notice that movement
in that location.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.130
So that is a systematic way in
American Sign Language using

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.110
that movement and location.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:35.160
So now, in a generation,
fast-forwarding to now,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.800
where we have the spectrum
of male and female

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.220
that we're looking at, how
does this impact sign language

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.830
and how it's expressed,
where things are not

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.862
already assigned?

00:09:44.862 --> 00:09:46.570
So as a deaf community,
this is something

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.620
we're starting to look at.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.340
What is a sign to
identify a gender?

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.480
And other signs that we
might not have signs for,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.380
that have not yet
been established.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.810
So, for example, the
term transgender.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:09.640
The sign is this.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.930
And notice that location.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.940
Why do you think this
location was used?

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.920
It's there to indicate the soul.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.490
The inner workings of
someone's heart, their soul.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.140
All the rest is a shell.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.570
Everything else that's
been biologically assigned,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.730
but to a person's soul.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.940
And so, when they have
that transformation,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.390
that's where that movement
comes in that location.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.260
A beautiful sign.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.070
Now the hand shape.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.570
Like this.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.270
That hand shape, along
with that movement,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.330
has a very unique
theme, a distinct theme.

00:10:57.352 --> 00:10:58.810
Now the sign for
beautiful is this.

00:11:01.252 --> 00:11:02.960
Notice that hand shape
and that movement?

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.515
You can sign grow.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.500
Also a part of that
same sign, culture.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.930
So that hand shape in itself
has a very rich history,

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.270
and such deep
meaning and context.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.370
So, to use that sign and
assign it to who I am,

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.350
how do I identify.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.020
And that's where the origin
for transgender, and that

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.100
sign in our community.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.480
Another term-- non-binary.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.120
We've heard that today.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.210
From a hearing,
non-signing perspective,

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.510
you have the words
male, female, binary.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.000
Those systems have
been in place.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.820
And those who are
nonconforming, that's

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.420
where we come up
with the word non,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:05.410
to then show the contrast of
that standard nonconformity.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.040
Non-binary-- to disassociate
from that concept

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.970
of the standard stereotype,
or that established systematic

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.290
terminology.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.020
And again, in time, there
will be new identities

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.610
that will continue to come up.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.520
But the first step and
stage is to disassociate

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.790
from the norm in those
cultural words and labels

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.640
as we know them.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.050
And that is also impacting
American Sign Language.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.120
There are things that we
might not have a sign--

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.210
and there are various rules,
grammatical, linguistic rules,

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.790
that are associated
to sign language.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.020
Remember, you have
to have a location.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.070
Now think about this neutral
space right here as a location.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.310
As you can see, it's
disassociated from my body.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.340
So, as an example,
you have non-binary,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.530
or, just for short,
the acronym NB,

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.950
as in American Sign Language,
we'll just use that short.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.630
But out in space, as you can
see, is a different location.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.315
So this is something that's
continuing to evolve.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.975
As we saw hats and bonnets
and various fashion items

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:14.350
that we've just
talked about have

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.040
changed till today, we also have
that same thing with language

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.410
and it's a beautiful
thing to see.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.710
We have one other activity
before I'm out of my time here.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.420
I'm going to give you
another hand shape.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.800
Do this as your hand shape.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.770
This could represent an
individual or a person.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.430
That's what that represents.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.130
Now, if someone was
going to indicate

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.610
that that individual
was walking, how would

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.350
you do that movement?

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:46.470
Like this, or like this.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.390
Now, how would you
demonstrate or manifest

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.670
that person as masculine
with that same hand

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.840
shape and movement?

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.416
What would you do?

00:13:56.416 --> 00:13:56.916
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:56.916 --> 00:13:57.416
Ha.

00:13:57.416 --> 00:14:01.370
You wouldn't do it by your
head, because that actually

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.240
would mean you're
walking on the head.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.710
Be careful with the location.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.440
Location, location
is everything.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.370
So how would you express
and demonstrate masculinity?

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.516
How would you do it?

00:14:16.516 --> 00:14:19.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.865
Well you're kind of cheating
doing two hands at once there.

00:14:22.865 --> 00:14:23.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:24.470
OK.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.100
So you're adding those
facial expressions,

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.142
those non-manual markers.

00:14:27.142 --> 00:14:31.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.600
You see how crucial it was
to identify that person

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.620
and how they identify?

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.810
Now what about a female?

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.910
In a feminine way,
how would you do that?

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:47.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.379
Same sign, same hand shape,
show me what you got.

00:14:51.379 --> 00:14:52.876
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:52.876 --> 00:14:56.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.860
- See the difference?

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.480
So again, back to those
fundamental parameters.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.050
This is what I live
and breathe in my work

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.390
as a performer and an artist.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.880
How I can manipulate
these parameters,

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.220
those hand shapes, movement,
location, orientation,

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.940
and facial expressions, to
express who I am as a person.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.290
Again, expressing my world view,
my political view, my belief

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.350
system, my culture, all in one.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.850
Thank you.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:56.727
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:56.727 --> 00:15:58.310
- Before we get on
to my presentation,

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.890
I just want to share
a few disclaimers.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.710
For this, I will be using
American Sign Language

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.750
and English, but I
want to recognize

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.480
that that has an inherent
privilege for the language I

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.310
choose to use.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.580
For this presentation
and its perspective,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:21.240
I will be using the terms
female as a umbrella term.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.130
So, I mean all of
those who identify.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.220
So I want to recognize as a
white woman how society views

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.270
me, how society views
women, and women of color,

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.220
and that discrepancy.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.940
So just as a whole,
to keep that in mind.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.670
Also, I want to clarify
some terminology

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.110
that I might be using.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.290
I will state the word
deaf, which is an umbrella

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.233
term because it is a very
diverse cultural community,

00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:48.900
and they all use
American Sign Language.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.280
So that can indicate someone
who is deaf, deaf-blind, someone

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.610
who is hard of hearing.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.950
But again, that language
that they're using

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.570
is American Sign Language.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.100
But to interact
in the world, they

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.520
may need to use an interpreter
for someone who does not sign.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.140
Also I might speak about
male, and female, transgender

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.972
as well, and cisgender.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:16.520
And I have two
scenarios and anecdotes

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.190
to show what it looks like
as an American Sign Language

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.480
interpreter, whether it's in
public or behind closed doors.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.349
Here's the scenario.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.359
As a staff interpreter,
I was working

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.890
at Boston Children's Hospital.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.900
There was an appointment,
which I went in.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.050
The provider and the doctor was
there speaking to the patient.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.740
This is post-op.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.130
And then was saying, hey,
you gotta get off your butt--

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.482
and the doctor, as he said
that, he smacked me in my butt.

00:17:40.482 --> 00:17:41.640
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.140
- Fact.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.410
This recent Super
Bowl, if you saw,

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.940
there was a press
conference where

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.840
Mayor Walsh-- and I was there
on stage interpreting with him.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.340
And that was very public.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.160
And it was edited where
someone grabbed a clip

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.410
and put it online, on
reddit, and people were then

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.980
started making various
comments about my look,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.440
my sexual performance,
what I looked like.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.700
The commentary went on and on.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.020
It was a free-for-all.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.200
But those were two examples
of me just as I am--

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:14.950
Jackie.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.400
But it's not alone.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.790
I'm not unique in
that one experience.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.520
So it's interesting
with this topic today,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.530
and how we see women, and
how it impacts deaf men,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.993
and how it impacts deaf
youth who are boys.

00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:32.910
And that's what I want
to share with you guys.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.590
- So what was that like for you?

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.120
Listening to me in
a conventionally

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.800
accepted male voice, versus
now listening to me in my own?

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.250
How does that difference
shape your judgments about me?

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.920
About your willingness
to trust me, to hire me?

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.230
I intentionally did not
ask you if that difference

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.490
had an impact.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.830
For today, I want us to
examine that dynamic--

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.020
when deaf boys and
men are working

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.270
with female interpreters,
American Sign Language

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.410
interpreters.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.830
And I want to challenge you to
examine your implicit biases

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.830
and assess how, just as it
says here on the screen,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.800
how and to what degree that
experience of listening

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.590
to a deaf man through
a female's voice

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:29.010
is impacting your actions, and
what is your responsibility

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.950
to make that connection
more authentic?

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.870
So why does this matter?

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.480
In 2016, a researcher
by the name of Punch,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.400
in her review of
literature, found

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.320
that deaf people
were nearly two times

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.530
as likely to be unemployed or
underemployed when compared

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.020
to non-deaf individuals.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.540
And yet, when it
comes to one's career,

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.470
a 2015 report from the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.880
put it bluntly.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.370
They said that your first
10 years in the labor market

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.510
are likely to shape your entire
lifetime earning potential.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.550
So it's not
far-fetched to believe

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.920
that because of society's
treatment of women,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.280
combined with the fact that 86%
of the people doing this work

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.820
identify as female, is having
an impact on deaf men and boys

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.930
and their social mobility--
their lifetime earning

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.040
potential.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.290
And so that is the space
I want to invite you

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.430
into today to explore.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.350
I have a few studies
to share to help

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.910
illuminate further
why this topic is

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.920
worth our consideration.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.800
As I share these,
I want you to think

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.300
about listening to a deaf man
through a female interpreter's

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.950
voice.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:42.880
In 2012, Karpowitz,
Mendelberg, and Shaker

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.280
showed us that holding the
floor for a greater percentage

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.050
of a group's
deliberation made you

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.580
more likely to be seen as
influential in the group.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.570
However, if you were a
woman interrupting a man,

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.000
you were likely to be
seen as disrespectful,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.830
whereas a man
interrupting a woman

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.260
was seen as more assertive.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.020
In a meta-analysis
of previous studies,

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.420
Williams and Tiedens
in 2015 found

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.160
that women who
assertively emphasized

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.580
their skills, accomplishments,
or desire to lead,

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.180
tended to be liked less and
to be seen as less hireable,

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.600
compared to men describing
themselves identically.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.600
Specific to the work of
female ASL interpreters,

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.170
Colleen Jones, in her
2017 graduate thesis work,

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.440
found that non-deaf men who
were listening to deaf men

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.300
through a female's
interpretation

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.140
rated him as less intelligent
and less trustworthy as

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.730
compared to
listening to deaf men

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.130
through male
interpreters voices.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:41.690
And last, a 2018 study from
ASL interpreter Lena Jenny

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.370
looked into
genderqueer and female

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:49.485
presenting interpreters with
masculine tethered traits.

00:21:49.485 --> 00:21:51.110
And she found that
if you are masculine

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.080
presenting and utilize
masculine discourse traits,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.600
you may actually be compounding
the discrimination faced

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.920
by these deaf men.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.135
So let's see if we
have this so far.

00:22:01.135 --> 00:22:02.510
If we're masculine
presenting, we

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.985
need to try to
sound more feminine.

00:22:03.985 --> 00:22:05.360
But if we're
feminine presenting,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.042
we need to try to
sound more masculine.

00:22:08.042 --> 00:22:10.250
All women should probably
try to sound more masculine

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.480
when other men are listening.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.800
But don't interrupt men.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.360
Right?

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.140
Got it.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.900
When it's all women, we can
sound authoritative, but not

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.980
tout our accomplishments.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.438
And when men are listening, or
when we're in mixed company,

00:22:21.438 --> 00:22:24.435
we need to tone it down, but
be ready to celebrate ourselves

00:22:24.435 --> 00:22:25.310
in a moment's notice.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.160
Got it.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.290
So, because we are
damned if we do,

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.440
and damned if we don't,
as was just shown,

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.600
many female interpreters
report using

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.060
any of the following
compensatory strategies.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.680
We stand taller,
we lower our voices

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.370
during the interpretation,
we dress in neutral attire

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.260
that we think is
more androgynous.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.260
Although I just learned
in the last presentation

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.135
it's actually more
masculine, which is really

00:22:49.135 --> 00:22:50.690
screwing with my mind.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.250
Thank you.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.780
We maintain distant
attitudes, we

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.880
learn to interrupt
to claim the floor,

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.160
and we train
ourselves to eliminate

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.100
what is conventionally
known as powerless language.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.960
Folks, we do all of
this while navigating

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.830
one of the most cognitively
complex tasks out there.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.570
This is the world
of ASL interpreting,

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.940
through the lens of a
female ASL interpreter.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.400
I want to take a step back.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.150
So we just covered a
little bit about what

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.040
female interpreters
are up against,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.765
but I want you to
understand what you--

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:21.390
I want to know what
your experience is.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.080
When you hire an ASL
interpreter, what's that like?

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.607
We'll take a broad
stroke here, just

00:23:26.607 --> 00:23:28.440
so we can appreciate
where the daily reality

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.080
of deaf men and female ASL
interpreters is situated.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.260
ASL interpreting as
a profession was not

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.595
known in the United
States until 1964,

00:23:38.595 --> 00:23:40.220
which is when our
National Professional

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.860
Organization, the Registry
of Interpreters for the Deaf,

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.161
was established.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.460
We are predominantly female.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.610
As was mentioned,
86% of RID members

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:56.060
who chose to identify
a gender are female.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.050
We are overwhelmingly white.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.610
87% of us doing this
work identify as white.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.160
And this is why you'll see
in my presentation today,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.417
the majority of my photos
are of white professionals.

00:24:07.417 --> 00:24:09.500
Because that's the reality
that we're up against--

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.330
that folks are dealing
with-- even though we are not

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.310
representative of the
increasingly diverse

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.740
populations of whom we serve.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:23.740
At least 93% of our members
are second or other language

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.790
learners of American
Sign Language.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:26.290
OK.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.300
So that's the larger context.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.970
We're a young profession,
we are predominantly female

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.460
white women, and we have
come into the language

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.280
in the community as guests,
or second and other language

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.350
learners of ASL, present
company included.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.212
Now that you have a
sense of who we are,

00:24:43.212 --> 00:24:45.670
I want to look at some of the
commonly reported experiences

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.680
of this predominately
female workforce

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.710
when working with men.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.250
Deaf and non-deaf men alike
routinely apologize to us

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.742
when they drop f-bombs.

00:24:56.742 --> 00:24:57.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.540
Now, when men are
with other men,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.380
we know that they swear to
decrease social distance,

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.768
for social power.

00:25:04.768 --> 00:25:07.310
So if they're censoring their
speech because of our presence,

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.140
how does that impact
their interaction

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.280
and its authenticity?

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.550
Now, this happens in
one-on-one interactions.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.760
It also happens in larger
all-male only spaces.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.460
The entire dynamic will shift
if I, or any of my sister

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.070
interpreters, walk into
a fraternity event,

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.070
or an all-male sex offender
group therapy session,

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.040
or a deaf man
wanting to find out

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.870
what's up with his male doctor.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.400
Right?

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.950
So, considering the reality
that less than 14% of my field

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.100
identifies as male, what
other strategies can we,

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.770
and you who work
with us, what can you

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.540
do to level the playing field?

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:46.800
All right.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.402
Picture this.

00:25:47.402 --> 00:25:49.110
You're a college
student, you're enrolled

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.485
in one of the interpreting
programs in the United States,

00:25:51.485 --> 00:25:53.970
and your college announces
that a very well-known comedian

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.960
is coming to campus.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.210
Interpreters will be provided.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.010
So naturally, you
buy tickets, right?

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.810
You want to see a
real-life interpretation,

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.730
you want to hone your
understanding of ASL,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.640
and dream about one day being
hired as a professional sign

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.730
language interpreter.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:07.230
OK.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.090
So the show starts,
and at some point

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.707
the comedian suddenly takes
notice of the female ASL

00:26:11.707 --> 00:26:12.540
interpreter working.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.870
In fact, you might have
seen these clips on YouTube.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.530
He tries to get a
rise out of her.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.530
He starts using obscene
language that I will not

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.317
use today out of respect
for my colleague working.

00:26:22.317 --> 00:26:24.150
But the interpreter
maintains her composure,

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.730
interpreting every single jab
that comes at her expense.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.230
And you can't help but think,
sitting there in the audience,

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.440
is this what you're aspiring
to be when you grow up?

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.740
Exploited for a cheap laugh and
used in public, or anywhere?

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.670
This situation is not unique to
that individual I just shared.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:49.080
It's one that many of us
have found ourselves in.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.288
Consider the reddit example
that I mentioned earlier.

00:26:51.288 --> 00:26:52.747
It turns out,
though, that it's not

00:26:52.747 --> 00:26:55.380
just the ignorant public who
sexualized female interpreters.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.750
In 2008, a video relay
service provider,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.660
one of the largest employers
of interpreters nationwide,

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.110
denied its female
interpreters, its employees,

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.800
the option of disconnecting
from a serial predator

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.550
who would connect with
them on the webcam,

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:13.160
not to place a phone call, but
to masturbate in front of them.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.230
Again, it's not
just sexual interest

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.660
from deaf and
non-deaf individuals.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.120
It's that female interpreters
are packaged as a commodity

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.920
and disregarded
by-- even our own--

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.000
by those who employ us and
who supposedly have our backs.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.750
What I find myself
wondering about though,

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:31.230
in these incidents and others,
is the lack of accountability.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.080
These non-deaf people,
intentionally or not,

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.518
are disrespecting an entire
population with their quips.

00:27:36.518 --> 00:27:38.060
There are deaf
patrons wanting to see

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.370
the show, deaf people at
home watching the press

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.217
conference about the
upcoming snowstorm,

00:27:42.217 --> 00:27:43.550
wanting to know what's going on.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.925
Or a deaf man going to the
doctor, wanting to know what's

00:27:45.925 --> 00:27:48.893
wrong with him, all of these
without drawing undue attention

00:27:48.893 --> 00:27:50.810
to the fact that their
communications with you

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.160
are mediated through a female.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.810
For this next section, I'd like
to borrow from the LifeCourse

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.610
Framework in the field
of public health.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.740
And if this is
unfamiliar to you,

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.890
the basic premise is that all
factors, genetics, nutrition,

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.330
social relationships,
financial security, exposure

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.833
to environmental toxins
and the like, all of these

00:28:11.833 --> 00:28:13.500
have a cumulative
impact on one's health

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.800
throughout their lifetime.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.710
And so, what we
experience today as

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.960
chronic physical and
mental conditions have

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.110
root causes that date way back.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.190
Now, if we take that
LifeCourse Framework

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.108
and apply it to the
life of a deaf male,

00:28:26.108 --> 00:28:28.150
for whom communication
with non-deaf individuals,

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.567
as we've discussed
time and again,

00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:32.230
is mediated through a
female ASL interpreter.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.540
I want to know, what's
the cumulative impact,

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.138
and can we even name it?

00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:38.680
Please note that the following
list is not exhaustive, nor is

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.700
it true for everyone.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.980
Interpreters are not
employed in all situations

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.330
or to the same degree.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.270
I'm simply using
these as exemplars.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.190
Let's start with a
deaf boy's childhood.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.620
Consider his education
and his extracurriculars.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.950
Please also note, that 87% of
deaf children in the United

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.710
States are not sent to schools
with deaf peers, deaf role

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.680
models, and others who are like
them, in a visually accessible

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.030
educational environment.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.300
Instead they're sent to
schools with peers and adults

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.060
who are not like them, and their
entire educational experience

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.150
is mediated through a likely
white female interpreter.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.170
So these are the public
schools that they're in.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:13.920
So think about it.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.643
Your classroom activities, your
group work with peers, maybe

00:29:16.643 --> 00:29:18.310
even your social
connections with peers,

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.620
all mediated through an adult
woman as a young deaf boy.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.120
But it's not just about the
boys lived experience or other's

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.405
experience of him.

00:29:25.405 --> 00:29:27.030
How does the presence
of an adult woman

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.420
impact him in ways that we
might not even be able to name?

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.787
That's what I want to know.

00:29:32.787 --> 00:29:33.870
Let's look at adolescence.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.880
Let's take some
common experiences.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.345
Driver's Ed, internship
interviews or placements,

00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:39.720
meetings with
guidance counselors

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.350
to talk about your future plans,
athletics, if that's your bag.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.600
How is an adolescent
boy's experience

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.250
shaped by working
with an adult female

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.050
for these rites of passage?

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.610
What about how others treat him?

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.110
What opportunities he's offered?

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.360
What he learns about
his changing body,

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.010
about networking,
or getting ahead

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.330
in love, life, and his career?

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.220
As a young adult, what
are the social, financial,

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.780
and academic impacts of having
a female in your college classes

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.670
or in your vocational training?

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.490
Or in Greek life?

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:08.990
Right?

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.360
All you want to do is make a
solid impression as a pledge,

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.980
or shoot the shit with
your fraternity brothers,

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.897
and then here's this
woman in the middle of it

00:30:14.897 --> 00:30:17.360
all who very well may
be your parents age.

00:30:19.965 --> 00:30:22.090
Look, I'm not saying these
poor deaf guys-- right--

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.173
they have to work with us.

00:30:23.173 --> 00:30:25.030
And I'm certainly
not saying deaf men

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.225
and female ASL interpreters
shouldn't be working together.

00:30:28.225 --> 00:30:30.100
I'm just arguing that
society's view of women

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.130
has short-term and long-term
impacts on these deaf boys

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.380
and these men and their
lifetime earning potential,

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.807
their social mobility, and
perhaps even their health.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.127
Lastly, for social services
and health care, many of us

00:30:43.127 --> 00:30:44.960
can agree that we feel
more comfortable when

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.835
we're working with a
health care provider who

00:30:46.835 --> 00:30:48.080
shares our same gender.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.370
Deaf men are not afforded
this luxury though.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.110
It is more than likely
that at some point

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.670
they will have a female present
for their consultations,

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.840
or for other health care
encounters that many of us

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.720
can agree we'd rather not have
someone of the opposite gender

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.300
in.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:04.800
OK.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.137
And so here we are.

00:31:06.137 --> 00:31:07.470
All I have for you is questions.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:08.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.402 --> 00:31:10.860
And what I want from you is
introspection and a willingness

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.260
to own what's yours to own.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.690
If we buy that
non-deaf people often

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.900
see us interpreters as
extensions of deaf people,

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.870
then how you see me as a female
may be helping or hindering

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.820
someone else's social
mobility, maybe

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.620
without you even realizing it.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.413
Thank you.

00:31:26.413 --> 00:31:38.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.390
- Yes.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.440
OK.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.140
So, my first comment
is for Rosa Lee.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.200
First of all, you should know
that Rosa Lee has the Rosa Lee

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:46.932
Show.

00:31:46.932 --> 00:31:48.390
And you should also
know that there

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.490
are a whole bunch
of videos online

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.830
of Rosa Lee doing
signed interpretation

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.850
of various songs.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.940
They're amazing, check them out.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.450
Rosa Lee.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:57.810
- Thank you.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:58.935
Thank you for that comment.

00:31:58.935 --> 00:32:00.420
- Yes.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.730
When you're in
situations where there's

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:07.050
mixed deaf and hearing groups
how do you claim your space?

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.860
- In what context, if I may?

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.382
So, space relating to--

00:32:17.382 --> 00:32:18.715
if you mind, give me an example?

00:32:18.715 --> 00:32:19.900
- Yeah.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.440
If it's a mixed group, there are
some individuals who are deaf,

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.570
some who are hearing,
some who are male,

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.540
some who are
female, how do you--

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.340
when you really want
to make a point--

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:35.844
how do you make sure that you
have the ground to communicate?

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.180
- Well, in my work as
an artist, my space,

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.130
my pallet is the stage.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:53.450
So using the platform in
itself, that is my space

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:56.150
and where I can express myself--

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.320
up here on stage.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.950
So allowing myself to
play along that spectrum,

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.680
again it could be politically
related, personally

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.290
related, a narrative or
an anecdote, world view.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.080
So using that space,
I'm able to control

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.224
the dialogue and the flow of
communication and information.

00:33:15.224 --> 00:33:17.160
- OK.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.850
Jackie, question for you.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.790
Last month I had the
opportunity to present

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.100
at a conference
of superintendents

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.230
of schools for the deaf.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.030
One of those
individuals was male.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.480
And when he followed up to see
who the interpreters would be

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.200
and the conference had hired
two female interpreters,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.450
he demanded that a male
interpreter be hired.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:42.670
And it became part of
the political discourse.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.010
He made the argument that
it was important for him

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.470
that his voice be
perceived in a way

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.178
that he felt
represented who he was.

00:33:50.178 --> 00:33:51.970
I just wonder if you
could reflect on that.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.780
I think it's very much
related to your talk.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.420
If you were to give advice
to others in that situation

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.020
or something.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.812
How would-- what might
you respond to that?

00:34:04.935 --> 00:34:07.310
- Sorry, I'm just having that
internal debate about which

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.960
language to choose again.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.170
How to respond.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.370
I think I wholeheartedly
support that decision.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.190
And in fact, in my work,
predominately with women--

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.318
other female interpreters--
and on the rare occasion--

00:34:19.318 --> 00:34:21.110
which by the way folks,
the fact that there

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.527
are two male interpreters as
part of the interpreting team

00:34:23.527 --> 00:34:25.680
is really screwing up
everything I just told you.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.617
I have nothing but respect
for my colleagues working.

00:34:29.617 --> 00:34:31.909
I appreciate them giving
their time today and, dammit--

00:34:34.037 --> 00:34:36.120
the truth is, though, that
more than likely you're

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.909
going to be working with
female interpreters.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.242
But on the rare occasion when
I do have a male colleague

00:34:40.242 --> 00:34:42.295
and we're at an event
where there is a deaf male,

00:34:42.295 --> 00:34:43.670
there have been
times in the past

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.968
where we have intentionally
assigned the male interpreter

00:34:47.968 --> 00:34:50.510
to make sure that he is always
interpreting into English when

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.760
that deaf man says anything.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.725
Because, based on experience,
it's harder to claim the floor.

00:34:55.725 --> 00:34:57.350
It's harder to
interrupt with my voice.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.880
People don't give
that deaf man--

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.520
regardless of his
position in the company--

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.860
which is interesting-- they
don't give him the space.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.620
So your question to Rosa
Lee about taking up space--

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.520
a man's voice.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.750
Honestly.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.860
And so-- it's true.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.350
It's very true.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.350
So-- oh yeah, please.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.060
- Yeah, if I could
piggyback on that.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.800
Marlee Matlin, you guys know the
well-known actress who's deaf,

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.320
she always has a male
interpreter with her.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.690
The reason is to remind people
that I am my own person.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.740
I'm my own individual.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.920
So sometimes you'll be
looking at her, Marlee,

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.170
and interacting with her,
but you have that male voice.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.160
And sometimes, if she's working
with a female interpreter,

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.837
then that kind of
blurs the line.

00:35:41.837 --> 00:35:43.670
And then they start
focusing and interacting

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.930
with the interpreter
and thinking

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.597
about the interpreting
process, and, oh,

00:35:46.597 --> 00:35:48.890
look at that beautiful
language, as opposed to actually

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:50.450
interacting with her directly.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.640
So she's always made sure
to have a male interpreter

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.320
work alongside her.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.780
So again, based on
context, whether it's

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.030
a presentation formally
in an academic setting

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.800
or what have you.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.300
- A friend who's
deaf was telling me

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.120
about other deaf
professionals she

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.870
knows who are men who
will, intentionally,

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.270
when they travel, request
female interpreters

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.830
to screw with the
audience and jar the ear.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.330
Right?

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.660
So you can manipulate it
in that way and use us--

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.960
whatever your goals are--

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.981
to accomplish.

00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:19.750
I think.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.480
- From the perspective of
both an individual who is deaf

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.810
and an individual who
does interpretation,

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:26.560
I wonder what your
thoughts are about ways

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.970
that we need to infuse
training to help interpreters

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.560
to become more aware of this?

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.890
And to help deaf individuals to
become more aware of how they

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.782
might request interpretation?

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.240
- OK.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.560
So see, that's my problem.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.100
Right?

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.373
Because if you look
anywhere in the literature,

00:36:46.373 --> 00:36:48.540
if you look at how we train
interpreters, especially

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.123
female interpreters,
it's, how can you

00:36:50.123 --> 00:36:52.620
be more assertive and more
dominant to take up the space

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.630
so that you can
placate the society

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.880
and let it continue
running status quo?

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.613
My question to you all, as
majority non-signing folks,

00:37:00.613 --> 00:37:02.280
is, what is your
responsibility in that?

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.520
Right?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.350
So I'm just going to
deflect that question

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.420
right back to you.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.850
We are training female
ASL interpreters

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.340
to do all of the things
that I just said and more.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:16.210
And I won't talk about what
we should be encouraging

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:20.130
the deaf community to
do, but my call to you

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.570
all is be a part of
that process too.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.070
Right?

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.445
If you're hiring an interpreter
to interpret an interview

00:37:25.445 --> 00:37:27.810
for an employee coming in,
or whatever ways you're

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.110
interacting with us, be
a part of that process.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.610
Find out who the interpreters
are ahead of time, set up time

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.920
to meet with them in advance,
check in with the deaf folks,

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.020
make sure that they are
satisfied with the services.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.520
All of that.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.560
I think everybody has to
be present in that process

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.450
and stop pretending
that we can just

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.110
blend into any sort of situation
and pick up right where you've

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.180
left off, even though
we're there for a day.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.388
We're there for an interview.

00:37:49.388 --> 00:37:51.070
We're there for just
a snapshot in time.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:54.102
We need to you to
take the lead on that.

00:37:54.102 --> 00:37:55.145
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:55.145 --> 00:37:56.020
Please and thank you.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.000
- Amen.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.350
I can just add a amen to that.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:00.850
- Yeah.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:09.820
I'm curious, Rosa Lee,
about the added demands

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:14.050
that you see being placed
on you in situations

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.150
like those interviews or
situations where you're

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.775
interacting with individuals who
are not familiar with deafness

00:38:18.775 --> 00:38:21.640
or deaf culture.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.770
Where do you see the
responsibility being

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:26.740
yours to educate, and where
do you see the line between it

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.352
really isn't you're
responsibility?

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.980
- For thoughts on that,
I think it would really

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.220
depend on the environment.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.800
When you're dealing in
a personal situation

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.380
where it is a
medical appointment,

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.540
I think it's medical
related, medical issues.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.300
I want to focus on that
information as opposed

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.210
to being an educator
in role at that time.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.320
I'm a patient.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.240
So for the patient
to then explain, oh,

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.300
this is the role
of the interpreter,

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.800
this is the role
of you as a doctor.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.580
No.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.750
You know, as opposed to,
in a different environment

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.710
or context, as an example,
like a IEP meeting.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.550
So in a K through
12 situation where

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.740
there might be an
opportunity there to explain

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.110
about the communication roles.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:18.440
And again, the objective is to
get the results that I want.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.010
So I have to kind
of walk that line.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.390
Again, just, what
the overall objective

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.670
is in working and
interacting with me.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:27.480
So sometimes it's an
educational roles,

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.960
sometimes an advocate
role, sometimes it's

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.970
me to step back and just be me.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.164
So it's like, hey, that's
your job, not mine.

00:39:35.164 --> 00:39:38.000
- Great.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.345
In line with Jackie's
comment around what can we

00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:41.720
do to be active
around that, I do

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.990
want to applaud Radcliffe
for inviting ASL interpreters

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:47.990
and having interpretation
at a lot of their events.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.135
And to reiterate,
both to Radcliffe,

00:39:50.135 --> 00:39:52.010
and then, any others
who are planning events,

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:54.770
that when you have that
available, it really does

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.810
increase the
likelihood, both of that

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.723
deaf individuals can come--

00:39:58.723 --> 00:40:00.890
sometimes people say, well
nobody's asked us for it.

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:02.973
But they might not know
that that's a possibility.

00:40:02.973 --> 00:40:05.498
So by arranging that and making
communication accessible,

00:40:05.498 --> 00:40:07.040
I think that's a
very important thing

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.510
that we can do to be proactive.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.550
And it also increases
visibility, and awareness,

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:17.240
and access in ways that
are really important.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.370
With that, I'm going to
open it up for questions.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.050
As others have
said, please join us

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:28.370
in the center to ask a question
and our speakers will respond.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.710
- Thank you so much for
helping me understand

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.670
the way that gender is
based on location in so much

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:35.420
of the signs.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:40.100
But I'm curious about the way
that gender accidentally works

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.900
its way into speech and sign.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.050
In the way that, kind of,
declarative statements

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:48.170
tend to be read as more a
kind of a male speech pattern,

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.330
and interrogative
statements tend

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.310
to be read as more of a
female speech pattern.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:55.130
I'm wondering, what
are the accidental tics

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:58.880
inside a sign that could
show unintentional ways that

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.270
gender has kind of
woven its way into sign?

00:41:08.937 --> 00:41:11.020
- It's going to get another
interpretation of that

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.687
because that is a
deep concept for sure.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.782
Jackie?

00:41:16.782 --> 00:41:19.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:24.110
- So one example,
and please, Rosa Lee,

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.110
correct me if I'm wrong.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:29.710
So the sign as we talked about
mother or father, mom or dad,

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:36.490
but now in the LGBTQ community,
any of non-binary individuals.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.070
So it's like mom, mom so
it's kind of like, all right,

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.390
how are we going to sign that?

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:44.680
Dad, dad, or in the
middle of those two

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.960
established locations?

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.740
So just as an example like that
that has that attributed to it.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.670
So, parents is signed like this.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.680
So if you had two
moms, then it's like,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.900
are you going to not go
up to the higher location

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.750
for that sign that
is indicating parent?

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:07.100
So also in this region
here, around your nose,

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.780
it's typically negative.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:13.590
Something that is
lousy, smells, stinks.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.150
Actually this is
a sign for penis,

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.920
since we were on that
topic today earlier.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.830
Just the nose.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:21.330
All right.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.910
Well, just, anyways, it's
not really a positive place.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:27.240
So it's just kind of
maybe around this region

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.740
or this location.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.620
So there has been some
discourse as far as

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.200
whether that is a positive
or negative attribute

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.100
of that location.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.475
But again, it's something that
is very fluid and evolving.

00:42:38.475 --> 00:42:40.350
And over time, we will
get to the right sign.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.210
So, definitely.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:47.940
- And if I could add just from
an interpreter perspective.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.570
I-- I'm sorry?

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:51.070
That's OK.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.360
- Just one moment
for the interpreter.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:52.860
Thanks.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.310
- I have one perspective
from the interpreting world.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:00.360
So in ASL, pronominalization
is gender neutral.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.780
And so, when you're an
interpreter working with a deaf

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.910
individual who's referring
to someone in space,

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.350
but they haven't told
you their gender--

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.060
they haven't told you
anything about them--

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.920
you as the interpreter then
have to make that decision.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.750
There are so many different
strategies we use.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:13.708
Sometimes we get our foot
caught in our mouths,

00:43:13.708 --> 00:43:16.130
where we assign a gender
to someone who we think,

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.320
and then we end up having
to backtrack and own

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.450
that error as well.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.900
But, specific to the language,
that shows up in our work

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.400
as well.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.980
- One interesting thing
about American Sign Language

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.430
is this right here, this
indication using as pronoun

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.330
is actually very neutral,
which works for an interpreter,

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.040
as Jackie just mentioned.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.180
And I could sign this and
be like, it was he, or she,

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.370
or this person told me,
or this person told me.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:46.688
So that's one example of
that neutral language.

00:43:46.688 --> 00:43:48.230
And that's more work
for you, Jackie.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.730
Sorry.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.684
Does that answer your question?

00:43:53.684 --> 00:43:55.360
- It's a little bit different.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.200
But it's OK--

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:59.340
- I guess what I mean
is, could you show us

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:04.075
the difference between the way
a man might sign something that

00:44:04.075 --> 00:44:06.600
shows more power
in the situation?

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.080
But it's not about the
words they're using,

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.850
it's about the way
the sign looks.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:17.090
With more certainty,
versus with more, kind of,

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:18.660
you know, questioning.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.360
Or lack of confidence
or something.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.640
Could you show us
the way that gender

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.100
might be embodied in
a particular sign that

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.950
might show the difference
between the way power

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:33.050
is encoded into the performance
of a particular sign?

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.300
- I would say with facial
expressions is probably

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.820
the parameter I would refer to.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.500
Eye gaze and glance.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.200
Like this, where your
eyes are looking downward.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:56.440
The use of hands
like this that is

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.380
indicating a status or class.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:04.450
Or as opposed to doing
this, ask her, or he.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:09.500
So again, that could then refer
again to a status in class.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.620
So location that way is
one way of indicating that.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.490
So there is a way
of inferring it.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:17.070
So there's a lot of -ists.

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.980
Oddist attitude,
racist attitude,

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.740
whatever the case may be
within the diverse community.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.870
As it is in society,
as diverse as it

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:30.450
is to indicate that status,
just by that range of height

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.830
and location.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:36.270
Also assign, also
being conveyed--

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:41.700
very small signing space or a
large signing space, like this.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.800
So those are other
ways within, again,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.960
how you morph along
those parameters.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.400
And slight changes can
indicate that power and control

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.945
and status as an example.

00:45:54.945 --> 00:45:57.700
Does that work for you?

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.200
All right.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:58.490
Great.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.590
- Next question please.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.320
- So interesting.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.800
I had a question about
the idea of seeing women

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.740
in positions of authority and
is there a corollary view?

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:15.630
I understand the idea of
the gendered interpretation

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:20.460
upon males, for instance,
having a female signer,

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.530
and that sexist interpretation
that's coming from the hearing

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.130
community.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:32.130
But is there a corollary
impact of boys growing up

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.320
seeing women in
authoritative positions

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.030
that actually empowers a kind
of more equal gender dynamic

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.875
within the deaf community?

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:49.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:52.040
- That's a new research
project for Jackie to take on.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:57.040
That is a great, great question.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.430
- So maybe I would
then counter that

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:04.860
and say, is the societal
view of sexist perspective,

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.760
is that paralleled in
the deaf community?

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.120
And I would say
that it is the same.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.540
So there is a -ist-- a sexist.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.540
So if you have that,
it doesn't really

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.340
matter if the person
is deaf or hearing,

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.220
whether that is impacted
in that dynamic.

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.910
Because the person is female,
or identifies as female, and is

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:26.960
Caucasian.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.430
Would that make
them less sexist?

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:29.390
I don't know.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:31.698
That could be a great
research topic though.

00:47:31.698 --> 00:47:33.740
- I can add, just from a
developmental psychology

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.980
perspective, that the idea for
young boys, elementary age,

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.650
for example, the way that
they connect with teachers

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.050
and paraprofessionals,
looking up to them

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:44.070
and feeling that connection
with their teacher.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.530
But we definitely see--

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.728
in a clinical view--

00:47:47.728 --> 00:47:49.520
adolescents, middle
school, high schoolers,

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.690
who then have to rely on that.

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:52.070
They think it is a
very different kind

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:52.980
of a relationship.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.140
So in part, it might be, here's
another nurturing person who

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.280
is involved in your
life, which can be great,

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.560
and a resistance to feeling--

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.350
to needing that later on.

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:03.850
- Thank you.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.158
- Mm-hmm.

00:48:06.158 --> 00:48:06.658
Yes.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.420
We need voice
interpretation please.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:17.510
- Oh I'm just asking you to come
up here so everyone can see.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:18.010
- Hi guys.

00:48:21.247 --> 00:48:23.205
I'm just going to kind
of throw this out there.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:34.690
So an event where you have, as
an example, Martin Luther King.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.170
There is an event with MLK Day.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.060
And then you have
an individual who's

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.070
assigned as the interpreter.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.810
How are they going
to handle that where

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:46.020
they're white, female, as
opposed to being someone

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.080
who is a person of color?

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.350
Now, how does that go as
far as the perspective

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.630
of assigning that person?

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:55.860
Is there an option?

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.620
And which one would you pick,
and which one should I pick?

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.890
Should it be the person who is
of color, just because they're

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:03.233
of color?

00:49:03.233 --> 00:49:04.650
Just kind of throw
that out there.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:06.570
And you might not
have a response,

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:10.810
but it might come down
to resource availability.

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.030
So just a thought about that?

00:49:17.437 --> 00:49:19.520
- I would say that in the
industry of interpreting

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.670
as a profession,
it's been terrible--

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.210
to be quite honest-- with
interpreters of color.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:29.620
And sometimes to say, hey, we
want to grow that population

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.100
and that demographic.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.830
But to really
actually proactively

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:37.430
go out to that community
as a professional--

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.040
as a profession-- we
haven't done that yet.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.680
And it's really-- it's overdue.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.420
It's past time.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.330
We hope that's something
that will take on.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:51.170
There is a grant, a
Project Klein, actually.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.410
And that is trying to increase
the working population

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:58.310
of interpreters of color
to do legal work as part

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.650
of their professional
development.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.680
You know, working
in courts, you never

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.270
think about, like,
OK, well, this

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:08.150
might not be fair for
how I'm representing.

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:11.060
And really thinking about--
it's supposed to be justice.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.210
It's justice within the justice
system, if you think about it.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.283
So it's a double
layer there as it is.

00:50:16.283 --> 00:50:18.200
So whether it's dealing
in the justice system,

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.020
or whether it's dealing in
the health care environment,

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:21.890
it's time.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:23.130
It's overdue for sure.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.850
And thank you for
bringing that up.

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.060
- Also, if I could
comment on that.

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:33.510
As far as manipulating the
results, if I could say,

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:36.690
as a black hearing
individual who's

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:42.010
speaking to an audience of
white or Caucasian individuals,

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:45.820
they would prefer to have
a white male interpreter.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:50.340
Because in that way,
there's a relatability

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.800
And see that common
ground, which

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.830
then triggers an allyship, which
then triggers active listening.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:00.410
So then you have
a black audience,

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:05.030
or having that opportunity
to have a person of color

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.850
in the audience, and then
having that same demographic

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:09.320
represented by the interpreter.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.010
So again, it does depend on
the result, and the objective,

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:14.665
and what you're looking for.

00:51:14.665 --> 00:51:16.040
So that would
impact the judgment

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.100
in the decision of whether you
were getting a person of color,

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:23.708
or a Caucasian, a male, or
female identifying interpreter.

00:51:23.708 --> 00:51:25.250
- I would add that
people like Jackie

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:29.420
are very conscientious of that
and the choice might sometimes

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.580
be, well, I'd prefer to
have another person do it,

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.130
but if it means there's going
to be no interpreter present,

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.880
I'll take the job.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.833
Yeah.

00:51:38.833 --> 00:51:39.500
- Next question.

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.040
- Yes.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:40.808
Go ahead.

00:51:40.808 --> 00:51:41.600
- Thank all of you.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.710
This is so wonderful.

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:44.210
All of you.

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:47.650
My question is about
getting older and using ASL.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:50.460
And I'm so impressed with
the physical vitality,

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:54.410
the manual dexterity this
beautiful language asks of you.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:56.510
But I'm trying to
imagine my mother who

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.455
has arthritis doing this.

00:51:58.455 --> 00:52:00.080
And so, it's sort of
me thinking about,

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.760
what happens as you get older?

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:07.380
Perhaps you lose a partner
who is also your interpreter?

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:11.180
And also curious, do you lose
words the same way that I'm

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.170
starting to lose words.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.628
You know, you're
reaching for them.

00:52:13.628 --> 00:52:16.330
I'm curious about the
process of aging with ASL.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:31.220
- As I mentioned, those
five fundamental parameters,

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.900
you can't live without those.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.240
So, you can't do it if you
don't have the hand shape.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.640
You can't convey the language.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.390
But, you have those
four other parameters.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:42.780
Would you be able to use
those to convey something?

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.400
If you do have
movement, you could

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.600
recognize there is movement.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.760
But without the
hand shape, it then

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.650
indicates something different.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:52.650
So trying to adjust.

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:55.290
As an example, my
grandfather is deaf.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:58.955
And he signs very low, like
this, in the signing space.

00:52:58.955 --> 00:53:00.330
And I'm trying to
understand him.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:01.580
I'm like, raise your hands up.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.810
He's signing so
low in that space.

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.770
But over time, I've
gotten used to him

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:12.870
and his mannerisms, his
use of space, location,

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:16.650
and I know what he's indicating.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:19.660
Sometimes there's some
guesswork involved, you know,

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.600
and I'm trying to like,
all right, I think

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.930
that's what you're saying.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.870
Which would be no
different than you

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.078
as you're interacting with
someone else who's hearing

00:53:27.078 --> 00:53:28.780
in the spoken language.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.947
So, I guess, trying to
convey that language.

00:53:31.947 --> 00:53:34.030
If you have a weakness in
one of those parameters,

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:35.738
the other parts of
those other parameters

00:53:35.738 --> 00:53:37.555
can then reinforce that.

00:53:37.555 --> 00:53:39.930
- I want to talk about the
practical implications of that

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:41.970
too, working as a
hearing interpreter--

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:44.760
non-deaf interpreter
with aging populations.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.100
Because so many of us have
come into this language

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.770
as second language
learners, we miss nuance.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.880
We are never going to be
100% native in what we do.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.520
Right?

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.910
And so, fortunately, we
have tandem colleagues

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.200
who are deaf themselves.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.698
Language professionals, who
we refer to as Certified Deaf

00:54:02.698 --> 00:54:05.240
Interpreters, who are going to
be these language specialists.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.573
Grew up in this world, visually
acquainted to the world.

00:54:07.573 --> 00:54:10.170
Just like these
aging individuals

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:12.840
you were mentioning,
who, for the arthritic

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.630
hands, who are missing
parameters, or what have you.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.940
They are going to work
with these individuals,

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.830
much like Rosa Lee
and her grandfather,

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:21.570
in a way that I, or
any of my colleagues,

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:23.190
will never be able to do.

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:24.690
And so we want to
see more and more

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:28.170
of these deaf professionals,
deaf interpreters.

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:30.638
That field needs to
expand exponentially

00:54:30.638 --> 00:54:33.180
to be able to serve the aging
population, especially the baby

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.380
boomers in however many years.

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.480
- We are over time, so
we will wrap up now.

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.520
