doctor or medical researcher and so you

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950
doctor or medical researcher and so you

so the cross-pollination of disciplines

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590
so the cross-pollination of disciplines
 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.450
so the cross-pollination of disciplines
is fundamental to truly revolutionary

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460

advances in our culture and so you can't

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
advances in our culture and so you can't
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.660
advances in our culture and so you can't
fund any one thing without the other

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670

lest you believe you are right on top of
 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.480
lest you believe you are right on top of
a solution when in fact you're
