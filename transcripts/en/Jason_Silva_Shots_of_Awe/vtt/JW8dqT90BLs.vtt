00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.072
You know, we talk a lot
about the nature of reality.

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:22.980
And we human beings,
we are a curious bunch.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.300
We want to look up God's skirt.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.660
And increasingly-- through
either our understanding

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.226
of quantum mechanics,
and all kinds

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:33.100
of new, exotic technologies
that are allowing

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.360
us to peer at the primary
building blocks of matter--

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.920
for whatever reason,
we're starting

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.540
to find some really weird stuff.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.930
Buckminster Fuller
perhaps had it right

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.150
when he said, "God is a verb."

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.790
There's an amazing,
amazing article

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.906
by Kevin Kelly called "The Fifth
and Sixth Discontinuities,"

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:54.405
where he essentially talks about
a series of discontinuities

00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:57.090
that have transformed the
context within which we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.220
understand ourselves
in the world.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.110
So we used to think
the Earth was flat.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.080
We used to think the Earth was
the center of the universe.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.880
We used to think all these
erroneous consensus realities

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.680
that we had agreed upon that
were smashed by science,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.026
transforming the way we
understood ourselves.

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:15.400
We used to think
we were separate

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.380
from the other animals.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.160
And then we realized that
we were descended from apes.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.430
And then it just keeps
getting weirded and weirder.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.220
Because now we're at the point
that through quantum physics,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.220
through things like
nanotechnology, what we're

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.790
starting to understand is that
at the most primary level,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.840
reality, matter
actually seems like it's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.260
made up of information.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.070
John Archibald Wheeler,
the quantum physicist,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.920
used to say that
it comes from bit.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.670
Bits, as in bits of
computer data, like data

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.240
comes before matter.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.720
Description precedes "it"ness.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.610
"The verbs are verbing
all by themselves,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.040
without a need to
introduce nouns,"

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.470
I believe was the quote.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.240
This idea that matter
acts, but there

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.980
are no actors acting
upon the action,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.125
the verbs are verbing all
by themselves without a need

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:08.840
to introduce nouns.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.110
Everything a signal,
everything is information.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.010
Perhaps there lies the
mystery of consciousness.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.520
But I just think it's
a fascinating idea.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.470
