00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.080
Technology will play potentially the role
just after the culture, the people, so the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.840
people have to have that will, they have to
have the interest, and technology is probably

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.779
the next leading indicator or the next leading
source that will lead change.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:34.630
The ideas behind biomass, the ideas behind
clean coal- a clean coal plant is pretty amazing.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.620
There are so many interesting advancements
happening in technology that are at the fringe

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.690
that are now being very funded.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.190
Just even in the past 18 months there's been
a massive shift.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.280
It's been happening for a long time.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.900
Vinod Khosla, John Doerr, Kleiner Perkins--
These are major investment VC houses, venture

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.250
capital houses, that have been funding this
so huge Google-esque or Google-size shift's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.830
about to happen in that area.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.830
The one that is most intriguing to me is all
the stuff happening kind of in the biomass

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.869
area.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:20.090
It's just really interesting, the idea that
we don't necessarily have to build more coal

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.909
plants, more effective pipes for electricity
to be flowing.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:33.639
The idea of an out-of-the-box solution that
is regionally based where people buy and consume

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:37.729
products and food and everything else and
then it all goes back in to the energy to

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.259
create energy, that's pretty radical.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.060
I like that.
