 PAUL SMURL: Technology is currently confusing our entire industry 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.970
 and has accelerated over the past few years - with a move 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.620
 from the traditional media and print based organization to one 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.329
 which is a global digital media organization. "The New York 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.450
 Times "is known for the highest quality 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.550
 journalism on earth. 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.190
 We have been in business for over 160 years. 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.670
 People who use our programs get deeper 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.220
 involved in the content therein. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.280
 They are more likely to return regularly, dig deeper 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.430
 and finally becoming subscribers. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.520
 KATE HARRIS: We launched our first Android program in 2010. 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.870
 So we were very early on that platform. 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 And since then, it's just been about growth. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.410
 And - over the past 2 years - it has exploded. 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.810
 To build a successful Android product, 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.740
 It is essential to have a team that really understands 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.980
 how the platform works, living for the platform, what 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.688
 obsessive about Android. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.920
 And we're very happy to have it at "The New York Times". 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.760
 Android makes it really easy to build apps 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.480
 intuitive to use. 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.730
 It's also easy as a program developer or publisher 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.480
 to build apps that use our own typography, the 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.940
 program like the "The New York Times." 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.500
 Integrated before our Play Billing, 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.330
 took our subscription process about two minutes. 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.090
 And we asked users for a series of forms 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.560
 to fill in, all on their phone. 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.240
 And now with Play Billing, because the user says 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.890
 credit card or their Paypal information associated with their account, 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.900
 can subscribe to "The New York Times" 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.280
 with two taps. 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.720
 Some of the typing features on Play Billing I love very much, 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.310
 is, one, that our local currency billing 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.370
 can be activated in more than 50 countries. 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.270
 And, two, it was very easy to add a free trial. 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.680
 With Play Invoicing we can increase 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.134
 125% in subscription conversion realized. 

00:01:45.134 --> 00:01:46.300
 PAUL SMURL: We did the sums. 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.720
 We looked at the benefit, in terms of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630
 incremental subscriptions will outweigh the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.550
 30% issue we pay to Google. 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.530
 And that is indeed the case. 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.990
 Android is an incredibly important platform for us. 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.370
 It's one of our fastest growing platforms. 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.810
 We consider our investment in Android as an essential one. 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 And with regard to our international growth ambitions, 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.220
 Android was a necessary investment for us. 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.970
