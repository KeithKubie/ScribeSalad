to share today so for the past couple

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340
to share today so for the past couple
 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.370
to share today so for the past couple
months we have been working on an

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380
months we have been working on an
 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.949
months we have been working on an
android sdk for pepper this is not the

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959
android sdk for pepper this is not the
 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.750
android sdk for pepper this is not the
first SDK we write because we've been

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760
first SDK we write because we've been
 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.280
first SDK we write because we've been
working on robots for more than 10 years

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290
working on robots for more than 10 years
 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.730
working on robots for more than 10 years
now but we thought and we wondered what

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740
now but we thought and we wondered what
 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.430
now but we thought and we wondered what
would be the best robotics SDK what

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
would be the best robotics SDK what
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.560
would be the best robotics SDK what
would make robots as accessible as any

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570
would make robots as accessible as any
 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.330
would make robots as accessible as any
other devices such as tablets and

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340
other devices such as tablets and
 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.800
other devices such as tablets and
smartphones and basically this is today

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810
smartphones and basically this is today
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.210
smartphones and basically this is today
we want to share our conclusions about

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220
we want to share our conclusions about
 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.580
we want to share our conclusions about
this and we want to show you have simple

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590
this and we want to show you have simple
 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.530
this and we want to show you have simple
robotics development can be for anybody

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540
robotics development can be for anybody
 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.750
robotics development can be for anybody
so as you may have already guessed our

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760
so as you may have already guessed our
 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.340
so as you may have already guessed our
SDK for pepper is an Android studio

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350
SDK for pepper is an Android studio
 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.030
SDK for pepper is an Android studio
plugin it is already available you can

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040
plugin it is already available you can
 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.050
plugin it is already available you can
download it it's online and basically

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060
download it it's online and basically
 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.900
download it it's online and basically
you can keep the same tools and the same

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910
you can keep the same tools and the same
 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.120
you can keep the same tools and the same
habits you have because we basically

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130
habits you have because we basically
 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.240
habits you have because we basically
kept we want to get the original Android

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250
kept we want to get the original Android
 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.050
kept we want to get the original Android
studio flow because we know you are

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060
studio flow because we know you are
 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.840
studio flow because we know you are
familiar with it and this is something

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850
familiar with it and this is something
 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.850
familiar with it and this is something
that we really wanted to be really we

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860
that we really wanted to be really we
 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.280
that we really wanted to be really we
didn't want to change it so what we did

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290
didn't want to change it so what we did
 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.770
didn't want to change it so what we did
is merely adding tools to the existing

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780
is merely adding tools to the existing
 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.110
is merely adding tools to the existing
environment tools for robots basically

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120
environment tools for robots basically
 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.420
environment tools for robots basically
doing your application is exactly the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430
doing your application is exactly the
 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.520
doing your application is exactly the
same way but we also provide api's so

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530
same way but we also provide api's so
 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.990
same way but we also provide api's so
that of course you can make the robot

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000
that of course you can make the robot
 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.330
that of course you can make the robot
move you can make it talk you can make

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340
move you can make it talk you can make
 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.310
move you can make it talk you can make
it interact you see what you would

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320
it interact you see what you would
 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.680
it interact you see what you would
expect from an SDK but more like

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690
expect from an SDK but more like
 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.200
expect from an SDK but more like
interesting tools such as animations so

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210
interesting tools such as animations so
 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.270
interesting tools such as animations so
you can use pre-existing animations that

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280
you can use pre-existing animations that
 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.630
you can use pre-existing animations that
we provide with the SDK and you can also

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640
we provide with the SDK and you can also
 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.580
we provide with the SDK and you can also
create your own we will get to that

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
create your own we will get to that
 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.840
create your own we will get to that
later and we also provide a chat editor

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850
later and we also provide a chat editor
 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.000
later and we also provide a chat editor
so that you can script very simple

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010
so that you can script very simple
 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.950
so that you can script very simple
interactions with the robot which is

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960
interactions with the robot which is
 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.480
interactions with the robot which is
voice commanded

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490
voice commanded
 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.700
voice commanded
and ass but not least the SDK also

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710
and ass but not least the SDK also
 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.120
and ass but not least the SDK also
provide simulated robots so that even if

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130
provide simulated robots so that even if
 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.250
provide simulated robots so that even if
you don't have a robot which is probably

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260
you don't have a robot which is probably
 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.930
you don't have a robot which is probably
already the case you can already start

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940
already the case you can already start
 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.250
already the case you can already start
developing your own robotics

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260
developing your own robotics
 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.100
developing your own robotics
applications the for the rest is the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110
applications the for the rest is the
 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.600
applications the for the rest is the
same so once your application is ready

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610
same so once your application is ready
 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.720
same so once your application is ready
you can create your pkg as usual and

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730
you can create your pkg as usual and
 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.100
you can create your pkg as usual and
maybe even publish them on the Play

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110
maybe even publish them on the Play
 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.910
maybe even publish them on the Play
Store so let's say we don't have so many

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920
Store so let's say we don't have so many
 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.740
Store so let's say we don't have so many
slides today because what I really want

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750
slides today because what I really want
 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:14.560
slides today because what I really want
to show you is the SDK itself

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570
 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.360
so on the left side you already know

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370
so on the left side you already know
 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.180
so on the left side you already know
this Android studio and in the upper

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190
this Android studio and in the upper
 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.380
this Android studio and in the upper
right corner we see Android emulator and

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390
right corner we see Android emulator and
 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.080
right corner we see Android emulator and
the last item is the robot view so the

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090
the last item is the robot view so the
 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.910
the last item is the robot view so the
robot view is basically a simulated

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920
robot view is basically a simulated
 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.520
robot view is basically a simulated
pepper and if you install the plug-in

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530
pepper and if you install the plug-in
 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.010
pepper and if you install the plug-in
for Android studio which would look

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020
for Android studio which would look
 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:44.280
for Android studio which would look
something like this

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290
 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.090
automatically you will have new features

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100
automatically you will have new features
 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.550
automatically you will have new features
added to Android studio to be used with

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560
added to Android studio to be used with
 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.870
added to Android studio to be used with
paper such as you will notice that there

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880
paper such as you will notice that there
 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.879
paper such as you will notice that there
are new buttons on the second line of

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889
are new buttons on the second line of
 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.400
are new buttons on the second line of
the toolbar here so the first one is

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410
the toolbar here so the first one is
 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.140
the toolbar here so the first one is
just to manage the SDK because you can

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150
just to manage the SDK because you can
 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.140
just to manage the SDK because you can
update them no more things and the

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150
update them no more things and the
 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.689
update them no more things and the
second one is to as I said oops so I can

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699
second one is to as I said oops so I can
 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.870
second one is to as I said oops so I can
restart it to start the emulator which

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880
restart it to start the emulator which
 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.340
restart it to start the emulator which
will automatically stop the tablet

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350
will automatically stop the tablet
 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.170
will automatically stop the tablet
emulator but also the simulated robot so

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180
emulator but also the simulated robot so
 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:25.300
emulator but also the simulated robot so
we have to wait a bit

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310
 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.879
and I said earlier that we support

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:27.889
and I said earlier that we support
 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.120
and I said earlier that we support
animation and also chat files and these

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.130
animation and also chat files and these
 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.220
animation and also chat files and these
are accessible as normal Android

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.230
are accessible as normal Android
 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.480
are accessible as normal Android
resources using this little menu so all

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490
resources using this little menu so all
 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.740
resources using this little menu so all
the tools we are providing out there and

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.750
the tools we are providing out there and
 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.970
the tools we are providing out there and
so you can create your boss application

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:42.980
so you can create your boss application
 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.820
so you can create your boss application
you can have animation timeline which I

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:45.830
you can have animation timeline which I
 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.590
you can have animation timeline which I
will show you a little bit later you can

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:47.600
will show you a little bit later you can
 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.510
will show you a little bit later you can
create chart topics or chat files and

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520
create chart topics or chat files and
 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.670
create chart topics or chat files and
also import animations because we

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680
also import animations because we
 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.700
also import animations because we
already provide a library with very nice

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:54.710
already provide a library with very nice
 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:03.790
already provide a library with very nice
and useful animations so maybe you can

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800
and useful animations so maybe you can
 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.480
and useful animations so maybe you can
start with a little coding because what

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.490
start with a little coding because what
 

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.730
start with a little coding because what
we wanted to do also is not to provide

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:09.740
we wanted to do also is not to provide
 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.090
we wanted to do also is not to provide
the same usual way API is work you know

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.100
the same usual way API is work you know
 

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.659
the same usual way API is work you know
with service and modules our design is

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:16.669
with service and modules our design is
 

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:20.110
with service and modules our design is
based on actions so what is an action an

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120
based on actions so what is an action an
 

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.330
based on actions so what is an action an
action is more like a task that you can

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:22.340
action is more like a task that you can
 

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.330
action is more like a task that you can
start and stop and it is it really

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:25.340
start and stop and it is it really
 

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.710
start and stop and it is it really
corresponds to something the robot is

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720
corresponds to something the robot is
 

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.680
corresponds to something the robot is
doing so for instance a window draws

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:29.690
doing so for instance a window draws
 

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.990
doing so for instance a window draws
widgets and a robot will perform actions

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000
widgets and a robot will perform actions
 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.880
widgets and a robot will perform actions
so when you create a task you can like

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:33.890
so when you create a task you can like
 

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.950
so when you create a task you can like
set some parameters and then execute the

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:35.960
set some parameters and then execute the
 

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.130
set some parameters and then execute the
task and of course you can do it

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:39.140
task and of course you can do it
 

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.079
task and of course you can do it
synchronously or asynchronously which is

00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:41.089
synchronously or asynchronously which is
 

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:44.440
synchronously or asynchronously which is
very important for Android and get

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.450
very important for Android and get
 

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.630
very important for Android and get
getting called back when the action is

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640
getting called back when the action is
 

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.079
getting called back when the action is
finished things like that so if I take a

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:50.089
finished things like that so if I take a
 

00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:52.030
finished things like that so if I take a
very simple example which would be like

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040
very simple example which would be like
 

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.100
very simple example which would be like
to make the robot say something it would

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.110
to make the robot say something it would
 

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:59.740
to make the robot say something it would
look like training a say object

00:08:59.740 --> 00:08:59.750
 

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:05.350
and then simply run it with the

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360
and then simply run it with the
 

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.690
and then simply run it with the
parameter so for instance this wouldn't

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:07.700
parameter so for instance this wouldn't
 

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:13.360
parameter so for instance this wouldn't
be hello world but in Ohio now I don't

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.370
be hello world but in Ohio now I don't
 

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.890
be hello world but in Ohio now I don't
offend so much time compiling and

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:14.900
offend so much time compiling and
 

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.970
offend so much time compiling and
deploying so we have already

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:15.980
deploying so we have already
 

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.110
deploying so we have already
pre-installed the sample on the robot so

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120
pre-installed the sample on the robot so
 

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.390
pre-installed the sample on the robot so
what you see on the screen would exactly

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:22.400
what you see on the screen would exactly
 

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.330
what you see on the screen would exactly
do this generally on very simple and the

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:28.340
do this generally on very simple and the
 

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:37.310
do this generally on very simple and the
robotics

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320
 

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.280
so I said that we provide no tools

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.290
so I said that we provide no tools
 

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.200
so I said that we provide no tools
because running an application is not

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:42.210
because running an application is not
 

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.090
because running an application is not
only about writing code for robots you

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100
only about writing code for robots you
 

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.010
only about writing code for robots you
have to care about a lot of other things

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.020
have to care about a lot of other things
 

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.230
have to care about a lot of other things
such as you know using the hardware

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240
such as you know using the hardware
 

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.480
such as you know using the hardware
because we have so many motors that you

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:50.490
because we have so many motors that you
 

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.040
because we have so many motors that you
really want the robot to do something

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.050
really want the robot to do something
 

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.750
really want the robot to do something
this is why we also have animations and

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760
this is why we also have animations and
 

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.830
this is why we also have animations and
our SDK allows you to use pre-existing

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:00.840
our SDK allows you to use pre-existing
 

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:07.100
our SDK allows you to use pre-existing
animations that our company is doing so

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.110
animations that our company is doing so
 

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.500
animations that our company is doing so
it provides four categories let's see

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:09.510
it provides four categories let's see
 

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.310
it provides four categories let's see
for instance action animals because it

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320
for instance action animals because it
 

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.310
for instance action animals because it
will come back later in the presentation

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320
will come back later in the presentation
 

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.870
will come back later in the presentation
let's say a gorilla animation so this

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880
let's say a gorilla animation so this
 

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.930
let's say a gorilla animation so this
animation you can see the preview you

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940
animation you can see the preview you
 

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.600
animation you can see the preview you
can exactly take it and import into your

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:26.610
can exactly take it and import into your
 

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.060
can exactly take it and import into your
project just as any normal Android

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.070
project just as any normal Android
 

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.230
project just as any normal Android
resource let me show you so we're happy

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240
resource let me show you so we're happy
 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.440
resource let me show you so we're happy
with this animation we selected and this

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:36.450
with this animation we selected and this
 

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.510
with this animation we selected and this
is automatically imported into the

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:38.520
is automatically imported into the
 

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.110
is automatically imported into the
resources you will see that the code

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120
resources you will see that the code
 

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.360
resources you will see that the code
window has changed to look like you are

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:47.370
window has changed to look like you are
 

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.100
window has changed to look like you are
probably familiar with that this is more

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.110
probably familiar with that this is more
 

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.370
probably familiar with that this is more
like a keyframe setup because you can

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380
like a keyframe setup because you can
 

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.640
like a keyframe setup because you can
edit those animations from the plugin so

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:55.650
edit those animations from the plugin so
 

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.580
edit those animations from the plugin so
if we look quickly here we have the

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:58.590
if we look quickly here we have the
 

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.530
if we look quickly here we have the
values of the joints so you know like

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540
values of the joints so you know like
 

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.060
values of the joints so you know like
different motors and we have the

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.070
different motors and we have the
 

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.330
different motors and we have the
positions for the shoulders and

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:06.340
positions for the shoulders and
 

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.630
positions for the shoulders and
so we can change it and sometimes it's

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:09.640
so we can change it and sometimes it's
 

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.150
so we can change it and sometimes it's
not enough to just set the angle because

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160
not enough to just set the angle because
 

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.760
not enough to just set the angle because
I could make like very you know jockey

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:14.770
I could make like very you know jockey
 

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.550
I could make like very you know jockey
animations so we also provide the more

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560
animations so we also provide the more
 

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.230
animations so we also provide the more
advanced mode for the people who really

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240
advanced mode for the people who really
 

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.100
advanced mode for the people who really
want to find you in their animations

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.110
want to find you in their animations
 

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.190
want to find you in their animations
which look like this so basically it's a

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200
which look like this so basically it's a
 

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.110
which look like this so basically it's a
nice way to set all the tangents of the

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.120
nice way to set all the tangents of the
 

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.940
nice way to set all the tangents of the
animations and to control how the

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:29.950
animations and to control how the
 

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.370
animations and to control how the
movement would you know how you would

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:32.380
movement would you know how you would
 

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.060
movement would you know how you would
get from position a to position B so if

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:36.070
get from position a to position B so if
 

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.120
get from position a to position B so if
I preview the animation on the emulator

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.130
 

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.079
this is the robot you know entering

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:43.089
this is the robot you know entering
 

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:45.180
this is the robot you know entering
something and what I didn't mention

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.190
something and what I didn't mention
 

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.740
something and what I didn't mention
earlier is we can also connect directly

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:46.750
earlier is we can also connect directly
 

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.880
earlier is we can also connect directly
to a physical robot it's just the same

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:49.890
to a physical robot it's just the same
 

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:54.690
to a physical robot it's just the same
so if I preview the animation let's say

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:54.700
so if I preview the animation let's say
 

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.460
so if I preview the animation let's say
I want to change the position of like

00:11:59.460 --> 00:11:59.470
I want to change the position of like
 

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.829
I want to change the position of like
the elbow role and you will see like the

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839
the elbow role and you will see like the
 

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:10.430
the elbow role and you will see like the
difference instantly

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440
 

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.619
well not-so-obvious we can see that the

00:12:12.619 --> 00:12:12.629
well not-so-obvious we can see that the
 

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:14.689
well not-so-obvious we can see that the
right arm of the robot is moving like in

00:12:14.689 --> 00:12:14.699
right arm of the robot is moving like in
 

00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:17.449
right arm of the robot is moving like in
a different way so all this can be like

00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459
a different way so all this can be like
 

00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:20.689
a different way so all this can be like
easily changed and customized and this

00:12:20.689 --> 00:12:20.699
easily changed and customized and this
 

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:22.400
easily changed and customized and this
is basically how we write the density

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:22.410
is basically how we write the density
 

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.600
is basically how we write the density
that you've seen at the beginning which

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:26.610
that you've seen at the beginning which
 

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.189
that you've seen at the beginning which
is more professional way of doing

00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199
is more professional way of doing
 

00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:31.699
is more professional way of doing
animations but again if you just want to

00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:31.709
animations but again if you just want to
 

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.139
animations but again if you just want to
have an application with a robot doing

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:33.149
have an application with a robot doing
 

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:34.879
have an application with a robot doing
the gorilla you just use the prices in

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:34.889
the gorilla you just use the prices in
 

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:36.530
the gorilla you just use the prices in
animations let me show you a couple

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:36.540
animations let me show you a couple
 

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:42.470
animations let me show you a couple
other ones

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480
 

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.509
so maybe animals are not so interested

00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519
so maybe animals are not so interested
 

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:46.340
so maybe animals are not so interested
interesting but when you write

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:46.350
interesting but when you write
 

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.600
interesting but when you write
applications and you want to have

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:47.610
applications and you want to have
 

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.940
applications and you want to have
interaction with a user you want to use

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:49.950
interaction with a user you want to use
 

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:55.300
interaction with a user you want to use
expressions like information

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:55.310
 

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:01.509
or exclamation and the words so hard you

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519
or exclamation and the words so hard you
 

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.610
or exclamation and the words so hard you
can have like more complete complicated

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:03.620
can have like more complete complicated
 

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.860
can have like more complete complicated
stuff like emotions so if you look at

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:05.870
stuff like emotions so if you look at
 

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.300
stuff like emotions so if you look at
positive you know like blowing kisses

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:09.310
positive you know like blowing kisses
 

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:18.660
positive you know like blowing kisses
because it's a nice application

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:18.670
 

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.910
yeah so this is it for animations and

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920
yeah so this is it for animations and
 

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.830
yeah so this is it for animations and
again this is like very important when

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:22.840
again this is like very important when
 

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.330
again this is like very important when
you write a robotic application because

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:24.340
you write a robotic application because
 

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.190
you write a robotic application because
you don't want only to display things on

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:26.200
you don't want only to display things on
 

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.530
you don't want only to display things on
a tablet you also want to have a robot

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:28.540
a tablet you also want to have a robot
 

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.300
a tablet you also want to have a robot
that moves and I can do like a lot more

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:30.310
that moves and I can do like a lot more
 

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:36.510
that moves and I can do like a lot more
things than just a normal device then it

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:36.520
things than just a normal device then it
 

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.160
things than just a normal device then it
works so nice if you can talk with your

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.170
works so nice if you can talk with your
 

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.290
works so nice if you can talk with your
robot so we've seen that yesterday

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:40.300
robot so we've seen that yesterday
 

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.150
robot so we've seen that yesterday
during the keynote vocal command is so

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160
during the keynote vocal command is so
 

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.450
during the keynote vocal command is so
important and interesting so we also

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:45.460
important and interesting so we also
 

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.720
important and interesting so we also
provide a way to write your own sequence

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:47.730
provide a way to write your own sequence
 

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.610
provide a way to write your own sequence
script little interactions with the

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:50.620
script little interactions with the
 

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.540
script little interactions with the
robot that we call chat files so I have

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:54.550
robot that we call chat files so I have
 

00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:03.160
robot that we call chat files so I have
a chat files already prepared here

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.170
 

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.680
so I will not go into the details of a

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:05.690
so I will not go into the details of a
 

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.440
so I will not go into the details of a
grandma but basically you can write

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:07.450
grandma but basically you can write
 

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.670
grandma but basically you can write
questions and depending on the answer to

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680
questions and depending on the answer to
 

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.110
questions and depending on the answer to
that question reacts differently and I

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120
that question reacts differently and I
 

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.800
that question reacts differently and I
will show you that on the emulator which

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:17.810
will show you that on the emulator which
 

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.720
will show you that on the emulator which
also prints out the application and

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:21.730
also prints out the application and
 

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.860
also prints out the application and
let's say you know you're working on the

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:23.870
let's say you know you're working on the
 

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.300
let's say you know you're working on the
plane or in the train or whatever and

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:25.310
plane or in the train or whatever and
 

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.560
plane or in the train or whatever and
you just want to test what you're doing

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:26.570
you just want to test what you're doing
 

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.860
you just want to test what you're doing
we provide the dialog view so here you

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:29.870
we provide the dialog view so here you
 

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.720
we provide the dialog view so here you
can type anything and directly discuss

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:31.730
can type anything and directly discuss
 

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.030
can type anything and directly discuss
with your robot this is exactly the same

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040
with your robot this is exactly the same
 

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.340
with your robot this is exactly the same
thing that would happen if you talk to

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:36.350
thing that would happen if you talk to
 

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.100
thing that would happen if you talk to
it is just you are feeding the text as

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.110
it is just you are feeding the text as
 

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:46.000
it is just you are feeding the text as
for the emulator so for instance hi you

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.010
for the emulator so for instance hi you
 

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.680
for the emulator so for instance hi you
like comics

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:49.690
 

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.070
yes we side are you on

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:53.080
yes we side are you on
 

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.860
yes we side are you on
Steve Rogers or Tony Stark let's Steve

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:57.870
Steve Rogers or Tony Stark let's Steve
 

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:04.150
Steve Rogers or Tony Stark let's Steve
and the robot is turning me

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160
 

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.620
so this quick example show you that it's

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:08.630
so this quick example show you that it's
 

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.560
so this quick example show you that it's
very easy to write your own sequences

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:11.570
very easy to write your own sequences
 

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.470
very easy to write your own sequences
and it can be very easy like this but

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480
and it can be very easy like this but
 

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.420
and it can be very easy like this but
you can quickly get more complicated

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:16.430
you can quickly get more complicated
 

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.480
you can quickly get more complicated
examples and also have reactions tied to

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:19.490
examples and also have reactions tied to
 

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.040
examples and also have reactions tied to
that so you know like selling things at

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.050
that so you know like selling things at
 

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.500
that so you know like selling things at
all which is more interesting digestion

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:23.510
all which is more interesting digestion
 

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:34.610
all which is more interesting digestion
or talking

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620
 

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.020
so all those tools again are directly

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.030
so all those tools again are directly
 

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.120
so all those tools again are directly
integrated into Android studio you don't

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.130
integrated into Android studio you don't
 

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.310
integrated into Android studio you don't
have to do anything else I just you know

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320
have to do anything else I just you know
 

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.520
have to do anything else I just you know
installing the plug-in and using them so

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:46.530
installing the plug-in and using them so
 

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.840
installing the plug-in and using them so
I showed the things separately let's

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:49.850
I showed the things separately let's
 

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.580
I showed the things separately let's
look at a more complicated example but I

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:52.590
look at a more complicated example but I
 

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.200
look at a more complicated example but I
don't really wanna spoil what he will do

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:54.210
don't really wanna spoil what he will do
 

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.460
don't really wanna spoil what he will do
so let's first start with the

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:55.470
so let's first start with the
 

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.110
so let's first start with the
application which is already on the

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120
application which is already on the
 

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.000
application which is already on the
robot and then I will show you how it's

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.010
robot and then I will show you how it's
 

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:07.490
robot and then I will show you how it's
written

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500
 

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:17.330
Zemo aiyo this is my waving animation

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:17.340
 

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:24.870
watch we move and speak at the same time

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880
 

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.610
hmm

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:30.620
 

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:37.060
let's say it again

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:37.070
 

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.740
this is my waving animation know

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:41.750
this is my waving animation know
 

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.160
this is my waving animation know
something in animation making robot talk

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.170
something in animation making robot talk
 

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.319
something in animation making robot talk
watch me move and speak at the same time

00:16:47.319 --> 00:16:47.329
watch me move and speak at the same time
 

00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:51.990
watch me move and speak at the same time
let's move and hopefully not fall

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000
 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:04.409
everything joke and you have the first

00:17:04.409 --> 00:17:04.419
everything joke and you have the first
 

00:17:04.419 --> 00:17:10.199
everything joke and you have the first
robotics elephant robotic joke ever

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:10.209
robotics elephant robotic joke ever
 

00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:12.880
robotics elephant robotic joke ever
so all this which is already looks

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:12.890
so all this which is already looks
 

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.679
so all this which is already looks
pretty cool I'm sure you you really want

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:14.689
pretty cool I'm sure you you really want
 

00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:17.110
pretty cool I'm sure you you really want
to try it and show it to people all

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120
to try it and show it to people all
 

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.150
to try it and show it to people all
right you already have more complex

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160
right you already have more complex
 

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.630
right you already have more complex
ideas I want to show you the code

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640
ideas I want to show you the code
 

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:34.320
ideas I want to show you the code
because it's not so complicated

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:34.330
 

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.390
so I will not go into more details about

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400
so I will not go into more details about
 

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.860
so I will not go into more details about
the oncreate you know we create the

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:37.870
the oncreate you know we create the
 

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.010
the oncreate you know we create the
activity and we carry it also a

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:41.020
activity and we carry it also a
 

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.170
activity and we carry it also a
different thread because for a few

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:43.180
different thread because for a few
 

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.060
different thread because for a few
statements you will see I want to block

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.070
statements you will see I want to block
 

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.190
statements you will see I want to block
and we don't want to stop the UI

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200
and we don't want to stop the UI
 

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.460
and we don't want to stop the UI
strategy so create a new thread and you

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.470
strategy so create a new thread and you
 

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.650
strategy so create a new thread and you
can see that there is a stock method

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:52.660
can see that there is a stock method
 

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.750
can see that there is a stock method
which is just underneath which will

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760
which is just underneath which will
 

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.580
which is just underneath which will
caught the wave method and a move method

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:56.590
caught the wave method and a move method
 

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:02.490
caught the wave method and a move method
let's look at the code of those so for

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:02.500
let's look at the code of those so for
 

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.890
let's look at the code of those so for
the wave the robot was saying this is my

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:04.900
the wave the robot was saying this is my
 

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.490
the wave the robot was saying this is my
waving animation and then waving so two

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:08.500
waving animation and then waving so two
 

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.710
waving animation and then waving so two
lines to make the robot talk you create

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720
lines to make the robot talk you create
 

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.540
lines to make the robot talk you create
the sea action and then you just run it

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:12.550
the sea action and then you just run it
 

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.720
the sea action and then you just run it
with the appropriate parameters and then

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:15.730
with the appropriate parameters and then
 

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.210
with the appropriate parameters and then
the animation what we did first was

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:18.220
the animation what we did first was
 

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.990
the animation what we did first was
actually to import the animation the

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000
actually to import the animation the
 

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.390
actually to import the animation the
elephant animation into the resource of

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400
elephant animation into the resource of
 

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.450
elephant animation into the resource of
the project and once it's done we can

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:30.460
the project and once it's done we can
 

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.180
the project and once it's done we can
just start the animation using run so

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:34.190
just start the animation using run so
 

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.970
just start the animation using run so
yeah maybe more details you can see the

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:36.980
yeah maybe more details you can see the
 

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.850
yeah maybe more details you can see the
line with zero animation I import I

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:39.860
line with zero animation I import I
 

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.920
line with zero animation I import I
create an animation from the resource

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:41.930
create an animation from the resource
 

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.450
create an animation from the resource
hello a zero zero one and then I can

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:46.460
hello a zero zero one and then I can
 

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.690
hello a zero zero one and then I can
just run the animate with the Hello

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:49.700
just run the animate with the Hello
 

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.460
just run the animate with the Hello
animation so if you want to start a

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:51.470
animation so if you want to start a
 

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.140
animation so if you want to start a
different animation we just need to make

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:53.150
different animation we just need to make
 

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.250
different animation we just need to make
another animation from resources and

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:56.260
another animation from resources and
 

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:02.960
another animation from resources and
just play it

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:02.970
 

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.749
now together robot move it's a bit more

00:19:05.749 --> 00:19:05.759
now together robot move it's a bit more
 

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:07.479
now together robot move it's a bit more
complicated but hopefully we provide

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:07.489
complicated but hopefully we provide
 

00:19:07.489 --> 00:19:11.529
complicated but hopefully we provide
better wrapper soon still a bit gullible

00:19:11.529 --> 00:19:11.539
better wrapper soon still a bit gullible
 

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:14.509
better wrapper soon still a bit gullible
what is important in that the robot is

00:19:14.509 --> 00:19:14.519
what is important in that the robot is
 

00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:17.779
what is important in that the robot is
in a 3d world the robot is moving and

00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:17.789
in a 3d world the robot is moving and
 

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:19.909
in a 3d world the robot is moving and
you are so moving so you need to get a

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919
you are so moving so you need to get a
 

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:22.369
you are so moving so you need to get a
good sense of where you are and where

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:22.379
good sense of where you are and where
 

00:19:22.379 --> 00:19:24.619
good sense of where you are and where
you go or where things are this is why

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:24.629
you go or where things are this is why
 

00:19:24.629 --> 00:19:27.019
you go or where things are this is why
we have what we call frames so you have

00:19:27.019 --> 00:19:27.029
we have what we call frames so you have
 

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:29.779
we have what we call frames so you have
the robot frame which basically is where

00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:29.789
the robot frame which basically is where
 

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:31.369
the robot frame which basically is where
the robot is and then you also have to

00:19:31.369 --> 00:19:31.379
the robot is and then you also have to
 

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.080
the robot is and then you also have to
define where you want to go so that's

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.090
define where you want to go so that's
 

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.940
define where you want to go so that's
why you can see that the few lines of

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:34.950
why you can see that the few lines of
 

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.629
why you can see that the few lines of
math to get moving correct but again

00:19:38.629 --> 00:19:38.639
math to get moving correct but again
 

00:19:38.639 --> 00:19:40.009
math to get moving correct but again
hopefully we want to make it simpler

00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:40.019
hopefully we want to make it simpler
 

00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:43.279
hopefully we want to make it simpler
soon so we will just set everything we

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:43.289
soon so we will just set everything we
 

00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:45.729
soon so we will just set everything we
want to do and set the target frame and

00:19:45.729 --> 00:19:45.739
want to do and set the target frame and
 

00:19:45.739 --> 00:19:49.239
want to do and set the target frame and
simply create a go to object here and

00:19:49.239 --> 00:19:49.249
simply create a go to object here and
 

00:19:49.249 --> 00:19:52.789
simply create a go to object here and
then run it and the robot will move one

00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799
then run it and the robot will move one
 

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:58.159
then run it and the robot will move one
meter so roughly

00:19:58.159 --> 00:19:58.169
 

00:19:58.169 --> 00:20:00.200
and then I don't know if you remember

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:00.210
and then I don't know if you remember
 

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.419
and then I don't know if you remember
but I touch the screen and you played

00:20:02.419 --> 00:20:02.429
but I touch the screen and you played
 

00:20:02.429 --> 00:20:06.649
but I touch the screen and you played
the elephant animation and play sound so

00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:06.659
the elephant animation and play sound so
 

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:08.299
the elephant animation and play sound so
this is basically we have a callback you

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:08.309
this is basically we have a callback you
 

00:20:08.309 --> 00:20:13.820
this is basically we have a callback you
know when I touch the the picture and so

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:13.830
know when I touch the the picture and so
 

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.320
know when I touch the the picture and so
you're probably already familiar with

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:15.330
you're probably already familiar with
 

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.330
you're probably already familiar with
the audio manager to just get the sound

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340
the audio manager to just get the sound
 

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.970
the audio manager to just get the sound
and play it and him animation again is

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:19.980
and play it and him animation again is
 

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.470
and play it and him animation again is
the one same thing you just create the

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480
the one same thing you just create the
 

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.779
the one same thing you just create the
animation from the resources and then

00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:23.789
animation from the resources and then
 

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:27.440
animation from the resources and then
you just play it so that's it like you

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:27.450
you just play it so that's it like you
 

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.360
you just play it so that's it like you
know very few lines if you remove out

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:29.370
know very few lines if you remove out
 

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.789
know very few lines if you remove out
the border plate code you can start

00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799
the border plate code you can start
 

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:33.409
the border plate code you can start
doing things that are very interesting

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419
doing things that are very interesting
 

00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:36.769
doing things that are very interesting
and you don't even need to know a lot

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:36.779
and you don't even need to know a lot
 

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:38.960
and you don't even need to know a lot
about the robot itself you just use the

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:38.970
about the robot itself you just use the
 

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.000
about the robot itself you just use the
api's because this is what we want you

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.010
api's because this is what we want you
 

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.490
api's because this is what we want you
to do we want to abstract everything on

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500
to do we want to abstract everything on
 

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.779
to do we want to abstract everything on
the robot side because it's a very

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:44.789
the robot side because it's a very
 

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:47.240
the robot side because it's a very
complex thing it's not only displayed

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:47.250
complex thing it's not only displayed
 

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.590
complex thing it's not only displayed
like there are many things to

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600
like there are many things to
 

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.930
like there are many things to
synchronize and resources we do want to

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940
synchronize and resources we do want to
 

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.460
synchronize and resources we do want to
have confliction these kind of things

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:52.470
have confliction these kind of things
 

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.289
have confliction these kind of things
and this is basically our job to give

00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299
and this is basically our job to give
 

00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:55.909
and this is basically our job to give
you the right api so that you don't have

00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919
you the right api so that you don't have
 

00:20:55.919 --> 00:21:03.820
you the right api so that you don't have
to care about these kind of things

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:03.830
 

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:08.650
so yeah I think it's about like 79th or

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:08.660
so yeah I think it's about like 79th or
 

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.590
so yeah I think it's about like 79th or
something and we have a pretty good

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600
something and we have a pretty good
 

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.140
something and we have a pretty good
animation so this is now just an example

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.150
animation so this is now just an example
 

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.730
animation so this is now just an example
to show you about the SDK but I think

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:18.740
to show you about the SDK but I think
 

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.710
to show you about the SDK but I think
it's not like very interesting and it

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720
it's not like very interesting and it
 

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.770
it's not like very interesting and it
doesn't give you like a good idea but

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:23.780
doesn't give you like a good idea but
 

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.960
doesn't give you like a good idea but
not very good ideas but we have better

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:25.970
not very good ideas but we have better
 

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.730
not very good ideas but we have better
things to show you that we've been

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:27.740
things to show you that we've been
 

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.210
things to show you that we've been
working on and we've prepared two very

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.220
working on and we've prepared two very
 

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.360
working on and we've prepared two very
interesting demos with Google using

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:34.370
interesting demos with Google using
 

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.960
interesting demos with Google using
Google technologies and we want to show

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:37.970
Google technologies and we want to show
 

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:43.030
Google technologies and we want to show
you those an aspect I would say is

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:43.040
you those an aspect I would say is
 

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.490
you those an aspect I would say is
better with the robot so we'll use the

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:45.500
better with the robot so we'll use the
 

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:59.019
better with the robot so we'll use the
physical robot instead of the emulator

00:21:59.019 --> 00:21:59.029
 

00:21:59.029 --> 00:22:05.060
thanks Lola so today we are going to

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.070
thanks Lola so today we are going to
 

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.750
thanks Lola so today we are going to
show that to you and other demos so

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760
show that to you and other demos so
 

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.620
show that to you and other demos so
first of all is showing the magic ahem

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:12.630
first of all is showing the magic ahem
 

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.440
first of all is showing the magic ahem
we call the magic n so it's kind of a

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:15.450
we call the magic n so it's kind of a
 

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.960
we call the magic n so it's kind of a
gesture recognition

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:16.970
gesture recognition
 

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:21.169
gesture recognition
so most of devices in the mobile one

00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:21.179
so most of devices in the mobile one
 

00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:24.230
so most of devices in the mobile one
that is still using that to D

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240
that is still using that to D
 

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.870
that is still using that to D
dimensional display so because the

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880
dimensional display so because the
 

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.399
dimensional display so because the
difference between the mobile devices

00:22:28.399 --> 00:22:28.409
difference between the mobile devices
 

00:22:28.409 --> 00:22:31.789
difference between the mobile devices
atom so this kind of a robot that this

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799
atom so this kind of a robot that this
 

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:34.810
atom so this kind of a robot that this
is this can be they express that any

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:34.820
is this can be they express that any
 

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.430
is this can be they express that any
reaction by using the three dimensional

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440
reaction by using the three dimensional
 

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.850
reaction by using the three dimensional
things so that would be the wonderful is

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860
things so that would be the wonderful is
 

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:46.129
things so that would be the wonderful is
impressive innovation for us so the

00:22:46.129 --> 00:22:46.139
impressive innovation for us so the
 

00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:49.039
impressive innovation for us so the
other one is we are going to show that

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:49.049
other one is we are going to show that
 

00:22:49.049 --> 00:22:52.789
other one is we are going to show that
the tell presence today then so Roland

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799
the tell presence today then so Roland
 

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:54.740
the tell presence today then so Roland
can you show us that there are first

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:54.750
can you show us that there are first
 

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.129
can you show us that there are first
round for that the magic hand yes so we

00:22:58.129 --> 00:22:58.139
round for that the magic hand yes so we
 

00:22:58.139 --> 00:22:59.990
round for that the magic hand yes so we
built a demo using tensor flow that

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000
built a demo using tensor flow that
 

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.639
built a demo using tensor flow that
you're probably familiar with and we

00:23:03.639 --> 00:23:03.649
you're probably familiar with and we
 

00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:09.740
you're probably familiar with and we
wanted to use

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:09.750
 

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.200
sorry we wanted to use this really

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.210
sorry we wanted to use this really
 

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.360
sorry we wanted to use this really
starting encampment so we have to

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:14.370
starting encampment so we have to
 

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:17.630
starting encampment so we have to
translate here let's see the robot let's

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640
translate here let's see the robot let's
 

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.430
translate here let's see the robot let's
see a good sense of is a very strange

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440
see a good sense of is a very strange
 

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.240
see a good sense of is a very strange
obstacles like feet and mochi watching

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:23.250
obstacles like feet and mochi watching
 

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.840
obstacles like feet and mochi watching
panicked so this is not for your game

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:26.850
panicked so this is not for your game
 

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.850
panicked so this is not for your game
that's like a proof of concept using

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860
that's like a proof of concept using
 

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.680
that's like a proof of concept using
tensor flow it sure looks the idea is to

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:33.690
tensor flow it sure looks the idea is to
 

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.800
tensor flow it sure looks the idea is to
detect some shape of my house

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:36.810
detect some shape of my house
 

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.320
detect some shape of my house
the magic signs to work you need to

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:39.330
the magic signs to work you need to
 

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.540
the magic signs to work you need to
first put me under your control using

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:41.550
first put me under your control using
 

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.390
first put me under your control using
the spell starter sign the magic book

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400
the spell starter sign the magic book
 

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.130
the spell starter sign the magic book
says to hold up your right hand towards

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140
says to hold up your right hand towards
 

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.340
says to hold up your right hand towards
me just like on my chest display hold it

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:49.350
me just like on my chest display hold it
 

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.680
me just like on my chest display hold it
for three seconds so the robots wants me

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:51.690
for three seconds so the robots wants me
 

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.270
for three seconds so the robots wants me
to do this for two seconds so that you

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:53.280
to do this for two seconds so that you
 

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.590
to do this for two seconds so that you
know it's enchanted

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600
know it's enchanted
 

00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:10.890
know it's enchanted
it's like it the culture of the robot

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:10.900
 

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.260
make sure you're using your right hand

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:13.270
make sure you're using your right hand
 

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:22.890
make sure you're using your right hand
and holding it in front of you so it's

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:22.900
and holding it in front of you so it's
 

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.740
and holding it in front of you so it's
supposed to see my hand and detect the

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:25.750
supposed to see my hand and detect the
 

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:30.330
supposed to see my hand and detect the
shape

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:30.340
 

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:39.970
so

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:39.980
 

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.290
let's see if you can cast some

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:42.300
let's see if you can cast some
 

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.660
let's see if you can cast some
higher-level settings in the robot makes

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:44.670
higher-level settings in the robot makes
 

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.180
higher-level settings in the robot makes
try tilting your hair to the right like

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:47.190
try tilting your hair to the right like
 

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.049
try tilting your hair to the right like
this so the robots now want me to do

00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059
this so the robots now want me to do
 

00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:58.040
this so the robots now want me to do
something like this so

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.050
 

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.410
make sure you're using your right hand

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:00.420
make sure you're using your right hand
 

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.430
make sure you're using your right hand
and holding it in front of you you did

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440
and holding it in front of you you did
 

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.680
and holding it in front of you you did
it now try the same sign but to the

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:06.690
it now try the same sign but to the
 

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:18.030
it now try the same sign but to the
opposite side like this

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:18.040
 

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.400

and holding it in front of you amazing
maybe you should fix that Iranian cells

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.200
maybe you should fix that Iranian cells
 

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.670
maybe you should fix that Iranian cells
in this environment but very talented

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:35.680
in this environment but very talented
 

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.410
in this environment but very talented
wizard thank you

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:37.420
wizard thank you
 

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.420
wizard thank you
I haven't seen hands this magic since

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:39.430
I haven't seen hands this magic since
 

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.860
I haven't seen hands this magic since
the last night is that it might not

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:40.870
the last night is that it might not
 

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.500
the last night is that it might not
seems let's see if you can master some

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:43.510
seems let's see if you can master some
 

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:47.340
seems let's see if you can master some
other magic signs first put me under

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:47.350
other magic signs first put me under
 

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.870
other magic signs first put me under
your spell again whether the spell

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880
your spell again whether the spell
 

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:57.870
your spell again whether the spell
starter sign so this is a very

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880
starter sign so this is a very
 

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.160
starter sign so this is a very
interesting example because you know

00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.170
interesting example because you know
 

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.990
interesting example because you know
with like very few things using

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000
with like very few things using
 

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.940
with like very few things using
tensorflow and some learning you can

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:02.950
tensorflow and some learning you can
 

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.120
tensorflow and some learning you can
have a very interesting product with

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.130
have a very interesting product with
 

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.370
have a very interesting product with
applications in real life because if we

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:08.380
applications in real life because if we
 

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.140
applications in real life because if we
have this then we can easily have things

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:10.150
have this then we can easily have things
 

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.900
have this then we can easily have things
like pepper understanding sign languages

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:12.910
like pepper understanding sign languages
 

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.330
like pepper understanding sign languages
for instance and maybe someday because

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:15.340
for instance and maybe someday because
 

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.860
for instance and maybe someday because
right now it's probably difficult for

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:16.870
right now it's probably difficult for
 

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.660
right now it's probably difficult for
him but we could also have the robots

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:18.670
him but we could also have the robots
 

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.180
him but we could also have the robots
talking back so it would support a

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:21.190
talking back so it would support a
 

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.470
talking back so it would support a
different class of languages and

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480
different class of languages and
 

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.300
different class of languages and
translations which would be I think

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:24.310
translations which would be I think
 

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.350
translations which would be I think
pretty cool so yeah this is using tons

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360
pretty cool so yeah this is using tons
 

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.830
pretty cool so yeah this is using tons
of flow and we also have another like

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840
of flow and we also have another like
 

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.290
of flow and we also have another like
very interesting example using other

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:34.300
very interesting example using other
 

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:41.570
very interesting example using other
technologies so I will show you

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580
 

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:46.860
starting a pepper tree organs let's see

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:46.870
starting a pepper tree organs let's see
 

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.840
starting a pepper tree organs let's see
just a second

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:48.850
just a second
 

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:57.769
just a second
our obligation I found it is the dance

00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779
 

00:26:57.779 --> 00:27:05.280
starting pepper telepresence

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:05.290
 

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.680
so is so there's something in the

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:07.690
so is so there's something in the
 

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:11.940
so is so there's something in the
trouble then so so next lemma is a

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:11.950
trouble then so so next lemma is a
 

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.970
trouble then so so next lemma is a
presence then you may have already

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:14.980
presence then you may have already
 

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.480
presence then you may have already
having that card about the stem we are

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:18.490
having that card about the stem we are
 

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.370
having that card about the stem we are
going to use the cold water demo with

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:20.380
going to use the cold water demo with
 

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.289
going to use the cold water demo with
the papers pepper has be a PPO and also

00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:25.299
the papers pepper has be a PPO and also
 

00:27:25.299 --> 00:27:27.780
the papers pepper has be a PPO and also
that another branch of a sensor in that

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:27.790
that another branch of a sensor in that
 

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:31.169
that another branch of a sensor in that
robot then we are using that video and

00:27:31.169 --> 00:27:31.179
robot then we are using that video and
 

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:34.080
robot then we are using that video and
also the mic and they're also sending to

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.090
also the mic and they're also sending to
 

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:36.480
also the mic and they're also sending to
that at those data tree that mobile

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:36.490
that at those data tree that mobile
 

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.640
that at those data tree that mobile
devices you can see that's the

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:38.650
devices you can see that's the
 

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.340
devices you can see that's the
everything by through the accountable by

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:41.350
everything by through the accountable by
 

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.740
everything by through the accountable by
using that mobile devices and Carla mode

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:43.750
using that mobile devices and Carla mode
 

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.200
using that mobile devices and Carla mode
then if you are putting into data paper

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.210
then if you are putting into data paper
 

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.780
then if you are putting into data paper
to that your house then you can only

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:48.790
to that your house then you can only
 

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:52.500
to that your house then you can only
motor be seeing to that so stay there so

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:52.510
motor be seeing to that so stay there so
 

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.820

we are using car bomb

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:07.780
we are using car bomb
 

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:14.010
we are using car bomb
oh and so it's not a really nice

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.020
oh and so it's not a really nice
 

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.890
oh and so it's not a really nice
environment but what is what would be

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:16.900
environment but what is what would be
 

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.020
environment but what is what would be
great is actually that when I'm speaking

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.030
great is actually that when I'm speaking
 

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.580
great is actually that when I'm speaking
the sound also comes out from the

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:20.590
the sound also comes out from the
 

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:25.380
the sound also comes out from the
microphones so I could be with Michael

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:25.390
microphones so I could be with Michael
 

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:33.110
microphones so I could be with Michael
Michael Ball

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120
 

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.970
but this is like a very interesting to

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980
but this is like a very interesting to
 

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.369
but this is like a very interesting to
represents this case because now I feel

00:28:37.369 --> 00:28:37.379
represents this case because now I feel
 

00:28:37.379 --> 00:28:42.340
represents this case because now I feel
like I'm the robots which is a bit weird

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:42.350
like I'm the robots which is a bit weird
 

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.700
like I'm the robots which is a bit weird
and this is also this is a very simple

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:46.710
and this is also this is a very simple
 

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.350
and this is also this is a very simple
application we are just using Google

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360
application we are just using Google
 

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.470
application we are just using Google
technologies and simply putting things

cool application and then go through the

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:21.990
cool application and then go through the
 

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.570
cool application and then go through the
Google parade and uploading to the

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580
Google parade and uploading to the
 

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.450
Google parade and uploading to the
Google Play so that would be created

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.460
Google Play so that would be created
 

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.590
Google Play so that would be created
another ecosystem in the world so you
