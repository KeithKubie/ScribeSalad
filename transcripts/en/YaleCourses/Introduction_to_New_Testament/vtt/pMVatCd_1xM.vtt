1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.470
The situation with Paul's Church in Corinth is very different from the situation

2
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.290
we saw in first Thessalonians.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400
First Thessalonians shows us a church that is new in its infancy,

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.540
is just been founded.
First Corinthians shows us a church of,

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.580
and it's sort of adolescent period.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.880
They've had some growing pains and they've got some problems,

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.210
but you can tell that they're not all brand new Christians.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.770
Look at first Corinthians 15.
Take your bibles out.

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.610
Remember,
you have to follow along.

10
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.680
First Corinthians 15,

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.140
this is when Paul is addressing the issue of the resurrection of the body.
Uh,

12
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.060
so early Christian groups wrestled with the kind of question,
uh,

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.880
that people sometimes still do,
which is what happens to you and you're dead.

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.210
Are you dead like rover in dead all over our,

15
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:04.320
does your soul go off to some of the place art as some part of you get

16
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:09.060
reincarnated into somebody else's body or in the Orthodox Christian,

17
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
uh,
confessions,
you confessed the resurrection of the body at the end of time,

18
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.520
at the end of this worldly time.
So Christians,
we're dealing with this stuff.

19
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.940
Paul has to address this question in First Corinthians 15 because there's some

20
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:24.540
confusion or some debate in the church there.
So read along with me.

21
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:27.480
First Corinthians 15 verse 20 we're going to skip around a bit,

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.560
but I'm going to cover a lot of,
uh,

23
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.940
cover a lot of ground in this lecture.

24
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.970
So you need to really follow along in the text as best you can so you don't get

25
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
too confused was where I am first going.
Use 15 verse 20,
in fact.

26
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.000
But in fact,
Christ has been raised from the dead.

27
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.770
The first fruits of those who have died for since death came through a human

28
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:54.060
being.
The resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being for all,

29
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.410
for as all die in Adam.
So all will be made alive in Christ,

30
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.260
but each in his own order,

31
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.020
Christ the first fruits than it is coming.

32
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.990
Those who belong to Christ then comes the end.

33
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.150
When he hands over the kingdom to God,
the father,

34
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.360
after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and every power.

35
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.290
So notice the resurrection of Jesus.
For Paul,
this is gonna be very important.

36
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.940
The resurrection of Jesus for Paul is not different in kind from the

37
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.760
resurrection that Christians can expect.

38
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.040
So the resurrection of Christians bodies will be just like the resurrection of

39
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.050
Jesus,
his body in kind.

40
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.430
That's important because a whole lot of people think that what Jesus experienced

41
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:36.360
in some kind of rent what they,

42
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.660
what early critically about Jews was something very different from what uh,

43
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.660
they confess about Christians.
But for Paul,

44
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.100
they're the same kind of resurrection.

45
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.880
That's why just because Christ's resurrection,
the first fruits,

46
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.130
it's just the first apple on the tree.

47
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.280
It just lets you know that harvest time is now here,

48
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.400
but it's just the first apple.
You'll have lots of other apples.

49
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.480
So that's the first.

50
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.730
Christ's resurrection is the first fruits and then he'll do it.

51
00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:02.564
Have there been time he,

52
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.430
there's a big war type thing and then Christ defeats all the rulers and the

53
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:09.280
authorities and powers on the earth and hands over the kingdom.

54
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.930
Verse 25 for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet for

55
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.060
the last enemy to be destroyed is death.

56
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.063
<v 1>Oh,</v>

57
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.810
<v 0>okay.
That's good enough for that point.</v>

58
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.110
But now skip down to verse 35 see what happens is that some people in in Corinth

59
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.040
are,
are questioning this now,
what are they question?

60
00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:34.770
Are they saying that people don't live forever at all or that there is no

61
00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:37.230
afterlife experience?
It looks like not,

62
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:39.420
it looks like what they're really questioning is simply the resurrection of the

63
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:40.440
body idea.

64
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.140
Because of course they're saying they might be thinking like a lot of people in

65
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:44.330
the ancient world,
there were other,

66
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.670
lots of Jews believed in the resurrection of the body.
And so it was uh,

67
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.720
an idea that was not unknown to people but think they,

68
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.490
they people in the ancient world also objective by saying,
yeah,

69
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:55.220
but how is that possible?
I mean,
the bar,

70
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.360
we all know the body rots when you put it in the ground.

71
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.560
It just decomposes and it just comes all a little molecules of other things and

72
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.210
how to,
and then that is,
you know,
it grows into trees and other grass,

73
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:09.810
the molecules,
my dead body become recycled in the universe.

74
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.790
The ancient people knew this.
They would even say,

75
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.650
what about sailors who are lost at sea and fish eat their bodies and then other

76
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:20.030
fish eat those bodies of those fish and then other fish eat those bodies of

77
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:20.610
those fish.

78
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.660
And then maybe one of those fish gets caught and you eat that body you met,

79
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:29.010
you had sort of little pieces of Fred,
the sailor,
you know in your body.
How,

80
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.190
how's God going to pull all that stuff together and resurrect that body?

81
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.860
So this was a debate that people in ancient Rome had to,

82
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.690
apparently some of the people in Corinth,
they're having the same kind of idea.

83
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.700
How is this possible?
So Paul addresses that.
Someone will ask,

84
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.390
how are the dead raised with what kind of body do they come fool?

85
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.523
<v 1>Okay,</v>

86
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.290
<v 0>since what says,
I started following along,
fool,</v>

87
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.670
what you saw does not come to life unless it dies.
And that's for what you sow.

88
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.260
You do not sow the body that is to be,

89
00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:02.720
but a bare seed perhaps of wheat or of some other grain,

90
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.520
but God gives it a body as he is chosen and to each kind of seed it's own body.

91
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.340
Just like a seed goes into the ground,

92
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:12.930
what comes up as a flower or a plant doesn't look like the seed.

93
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.610
It's not even necessarily all the same.
Complete stuff is new stuff,

94
00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:18.050
but it's still continuous with it.

95
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.950
Not all flushes or like there was one flesh for human beings,

96
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.180
another for animals,

97
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.720
another for birds and another for fish and notice that's in kind of a hierarchy

98
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:31.370
there of beings,
animals or humans or are higher than animals.

99
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.130
Animals are higher than birds.
Birds are higher than fish.

100
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.400
On this kind of ontological scale of different kinds of bodies that Paul is

101
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:40.250
working with him here.
This is a common assumption in the ancient world also,

102
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.870
there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies.
What our earthly bodies,

103
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.680
hours,
this dogs,
cats,

104
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.250
everything that everything's a body that's that physical for these people.

105
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.390
What are the earth?
What are the heavenly bodies,
the sun,
the moon,
and the stars.

106
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.360
They,
all these things are themselves in ancient ideas.

107
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.320
Bodies that simply actually are fixed into kind of a dome.

108
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.790
That's the sky and they travel around on that dome.
So the earth,
the this,

109
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.370
all these things in the in the sky are also bodies.

110
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.970
The glory of the heavenly is one thing that of the earth he has another.

111
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.670
There is one glory for the sun,
another glory for the Moon,

112
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.230
another glory for the stars.
Indeed star differs from star in glory.
Again,

113
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.840
a hierarchy of different kinds of bodies,

114
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.690
so it is with the resurrection of the dead.
What is sown is perishable.

115
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.010
What is raised is imperishable.
It is sown in dishonor.
It is raised in glory.

116
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.910
It is sown in weakness.
It is raised in power.
It is sown.

117
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.220
Now here you get into a translation problem.

118
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.810
My translations here says in verse 44 it is sown a physical body.

119
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.190
It is raised a spiritual body.

120
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.250
Does anybody translation have something different at that verse

121
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.780
is sown a natural body and it is raised in a spiritual body?

122
00:06:57.781 --> 00:07:01.580
Is that what it says?
It's anybody else have a different translation for those,

123
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.940
the problem is the word translated physical here is not really the Greek word

124
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.060
physical.
There is a Greek word physical.
What's trendy?

125
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.650
What's what they're talking about here is what is sown is a psychic,

126
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.160
a body made of soup coasts.
The Greek word for soul.

127
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.480
What stone is a soul ish body is what he's talking about.
It's a,
it's a,

128
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.430
it's a heavy,
it's a denser kind of body and what is raised is a spiritual body,

129
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.720
but whereas in the modern world,

130
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:32.390
we tend to think spiritual is something that's in material.

131
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.540
Spiritual means not matter.
It's invisible.

132
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.250
It's something that doesn't exist as matter.

133
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.490
That's not what [inaudible] means in the ancient world.
In the ancient world,

134
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.260
Kanuma is like is a stuff,

135
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.140
it's like what Arabs made it of when the wind blows around,
that's punch Luma

136
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.200
going on.
When you take in breath,
you're taking in a form of Panola.

137
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.880
That Greek word Sonoma does refer in the ancient world to some kind of stuff.

138
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.650
It doesn't refer to in material substance as it does later in Christian theology

139
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.740
or in some philosophies.
So what Paul,

140
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.820
the translation here is misleading because what Paula says is when your body is

141
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.230
put into the ground,
when you're dead,

142
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.520
what's put in there is sort of a psychic body.
It's a body that carries life.

143
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.000
Sure.

144
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.180
Cause that's what psychic means for in the ancient Greek word is it's a lot.

145
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.450
It's a living body,
but it is more like something that,

146
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.700
it's a natural but he's kind of the body that you're just given with naturally.

147
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.720
But what is raised is going to be ready to say a pneumatic body,

148
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:32.330
but now a pneumatic body.
So it's not the same thing as it was put in the ground.

149
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.300
It's raised a pneumatic body,
but it's still some kind of stuff.

150
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.340
If there is a physical body there I was also a spiritual body,
a pneumatic body.

151
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.271
Thus it is written.

152
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:45.320
The first man Adam became a living being the last Adam became a life giving

153
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.370
Kanuma but it is not the [inaudible] that is first.

154
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.850
But the psychic and then the Kanuma.

155
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.570
The first man was from the earth,
a man of dust.
The second man is from heaven.

156
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.070
Notice that he talked about heavenly bodies earlier and he says the resurrected

157
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:04.350
body is going to be a heavenly body.
Also,

158
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.540
this indicates that in the end a lot of ancient thought,

159
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.500
they thought that the sun and the moon and the stars were themselves pneumatic

160
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.740
bodies.
They were bodies made of this stuff of Numa

161
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.180
as was the man of dust or are those from the dust as of the man of heaven.

162
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:20.940
So are those from heaven.
Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust,

163
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:24.030
we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.
What I'm saying,

164
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:28.590
brothers is this flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,

165
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.040
nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable flesh and blood cannot inherit

166
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:35.760
the Kingdom of God.

167
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.520
Notice what he's saying is that the resurrected body that he is expecting is not

168
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.200
a flesh and blood body.

169
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.620
So when Paul is thinking about however the resurrection of Christ happened,

170
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.400
he doesn't imagine it as the very same flesh and bud.

171
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.850
It's not like it is in the movies where the various same flesh and blood of the

172
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.360
dead,
Jesus' body somehow resuscitates and walks out of the tomb.

173
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.210
That's how people popularly imagined it.
That must not have.

174
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:06.390
And that's how it clearly some already early Christians thought of it.
You can.

175
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.960
Some early Christians thought precisely that it was the,

176
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.730
the flesh and blood body of Jesus that got up and walked out of the tomb.

177
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.410
Paul must not have thought that because he says the body that we will as

178
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:16.921
Christians,

179
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:20.280
as followers of Christ have when we are resurrected is a pneumatic body,

180
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.490
not a flesh and blood body.
It's still a physical body.

181
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.070
And Paul since cause he believes it per numa is matter.

182
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.690
So what would be raised is this pneumatic body.
Now the reason why,

183
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.050
so why is Paul getting into all this?
For one thing,
it shows,
like I said,

184
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.450
this is a church that's not totally infant church,

185
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:38.100
but it's also an adolescent church.

186
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:43.370
These are people who have some much more exposure to Paul's teaching and to the

187
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:46.980
Gospel and different Christian ideas.

188
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.930
Then say the Thessaloniki and Christians did.

189
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.640
But they're still very confused about a lot of things that Paul seems to be

190
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.790
quite certain about.
So apparently some of these people in this church,

191
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.340
they had heard this teaching about the resurrection of the body.

192
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.230
So apparently they've heard this already.

193
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.410
They're not like the Thessaloniki and who just don't seem to know that

194
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:07.920
anything's going to happen to their brothers and sisters after their death.

195
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.460
So they're comp policy saying,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
The dead in Christ will rise.

196
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.970
We'll go meet Jesus in the air.
That'd be a big party.
And if they're dead now,

197
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:17.640
they won't miss out on the party.
The Corinthians don't have that problem.

198
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.670
They know there's some kind of afterlife preaching and teaching,

199
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.970
but some of them seem to be rejecting the most obvious crude way of

200
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:27.350
understanding the resurrection,

201
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:31.410
the body as if the very flesh and blood will somehow resuscitate and come back

202
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:33.540
to life.
And so Paul says,
no,
no,
no.
That's not how it happens.

203
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.070
It's more complicated than that.

204
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.120
There's a spiritual body and then there's this natural body in the spiritual

205
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:40.530
body is the one that's going to be raised.

206
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.240
Now it's perfectly natural though for people to have raised these objections

207
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.290
precisely because if they heard Paul's preaching about the resurrection of the

208
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:52.980
body,
they precisely would think,
well not how,
how would that happen?

209
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.790
And that would be skeptical of it.

210
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.690
Especially if they had any kind of sort of more philosophical education.

211
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.590
They would think,
ah,
yeah,
that's superstition.
The idea that bodies,
you know,
can,

212
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.670
you know,
zombies can kind of get up out of the grave and walk around.

213
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.300
That's just superstition.
Simple people might believe that,

214
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.790
but we're more educated.
We don't believe that kind of stuff.

215
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.180
So this shows that this church is in a bit different situation.

216
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.800
There's going to be some cosmic transformation that will happen at the end of

217
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:22.690
time.
This is not an individual thing either.

218
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:26.970
It's not like every individual person sort of,
uh,
experiences your afterlife,

219
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.920
your experience in your,
your resurrection all at a different time.
It's,

220
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.440
it's all the same time,
uh,
policies.
Imagine that,
uh,

221
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.300
people will sleep in the ground and then at the end of time the Messiah will

222
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:41.230
come back and as big resurrection of,
of pneumatic bodies will occur.

223
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.010
So notice though that this is the issue he read.

224
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.440
He relates in just first Corinthians 15,

225
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.260
and we're going to back up then and talk about how does that issue about the

226
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:52.710
resurrection from the body relate to other parts of the letter and had it,

227
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.190
what does that tell us about this church?

228
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.620
But first a little background on what this is.

229
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.560
Corinth is a very important city in the ancient Greek world.

230
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.310
It's right on the isthmus of Corinth.

231
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.340
That little narrow strip of land that connects the main part of Greece where

232
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:12.310
Athens is a Kia to the southern part of Greece called the Peloponnese for the

233
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:16.470
Peloponnesus.
Uh,
and so it was an important,
uh,

234
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.850
through way,
both by land because every,

235
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:22.150
all trade and travel that went from northern Greece to southern Greece or vice

236
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:26.920
versa had to go right through Corinth.
So it was a very important for trade.

237
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:31.090
It was also though where,
um,
they didn't have a canal there now so that you can,

238
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:33.100
don't have to sail around the southern part of Greece.

239
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.860
You can just go through the canal.
But back then they didn't have a canal.

240
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:39.280
So they had these big tracks and so ships would come up and can crank out one

241
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:43.750
part on one side,
uh,
of the,
of Greece.
And they would unload all their stuff,

242
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:44.980
put them on the big tracks,

243
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.370
and they would take it across the isthmus and then load it back on other ships.

244
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.390
So this is a hugely important,
uh,
city.
As far as trade went,

245
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.800
it was also important for Rome.

246
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.980
Rome had destroyed Corinth previously in the one forties BCE because Corinth was

247
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.590
helping to lead rebellions against the Rollins who are increasing their power in

248
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:06.220
the eastern part of the Mediterranean.
So Rome,
the Romans destroyed Corinth.

249
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.740
And then let,
let that way for about a hundred years.

250
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.910
It had been refounded again in the forties.
Um,

251
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.890
and then settled with ramen veterans.

252
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.510
So by the time that Paul writes this letter and the say the middle of the first

253
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:23.120
century Ce,
our era,
uh,
roam,

254
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.050
Corinth is still a very romanized kind of place.

255
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:29.650
So it's got a blend of Greek cultures and a blend of Roman cultures.
In fact,

256
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:33.880
the inscriptions in Corinth up until the years one 30 or so,

257
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.910
we're still predominantly in Latin in Corinth,

258
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.030
which was very unusual in the ancient world,
but it shows that,
uh,

259
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.430
the Romans and Latin was a very,
it was very important.

260
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.470
So Corinth was a Roman colony,

261
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.380
which made it both a Greek place and a romanized place.

262
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.570
Found Paul founded the church there himself.
Uh,

263
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:55.250
it talks it in acts 18 one through 18.
Uh,
and in this case,

264
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:57.260
we don't have a whole lot of way to,

265
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.700
to dispute a lot of what acts tells us about Corinth,
although,
uh,
uh,

266
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.250
we can't take it as straight forward historically either.

267
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.140
Paul writes his letter to the Corinthians,
first Corinthians from Ephesus,

268
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.870
as he says in Chapter 16.

269
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.460
And Paul has gotten his information about what's going on at the church in

270
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:19.730
Corinth from several different sources.
For one thing,

271
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.290
and we're going to flip around a bit,

272
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:26.270
look at First Corinthians one 11 chapter one,
verse 11,

273
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:33.620
<v 1>uh,</v>

274
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:33.861
<v 0>Four.</v>

275
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:38.510
It has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there are quarrels among you.

276
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.220
Some people say,
I belong to Paul.
I belonged to Apollo's,

277
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.400
I belonged to cvs or I belong to Christ.
Chloe's people.
What does that mean?

278
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:49.310
We'll close obviously a woman's name.
And when you say,

279
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.880
when you hear this in Greek,
somebody,
people those,
they're good guys.

280
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:54.590
We those around Chloe.

281
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.780
This refers to probably members of her own household.
They could be slaves,

282
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.560
that could be her freed persons,
that could be clients.

283
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.600
It probably refers two clients are slaves are Friedman of Chloe herself.

284
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.760
So say they're members of this church.

285
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.000
Now it doesn't tell us that Chloe herself is a member of the church.

286
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.710
She might be because Paul names her out by name,
but we don't know that for sure.

287
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:21.440
But at least some of the members of her household are,

288
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:24.470
and they have gone to Paul and told him stuff that's going on.

289
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.220
So he gets some of his information from close people.
And like I said,

290
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:32.480
those may well be slaves.
Are freed persons,
was that important?
Well,

291
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.490
at least it means they're probably not members of the,
you know,
upper class or,

292
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.540
or high high status members.
But he also gets information from a letter.

293
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.720
So in in chapter seven verse one he says now concerning the things he wrote

294
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.160
concerning the matters about which you wrote,

295
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.860
and then he says it is well for a man not to touch a woman.

296
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.460
So then he gets into the issues of sexuality,
marriage,

297
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:56.870
divorce and those kinds of things.

298
00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.950
So he's also though received a letter that from at least other people in Corinth

299
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.040
that raises different issues.
Well what do we do about divorce?

300
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.970
What did it about marriage,
what to do about sex?
And then it ray.

301
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.790
And so from chapter seven on he raises different issues that may have been

302
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:14.690
raised in their letter to him.
So that's one place he gets information.

303
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.340
He also mentions in 16 2012 that Apollos has,

304
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.400
has come in is with him in emphasis now in policies come from corn.

305
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.110
So he probably get some information from Apollo's who is not who Paul talks

306
00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:28.610
about,
a policy as a coworker,

307
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.420
not as his sort of servant or his assistant or anything like that.
In fact,

308
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:34.190
when Paul talks about Timothy,

309
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.130
it's clear that Timothy is Paul's assistant because Paul says,

310
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.660
I sent Timothy Someplace.
But when he talks about a policy,

311
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:46.040
says I've urged Apollos to go to come,
come visit you.
In other words,
Paul,

312
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.110
Paul doesn't say he sent a polos anywhere.

313
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.320
There's indicates that Apollos is on something more of an equal status with
Paul.

314
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:56.310
Maybe policy is considered another apostle or a teacher or something like that

315
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:59.400
in early church,
but it,
Paul May have gotten some of the information there.

316
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.500
And then in chapter 16,
17,
he talks about,

317
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.383
uh,

318
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.510
I rejoiced at the coming of Stephanus and Fortune Addis and a caucus because

319
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.190
they have made up for your absence.

320
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.000
Now there are a couple of interesting things about these names.

321
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.130
A Kaia cause would mean would be sort of a name or a nickname for someone who's

322
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.740
from a k up the area just north of Corinth.
Uh,
where,
uh,

323
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.040
that means that area of Greece,
Stephanie,
this is a very Greek word,

324
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:33.360
meaning a crown.
And Fortunate Naddis though is not a Greek word.

325
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:37.740
It's from the Latin,
right?
So F and fortune,
not us.
Does and means fortune.

326
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:40.320
Someone who's fortunate or lucky.
It's like having a,
you know,

327
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.850
a person named lucky.

328
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:47.180
So does this mean that this guy was a himself Roman or maybe was a freed person

329
00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:52.950
of a Roman and therefore had a Latinized name,
whatever.
We don't know about that,

330
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:53.520
but he's,

331
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.130
Paul apparently had gotten information from them also and it talks about a

332
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:58.120
church in their house.
So there are they,

333
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.500
what's going on in corn is there seem to be different house churches in Corinth

334
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:04.650
is not all one group meeting all the time in one place.

335
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.400
So we could imagine different house churches meeting in different places and

336
00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:10.080
maybe made up of different kinds of people.

337
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.580
And one of the ways we're going to talk about this is to see what was the social

338
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:19.581
class of these people in First Corinthians one 26 we get our first major clue.

339
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.800
Consider your own call.
Brothers and sisters,
not many of you.

340
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.210
And again the Greek doesn't have sisters.

341
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:29.280
They've added that to the English to make it more inclusive.

342
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.750
Not many of you were wise by human standards.
Not many were powerful,

343
00:19:33.751 --> 00:19:37.470
not many were of noble birth.
Now they'll all three of those words in the Greek,

344
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.910
our status symbol words.
Why is it doesn't mean just smart.

345
00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:46.020
It means educated.
So not many of you are well educated.

346
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.220
Not many of you are powerful.

347
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.940
That is you're not going to keep people occupying government positions or

348
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:53.190
anything like that and you're not of noble birth,

349
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.140
but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise God chose what is

350
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:01.680
weak in the world to shame the strong God chose what is low and despised in the

351
00:20:01.681 --> 00:20:04.230
world.
Things that are not to reduce to nothing.

352
00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:08.880
Things that are now at one point that those verses were taken to indicate that

353
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.970
all of the Corinthian church,
we're very,
we're just completely low class,

354
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.250
that they were all either slaves are poor,

355
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:18.240
Freedman are lower class manual laborers and this kind of went along with the

356
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:22.350
image that a lot of you saw a lot about Christianity and popular movies like Ben

357
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.410
Hur or the robe or things like this,
which has the earliest Christians,

358
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:29.850
all kinds of hiding away from the Romans in little dark rooms and all being very

359
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:34.200
much laboring class people.
More recently scholars who said,
yeah,

360
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:38.430
but that's not exactly what Paul says.
He says not many of you wear these things,

361
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.390
which at least implies that some people in the Corinthian church actually were

362
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.950
wise,
maybe educated,
uh,

363
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.770
of noble birth or having some kind of access to power.
So this is one clue,

364
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:51.610
this stuck.

365
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.170
There's car scholars in the last 30 40 years to reread the Corinthian

366
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:59.980
correspondence,
both first Corinthians and second Corinthians precisely by take,

367
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.720
looking at what's going on with regard to social status and social class.

368
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.080
And now it gets really interesting because the typical way to read the Bible

369
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.720
that most of us grew up with is you read it very piously.

370
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.030
You read it as having something to say about theology.

371
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.540
You read it and having some say about God and all those are obviously important

372
00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:24.070
ways to read the Bible.
But it's also when you add into issues like Mike,

373
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:27.670
this text not only had something to say about theology but also about issues

374
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:29.620
like social class and power.

375
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.490
And scholars have said it's precisely in First Corinthians.

376
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:37.300
That's one of the places we see in the New Testament.
The best evidence we have,

377
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.740
that the early churches weren't all homogeneous when it comes to their social

378
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:42.580
status level.

379
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.560
And they may have actually experienced conflicts in their groups do precisely to

380
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:49.990
differences in social status and social power.

381
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:55.180
So that's the way I have interpreted first Corinthians.
And uh,

382
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:57.130
it's,
it's debated by some people,

383
00:21:57.131 --> 00:22:01.420
but it's much more the consensus view now among scholars that especially

384
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:02.050
Corinthian,

385
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.140
the Corinthian correspondence does have these evidence of class levels.

386
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.210
So let's see,
how is this working out?

387
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.310
I just read the first passage where Paul seems to say some of you are claiming

388
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:15.820
I'm bi,
I'm for Paul,
I'm going to Paul's people.
I want to apologize people.

389
00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:17.470
I'm one of CIF US as people.

390
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.300
And of course cfs is just the Aramaic name for Peter.
Exactly.

391
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.350
Uh,
Peters,
the Greek name.
See if this is the air air McNain name for the rock.

392
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.540
And so spending,
and in some people in the church is saying,

393
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.700
I'm one of Christ's man.

394
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.960
So these parties that seem to have been developed,

395
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:39.040
or at least there's some kind of glomming on to different leaders.

396
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.390
And some people have said these maybe episode represent actually for different

397
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.130
specific delineate parties in corn.

398
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.690
I tend to doubt that because I don't think you see any evidence the rest of the

399
00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:52.090
way in the correspondence that there are four distinct groups.

400
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.980
I do think there are basically two groups that are going on in opposition to one

401
00:22:56.981 --> 00:23:00.370
another in court.
And that's what I build my uh,
reconstruction on.

402
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.390
So people are having their favorite,
uh,
apostles.

403
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.950
What are some of the other,
the resurrection of the body is one thing,

404
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.510
but there are several other issues.

405
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:14.010
And now that you've all read first Corinthians so carefully,
uh,

406
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.670
in the last several days and read it over,

407
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:19.960
I'm sure three or four times a each day you yourselves can tell me what are some

408
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:23.800
of the other issues that come out in First Corinthians?
Right?

409
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.370
So first we have favorite apostles

410
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.080
and we have differences about the resurrection of the body.

411
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:37.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

412
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.910
<v 0>Those are two of the issues that Paul has to address.
And First Corinthians,</v>

413
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.800
what are some of the others?
Anybody.

414
00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.990
Okay.
Sexual conduct.
And,
uh,
what kinds,

415
00:23:52.991 --> 00:23:56.560
cause there are actually several different issues on sexual conduct and current

416
00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:57.483
in Corinthians.

417
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.660
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

418
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.360
<v 0>exactly.
A man is sleeping with his stepmother</v>

419
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.280
and Paul says that's a big no,
no.

420
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:12.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.790
<v 0>Even for the Greeks,
he says even the Greeks don't do that kind of stuff.</v>

422
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.140
So anything what other sexual conduct issues are going on.

423
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.010
How about chapter six in Corinthians?
First Corinthians,

424
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.590
some men,
men in the church are visiting prostitutes.

425
00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.230
That's what it means in First Corinthians six when it says,

426
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.370
uh,
where is it?

427
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.340
Do you not know that whoever is United to a prostitute becomes one body with
her?

428
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.940
So some men in the church seem to think,
well,
you know,
what's the big deal?

429
00:24:56.941 --> 00:24:59.550
I'm in Christ,
I'm a Christian.
But you know,

430
00:24:59.551 --> 00:25:02.400
what you do with your body is not that important.
So you know,

431
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.410
every guy's got needs.
So some of these Christian men are visiting prostitutes.

432
00:25:07.411 --> 00:25:08.580
So Paul has to address that issue.

433
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.710
Any other issues of sexuality that Paul has to address in First Corinthians,

434
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:14.970
there's one more major one.

435
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.093
<v 1>Pardon?</v>

436
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.550
<v 0>Virginity.
He does bring it up,</v>

437
00:25:20.551 --> 00:25:23.850
but that's not as big an issue for them as simply the idea of should you get

438
00:25:23.851 --> 00:25:27.420
married.
Remember in First Corinthians seven one they,
they seem to have ask him,

439
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.920
uh,
may,
this is actually putting quotation marks in some of your body bibles.

440
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:36.130
It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
So,

441
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.810
and now in scholars debate,
is that Paul view or is that something,

442
00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:42.900
a quotation of a slogan of theirs that he's quoting back to them?

443
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.030
So there's a debate about that among some scholars,

444
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.300
but at least some people in court have written him asking particularly about

445
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:53.340
should we have sex at all or should we be totally aesthetic that is avoid sex

446
00:25:53.341 --> 00:25:55.320
and be a totally continent.

447
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.030
So sex and asceticism

448
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.030
which leads to,
um,
also issues of marriage and divorce.

449
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.760
Okay.
So what other issues are going on?
What about first,
Chris?
The part,

450
00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:18.400
part first part of First Corinthians six,

451
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.950
when any of you has a grievance against one another,

452
00:26:20.951 --> 00:26:24.010
do you dare to take it to court before the unrighteous instead of taking it

453
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:27.940
before the saints?
So some people,
none of that.
Notice this is the part in the,

454
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.390
in First Corinthians,
that's before Paul mentions the letter.

455
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.230
So this seems to be part of an information he's gotten maybe from Chloe's people

456
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.830
that some people in the Corinthian church are taking other members of the church

457
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.370
to court and suing them.
So court cases.

458
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.270
Here's one issue,
uh,
right after that,
it's the one about the prostitutes,

459
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:55.220
the marriage and divorce in chapter seven and then eight chapters eight through

460
00:26:55.221 --> 00:27:00.221
11 are all about one big complex issue and that is food offered to idols.

461
00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.730
Now,
why is that a problem?
Well,
in the ancient world,
most of the time,

462
00:27:13.731 --> 00:27:14.800
I'll talk about this a little bit further.

463
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.340
Most of the time meat was expensive and if you were not rich,

464
00:27:18.341 --> 00:27:19.300
it was hard to come by.

465
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.680
And so the one place where most people need to well actually had any chance to

466
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:26.800
eat meat wasn't a sacrificial festival.
What what happened in,

467
00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.700
in Greek sacrifices is that somebody rich or the city would pay for a bunch of

468
00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.450
cattle or are different kinds of animals to all be slaughtered.

469
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.340
The blood would be poured out and part of this,

470
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.860
the animals would be put on an altar and burn for the gods.

471
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:44.040
But all the rest of the meat within me passed out and and different people who

472
00:27:44.231 --> 00:27:45.230
went to the festival,
we did it.

473
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.210
So you'd go with your buds and you'll get a big hunk of meat from the sacrifice.

474
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.560
Then you'd go off and barbecue it and have,
you know,

475
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.170
your own barbecue as part of the sacrificial festival.

476
00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:57.370
So most most are you taking back to your family store.
Some of it,
you know,

477
00:27:57.371 --> 00:27:58.990
boil from Hobbit,
that sort of thing.

478
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.830
So the main place that most people can answer the world ate meat,

479
00:28:02.831 --> 00:28:06.760
was connected to some kind of sacrifice to some kind of God.
Now of course,

480
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.310
this is part of the sacrificial cult you're eating.

481
00:28:09.311 --> 00:28:12.010
You're sharing a table with that God,

482
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.100
by eating that sacrificed material,
you're,
you're,

483
00:28:15.101 --> 00:28:18.370
it's like you're sitting down to dinner with Zeus when you do this,
right?

484
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.680
So if you're a Jew in the ancient world,

485
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.880
this is causes problems because it means you're,
you don't believe in these gods.

486
00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.580
You're supposed to avoid these gods.
You're supposed to avoid idolatry,

487
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.080
but if you eat that meat,

488
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:33.400
you're still seen by many Jews as participating in that cult with that God.

489
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.560
And also some people believed.

490
00:28:35.561 --> 00:28:37.330
Some of the people thought that was kind of superstitious,

491
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.860
that if you ate that stuff,

492
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.000
then whatever the power that lie behind that God could get into your body by

493
00:28:43.001 --> 00:28:46.990
means of the food.
You can imagine how this happened.
A lot of Jews believed that.

494
00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:51.760
They didn't believe that the idols were just nothing but stone or rock or wood

495
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.930
or metal.

496
00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.840
They believed there was something there that was causing that thing to have

497
00:28:55.841 --> 00:28:56.980
power because they looked around,

498
00:28:56.981 --> 00:29:00.280
they said this person claimed to be healed by Asclepius.
Well,

499
00:29:00.281 --> 00:29:02.440
I can see he's now healed,
so who healed him?

500
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.450
I don't believe that the sleepiest is actually a god,

501
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.700
but I believe Asclepius is a demon.

502
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.900
So a lot of Jews would go around and Christians then later saying that the

503
00:29:10.901 --> 00:29:14.650
powers that lie behind the gods of other nations are not really gods,

504
00:29:14.651 --> 00:29:18.340
but they may be demons and if you participate in an eating,
their meat,

505
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.170
that demon could get in your body.

506
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.800
So food offered to idols became a big problem and the early church should you

507
00:29:26.901 --> 00:29:29.030
eat it is so would it hurt you?

508
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.770
It didn't mean you were participating in sacrifice there in chapter 11

509
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.740
I have to change over here another

510
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.100
women praying without veiling their heads.

511
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:44.963
<v 1>Okay?</v>

512
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.140
<v 0>Paul has to address that.
Notice he doesn't say that women can't pray in church,</v>

513
00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.180
but he says if they are going to pray in church things,

514
00:29:53.181 --> 00:29:55.970
you put a veil over their heads,
that cause of the angels,

515
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.250
whatever that means.

516
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.220
Then a lot of us who've written a lot on that and I have my own theories and

517
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.890
which most of my friends don't like.
In chapter 11,

518
00:30:06.891 --> 00:30:10.610
later he gets into a big conversation about what they're supposed to do in the

519
00:30:10.611 --> 00:30:13.130
Lord's supper,
when they come together to eat the Lord's supper.

520
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.220
And it's not turning out the way supposed to be.
So that's another issue.

521
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.090
The Lord's supper.

522
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

523
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.880
<v 0>Uh,
in chapters 12 through 14,</v>

524
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.250
nobody raised this issue.
Chapters 12 through 14.

525
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.430
What's the big issue that Paul has to address there?

526
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.550
Speaking with tongues.
So the technical term for that is often Glossolalia,

527
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.880
which comes from the Greek word for tons.
So speaking in tongues,

528
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.880
some people in the church or speaking in tongues,

529
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.170
speaking in tongues of course refers to speaking some kind of unknown,

530
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.830
esoteric language that you'd only know by Marac by miracle.

531
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.560
It's a special gift.
It's not an language you learn.

532
00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.040
There's a debate among people about when people talk about speaking in tongues,

533
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.800
are they talking about speaking some other human language,

534
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.770
which is known but just not known but not learned by you.

535
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:08.110
That's what it sounds like.
An axe and axe,

536
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.110
the tongues of fire come down upon the apostles,
you know,
and,

537
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.300
and they all start speaking these strange languages.

538
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.150
And it says everybody who was there visiting from around the world could

539
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:18.640
understand the apostle speaking in their own language.

540
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.940
So the writer of acts seems to think that speaking in tongues in the early

541
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:26.320
church refers to this speaking other known human languages are their scholars

542
00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:27.154
think that at different,

543
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.150
at other times it referred to just speaking some kind of unknown language that

544
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:34.750
would sound to anybody like jibberish.
And that's often how it happens nowadays.

545
00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:36.250
If you go to a church or they're speaking in tongues,

546
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.520
they're not speaking another discernible human language,

547
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:40.600
they're speaking something else.

548
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.750
And so Paul calls at one point the language of angels.

549
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.660
So sometimes some of these early Christians seem to think that when they spoke

550
00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:47.350
in tongues,

551
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.160
they were speaking the angelic language and they were learning it miraculously.

552
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:55.210
So speaking in tongues though is an issue in Paul addresses that in those

553
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.810
chapters in 12 to 14 and then as we said,

554
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:00.790
the last major issue is the resurrection of the body.

555
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:05.710
Now what holds these different issues together?
What,

556
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:07.620
what makes all,

557
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:12.430
are these just a random sort of things that are caught?
The splitting the church,

558
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:17.520
is it just because some people like speaking in tongues and others don't,
uh,

559
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.490
some people are doing it and others don't.
Is it just because,
um,

560
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.900
uh,
you know,
the court cases,
uh,

561
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.800
is just an isolated incident here or there.
Um,
is the,

562
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:34.030
is the issue of food offered to idols and their debate about that is that it all

563
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:38.350
connected to their disagreements about the resurrection of the body and are

564
00:32:38.351 --> 00:32:41.390
those connected their disagreements route sexual conduct?

565
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.310
Because obviously it's their,
they're disagreeing about,

566
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:46.490
this is why Paul is getting different reports from people.

567
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.060
He's getting some reports from close people and then some others write a letter

568
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.650
and whoever wrote the letters,

569
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:54.050
probably not the same people that are giving him the oral reports.

570
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.400
So Paul's getting information from different factions in this church.

571
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:03.610
So the big question is do all of these issues just represent totally different

572
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:09.431
disparate arguments or is there some bigger reason that these are a debate?

573
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:14.300
And is there some sort of major divide along which people are lining up?

574
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.600
And so you get a really wonderful,

575
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:22.601
brilliant book written by a famous New testament scholar Wa

576
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.210
called the Corinthian body and what I tried to do in that book was precisely to

577
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:33.290
take all of these different issues and show how they could line up on one or two

578
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:38.290
sides of what was a social status issue.
I argued that not,

579
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.280
it wouldn't be totally neatly,
but what I try,

580
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:44.450
I tend to try to say is that in a bunch of these different issues,
if you are,

581
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.870
if you had more money,
if you had more access to power,

582
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.270
if you had a better education,

583
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.640
likely you would end up on one side of these issues.
If you didn't have money,

584
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.460
you didn't have power and you didn't have education,

585
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.730
you were more likely to line up on the other side of these issues.

586
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.250
So I argued that the Corinthian church,

587
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:06.800
which remember was in different house churches and it may have been that one

588
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:10.580
house church tended to be on one side and another house church tend to be on

589
00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.690
another.
We don't know that,

590
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.470
but we know that there were different house churches being represented here in

591
00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:17.540
the church in corn.
So when we talk about the church in Corinth,

592
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.280
we're not just talking about one house church,

593
00:34:19.281 --> 00:34:22.120
we're talking about the collection of them and apparently they may have gone and

594
00:34:22.121 --> 00:34:26.030
gotten together sometimes for a special sort of festival for the Lord Separate

595
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.240
Times,

596
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.880
but they apparently would have been meeting in other people's houses at other

597
00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:31.220
kinds of times.
So let's look at how this would work.

598
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:34.910
I first the whole Lord's supper issue,

599
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.940
and here is something that I didn't write about,
uh,
on my own.

600
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:41.870
This was by a famous scholar named Garrett Tyson,
a German scholar.

601
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:45.920
He published a series of articles in the seventies and eighties in which he made

602
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:50.210
this argument.
He pointed out,
just like I've already have that meet.

603
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.290
The availability of meat in the ancient world was very much linked to

604
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.370
sacrificial cult.

605
00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.410
The argument I just gave you even when even if you weren't going to participate

606
00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:01.700
in the sacrifice itself,

607
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.080
chances are if you went to a butcher shop and wanted to buy meat and it would be

608
00:35:06.081 --> 00:35:09.010
expensive if it was meat at all,
if you,

609
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.370
the chances are that butcher had gotten that meat from some kind of sacrificial,

610
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:17.180
uh,
activity because the priests sometimes would own them and eat meat.

611
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.370
Sometimes in order to make money for themselves,

612
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.310
they would sell meat to butcher shops.

613
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.500
So it would be almost impossible.

614
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:27.560
It'd be very difficult unless you yourself were wealthy and you could raise your

615
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:28.250
own meat,

616
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:32.120
have it slaughtered your way and consume it yourself and know that it wasn't

617
00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:33.830
connected to the sacrifices at all.

618
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.860
But if you weren't wealthy and couldn't raise your own meat like that and you

619
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:40.230
just depended upon festivals or the butcher shop,

620
00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:45.540
it would be very difficult to avoid meat that had not been sacrificed to idols.

621
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.480
So what he are that is what you already about,

622
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:51.000
that he also pointed out that the Lord's supper,

623
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.610
when we look at the Lord's supper,
notice what is happening.

624
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:58.230
This is in First Corinthians.
Uh,

625
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:04.530
you find exactly which part of it is,
it's an old chapter 11,

626
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:09.290
but it's toward the end of chapter 11
yeah,

627
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.133
start reading it.

628
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.930
Chapter 11 verse 17 and the following instructions,

629
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:19.190
I do not commend you because when you come together it is not for the better,

630
00:36:19.191 --> 00:36:22.220
but for the worst for to begin with.
When you come together as a church,

631
00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:26.780
I hear that there are divisions among you and to some extent I believe it
indeed,

632
00:36:26.781 --> 00:36:28.790
they're happy factions among you for only.

633
00:36:28.791 --> 00:36:31.280
So will it become clear who among you are genuine?

634
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:35.570
I think he's being ironic there,
but it could be a debate when you come together.

635
00:36:35.571 --> 00:36:38.840
It is not really to eat the Lord's supper for when the time comes to each.

636
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.550
Each of you goes ahead with your own supper.

637
00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:42.500
One goes hungry and another goes drunk.

638
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.700
What do you not have homes to eat and drinking or do you are you show contempt

639
00:36:46.701 --> 00:36:49.700
for the Church of God and humiliate those who have nothing?

640
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.450
What's going on here?
Apparently,

641
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.360
remember I said the early Christian Eucharist Service,

642
00:36:56.361 --> 00:36:59.720
the Lord supper wasn't simply a little bit of wafer and a little bit of wine.

643
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:04.220
It's a meal of which part of it would be then the saying that the consecration

644
00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:07.670
things like repeating what Paul says,
Jesus had said,
this is my body.

645
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.880
Do this in remembrance of me.
This is my blood.
Do this in my memory.

646
00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.050
That might be part of it,

647
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.800
but it's clearly part of a wider meal and it looks like it was something like a

648
00:37:15.801 --> 00:37:19.280
potluck.
Either the rich,
the richer members of the church,

649
00:37:19.281 --> 00:37:21.440
and I don't mean to imply that they're really,
really rich.

650
00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:24.320
We don't think any of these members of Paul's churches were actually members of

651
00:37:24.321 --> 00:37:27.530
the top elite of the Roman Empire.
They weren't senators.

652
00:37:27.531 --> 00:37:29.650
They weren't even a questions,
but they they,

653
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.420
some of them clearly had their own homes,
so that clearly had slaves.

654
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.450
Some of them clearly had some kind of access to financial power.

655
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.360
If they show up at the dinner first,

656
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:40.820
chances are they've either paid for it themselves.

657
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:44.330
Because in the ancient world it was typical for people who are wealthier to

658
00:37:44.331 --> 00:37:45.830
supply something for the community.

659
00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.430
The wealthy people provided the sacrifices for town sacrifices.

660
00:37:49.431 --> 00:37:52.580
If the town didn't buy it themselves,
but usually the town didn't by themselves.

661
00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:55.580
Usually what the town did was expected wealthy people in the,

662
00:37:55.581 --> 00:37:59.600
in the town to pay for big a civic festivities and sacrifices.

663
00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.620
So that's what happened.

664
00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.510
Usually the wealthier people would provide the stuff for the festival,

665
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.000
this upper by paying for it or they might have brought it themselves.

666
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.840
So imagine what you have is a potluck like this.
If you're a fairly well off,

667
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.830
you can show up at say five o'clock I'm going to show up at five o'clock in my

668
00:38:15.831 --> 00:38:18.140
buds.
We're going to have a little drink before dinner,

669
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:22.460
brought an extra bottle of wine and then you know the other people will show up

670
00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:25.460
when they can when they get off work.
Well when you get off work,

671
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.520
if you're a laboring person or a slave in the ancient world,

672
00:38:28.521 --> 00:38:32.660
and slaves did work at regular jobs or they would follow at workday,

673
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.220
you got off work at sundown.

674
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.140
So if you're a working person or especially a slave,

675
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.490
you can't go to the church service until the sun is down.
By that time,

676
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.560
apparently some of the better off people who've already been there,

677
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:48.940
and Paul seems to say they're already drinking and eating and having a good time

678
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.800
before the rest of the people even show up.

679
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.490
So what he says is he talks about people who have nothing and he says,

680
00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:56.890
don't you have homes to eat and drinking?
Well,
other,

681
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.610
a lot of people in the church would have said,
no,
no,

682
00:39:00.611 --> 00:39:05.200
we don't have homes rapport.
The poor lived kind of anywhere they could.

683
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:10.960
So Paul is addressing two different kinds of people in this very chapter.

684
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.200
Some of them have,
in fact,
he calls him the haves and the have nots.

685
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.460
That's the Greek he uses so that the Lord's supper is,

686
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.500
is splitting the church along this social status line and Paul Solution.

687
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.383
Paul even says,

688
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:29.050
if you take the Lord's supper without discerning the body,

689
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.480
and what I think he's talking about is discerning the body of Christ,

690
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:34.360
that is the other people there.
And discuss.
Discerning the body of your neighbor.

691
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.270
If you don't pay attention to the needs of the other bodies,

692
00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:39.220
they're there and you take the Lord's supper,

693
00:39:39.221 --> 00:39:42.520
it will turn into poison and it will kill you.
And he says,

694
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:43.810
that's why some of you are getting sick.

695
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:46.330
Paul believes that some of the Corinthians,

696
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:50.290
because they're not taking the Lord's supper with the proper ethical concerns

697
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:51.040
for their neighbors,

698
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.020
the other church members are actually getting sick off the Lord's supper rather

699
00:39:56.021 --> 00:40:00.190
than helping them.
So what's his Paul Solution?
Wait,

700
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:01.930
if you're that hungry,

701
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:05.950
eat at home before you get there so you can wait on the other people to come who

702
00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:06.784
have to come later.

703
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.100
So Paul solution is to alter the behavior of the higher status members of the

704
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:16.990
church to accommodate the needs of the lower status members of the church.

705
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.390
And if you see what's going on here,

706
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:22.210
you can see that Paul does this over and over again with these different

707
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:25.750
activities.
I can't go into much detail.
Go out and buy the book,

708
00:40:25.751 --> 00:40:30.430
the Corinthian Body.
You can get it on amazon.com and you can read all about it.

709
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:34.960
But on each of these things,
I tried to argue there that food offered to idols.

710
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.260
What does Paul Solution?
Well,
he says it won't actually,

711
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.110
you don't even have to worry about it,

712
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:46.030
but those of you who think it's okay to eat food offered to idols should give it

713
00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:49.630
up if it's going to cause people who think it's wrong to do it,

714
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.690
to do it anyway because that might hurt their conscience.
In other words,

715
00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:56.380
and it's also clear that the people who would've thought this whole thing about

716
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.980
worrying about demons getting to you because you eat idol meat,
they,

717
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.510
if they thought that was ridiculous,

718
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.620
chances are they had some kind of exposure to ancient education because ancient

719
00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:07.720
education taught people that that was ridiculous.

720
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:12.130
Gods don't do that sort of thing.
So the food offered to idols again,

721
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.850
looks like it split the church along these social class lines.
Um,

722
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.350
the resurrection of the body,
I said,

723
00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.710
who would have found the resurrection of the body to be a ridiculous idea?

724
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:25.560
People with more education,
people exposed to a bit more education,
uh,

725
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.870
who would have been taking people to court.
If you are poor in the ancient world,

726
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:33.170
you didn't take people to court because you would lose Roman law was even

727
00:41:33.171 --> 00:41:36.950
explicit telling judges if you have a rich man in your case and a poor man in

728
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:37.251
the case,

729
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:39.920
well of course you'll does that decide in favor of the rich man because he has

730
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:43.500
less incentive to cheat.
The poor are the ones who haven't sent into the t.

731
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:48.560
So Roman law was clearly biased toward the wealthy and the people with power.

732
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.040
So if anybody is taking other Christians to court,

733
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.590
it would be people of higher status,
not people with lower status.

734
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.510
And it may have been that people have higher status.

735
00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:01.660
We're taking their lower status Christian brothers to court Paul there and tells

736
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:04.790
him,
don't go to court if you have a dispute.

737
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.940
Let it be handled within the church itself.
Now notice again,

738
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.800
just like you talked about file Lehman last time,

739
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.280
who would have been the majority in the Corinthian church?

740
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.100
Rich people or poor people,
poor people.

741
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:18.590
There may have been some people who are better off,

742
00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:21.470
but they had been vastly outnumbered by the poor people.

743
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.310
So by telling the rich people they have to handle their problems within the

744
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:26.144
whole church.

745
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.870
He's placing the rich in a situation where they're the minority and that

746
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:34.820
therefore increases the power of those of lower status in each of these cases.

747
00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:36.650
In other words,
I've argued that the whole Corinthian,

748
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.340
the Corinthian church has problems where they are coming to different views

749
00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:45.140
about Christ,
about the body,
about sex,
about women,

750
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.870
and covering their heads when they pray and prophesied and that sort of thing.

751
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.470
They were coming to the different views because they had different exposures to

752
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:54.260
upper class ideology or lower class ideology.

753
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:59.510
Two different exposures to levels of education.
Now,
what happened?
Well,

754
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.160
apparently first Corinthians as a letter did some good because we've yet we have

755
00:43:04.161 --> 00:43:06.290
fortunately other materials for most of Paul's letters,

756
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:09.050
we don't know whether they succeeded or not because we don't have any other

757
00:43:09.051 --> 00:43:11.690
writing.
And we do have second Corinthians,

758
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.620
which is made up of at least two other letters.
Second Corinthians is actually,

759
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:20.060
uh,
the first part of it is one letter and then chapters 10 through 13.

760
00:43:20.061 --> 00:43:22.610
In Second Corinthians is another letter.
And if you read them side by side,

761
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:26.960
you can tell because Paul's tone changes radically when he gets to chapter 10 in

762
00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:28.790
Second Corinthians.
So in Second Corinthians,

763
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:30.800
we have at least two more letters that Paul wrote.

764
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:35.360
And then Paul mentions infrastructure is another letter he wrote to them.
So we,

765
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:37.760
there was another letter going back.
Fuck,
we don't have that one probably.

766
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.630
And in Second Corinthians,
Paul mentions a tearful letter,
a letter he sent,

767
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.640
but it was very difficult for him to write.
He cried over it.
Now some of theirs,

768
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.200
is that referred to another letter or does that refer to the way his,
uh,

769
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.630
Second Corinthians 10 through 13,
which was a very angry letter.
We don't know.

770
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:54.590
There's a debate about that,

771
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:59.210
but what we can tell is that the basic things about Paul that Paul addresses in

772
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:02.600
First Corinthians seem to have been settled by the time we get to second

773
00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:06.080
Corinthians.
Although he has other problems.
And the biggest problem is we,

774
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:09.620
when that section 10 through 13 a second Corinthians,

775
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.040
because here we get Paul having to defend himself.

776
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.750
And this is very telling because Paul says,
well,

777
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:19.550
you're talking about the super apostles.

778
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:22.220
Some other people must have come on the scene.
We don't know who they were,

779
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.070
but Paul ironically caused them super apostles.

780
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.760
You talk about the super apostles,
they're perfectly willing to mistreat you.

781
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.780
They treat,
they're arrogant,
they treat you as if they all the power.
Pardon me,

782
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:37.830
that I was too weak to do that.
I treated you well,

783
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:42.240
but maybe that's my weakness showing itself.
And somebody said,
well,
you know,

784
00:44:42.241 --> 00:44:46.110
he's very,
he's very strong in his letters,
but you know,

785
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:50.790
in person he's kind of a wimp.
He's very weak in person.

786
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:56.310
His speaking style,
well,
this was a social status thing.

787
00:44:56.311 --> 00:45:00.090
If you were a man in the ancient world,
if he was upper class,
upper status,

788
00:45:00.091 --> 00:45:03.180
he was supposed to be able to talk powerfully in public,
and if he couldn't,

789
00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.540
he was survival.
So in,
in this,
in Second Corinthians,

790
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:10.920
Paul is forced to defend himself from charges that he is uneducated,

791
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:15.930
weak and powerless,
and therefore not much of an apostle.

792
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:20.910
Now that goes on in Second Corinthians,
eventually what happens,

793
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.870
we don't know what happened.

794
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:26.490
Did Paul did riding this really scathing letter to them in Second Corinthians 10

795
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:31.110
through 13 did that settle the issue?
Do they all just say,
okay,
we were wrong.

796
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:35.250
You're our apostle,
you're the big daddy,
everything's fine.
We don't know.

797
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.800
We do have a reference in second Clement,

798
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:41.640
which is a letter written in roam around the end of the first century,

799
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:45.690
beginning of the second century in which an author talks about the Corinthians

800
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.550
as being an ancient and great church.
So at least by the next generation,

801
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.300
the church in Corinth is strong and powerful and respected.

802
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.780
So eventually Paul's work in Corinth succeeded.

803
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:01.030
But what we see by looking at first Corinthians and second Corinthians all

804
00:46:01.031 --> 00:46:06.031
together is the struggles it took for Paul to get that church from this,

805
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:10.110
what I call an adolescent phase where they're arguing about everything.

806
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.560
They're really confused about what they think about basic doctrinal or life

807
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:18.420
issues,
and then to finally settled down into some kind of coherence.

808
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.720
So that's what makes these letters really fascinating for us is that they give

809
00:46:21.721 --> 00:46:26.460
us a little snapshots of one church that Paul founded at at least three

810
00:46:26.461 --> 00:46:28.710
different stages of its development.

811
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.850
Those three stages being represented by what we can read from first Corinthians,

812
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.970
which kind of gives us one snapshot of this problem they're having.

813
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:40.950
What we can read from Second Corinthians,
the first nine chapters,

814
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:45.510
which sounds like they've made up and things are okay and what we can read by

815
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:48.570
Second Corinthians 10 through 13 which we don't know where that was written

816
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:52.120
after the first part of Second Corinthians or before it.
We can't.

817
00:46:52.121 --> 00:46:53.370
It's difficult to place these things,

818
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:57.390
but it shows Paul and a very defensive posture with regard to this church.

819
00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:03.350
So we get a very good idea of how churches struggled to actually start becoming

820
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:09.210
what we are seeing will become Christianity.
They've got a long way to go yet.

821
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:14.310
Any questions or comments?
I've covered a lot of area today.

822
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:16.200
You can go back and read it,

823
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:20.040
and I haven't even talked about Philippians because I wanted to make sure that

824
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:23.580
you understood what was going on in scholarly opinion about the Corinthian

825
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:28.410
epistles.
Any questions,
comments,
outburst?
Okay,

826
00:47:28.411 --> 00:47:29.340
I will see you on Wednesday.
