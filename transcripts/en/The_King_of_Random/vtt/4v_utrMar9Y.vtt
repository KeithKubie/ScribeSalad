00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.290
For this project I’m going to show you how
to make “Screw-Lock” Sugar Rockets. These

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.000
PVC rocket motors are powerful, and designed
to help you re-load, and re-launch your “Randomizer”

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.709
rocket within minutes. They’ve got a built
in parachute ejection system, which will help

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.620
bring your rockets back safely. And the best
part is, you can make as many as you want,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.900
for about a dollar each.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.120
Let’s start this project with a box of baking
soda, a bag of powdered sugar, and 100% Potassium

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.520
Nitrate, stump remover.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.720
It’s important to grind the potassium nitrate
into a really fine powder, and the easiest

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.800
way to do that, is with a small blender, like
the one I found at a local thrift shop for $5.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.120
Potassium Nitrate is hygroscopic, meaning
that over time, it’ll absorb moisture out

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.940
of the air. Which is exactly opposite,
of what we want for our rocket fuel.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.059
To make sure your nitrate salt is as dry as
possible, try sprinkling the fine white powder

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.930
on something like a baking pan, then sticking
it in the oven.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.820
I let mine bake at 300ºF (165ºC), for around
30 minutes, to drive off all the moisture,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.980
and prepare it for it’s destiny, as my hobby
rocket fuel.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.040
While we’ve got that warming, let’s move
on to modifying a few 3/4” x 12” PVC risers,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.020
which you can find in the sprinkler section,
of your local hardware store.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.350
I clamped a piece of wood to my chop saw exactly
5” away from the blade, which gives me the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.990
option to line up the threaded edges, and
cut the tubes cleanly, at exactly 5” long, every time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.580
You can flip the riser
around and do the same thing with the other threaded end as well.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.009
This way you get two 5” motor casings, from
one riser. Which will save you time and money,

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.350
if you’re making more than one.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.079
Alright let’s move on to packing the casings,
and for that, you’re going to need a 10” oak dowel.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.789
This will be a ramming rod, and a template
as well. And the markings you can see on my stick

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.139
are designed to make the equivalent, of an
E45-5 rocket motor.

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:41.840
Mark a line precisely in the center of the
dowel, at 5”.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.440
And measuring from this line, you’ll need
to mark the dowel at 3/4”, 2-1/2”, 5/16”, and 3/4”.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.740
Take time to be precise, because
the performance of your rocket motor depends on it.

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.060
These markings are for the different compositions
we’ll be adding in just a minute, and to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.450
double-check you’ve done it right, you should
have 11/16th of an inch left at the tip.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.319
Now depending on how, and when, your PVC risers
were manufactured, they may be a little too

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.630
small for the oak dowel to push all the way
through.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.000
If that’s the case, just use a little sandpaper
to knock down the sides of the dowel a bit,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.690
until you can slide it all the way into the
casing, with little to no gap at the end.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.110
Now before we pack the rocket fuel, it’s
important to rough up the insides of the casings

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.140
a bit, and for that I’ll be using a flat
metal file.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.060
The strength of your clay nozzles and bulkheads
will increase dramatically, just by scoring

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.360
the bottom inch of your casings, on the inner
walls. And the deeper you can get the scratches, the better it’ll hold.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.090
Do the same thing with the top inch of the
casing as well, then set the tube firmly on

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.920
a hard surface. Because the time has come,
to pack powder.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.140
The composition I’m using for my sugar rockets
is a mixture of these three powders.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.800
The first glass is filled with finely powdered
bentonite clay, and we’ll be using that first.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.730
The cheapest and easiest way to get bentonite
clay is by going to the dollar store and picking

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.090
up a bag of unscented kitty litter.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.850
Use your hobby blender to grind a handful
for around 30-40 seconds, and when your clay

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.260
is finely powdered, use a funnel to add some
to the tube.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.640
Hold the tube firmly to a hard surface, then
hammer the top of the ram rod, as hard as you can.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.640
I like to use a rubber mallet, and you’ll
want to give it around 5-10 good whacks to

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.150
make sure the clay is nice and compacted.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.760
Go ahead and repeat the process, and when
the first line on the ram rod, lines up perfectly

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.520
with the top of the riser, your first clay
plug is done. Let’s move on to adding the “White Mix” next.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.090
“White Mix” is the pyrotechnic fuel that’ll
make the rocket fly, and is simply a mixture

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.870
of 65% Potassium Nitrate, (which is the stuff
we just finished drying in the oven), and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.590
35% Powered Sugar, by weight.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.230
Shake the mixture for a couple of minutes
to get the sugar and salt as intimate as possible.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.780
I’m shaking by hand, because it’s a good
way to help avoid dangerous amounts of heat

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.660
or friction, from building up.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.330
Remember that this is a highly flammable mixture
and needs to be protected, and treated with

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.900
respect. Because you don’t want it going
off accidentally.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.240
With the fresh white powder thoroughly mixed,
go ahead and ram the fuel into the casing

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.530
until the second mark on the dowel lines up
perfectly at the top.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.209
When it does, you’re ready for cup #3.

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.459
This third powder is the time delay mix that’ll
control when the parachute gets ejected.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.459
The delay mix burns around 1/16” per second,
and you can easily make it by using 20 grams

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.700
of the “White Mix”, sprinkled with 3 grams
of regular, household Baking Soda.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.749
Use a digital scale to make sure your composition
is as accurate as possible, then transfer

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:20.590
the delay mix into a plastic party cup, and
gently swirl it around for about a minute,

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.480
to make sure the baking soda gets thoroughly
worked in.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.600
5/16” of this powder should give us about
a 5 second delay, and when you’ve got the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.300
delay mix rammed in tight on top of the “White
Mix”, go ahead and cap it off with another

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.490
3/4” of rammed kitty litter clay, like you
did for the nozzle.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.800
To double-check you did it right, your casing
should have, 3/4” of clay at the bottom,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.330
2-1/2” of “White Mix” above that, 5/16”
of “Delay Mix” next, followed by 3/4”

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.400
of rammed clay at the top.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.599
All that’s left is to do now, is add the
parachute ejection charge, and drill out the nozzle.

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.770
I’m using a 3/32” bit for the ejection
charge, and a 7/32” bit for the nozzle.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.529
Look closely and you should be able to see
the tips of bits, line up exactly on either

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.029
side of the “Delay Mix” markings, and
that’s important.

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.710
And it’s also a really good idea to mark
both ends of the bits in-line with the ends

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.699
of the motor casing, because that way you’ll
know exactly how deep to drill.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.949
If you want to make sure your rockets go as
high as possible, with a parachute that ejects

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.249
when it’s supposed to, it’s critical that
all your marks and measurements are perfect.

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:22.999
If you’re feeling confident they are, then
let’s move on to adding the ejection charge next.

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:26.529
The ejection charge goes in above the clay,
but in order to light it off we first

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.479
need to use the 3/32” bit, to drill a small
hole through the center of the clay, until

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.879
it reaches the delay mix.

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.069
It’s really important not to drill into
the delay mix though, because if you do, it’ll

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.909
compromise the delay time.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.150
Use the marking at the back of the bit for
reference, and when you get close, slowly

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.479
and carefully drill the rest of the hole by
hand.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.400
The instant you see a little white powder
on the tip of the bit, you’ll know you’ve

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.200
arrived. So don’t go any further.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.879
Now I picked up a 1lb bottle of FFFG equivalent,
muzzleloading propellant, which seems to work

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.539
really well for popping out parachutes.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.419
Carefully pour a bit of the black powder into
the top, so it covers the clay a few grains deep.

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.689
Then take your spoon and give the casing a
few gentle taps at the top, to make sure the

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.529
black powder flows down the hole, and makes
contact with the delay mix.

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.069
To keep the powder from falling out, give
it one firm tap with your dowel, and you should

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.529
find it compresses the powder just enough
to keep it in place.

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:17.650
Now you will need to cover the powder with
a fire-resistant layer, so it doesn’t get

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.089
set off accidentally. And for that I’m using
some cellulose insulation, that I scavenged

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.529
from the attic of my house.

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:27.219
Put some fire resistant wadding on top of
the black powder, then ram it down tight,

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.699
and your ejection charge is complete.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.039
With that, there’s only one thing left to
do before our rockets are ready to fly, and

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.089
that’s to drill out the nozzles.

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:39.689
Turn the motor over so the bottom is facing
up, then very carefully place the 7/32”

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.309
bit exactly in the center, and slowly begin
to drill.

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:46.199
It’s important to drill this hole as centered
as possible, and slowly enough that there’s

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.229
no chance, the fuel can catch fire from the
friction.

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.279
Keep drilling until you reach the reference
mark at the back of the bit, and with that

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.900
final step, you’re done.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.710
You’ve just created a PVC Sugar Motor, that’ll
screw-lock into position.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.319
Just for fun, I made one with an acrylic casing,
so you can see inside, and get a feel for

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.369
exactly how it’s put together.

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:07.490
Lighting it off with a fuse, you’ll see
that when the white mix ignites, it burns

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.409
incredibly fast, then stops suddenly where
the delay mix begins. And 5 seconds later,

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:13.699
pops off the ejection charge.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:19.179
Alright, let’s try testing one of the “Screw-Lock”
motors, with the “Randomizer” rocket, it was designed for.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:23.419
I connected the leads to an electric match
we made in a previous video, then used my

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.490
N64 Rocket Launch Controller to set it off.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.800
With a quick and powerful burst of energy,
the “White Mix” launches the rocket high

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.879
into the air, then ignites the delay mix,
which slowly burns between 4-7 seconds.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:38.909
When the delay is all used up, the black powder
ignites, popping out the parachute, and floating

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:41.119
the rocket safely back to the ground.

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:45.119
The best part is it only takes a few seconds
to re-pack the parachute and screw on a fresh

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:50.499
new motor. Which means now, you can be all set
for another launch within a matter of minutes.

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:53.649
Well now you know how to use baking soda,
kitty litter and a few other common materials,

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:57.330
to make sugar powered hobby rockets, for around
a dollar each.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.839
But if you don’t feel like spending the
time it takes to make your own, just use commercial rocket motors instead.

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:05.770
I tried screwing an Estes E9-6 to the bottom
of the “Randomizer”, and it flew just

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.060
as well, and over 1,000 ft high. It just cost
5 times as much.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.460
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of 
my others.
