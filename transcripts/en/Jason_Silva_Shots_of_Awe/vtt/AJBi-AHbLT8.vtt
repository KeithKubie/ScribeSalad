00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.550
I am in love with this dog.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.784
In love.

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:12.041
[INAUDIBLE] demon up there
on the shelves. [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.780
Oh, we're on?

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.220
Yes?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.470
What's up, everyone?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.600
Welcome to this Google
Hangout over here.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.960
My name is Jason Silva.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.300
And in case you
guys are not aware,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.570
I create, in
partnership with my pals

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.280
at Revision3, Shots of Awe.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.520
Shots of Awe is a weekly series
of short nuggets of techno

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.740
rapture that celebrate
big ideas, that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.950
celebrate inspiration,
that celebrate

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.650
those moments that [?
we ?] make final cuts.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.590
I am an inspiration junkie.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.490
I love to be elated.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.370
And I'm here to take your
questions and chat with you

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.390
about YouTube.com/ShotsofAwe.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.510
I'm also the host of Brain Games
on National Geographic Channel.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.610
And I'm excited that
you guys are here.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.240
And I'm open to all of it.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.330
I'm hearing a playback right
now of what I just recorded.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.550
It's already playing back.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.810
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.643
What's up, everyone?

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:10.590
Welcome to this--

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.005
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:11.505
OK.

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:12.500
There we go.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.520
All right, everyone.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.780
Sorry.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.530
Technical failure.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.210
We actually had a power
failure at the office

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.190
where we were going to do this.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.750
Human technology, co-evolution
collapsed ironically.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.460
Here I am talking about
singularity, and we lost power.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.950
Anyway, ask away.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.160
I'm here for you.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.580
Let's chat.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.900
Let's create a techno-social
wormhole of communication

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.670
and transcend time,
space and distance.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.730
All right?

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.660
OK.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.260
Oh.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.450
"Can you speak on
the possibility

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.380
of a dystopian singularity?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.460
What are the potential
threats of a Utopian future?"

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.960
Sure.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.810
Look, I think Kurzweil has
talked about this a lot

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.580
as well.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.020
Technology has always
been a double-edged sword.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.730
Technology extends
our reach, but it

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.920
can extend our reach
in any direction.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.660
Perhaps the man that discovered
fire, as Kurzweil says,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.409
was probably burned at the
stake by his contemporaries.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.950
So we can use fire
to cook our foods,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.690
or we can use fire
to burn one another.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.830
So we use these tools,
we use these instruments,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.550
to extend the boundaries of
our thought, of our reach,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.280
of our vision, to
extend ourselves.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.030
But it's how we choose
to extend ourselves

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.238
that ultimately determines
the effect that technology

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:24.491
has on our future.

00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:26.490
And I think that's where
cultural narratives are

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.100
important.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.620
That's where memes
are important.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.680
That's where, again, these
narratives that will ultimately

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.880
inform how we use these
tools are crucial.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.510
So that's what publishing
platforms like TED

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.530
are so important.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.250
That's why I make my videos,
to put them out there,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.320
to inspire a greater
vision of life, a greater

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.630
vision of what's possible.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.230
But if you actually
map out human progress

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.730
over the last 100 years,
contrary to popular belief,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.080
we have to used these
tools to make life better.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.232
Steven Pinker's work
talks about the fact

00:02:58.232 --> 00:03:00.690
that the chances of a man dying
at the hands of another man

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.990
today are the lowest
than they've ever been.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.630
The world has actually never
been less violent than it is

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.380
today, contrary
to popular belief.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.290
So it's not utopia yet,
but it's leaning that way,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.590
as Steven Johnson likes to say.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.660
More questions.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.160
Let's see.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.080
"What are the actions you can
take beyond reading and talking

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.790
about this kind of
awesome vision?"

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.170
Well, I think use the
tools at your disposal

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.030
to basically put out your unique
vision, add it to the world.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.130
We've never had such
tools with which

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.440
to create ripples
that can transform.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.440
It's this idea that a
young person with a cell

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.990
phone in Africa today
has better communications

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.400
technology in the US
president had 25 years ago.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.520
So how might this young
child use this tool?

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.330
How might he use it to
extend his creativity?

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.420
To remix his fear
of possibilities?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.170
It's not my job, I
think, to tell you

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.100
how or what you can do.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.410
It's mostly just to inspire
you to believe that you can.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.220
But I think you have
to ultimately discover

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.890
your own path.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.500
What is your
contribution going to be?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.570
That, I think, is the question
we can all ask ourselves.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.720
In fact, at Singularity
University in Silicon Valley,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.350
they've created this whole
university at the NASA Ames

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.966
campus to encourage
and teach people

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:30.840
to think exponentially
about what's possible.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.720
The idea is that passionate
individuals today

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.930
can do what only governments
and corporations used

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.610
to do mere decades ago.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.226
The tools to change the world
are in everybody's hands.

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:42.750
I think that's a wonderful idea.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.500
Because on the back
of these exponentials,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.890
you are now more empowered
than you've ever been.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.385
So again, the question is,
what is your contribution

00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:50.100
going to be?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.415
Let's see.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.000
"can The Matrix be considered
a controlled singularity?"

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.040
Yeah.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.010
I think The Matrix was presented
as a dystopian meditation

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.680
on control and free
will and identity,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.290
because dystopian stories
and conflicts make

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.996
more entertaining movies.

00:05:16.996 --> 00:05:21.290
But a lot of stuff that was
hypothesized in that film

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.580
sounds pretty glorious.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.270
Wouldn't you like to inhabit
a kind of virtual world,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.600
indistinguishable from
this one, but one in which

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.740
the very physics, the very
constructs of said reality

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.710
are completely malleable?

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.180
Why can't we all be
Neos in The Matrix.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.450
Why can't we all
move into universes

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.850
of our own construction?

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.190
Terence McKenna says the
man made world is already

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.940
a condensation of
the imagination.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.970
The whole thing has been
sprouted from the human mind.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.270
In the film The Matrix, I
didn't see it as a bad thing,

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.660
for us to live in
this virtual utopia.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.157
But the film found it
necessary to say, oh,

00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:03.365
humans didn't accept the
program when it was perfect.

00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:05.675
They only accepted it when there
was conflict, nah, nah, nah,

00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:07.966
nah, nah, and then it went
off in that other direction.

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.780
But yeah, that's kind
of a singularity.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.280
The minute you can
create an AI that

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.015
can build a world for
you, that's a singularity.

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:14.670
Why not?

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.100
"Have you read Radical
Evolution by Joel Garreau?"

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.740
Heard of it.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.490
Read pieces of it.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.030
Haven't read the whole thing.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.480
"How cool is it to be on
the Joe Rogan podcast?"

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.650
I love Joe Rogan.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.320
I think that he's got
something really amazing

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.190
with that podcast.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.670
It's a labor of love.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.230
He produces it with his friends.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.580
They blast it out into
the world, unedited.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.550
And they touch on such
a range of topics.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.646
From MMA, to
consciousness expansion,

00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:46.020
to the technological
singularity.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:53.141
He's had everybody from Sam
Harris to comedians to me.

00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:55.390
It's an absolute honor to
have been there three times.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.400
And the response that I got
from appearing on the Joe Rogan

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.880
podcast has been superb.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.640
The passionate nature of
his fans and his followers

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.910
is humbling, but it's
wonderful at the same time.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.090
"Have you thought about
writing a book any time soon?"

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.510
I've actually been contacted
by several publishers and book

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.160
agents, believe it or not.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.427
Ever since my
videos going viral,

00:07:20.427 --> 00:07:22.260
and doing all the
keynotes around the world,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.440
and also Brain Games, that I
host on National Geographic,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.750
has been the highest
rated series launch

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.246
in the history of
NatGeo as well.

00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:31.120
So all these things kind
of happened at once.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.950
I've been experiencing my
own singularity, in a way.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.230
With Shots of Awe and the
Brain Games and speaking.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.685
And so people have
started to approach me

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:40.560
about writing a book.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.570
And I've hesitated a little bit.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.060
Because a part of
me feels like, I

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.610
believe in remix
and mash-up culture.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.280
I'm not really an academic.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.510
So my book would be essay-istic.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.365
It would be a stream of
consciousness of the references

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:56.530
and the anchor points of
the frameworks of reality

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.460
that I'm currently surfing.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.480
If people are expecting
an academic book,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.940
that's not what they're
going to get from me.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.450
I have this fantasy of doing a
coffee table book with images

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.660
from the Imaginary Foundation
mixed with my favorite essays.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.515
So it's more of a
curatorial effort, where

00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:12.450
I would grab selections from
Terence McKenna and Timothy

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.800
Leary and Erik Davis and then
images form the Imaginary

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.989
Foundation, and then
maybe some pictures-- just

00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:21.780
beatific other images
that I stumbled upon.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.696
That would be awesome.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.530
"Transcend time
and space, you say.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.410
This will be fun."

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:29.910
Well, yeah.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.150
That's kind of what these
technologies allow us to do.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.566
Something I've
been thinking about

00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:37.280
lately is how we
use airplanes force

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.289
us to re-accommodate ourselves,
to renegotiate our relationship

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.930
to distance and to
time and to scale.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.780
What is close and
what is far when it

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.630
takes three hours in traffic
to get from uptown to downtown,

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.300
but then three hours
can also take you

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.830
to another side
of the continent?

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.450
These machines, they transform
all notions of scale,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.230
all notions of distance.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.634
But psychologically, it's
still a re-accomodation, right?

00:09:03.634 --> 00:09:05.800
I feel very disjointed when
I take these long trips,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.690
because there's something
just supernatural, almost,

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.690
about these magical machines
that fly through the sky,

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.340
and we somehow take
it for granted.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.540
Amber Case, the
cyborg anthropologist,

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.760
says that even right now, here
in a techno-social wormhole,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.650
we've created this
hole in space and time.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.910
And wherever you guys
are, you can hear me,

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.100
you can talk to
me, I can hear you.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.280
The human mind--
at least the part

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.750
of the mind that is
communicating-- communication

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.940
itself between
sentient minds has

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.839
transcended time,
space and distance.

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:40.005
I think that's unbelievable.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.220
"Virtual reality is coming.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.830
Any worlds in particular
you would like to visit?"

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.710
Oh my god, yeah.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.600
I want to visit Jodie Foster's
wormhole in the movie Contact,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.400
when she's literally
riding a roller

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.960
coaster through the universe.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.270
That would be rad.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:03.540
Also, the Utopian romantic
projection of Cameron Crowe's

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.590
Vanilla Sky.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.160
The lucid dream where the
character of David Aames

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.640
creates this virtual, lucid
dream that's sculpted out

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.260
of the iconography of his youth.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.380
So images of pop culture,
references of love,

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.710
of what love is like, of
what friendship is like,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.690
all these things that
inform his lucid dream.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.190
Like a virtual space
that's rendered

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.980
at the speed of your
thoughts-- or rather,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.090
your fantasies--
sounds pretty rad.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.550
To create and perceive your
world at the same time,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.850
like the dream
sequences in Inception.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.190
How awesome would that be?

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.570
"What is your take on aliens?"

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.920
Well, I think that
it is inevitable

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.030
that intelligent life either
will be or has evolved

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.100
somewhere else in the universe.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.380
My intuition tells me, it's
too big, it's too bast,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.630
the scales are too
difficult of fathom

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.060
for there not to be something
else like what occurred here.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.050
Whether they've visited us
or not, I'm not convinced.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.180
Most UFO footage
looks like a hoax.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.140
Whether panspermia was
responsible for putting life

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.690
on Earth, whether the building
blocks of life were sent here.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.870
That idea of panspermia
is kind of amazing.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.190
Especially because Freeman
Dyson, the physicist,

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.660
says we need to do that soon.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.380
We need to take all the
DNA of life on Earth

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.449
and send it out into space.

00:11:33.449 --> 00:11:33.990
So who knows?

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.000
Maybe some intelligent
super alien intelligence

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.390
did that to seed the
life on this planet.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.890
It's interesting
to speculate about.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.692
I love the mystery of that,
the possibility of that.

00:11:47.692 --> 00:11:49.150
There's an interesting
thing called

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.066
the transcension hypothesis
that I made a video about that

00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:54.690
tries to explain
Fermi's Paradox, which

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.523
is if the universe is
so vast, why don't see

00:11:56.523 --> 00:11:59.420
any evidence of these
extraterrestrial civilizations?

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.530
And the reason is that as
complexity and technology

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.830
evolves, we stop
expanding outwards,

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.007
and we start expanding inwards.

00:12:08.007 --> 00:12:10.340
The whole thing about STEM
compression-- the compression

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.690
of space, time,
energy, and matter--

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.106
means we start to put more
computation and more complexity

00:12:14.106 --> 00:12:15.490
into denser and denser spaces.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.290
Until you have
computation at the level

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.640
of the nano scale
and the femto scale.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.630
And literally, you're
concentrating [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.254
into a point where
you literally create

00:12:23.254 --> 00:12:26.040
black hole-like conditions,
and virtual realities

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.540
and digital minds disappear
into those black hole-like

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.140
conditions and
slingshot to the end

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.870
of the universe, the
end of space-time.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.420
And that's where all the other
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:35.920
are.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.794
And so that's why we
don't see them anywhere,

00:12:37.794 --> 00:12:40.140
because they exist outside
of the observable universe.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.440
Because of this inevitable
STEM compression

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.560
that happens when technology
reaches that singularity.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.750
That's why we can't
see the aliens.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.250
Maybe.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.360
"Because of
mortality, our brains

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.040
help us make decisions
to keep us alive

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.190
because we are afraid to die.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.565
What do you think
our world would

00:12:58.565 --> 00:13:00.870
be like without
these limitations?"

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.709
I think about Robert Ettingter,
who wrote Man into Superman.

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:06.250
And he says, "together
we shall taste

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.054
the wine of centuries unborn."

00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:09.470
Nobody's going to
convince me with

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.850
the deathist rationalization
that says that, oh, death gives

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.470
meaning to life and we would
be bored if we were immortal.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.150
I'm sorry, man.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.190
I think that that's just
because we are poetic

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.106
and we've found a way
to accommodate ourselves

00:13:20.106 --> 00:13:21.080
to personal extinction.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.060
But I [INAUDIBLE] words
of Alan Harrington

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.914
that says, "any philosophy
that accepts death must itself

00:13:25.914 --> 00:13:27.830
be considered dead, its
questions meaningless,

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.540
its consolations worn out."

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.160
I'm sorry.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.940
Just nobody's going
to convince me

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.760
to accept the
inevitability of loss,

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.975
the inevitability of losing
everyone I care about.

00:13:36.975 --> 00:13:37.850
I just do not accept.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.030
I just defy those conditions.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.280
I do not accept those terms.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.900
I love too much.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.350
I love my family.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.690
I love the people in my life.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.610
And I just don't accept
that this imposition,

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.860
this entropy thing, says oh,
love each other for as long

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.640
as you can, because you're
going to be food for worms.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.410
Not cool.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.330
And I think the purpose
of human evolution

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.920
is the trend to end entropy.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.640
Is to basically engineer
our own divinity.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.290
That's what it
means to be human.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.970
To transcend all
previous limits.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.460
I think we can talk about
anything. [INAUDIBLE] metaphor.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.150
You can talk about unknowable
things using metaphors.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.930
Even singularity
is a physics term.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.180
It's a physics term borrowed
to describe this even horizon,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.100
this moment in which AI become
smarter than the human brain.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.350
And so thinking itself
takes on a dimension

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.380
that is unfathomable to human
brains without augmentation.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.430
The whole idea of it is
that we use language,

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.122
we use poetry to
describe the ineffable.

00:14:41.122 --> 00:14:43.460
That's another great skill
set that we happen to have.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.390
So I do think we could speculate
about what the singularity--

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.580
how it might play out.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.520
But sure, to imagine
what it will be like

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.970
is as difficult as trying
to imagine what the world

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.399
post-language would have
been too early hominids

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.690
on the other side of that line.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.742
Try to explain to
chimp the nuances

00:14:58.742 --> 00:14:59.825
of a Shakespearean sonnet.

00:14:59.825 --> 00:15:00.990
You know what I mean?

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.820
It's not that easy.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.360
They don't have
the mental software

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.564
to be able to run
that in their heads.

00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:07.480
Which is a shame, because
they're missing out.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.420
"Hawking says that if we
don't back up humanity--"

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.320
Yeah, look.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.330
We have backups for our iPhones.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.030
We need to back
up our mind file.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.470
We need to back up our DNA.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.820
We need to back up humanity.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:29.600
I do think that, yeah, we
need to back ourselves up.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.380
Why wouldn't we?

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.980
What a tragic thing it
would be to not be backed up

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.356
and be hit by a train.

00:15:38.356 --> 00:15:38.855
Oh.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:42.190
I can't imagine
anything more horrible.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.030
What else we got?

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.680
What else we got?

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.270
Your response, can we even
talk mortality-- The internet

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.210
already being an AI.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.960
Well, there's a great
metaphor, of course,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.640
that says as we all join the
internet-- in terms of scale

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.030
and emergence-- just like
10 trillion cells decided

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.230
to team up and become
the super-organism called

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.050
the human being, now
billions of human beings

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.410
are teaming up and becoming
this super-organism called

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.620
the internet, and the
internet is wiring all of us

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.520
together like
individual synapses.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.385
And these synapses are
becoming this global brain.

00:16:14.385 --> 00:16:15.760
And that eventually,
when there's

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.710
sufficient interconnection
and sufficient complexity,

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.660
a new kind of
planetary consciousness

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.935
might emerge from that.

00:16:21.935 --> 00:16:23.690
And it's one of those
things where you can't plan.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.900
That's the whole
thing about emergence.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.110
[INAUDIBLE] complexity leads
to something different.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.990
The sum of the parts adds
up to more than the parts.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.424
That is what emergence is.

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:32.882
So even if that
did happen, I don't

00:16:32.882 --> 00:16:34.965
know if we would be aware
of it, the very same way

00:16:34.965 --> 00:16:38.040
that the cells that make up the
individual cells in my bodies

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.770
probably are not aware
that their aggregate is

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.930
this super-organism.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.617
So yeah.

00:16:44.617 --> 00:16:46.200
The internet could
lead to that, but I

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.783
don't know if we
would be aware of it.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.320
Wow.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.710
"Man will not merely
endure-- he will prevail."

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.670
Oh, wow.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.100
William Faulkner said,
man will not just

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.370
endure-- he will prevail.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.510
I love that!

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.320
That's a beautiful thing.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.780
That's like the guy that said,
"first we build the tools,

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.750
then they build us."

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.579
He also said that he's
confident that men

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.590
will learn the songs that
orchestrate the universe.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:12.089
Look at us.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:14.089
We're a pretty
exceptional species.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:18.244
Our ability to reverse
engineer reality.

00:17:21.366 --> 00:17:23.450
I look at what
we've done so far,

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.310
and it makes me think
there's nothing we can't do.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.010
I think it was Sophocles who
says "Manifold the wonders.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.550
Nothing towers more
wondrous than man."

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.740
I agree.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.890
I think it's sad that a lot
of people fail to see that.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.260
But I think it's my mission
in life to get them to see it.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.950
Besides, what is life if
not the pursuit of a dream?

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.130
The dream of transcendence,
the dream of glory,

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:53.070
the dream of usurping
all previous limits.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.180
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.638
Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily.

00:17:56.638 --> 00:18:00.590
Life is but a dream."

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.990
What else?

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.570
What else?

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.361
Plato's Allegory of the Cave.

00:18:04.361 --> 00:18:04.860
Ooh.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.830
That's a good one.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.660
"I love the amount of
enthusiasm you have.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.730
What inspired you to be an
influential type of speaker?"

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:13.630
Interesting.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.170
Thank you for that.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:19.210
I didn't plan to have
a speaking career.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:24.990
I worked at Current, Al Gore's
TV network, for four years.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.340
And I was hosting
a show on Current.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.900
And when I left, I
wanted to go back

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.800
to create the kind of content
that moved me profoundly,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.320
which was content that reflected
my philosophical sensibilities

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.850
and my love
aesthetically-relevant

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.035
presentation.

00:18:42.035 --> 00:18:44.410
And I started doing these
short videos, the Philosophical

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.930
Espresso Shots, as a way
of creating a visual art

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.650
form, a format, so to speak,
a short form communication

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.600
style that was built
around how I talk.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.090
I just so happen to go on
these rants for two minutes.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.690
If you hang out
with me, you'll see.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.090
And so I thought,
eh, maybe I can

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.760
take some of my most lucid
rants on my favorite ideas

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.530
and edit them with
music and imagery

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.450
and put people in
my head to turn

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.729
my subjectivity into a visual,
externalized art you could see.

00:19:12.729 --> 00:19:15.020
So it's like you could see
my [? thoughts ?], you could

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.920
see the butterfly
effect in thought as I

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.500
was going through it.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.592
And the videos took off.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:22.550
And what happened is
people would see the work,

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.716
people would see the videos.

00:19:23.716 --> 00:19:25.690
It was a way of
discovering these ideas ,

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.440
which is ultimately
what these were about.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.180
Trailers for ideas.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.362
And then I got to speak
at the Singularity Summit

00:19:31.362 --> 00:19:33.070
and I had really good
feedback from that.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.370
And then I spoke at another
economist ideas conference

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.540
and I had really good
feedback from that.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.630
Then I found out I
have a knack for it.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.500
Because I'm so passionate
about these ideas

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.020
that it flowed very naturally.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.600
Then TED Global came to me.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.379
Of course, the illustrious
TED Conference, so amazing.

00:19:46.379 --> 00:19:48.920
They had me do a video for them
called Radical Openness which

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.360
I premiered on the TED stage.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.240
And from that, things
just snowballed.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.380
I've since spoken at the
Festival of Dangerous Ideas

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.320
in the Sydney Opera
House, which was amazing.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.930
I've done corporate keynotes for
IBM, and Intel, and Microsoft,

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.135
and Adobe, and Oracle.

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.240
It's taken off.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.895
And I'm just really
grateful, because it's

00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:08.270
like Joseph Campbell
used to say,

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.780
"follow your bliss
and doors will

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.120
open where there were no doors."

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.930
And that's kind of how it feels.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.370
It's really wild.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.920
It's like that
scene in The Matrix

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.740
when Neo has that realization
that he can see the code

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.040
and he can rewrite the code.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.623
And a lot of these limitations
and these frameworks of reality

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:25.970
are just that.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.350
They're software
that can be hacked.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.760
I love the term
"reality hacking."

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.625
The only thing standing
in your way is you.

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:36.040
It's a big idea.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.040
Big idea.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.450
"The idea of overcoming entropy.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.200
Humans can influence
chaos and organize it

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.140
with nothing but our minds.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:43.931
What do you think?"

00:20:43.931 --> 00:20:47.080
I completely buy
into that notion.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.260
I think entropy is an
existential bummer.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.250
I think that life
is anti-entropic,

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.260
as Bucky Fuller used to say.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.170
We move towards
greater complexity.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.140
We don't accept these
existential bummers

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.710
if we don't have to.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.090
And we've already doubled
the human lifespan.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.020
And that was before the
revolutions and domestication

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.517
of biotechnology.

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.600
I was just watching that
video of that little girl

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.870
that was cured from cancer
by them putting HIV in her.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.120
They reprogrammed
the HIV virus so

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.590
that it would attack
her cancer cells.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.960
Talk about hacking
the software of life.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.140
Literally, they made the
virus attack her cancer cells

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.740
and she got cured.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.300
There's nothing
we can't do, man.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.820
We are as gods.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.320
Love it.

00:21:33.827 --> 00:21:34.660
"What's on your hat?

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.659
Are you ever in Venice?"

00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:39.040
Actually, it says
"deus ex machina."

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.310
If the "s" in the
"deus" was an "x,"

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.790
it would be "god
in the machine."

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.140
So I discovered this company.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.731
I was in Australia, and I have
another one that says "deus ex

00:21:46.731 --> 00:21:48.230
machina," the god
is in the machine.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.130
I thought it would
be funny because I

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.713
talk about the
singularity, and that's

00:21:50.713 --> 00:21:51.940
like engineering divinity.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.273
So that's where that comes from.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.710
"Would you consider cloning
yourself when possible?

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.670
Ha, ha, ha.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.770
Wow, thanks.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.470
I haven't thought
about that yet.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.755
I think that sure, that
would be interesting.

00:22:17.515 --> 00:22:19.740
I haven't thought
about it, but yeah.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.570
"If you were going
to college nowadays

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.730
to study science,
technology, which field

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.440
would you pursue because
of the current potential?"

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.160
I think anything.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.735
Any of these emerging
technologies.

00:22:28.735 --> 00:22:30.360
Anything that's
emerging exponentially.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.609
I would encourage people to
go Singularity University,

00:22:32.609 --> 00:22:34.860
actually, where they
focus on exponentials.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.445
Exponential thinking,
I think, is key.

00:22:36.445 --> 00:22:38.390
Because we have these
brains that just

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.570
intuitively think linearly.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.919
But progress is exponential.

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:44.335
So we need to reprogram our
brains to think exponentially.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.200
Venus project!

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.640
Yes, I'm aware of it.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.670
Love the artwork for it.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.729
It looks amazing.

00:22:51.729 --> 00:22:52.520
It looks beautiful.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.320
Jacque Fresco,
definitely a smart guy.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.070
I think it's cool.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.910
I think all possible
Utopian visions

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.630
are worth investigating and
pursuing in some capacity.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.620
Just the idea of us trying to
create perfection turns me on.

00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:13.010
"The future is already here.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.840
It's just unevenly distributed."

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.340
Yeah.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.670
People talk about
this all the time.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.710
They say, yeah, these
technologies sound great.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.290
But what about the info-nots?

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.230
You have the info-haves,
and you have the info-nots.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.860
Kurzweil answered
this brilliantly.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.079
He says, people are afraid
these technologies are only

00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:28.620
for the rich.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.640
And he answers, yeah,
like cellphones, right?

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.140
When cell phones
were first created,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.264
they were expensive, clunky,
didn't work very well,

00:23:35.264 --> 00:23:37.540
and perhaps only a
few could afford them.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.540
Today, a young person
with a cellphone in Africa

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.540
has better communications
technology than the US

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.902
president had 25 years ago.

00:23:42.902 --> 00:23:44.985
So these technologies,
they improve exponentially.

00:23:44.985 --> 00:23:47.080
They get cheaper, they
get more accessible,

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.817
and they get more affordable.

00:23:48.817 --> 00:23:50.650
So I don't think these
technologies are just

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:51.700
for the rich at all.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.780
I think they spread and they
become available to everyone.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.560
"What is your take on
vibrational [? seet ?]

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.990
frequency, multiverses,
ascension?"

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.960
I can't speak too much
about any of those other

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.300
than the multiverse idea.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.280
The parallel universe
theory of quantum mechanics

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.430
that was proposed
by Hugh Everett III

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.880
is this idea that the only
way to explain quantum physics

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.170
is to assume that every possible
thing that could ever possibly

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.592
happen is happening in some kind
of parallel universe to ours.

00:24:26.592 --> 00:24:28.300
There was a great book
called The Man who

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.980
Turned into Himself,
which took that idea

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.430
and wrote a fictional
account of it.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.110
This guy, his wife dies, and
he just can't bear the pain.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.745
And somehow, he learns to surf
between parallel universes.

00:24:38.745 --> 00:24:40.870
And he ends up going to
the other parallel universe

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.030
in which his wife didn't die,
and then gets to be with her.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.370
It's an amazing story.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.880
Also, Michael
Crichton's book Timeline

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.390
use the parallel universe
theory of quantum mechanics

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.610
to achieve time travel.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.050
Because obviously, I can't go
to the past of this universe,

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.880
but I can go to a parallel
universe in which their present

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.970
looks a lot like what
our past looked like.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.360
And in order to get to
that parallel universe,

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.750
you can't fit human
through a wormhole.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.459
But you can send a fax.

00:25:08.459 --> 00:25:10.250
The same way you can't
put a piece of paper

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.420
through a telephone line,
but you can send a fax.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.990
So they figure out how to scan
the information equivalent

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.970
of the human being,
destroy the human

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.076
on this side at the same
time as they zap you

00:25:19.076 --> 00:25:19.950
through the wormhole.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.160
And then the other
universe reconstructs you

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.930
upon receiving your
particles, somehow.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.480
You self-organize, and you
just pop out the other side.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.730
It's an idea, but
kind of a wild idea.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.710
But Michael Crichton
in Timeline explored it

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.422
in a pretty cool way.

00:25:33.422 --> 00:25:36.530
I can't believe I
actually remembered that.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.320
How are we doing?

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.710
"Who are some of your idols?"

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.840
I adore Kevin Kelly's writings.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.660
He's brilliant.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.850
What Technology Wants is genius.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.840
I like Terence McKenna's
ideas of a new university

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.030
that engenders novelty.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.805
I like Timothy Leary, who
says that our technology is

00:26:01.805 --> 00:26:03.930
the literalization of the
psychedelic dream of mind

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.350
expansion.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.910
I really like film directors.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.630
Cameron Crowe, who did
Vanilla Sky, is an idol.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.380
Danny Boyle, who did Slumdog
Millionaire, 127 Hours, Trance,

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.840
The Beach, he's a total idol.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.160
Ron Howard, who I've recently
become friends, total idol.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.900
Apollo 13, A Beautiful
Mind, his new film Rush.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.964
Love these guys.

00:26:22.964 --> 00:26:24.505
Christopher Nolan,
who did Inception.

00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:25.730
Oh my god.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.800
I do think that filmmakers
are ecstatic shamans.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.000
They take us to places of
ecstatic illuminations.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.710
They're masters of
the art of capturing

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.668
and managing attention.

00:26:34.668 --> 00:26:38.080
They can orient our awareness
to psychological spaces,

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.930
to subjective spaces
of grand visions

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.840
and grand possibilities.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.760
I love those guys.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.810
"What do you think of David
Pearce's idea of utopia?"

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.160
I love David Pearce.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.120
I love him.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.407
His Hedonistic Imperative,
I think, is brilliant.

00:26:54.407 --> 00:26:55.740
Everybody should check that out.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.810
It's this online treatise on
how we should use biotechnology,

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.421
nanotechnology, to engineer
suffering out of existence.

00:27:02.421 --> 00:27:03.420
Like physical suffering.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.760
Like pain, malaise,
death, disease.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.300
Literally eliminate it.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.300
And just literally
transform ourselves.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.470
Like caterpillars turning
themselves into butterflies.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:14.900
It plays out in nature.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.030
Why can't we do it?

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.010
We are nature, too.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.510
That's a thing you
shouldn't forget.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.760
We are nature.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.200
Everything we do is nature.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.680
OK.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.980
If you guys are enjoying
this conversation,

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.570
I would ask you to go to
YouTube.com/ShotsofAwe

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.840
and subscribe to my channel.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.150
Because we're popping out
new videos every week.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.840
Every week, I'm putting in
a new Shots of Awe video.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.350
I'm working with
my friends here.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:46.450
They're awesome.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.732
The images, the music, the
micro-psychedelic experience.

00:27:49.732 --> 00:27:51.190
It's like downloading
the universe.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.770
So please, please subscribe.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.210

Also, follow me on Twitter.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.210
I'm @JasonSilva.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.510
S-I-L-V-A. @JasonSilva.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.180
I have a verified account.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.386
I'm easy to find.

00:28:02.386 --> 00:28:04.010
Follow me on Twitter
and stay connected

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.135
so we keep this kind of
two-way conversation going.

00:28:06.135 --> 00:28:08.220
Keep the techno-social
wormhole open.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.189
Keep it stable.

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:13.230
Prediction of Moore's law
that exponential growth

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.130
will decelerate.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:14.927
I don't think so.

00:28:14.927 --> 00:28:16.510
I think that every
time the people are

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.926
afraid that Moore's Law or
that the exponentials are going

00:28:18.926 --> 00:28:21.990
to stabilize, there is
a new paradigm shift.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.180
Some new crazy
technology comes online,

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.550
and Moore's Law just continues.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.080
Even gene sequencing is
going three times faster

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.560
than Moore's Law at the moment.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.140
So I don't think
it's going to stop.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.070
On the last Joe Rogan
concept, I touched on comedy

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.210
being a kind of philosophy.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:44.043
Could you elaborate?

00:28:44.043 --> 00:28:46.794
Yes, Well, comedians are the
original stand-up philosophers.

00:28:46.794 --> 00:28:48.960
Or at least, the contemporary
stand-up philosophers.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.490
There's not a lot of
spaces today outside

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.710
of university campuses
where somebody can stand up

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.280
and pontificate on things.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.260
I try to do it in my talks.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:03.500
But comics like Joe Rogan, like
George Carlin, like Bill Maher,

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.470
these are contemporary
philosophers.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.520
They get up on stage
and they think out loud.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.690
And they ruminate with you.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.320
And they share anecdotes
and make observations

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.190
about the world.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.616
They philosophize.

00:29:14.616 --> 00:29:16.240
And then they have
this humorous twist.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.610
We laugh because we
relate to what they're

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.850
saying, because they
mirror us brilliantly.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:23.450
So I definitely
think that comedians

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.410
are contemporary
stand-up philosophers.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.650
Technology, extension
of ourselves,

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.560
reflection of ourselves,
our true potential.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.300
Look, I think technology,
again, is our second skin.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.970
It's like the termite colony
is temperature controlled,

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.960
but it's still part of
the termite species.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.461
The spider's web, it's
still part of the spider.

00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:47.960
We need to think of our cities,
our skyscrapers, and our jet

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.043
engines as literally things
that are spilling over

00:29:50.043 --> 00:29:51.700
out of the organism.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.850
If we were able to
time lapse progress,

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.920
it would look like
our grand visions

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.600
and our grand dreams spill
over from our brains.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.700
This is the world
that we live in.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.935
This is what we are.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:05.820
Well, guys.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.420
This has been fun.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.250
I tire easily because I'm very
passionate, as you can tell.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.370
But I've had a great
time chatting with you.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.830
And I hope that you
guys will subscribe

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.240
to YouTube.com/ShotsofAwe.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.900

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:29.979
So watch Brain Games on NatGeo.

00:30:29.979 --> 00:30:30.770
Thanks a lot, guys.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.070
Jason Silva, Shots
of Awe, signing off.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.900
