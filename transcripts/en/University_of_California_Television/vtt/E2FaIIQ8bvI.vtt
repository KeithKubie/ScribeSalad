00:00:05.826 --> 00:00:09.159
(soft electronic music)

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.490
- I think we can all agree

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.470
that it is very difficult
to understand the brain.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.270
Part of the reason is
because the sheer number

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.170
of neurons we have to study.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.960
There's about 100 billion
stars in our galaxy,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.600
but if you look at the human brain,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.770
there's about the same number of neurons.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.050
It's also about 100 billion.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.010
But what make it even more difficult

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.950
is that on average,
each neuron is connected

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.560
with about 10,000 other neurons.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.620
Even when you look at
a much smaller brain,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.610
for example that of a mouse,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.870
there's still about 100
millions of neurons,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.690
with that forming about
100 billion connections.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.630
What make it difficult to understand

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.520
is not just the sheer amount of numbers.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.650
The thing is there's also mental activity

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.060
that we really want to
be able to understand.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.320
For example, perception,
attention, or consciousness

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.210
is really an emergent property
of not just a few neurons,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.180
but instead those millions
up to billions of neurons

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.900
that form a neural
network or neural circuit

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.610
by forming a connection with each other,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.420
which we call synapses.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.100
So, it's not enough to
only try to understand

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.930
the, you know, 100 neurons,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.680
even though you can already
know a lot about the universe

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.400
by looking at the 100 stars

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.670
that are formed at different stage.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.730
So, condense all this

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.810
into a scientific
question that we can ask,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.130
the first set of questions
we want to understand

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.580
is how a single neuron operates.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.820
For example, a single neuron

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.020
in the cortex may receive 10,000 inputs.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.460
We want to know what are those inputs,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.920
and we also want to know
how this individual neuron

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.310
integrated all the inputs it received

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.270
to generate an output signal.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.500
So another way to answer the question is,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.640
what is input-output relationship

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.330
for the individual neuron in the brain.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.970
After we understand that,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.490
we can then look at how multiple neurons,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.040
actually tens of thousands of neurons

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.090
that are working together
by forming a circuit,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.780
and what are the inputs
those circuit receive,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.660
and how individual
neurons within a circuit

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.870
encode the sensory stimuli,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.870
or actually to execute a neural
command, a motor command.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.600
So, in order to do that,
we really need to spend

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.850
a very large scale, both
in space and in time

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.410
as Mark mentioned previously.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.290
So for imaging method,
what we would like to have

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.720
is that we'd like to have
sub-micron spatial resolution

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.340
because that is the size
of individual synapses.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.280
Those are the size of the
connections between neurons.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.750
But we also want to be able to have

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.220
millisecond-scale time
resolution because of how quickly

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.860
the neuro signaling happen in the brain.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.830
We want to be able to
image all those processes

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.380
at depths because brain's
this three-dimensional,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.240
rather thick structure, which
in all the adult brains,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.720
they are also scattering.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.160
So one of the technique that
has been around for many years,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.740
which is very powerful in this aspect,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.210
are the so called two-photon
fluorescence microscopy.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.880
So this microscopy rely on the excitation

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.470
of a fluorescent molecule
by the absorption

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.190
of two photons at the same time.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.470
And then when the molecule
come back to the ground state,

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.150
it will release its energy

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.100
in the form of a fluorescent photon.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.670
The nice thing about this technique

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.530
is that the fluorescent
signal is only generated

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.000
at the focus of your excitation laser.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.490
So in order to form an image of the brain,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.180
what you only need to do
is just to scan this focus

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.640
around inside the brain and connect

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.420
to the fluorescent
signal at each position.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.410
And then when you plot out this
two-dimensional Raster Plot,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.490
that basically gonna give you a micrograph

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.580
of the fluorescent molecule distribution.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.080
As this example show, you can see

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.180
that there's a special resolution

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.820
of this technique is clearly sufficient,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.820
since you are able to see individual

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.340
dendritic spines in vivo.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.640
But there's a problem
when you try to image,

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.080
going beyond the two-dimensional image.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.040
And this is important because

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.460
from a single neuron to a neural circuit,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.000
this is really a
three-dimensional structure.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.810
If you only scan in a 2D plane,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.100
you will only be able to have

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.210
a cross sectional view of the sample.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.630
So, in order to get the
volumetric imaging of the neuron,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.910
you basically need to scan.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.590
You basically need to scan
this focus in three-dimension.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.100
So you can see that it takes time.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.790
And secondly, sometimes
your sample may be moving,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.760
and then you will have this motion-induced

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.820
artifact in your image.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.330
And finally, if you want to really have

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.420
high volumetric imaging speed,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.840
the traditional approach
is basically trying to move

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.830
this laser focus very
rapidly in three-dimension.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.980
So assume that you can do that,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.470
what will then happen is that

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.350
now you will have a huge amount of data

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.720
'cause you go from a two-dimensional image

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.250
now to a three-dimensional image stack.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.530
And because of this motion
problem that you want to correct,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.550
now you need to do three-dimensional
motion registration,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.040
which is very difficult to do

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.910
when you're dealing
with gigabytes of data.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.360
And typically, traditional
neurobiology laboratory

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.730
are not really equipped either in terms

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.450
of computational hardware and expertise

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.850
to really handle this type of big data.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.150
And finally, the actual
volume rate is still limited

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.880
by the brightness of the
fluorescent molecule.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.000
Even if you can move the
laser focus very rapidly,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.820
the focus is still required to stay

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.440
at each individual position
for an amount of enough time

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.920
for you to gather enough
photon to see the structure.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.300
So when we was confronted
with this problem,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.330
we asked ourselves this question,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.700
is this traditional approach of scanning

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.550
this focus in 3D absolutely necessary?

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.940
And before I give you the answer,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.060
I want to show you that
those are the neurons

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.210
in the brain, and you can
see individual circles.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.390
Those are the cell body
of individual neurons.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.180
And those are the dendritic
spines of a single neuron.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.630
So there's lots of things happening.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.990
You see flashes of
fluorescence intensity change,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.110
which is basically telling you

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.400
that these neurons are becoming active.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.930
But despite of all those activities,

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.220
you would probably also notice
is that nothing is changing.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.320
I mean, sorry, the neurons
are not moving around.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.620
Most of things are changing,
but the neurons stay put.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.800
Maybe because of the actual
cell (mumbles) metrics

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.730
that are holding them in space.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.780
But they are so stationary,
that they are even,

00:07:03.754 --> 00:07:05.690
they even have constant position

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.130
on the label of a single synapse.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.680
So this means now, we
actually have a choice,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.470
which is specifically true

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.710
if you have a sparsely labeled sample.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.310
You could do this conventional scan,

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.340
and then for a sparsely labeled sample,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.880
you will spend lots of
time looking at nothing.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.700
Or what you could do is to
stretch out your excitation focus

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.460
so that by scanning this
focus once in two-dimension,

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.090
you will have a projected
view of the same volume.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.210
But the advantage here is
that the imaging frame rate,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.240
in this particular case
is 30 frames per second,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.990
now become your volume rate.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.000
So here you are looking
at the volume of brain

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.380
inside the awake behaving mouse.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.340
And you can see the neurons
become brighter and dimmer,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.710
reflecting the activity
of this particular neuron.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.770
So, this type of focus

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.110
where we stretch it in the axial direction

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.850
is called Bessel focus or Bessel beam.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.160
And this conventional type of
focus where it's very small

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.580
is an axial direction
called Gaussian beam.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.810
Now, Bessel beam is actually
not something very exotic.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.460
Whenever you go to supermarket,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.230
and you go to the checkout line,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.410
they will have this red light
that is reading the bar code.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.510
Those red lights are actually Bessel beam.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.910
But when we use this for two-photon

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.060
fluorescence microscopy though,

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.250
we can't just use whatever is inside

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.640
our checkup line in our supermarket.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.920
So what we did is that we
built a very simple module

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.680
that is located between
our excitation laser

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.740
and the two-photon microscope.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.560
I'm not gonna go through the detail,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.830
but we use this metal equipment

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.790
called the spatial light modulator,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.350
which allow us to generate the Bessel beam

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.560
of different length as
well as the narrowness.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.020
So here are just two examples.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.500
On the right hand side is
what the excitation focus

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.910
actually looks like in
the axial direction.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.680
I just want to point out that,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.150
to the actual size, you have
to stretch this whole thing

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.150
by five times because it's
just too narrow to show it

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.070
if I show you with its real aspect ratio.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.040
So you can see that when we
use a longer Bessel beam,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.600
in this case about 60 micron
in the axial direction,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.610
you can see more structures.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.640
But one thing I want to point out is that

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.700
if you compare the image you get

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.130
with what you have gotten with
the conventional approach,

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.172
you can notice that we maintain

00:09:38.172 --> 00:09:41.030
the ability to resolve
individual synapses.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.760
For example, there's
about three axonal boutons

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.750
in this Gaussian image,
which is clearly detected

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.850
in the Bessel images as well.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.370
So one big advantage of this approach

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.800
is that now the imaging become insensitive

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.970
to the axial motion.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.640
So what do I mean by that?

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.160
So here are the image of a
stretch of dendrite in a mouse

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.740
taken with a Gaussian beam
as well as a Bessel beam.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.640
So you can see there's
quite a bit of motion

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.050
because this animal is awake

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.310
and hasn't been fully
habituated to have fixation.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.160
And we can easily register this image

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.280
in 2D just to correct the matter of shift.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.842
And then, now you can
see it doesn't jitter

00:10:21.842 --> 00:10:24.820
in the XY direction as much.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.800
And if you now plot out
the fluorescence intensity

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.080
within this small stretch of dendrite,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.550
you can see that in the Gaussian data

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.400
you see this up and down signal,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.836
which actually looks very much

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:39.950
like the calcium activity
that you would expect

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.300
to see when the neuron become active.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.500
However, when you look at the Bessel data,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.930
you don't see such open,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.120
those transient-like variations.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.000
Now, we could also quantify
how much the brain is moving.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.860
And when we do that, you actually realize

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.210
that all those transients we see here

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.270
are very strongly correlated
with the motion of the brain.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.510
So then you can say, well,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.400
how do you know this is not activity?

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.610
It could still be some kind

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.470
of motion-induced activity of the neuron.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.250
But we know in this case
it cannot be activity

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.060
because we are not expressing

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.790
calcium indicator in the brains.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.140
In this case, it's just very simple

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.680
yellow fluorescence protein.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.200
So, by using a Bessel beam,
now we really don't need

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.440
to worry about whether the data you get

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.170
is contaminated by motion artifact or not.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.110
So as I mentioned before,
we have synaptic activity,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.250
and this really help us to do a subtype

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.770
of neurobiological experiment,
where we ask the question,

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.540
what are the synaptic input
a single neuron receive?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.860
So here, you are looking
at a 3D imaging stack

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.230
of dendrites of a neuron.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.150
You can see there are dendritic spines

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.300
distributed at different depth.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.390
And the question here
we are asking is that

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.090
what are the orientations and activity

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.460
each synaptic, each dendritic spine's,

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.200
what are the orientations and activity

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.960
of the inputs each synaptic
spines are receiving?

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.000
Now if you want to
interrogate all the spines

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.750
within this volume using
the conventional approach,

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.660
the experiment is gonna
take about 10 hours.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.920
But with Bessel beam, we
could probe the orientations

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.800
and activity of those synaptic inputs

00:12:29.609 --> 00:12:32.880
in a single session, which
only will take 20 minutes.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.880
So we have about 30 times
increase of the throughput.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.010
And if you analyze this data,

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.560
you can then gather the tuning property

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.060
of all the dendritic spines in one row,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.409
and in this particular case,

00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:52.110
we observe some clustering
of inputs of similar type.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.870
Now we are not limited to this
dendritic type of imaging.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.200
Any kind of sparsely labeled sample

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.300
can be studied using this method.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.050
So here we are looking at inhibitory

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.620
neuron population in the mouse brain.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.120
And using the conventional
approach to probe

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.220
the first 400 micron
of inhibitory neurons,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.810
we need to take at least 80 images.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.829
But with Bessel approach,
we only need to take

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:19.480
four images, and by doing that,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.650
in each imaging session,
we can get lots of neurons.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.380
And by looking at this
data, we very easily realize

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.210
this triangle that is a subpopulation

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.630
of neurons have very highly
synchronized activity.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.420
So if you are into interneurons,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.670
then you will answer the question

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.710
that there are many
subtypes of interneurons.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.560
We can label a particular
subtype called the VIP neuron,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.030
and you can again see that
with a Bessel approach,

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:49.440
we can get all those VIP
neurons in one imaging session.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.040
And when we look at their activity,

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.560
we actually found that those neurons

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.400
are highly synchronized.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.160
And we further discovered
that the activities

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.790
very much correlated with the diameter

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.630
of the pupil of the mouse.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.660
So now what does that mean?

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.570
It is known that if
your pupil are dilated,

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.580
that means you are paying attention.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.260
So I hope all you guys' pupil
are dilated at this moment.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.390
But what we basically
discovered is that VIP neuron

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.650
as a population has extremely
synchronized activity

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.930
reflecting the arousal level.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.230
Now, if you are interneuron field,

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.340
the next cell type you
will want to look at

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.810
are the so-called somatostatin neuron.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.680
The reason is because the current model,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.990
most dominant model,
is that the VIP neuron

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.440
will inhibit somatostatin neuron.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.520
If this model is correct,
then what you will expect

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.890
is the somatostatin neurons' activity

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.420
to be always anticorrelated
with the pupil.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.750
But that's not what we see.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.270
We do see anticorrelated population,

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.090
but we also see lots of population
that are also correlated.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.710
So this means that this is really

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.130
a probably too simplistic picture,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.230
and somatostatin neuron really
has heterogeneous activity

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.490
that wasn't appreciated before.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.480
Now we actually didn't set
out to make this discovery,

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.490
but because we can image
at a high throughput,

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.670
this kind of conclusion just
naturally fall out of data

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.610
with a minimum amount of data analysis.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.510
One thing I think will make
this technique very powerful

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.160
is that it is very easy
to add this capacity

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.170
to an existing microscope.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.350
So my post-doc, Rongwen, flew down

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.660
to Max Planck Florida Institute,

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.970
and it took him only one day to install

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.680
a Bessel beam scanning module

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.650
on a commercial microscope
in the David Fitzpatrick lab.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.480
And because biology are much harder,

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.440
they then spent a lot
longer trying to gather

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.750
this high super synaptic
imaging to work in ferrets.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.030
So, since we published the result,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.400
we've been helping multiple
labs to implement this method.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.470
While we were doing that,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.830
we realized there's two limitation

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.140
of the implementation that
we designed originally.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.010
Number one is the limitation of money

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.920
because the spatial light modulator

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.440
is rather expensive equipment.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.350
It's about $25,000.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.470
Not every lab can easily come up

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.660
with the money to afford it.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.370
Secondly is space.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.160
Especially for labs that are
using commercial microscope,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.490
oftentimes, it's a very compact design,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.240
so it's difficult to fit in

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.060
an SLM-based module into those space.

00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:26.330
So an alternative is to use the optics

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.740
that the checkout line also uses

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.260
called axicon to generate the Bessel beam.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.850
It's much cheaper.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.650
The whole module now is only about $5,000,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.580
and it's very much more compact.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.730
But the problem with axicon-based method

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.150
is that you cannot really tune

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.120
how long your Bessel beam will be.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.070
But my post-doc Rongwen figured out

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.270
that you can simply translate
a lens inside the module,

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.960
and by doing that, we can
generate a Bessel beam

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.870
of different length very easily.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.120
So again, here you need
to stretch out the focus

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.600
about 10 times to
appreciate the real length.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.300
So because this system is so compact,

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.560
we can now easily implement
it on any kind of microscope.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.560
One particular microscope

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.580
that is of interest here is a mesoscope

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.140
that was designed and built by the group

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.270
of Karel Svoboda at Janelia Farm.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.800
So this microscope has
very large field of view.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.080
It's about five millimeter,

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:27.080
which covers about 50% of
half hemisphere of cortex.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.090
And I also want to mention

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.900
that there's this remote
focusing unit there,

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.800
which allows them to very rapidly move

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.240
the focus in a Z direction.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.980
So we can combine the Bessel
module with the mesoscope.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.130
This is how the whole module looks like

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.670
relative to the microscope.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.030
And now we can probe a very large volume

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.340
of neurons at very high resolution.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.780
For example, here we keep zooming in

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.040
into this very large field of view,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.710
and you can still see we maintain

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.770
the resolution to see dendritic spines.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.550
And just a few nice movies.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.250
By combining this with functional imaging,

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.280
now we can do actual large volumetric

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.200
functional imaging at high speed.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.690
So this a 300 Gaussian image
frame of a single neuron,

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.200
labeled in the mouse cortex.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.340
And we can just translate
the Bessel beam six times.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.440
We can cover the same volume,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.850
and in this case, we can
now monitor the activity

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.710
while maintaining the ability
to see individual synapses.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.530
And remember at the beginning of my talk,

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.970
I mentioned the goal
of being able to study

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.810
the input-output relationship
of a single neuron.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.930
Now we really have the
technique to do that,

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.070
you know, awake behaving animal.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.760
The very last example I wanna show

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.290
is when we look at not
just a single neurons,

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.310
but also on cell bodies in our circuit.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.650
So here, we are looking
at an actual large volume.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.290
Those are the inhibitory neurons
from the first 650 micron

00:18:58.282 --> 00:19:00.230
thick in the mouse brain.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.490
And we can image this whole volume,

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.300
1.3 millimeter by three
millimeter by 600 micron volume

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.450
of inhibitory neuron
activity at one hertz.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.450
And we're still doing data analysis,

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.800
but just subset of data
give us about 1,700 neuron

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.800
of the activity information.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.690
So I just wanna quickly summarize.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.440
This work was made by the post-doc Rongwen

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.370
with help from many
biologists and collaborators,

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.280
both inside and outside Janelia.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.206
Thank you very much.
