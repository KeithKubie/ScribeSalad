00:00:00.582 --> 00:00:03.244
- [Voiceover] Let's think
about the infinite series,

00:00:03.244 --> 00:00:06.303
so we're going to go from
n equals one to infinity,

00:00:06.303 --> 00:00:11.259
of one over two to the n plus n.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.590
And what I want to do
is see if we can prove

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.092
whether this thing converges or diverges.

00:00:17.092 --> 00:00:19.089
And as you can imagine based
on the context of where

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.622
this video shows up on
Khan Academy that maybe

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.376
we will do it using the comparison test.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:27.862
At any point if you feel
like you can kinda take

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:29.482
this to the finish line, feel free

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.473
to pause the video and do so.

00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:36.477
So in order to kind of
figure out or get a sense

00:00:36.477 --> 00:00:38.927
for this series right over
here, it never hurts to

00:00:38.927 --> 00:00:41.348
kind of expand it out a
little bit, so let's do that.

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:43.538
So this would be equal
to when n equals one this

00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:46.531
is gonna be one over
two to the one plus one,

00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:48.182
so it's gonna be one over two plus

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:51.506
one, it's gonna be one third
plus that's n equals one.

00:00:51.506 --> 00:00:54.052
When n equals two it's gonna
be one over two squared,

00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:57.763
which is four plus two plus one over six.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:03.224
Plus let's see we go
to three, n equals one,

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:06.526
n equals two, n equals
three is gonna be one over

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:09.457
two to the third, which
is eight plus three is 11.

00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:13.173
So one over 11, maybe
I'll do one more term.

00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:18.141
Two the fourth power is going
to be 16 plus four is 20.

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:22.040
Plus one over 20 and obviously we

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.351
just keep going on and on and on.

00:01:25.394 --> 00:01:30.394
So it looks, it feels like
this thing could converge.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.991
All of our terms are
positive, but they are getting

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.604
smaller and smaller quite fast.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.960
And if we really look at
the behavior of the terms

00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:47.079
as n gets larger and
larger, we see that the two

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.536
to the n in the denominator will grow

00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:51.238
much, much faster than the n will.

00:01:51.504 --> 00:01:55.316
So this kind of behaves
like one over two to the n,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.502
which is a clue of something that we might

00:01:57.502 --> 00:01:59.818
be able to use for the comparison test.

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:01.655
So let me just write that down.

00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:05.573
So we have one over, so
the infinite series from

00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:08.962
n equals one to infinity
of one over two to the n,

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.001
and so when n equals one this is

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:16.396
going to be equal to one half.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.176
When n is equal to two this is

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:21.271
going to be equal to one fourth.

00:02:21.584 --> 00:02:24.305
When n is equal to three
this is equal to one eighth.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.422
When n is equal to four this
is equal to one sixteenth.

00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:29.860
And we go on and on and on and on.

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.958
And what's interesting about
this is we recognize it.

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.907
This is a geometric
series, so let me be clear.

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:38.849
This thing right over here,
that is the same thing

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.849
as the sum of from n
equals one to infinity of

00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:48.691
one half to the n power, just
writing it in a different way.

00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:51.495
And since the absolute
value of one half, which

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:56.495
is just one half, so
because the absolute value

00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:01.786
of one half is less than one we know that

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:05.947
this geometric series converges,
we know that it converges

00:03:05.947 --> 00:03:08.774
And actually we even
have formulas for finding

00:03:08.774 --> 00:03:13.774
the exact sum of or to figure
out what it converges to.

00:03:15.138 --> 00:03:17.980
And so we know this thing
converges and we see that

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.516
actually these two series
combined meet all of the

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:23.361
constraints we need for
the comparison test.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.813
So let's go back to what we
wrote about the comparison test.

00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:31.287
So the comparison test,
we have two series, all

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:33.420
of their terms are greater
than or equal to zero.

00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:35.714
All of these terms are
greater than or equal to zero.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.706
And then for the corresponding
terms in one series,

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:41.337
all of them are going
to be less than or equal

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:42.973
to the corresponding
terms in the next one.

00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:46.847
And so if we look over here,
we can consider this one,

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.377
the magenta series, this
is kind of our infinite

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:53.008
series of dealing with A
sub n and that this right

00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:56.490
over here is, well I
already did it in blue

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.087
this is kind of the blue series.

00:03:58.264 --> 00:04:02.313
And notice all their
terms are nonnegative and

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:07.005
the corresponding terms
one half is greater than

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:09.321
one third, one fourth is
greater than one sixth,

00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:11.551
one eighth is greater than one eleventh.

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.188
One over two to the n is
always going to be greater

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:16.961
than one over two to the n plus n for

00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:19.579
the n that we care about here.

00:04:19.975 --> 00:04:22.109
And since we know that
this converges, since we

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.921
know that the larger one converges.

00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:26.913
It's a geometric series
where the common ratio

00:04:26.913 --> 00:04:29.783
the absolute value of
the common ratio is less

00:04:29.783 --> 00:04:32.339
than one, since we know
that the larger series

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.637
converges therefore, the
smaller series or the

00:04:35.637 --> 00:04:38.207
one where every corresponding
term is less than

00:04:38.207 --> 00:04:42.167
the one in the blue one,
that one must also converge.

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:47.473
So by the comparison test the series

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:52.633
in question must also converge.
