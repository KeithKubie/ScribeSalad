00:00:00.742 --> 00:00:02.700
HENRY NEWTON-DUNN: Cars
are integral to the way

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.620
people live their lives today.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.870
We use cars for taking
our kids to school.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.970
We use our cars for
commuting to work.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.110
But when we look at
cars today, they're

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.970
fundamentally
disconnected vehicles.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.220
PATRICK BRADY: People don't
want to check their phones

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.180
at the door when they
get behind the wheel.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.380
So we partnered with auto
manufacturers and technology

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.080
partners to figure
out the best way

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.020
to bring Android into the car.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.760
Today we're announcing
Android Auto,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.320
which extends the Android
platform into the car.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.960
Android Auto combines
the best of both worlds.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.660
You get the connected apps and
services on your smartphone

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.390
with the physical
controls that were

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.160
optimized for
driving in your car.

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:42.950
We had to go back
to the drawing board

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.750
and really take
an experience that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.240
was designed for a
smartphone, and break it down

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.302
to its bare essentials.

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:50.510
HENRY NEWTON-DUNN: We focused
it down to the features

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.370
that the user really needs
within the driving space.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.850
We've made Google Maps really
easy to use for the car.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.645
We've got nice, easy-to-access
touch targets and a simplified

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:01.430
interface.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.319
The voice technology that
we're using within the car

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.489
is super conversational.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280
PATRICK BRADY: Your
hands are on the wheel.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.417
Your eyes are on the road.

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:10.500
MALE SPEAKER: Set a reminder
to get gas on the way

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.360
back to work.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
Pick up my dry cleaning.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.069
Remind me to get
tickets on the way home.

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.526
PATRICK BRADY: Google brings
you just the right information

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:17.890
at just the right time.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.150
So when you set reminders
while you're driving,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.840
your phone will
remind you later on,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.900
even if you're outside the car.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.000
Android developers will soon
be able to create entirely

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.135
new experiences for the car.

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:32.760
HENRY NEWTON-DUNN: We're really
excited about this opportunity.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.980
Because for us, this is really
very much at the beginning.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.070
And we're really going to
go a long journey with this.
