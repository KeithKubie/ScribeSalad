SNORT can be configured as in-line or
passive.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.380
In the passive mode, it simply
copies and monitors traffic, and

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.080
the traffic does not pass through SNORT.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.440
That is, with the passive mode, SNORT
is configured for intrusion detection.
