Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Last time we talked about the book of revelation and I ended up by saying, uh, trying to place a revelation in the context of Roman politics and the imperial cult. Uh, clearly this author, whoever wrote revelation, and it is somebody named John, all those who said, it's not the same John who wrote the gospels are wrote the letters. It's not John Son of [inaudible] is just some of the guy named John. John was a very common name for Jews in the first century. So it's not uncommon that we have a guy named John, but don't know exactly who he is in relation to be anybody else in early Christianity. One of the things that I ended, but it was by saying, let's imagine his politics. This is clearly an anti Roman document. That's the one thing we can say about it for sure. Who would write this and why would he write it to these seven, uh, these seven letters to these seven churches that we have in revelation.

Speaker 1:          00:56          One way to think about this is if this document was written toward the last part of the first century, uh, as a lot of scholars think it is, he may, this may be an, and I said, remember his Greek is bad. He doesn't write Greek. Well, sometimes it's even grammatically wrong in places, uh, is just not bad Greek, even though we don't have really good Greek and most of the New Testament. But this is the worst. How do you think of someone who is against eating meat? Sacrificed to idols? Seems to think of himself as a true Jew and the Jews who are occupying synagogues in different parts of Asia minor as not true, Jews anti women as far as their roles in the churches. He, there's nothing we know about this one when he calls Jezza Bell, except that he's using this nickname from the old testament for a whore like, uh, idolatrous woman Jezza Bell and labeling some Christian woman who's a leader in some of these, one of these churches, he's labeling her with this terrible term.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Uh, and I suggested maybe he's actually writing against the kind of Christianity we see represented by Paul's churches, which were right there in these places such as ethicists and Smyrna that he's writing too. Because Paul's churches actually have people in them who are fairly well off. In some cases, they seem to be fairly comfortable with Roman culture. They may have their own businesses, they have their own slaves. Uh, there are women leaders in Paul's churches. Paul allows that sort of thing. As some of you have pointed out in your papers on that, um, and they believe it's okay to eat meat sacrificed to idols, which this author seems to think is idolatrous in itself. So I suggested that maybe this guy is riding Rome rep revelation precisely to attack the kind of, uh, Christianity we see represented in Paul's on letters. What kind of person might this be?

Speaker 1:          02:46          One way is just to imagine, and this is pure speculation, pure imagination. What if this guy had come from Palestine himself? Maybe he lived through the Jewish war of 70 [inaudible] 70 when the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed and Jerusalem was overrun by the Romans. Thousands of Jews were taken into slavery and taken to Rome and sold off to be slaves. And, uh, the land was devastated to a certain extent. Maybe he lived through that war and that increased his hatred of the Romans. And he gets to western Asia Minor. He's traveling around other parts of the Metro, eastern Mediterranean. He gets to western Asia Minor. And here he doesn't see followers of Jesus who aren't like him. Poor, uh, not very well educated, perhaps hateful of the Roman empire and sit and see themselves as being oppressed by the Roman Empire. He sees Christians who think that their followers of Jesus also, but they're fairly comfortable in their world.

Speaker 1:          03:44          They live in a comfortable Greek and Greco Roman urban environments. And so he writes revelation to try to shake them up, to get them to hate roam as much as he hates Rome, to get them to be just as wary of the imperial cult as he is. So that's one picture definitely have of early Christianity that we see an anti Roman kind of politics. The live question this week. And the question you'll be talking about in your discussion groups on Thursday and Friday and some of you will be writing papers about is what is the politics of early Christianity in some of the old Hollywood type days. The idea was the, uh, early Christianity where it was a movement of slaves are all completely poor people and Rome was always going around persecuting early Christian groups. And there's these little bands of early Christians huddled in dining room somewhere huddled in, in the catacombs and Romer huddled in caves.

Speaker 1:          04:38          Well, that's Hollywood. The Romans actually didn't pay that much attention to the early Christian groups at all until much later than this. There was no coherent persecution attempt by the Romans against the, uh, the Jesus movement at any time until much later, uh, in history. So you don't have Rome taking even notice of most of these little house churches, uh, founded by Paul and other Christian missionaries, uh, for the first several decades. And so you had actually a variety of ways that these people themselves related to Rome as an empire and we, and so we see that with revelation. We see this heavily anti Roman view. But remember what Paul said in Romans 13 let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God. And those authorities that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore, whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed. So God has appointed the Roman governors according to what Paul is saying here. And those who resist will incur judgment for rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad government. Roman governors are a threat only to people who are bad, not to good. The writer of revelation would disagree with that completely it. This is crazy. Do you wish to have no fear of the authority? Then do what is good and you'll receive its approval for it is God's servant for your good.

Speaker 2:          06:09          Okay?

Speaker 1:          06:09          But if you do what is wrong? You should be afraid for the authority does not bear the sword in vain. It is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer. So the Roman governor, from Paul's perspective, at least as he puts it there in Romans 13 is actually God's servant to punish wrongdoing, completely different view of Roman power that we then we had in revelation. So where do the different documents of early Christianity? Remember we've stressed in the whole course. The diversity of early Christianity is different Christianities in the first century. Where did the different documents align up on their politics? Are they revolutionary or are they accommodating to power? Are they pro ramen? Are they anti Roman? And we've already got now two seemingly opposite positions except look over at first Corinthians. Now remember, you have to have your bibles with you.

Speaker 1:          07:07          First Corinthians two verse six. Yet among the mature we do, we do speak wisdom. Though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are doomed to perish, but we speak God's wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood this for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. Now, Paul knows that the Romans crucified Jesus. They're almonds. Crucifixion is not a Jewish punishment that would be stoning. So in the Jewish leaders wanted to punish somebody with death and Jerusalem, they had, they got a mob together and they stoned the person. Stoning was the Jewish means of capital punishment. Crucifixion was the Roman means of capital punishment. Paul knows this, so is he here talking about these authorities who crucified Jesus?

Speaker 1:          08:03          That is the Romans. Pilot obviously is a governor of Judea at the time, but pilot was simply the representative of the Senate and the emperor. So as Paul blaming the Senate and the emperor for the crucifixion of Jesus here, what does it mean by rulers? So you have some scholars who use this text to say, well, even in spite of what Paul says in Romans 13 Paul doesn't have any great love in his heart for Rome. He still believes that they are evil powers who crucified Jesus. They're in the, they're in the process of perishing as we speak, and they'll certainly be destroyed by God when Jesus comes back on the clouds with his holy Angel Army. But other scholars say, no. The word here for ruler are con in the Greek could refer to superhuman and Jelic kinds of powers we would call supernatural powers.

Speaker 1:          08:58          So just Paula is Paul talking here about sort of say, tannic, angelic powers that rule the cosmos. Because remember we've talked about apocalyptic world view, and one of the aspects of an apocalyptic world view is that different countries have these angelic forces, these angelic leaders that are the true power behind their government or behind their nation. So in Daniel, we've got the prince of Persia is understood as this angel who runs Persia. So every nation has these angelic powers, are satanic powers because of course Satan is himself a depicted as an angel in the UN, in the Jewish Bible. So is Satan just one of many kinds of powers like this or our rulers of the cosmos. And is Paul actually talking about Angelic Superhuman Powers here that crucified Jesus rather than, than the Romans? Or as some scholars would do say, and I'm in this last camp, maybe he's talking about both.

Speaker 1:          10:00          Maybe Paul is including the Romans in this, these rulers who ignorantly crucified Jesus, and so we'll be destroyed. But maybe Paul also believes that the Romans are themselves controlled by superhuman, say Tannic, angelic powers. If that's how you read First Corinthians two, then Paul's view of Rome isn't quite as positive, just straightforwardly positive as you would get from Romans 13. Right? So when you ask scholars, uh, this question, is early Christianity politically revolutionary against Rome, or is it politically accommodating? You're going to get scholars lining up on both sides of this. Some of them say no, they read, they read, or the Christianity is, for the most part, revolutionary and anti Rome. Others say, no, it was accommodating. They were fairly conservative and comfortable. So this is a place we, we assigned this topic for your papers this week because this is actually something where there's a live debate that goes on among scholars themselves.

Speaker 1:          10:58          There's not one correct answer to this question. It's complicated, so it's a good thing for you to look at. Of course, we, we've already read Luke and acts two and Luke and acts. That author seems to present Rome and kind of a strange, ambiguous way. On the one hand, the author goes out of his way to have Roman governor after Roman governor say that Jesus is innocent. Paul is innocent. This movement is innocent. They're not revolutionary. Paul is eventually taken to Rome, but it's after the governor said, well, I could release him. I don't see anything that this guy has done. It's just a dispute among Jews and yet Paul appeals to the emperor, so he is sent to Rome in the book of acts. But all these Roman governors declare that Christianity is not politically insurrectionist so that it looks like the author is actually riding almost a more apologetic book about the Romans except then is that the people that pointed out, all of these Roman rulers come across looking like they're rather incompetent and powerless.

Speaker 1:          12:00          They almost can't seem to control the mobs that are around them. They can't seem to really resist the Jewish leaders who want to accuse Paul of being insurrectionist, so is wrong presented in the book of acts and and the gospel of Luke as a good force or a bad force or an ambiguous force. Now what we've got is the letters were going to the documents we're going to look at here first. Let's get second Thessalonians. We've looked already at some of these documents that seem clearly to be anti Rome such as the book of revelation. Second decile Odians is one of these letters of Paul that some scholars believe Paul actually wrote and other scholars believe he did not write. I tend to be on the camp that said he probably did not write second Thessalonians, but unlike Ephesians and Colossians and the pastoral epistles where it's much clearer that they're written in a very different style of Greek than Paul's seven undisputed letters.

Speaker 1:          13:05          Second Thessalonians is actually the Greek of second as lungs actually looks pretty much like Paul's Greek, so you can't throw second Thessaloniki ins out of the authentic epistles of Paul on the basis of the Greek style like we can. I think some of the other letters that claimed to be by Paul. Why is it that I say say, I don't think second Thessalonians is by Paul? Well, for one thing, this is not so important, but we'll get to it in a minute. He actually has a message in second Thessalonians about the coming of Jesus that seems to contradict what he'd been saying in first Thessalonians in first Thessalonians. He says, it's coming very soon. Get ready, don't go to sleep. Jesus is coming back and the Paris or will happen is all going to happen very soon. And he says, no, we don't know exactly when it's gonna happen, but it's going to happen very soon.

Speaker 1:          13:52          In Second Thessalonians, as we'll see, he actually says, no, no, no, no. Don't quit work or anything. Don't quit your day job because some of the people and desolate Annika according to this author seem to have quit their jobs because they're ready for Jesus to come back so soon. He says, no, no, you should still be working. There is going to be a few things that'll happen first before the end comes and then he lays out a timeline of what he's expecting to happen. And I'm going to walk you through that timeline in a minute. So some scholars who said what second Thessalonians teaches about the end time and the coming back of Jesus differs enough from what Paul had actually said about it in first Thessalonians, that it might be written by a different person at a different time in a different situation. That's one argument.

Speaker 1:          14:36          I think the more convincing argument to me is if you take the beginning of first Thessalonians, I mean the beginning of second Thessalonians and the end of second Thessalonians and you put them side by side with parts of first Thessalonians, they look very, very much alike. Now wait a minute, they look alike. So that means they're not by Paul. This is what I'm thinking when you, if, if I'm, if Paul is going to sit down and write another letter, the second [inaudible] is he going to do so with the copy of first Thessalonians in front of him?

Speaker 1:          15:12          Is he going to do so even recalling the same words and phrases that he used in the previous letter? I don't think so. In other words, I think second testimonials in certain parts of it looks suspiciously too much like first Thessalonians to be an authentic leader by Paul because when people write another letter, they use different words they so that you don't sit down and basically repeat words and phrases and things from your previous letter. So that made the one place where you don't sign. Find those words and phrases being the same is precisely in the second chapter of Second Thessalonians, that middle part where this author is teaching a different timeline for the end time than first Thessalonians head. So in my mind I'm thinking, okay, if you want to ride a pseudonymous letter and claim to be by Paul, how do you make it convincing?

Speaker 1:          16:05          Well, if you knew first Thessalonians is a letter, you might actually take that as a model and read for assessment is carefully and imitate the style and imitate even what's said. But then you stick in the second chapter of Second Thessalonians where you give your own timeline for what you think is going to happen. So that's why I think it's probably not by Paul, but scholars kind of divide up on second Thessalonians and a lot of different ways with many scholars, even critical scholars who don't believe Paul wrote all the letters that are in his name in the New Testament and they'll say they still think Paul did right? Second vessel onions. But now what's the goal of writing? And here's what, let's look at this chapter two, the first 12 verses of chapter two. Now read along with me so you'll know I'm not lying to you because every time I get a chance I like to lie to students, lead them astray as to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and are being gathered together to him.

Speaker 1:          16:59          We beg you brothers. Again, it doesn't say sisters in the original Greek, not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarm, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as though from us to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here. So he's mentioning there may have been a letter circulated in Paul's name claiming that the resurrection has already happened. The day of the Lord has already come. So there's a reference to notice how if this letter is synonymous as I claim there's a reference to a pseudonymous letter in the pseudonymous letter. That's actually not unusual in the ancient world. Sometimes if you're riding a pseudonymous letter, you'll put a reference, say, well now some people been circulating synonymous letters by me and I condemn them for it. Of course it's in a letter. That probably itself is pseudonymous. That's irony, irony. We see in some of these ancient letters, let no one deceive you in any way for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed.

Speaker 1:          17:57          Okay. The lawless one, what's the talking about here? The one destined for destruction. He opposes and exalts himself above every so called God or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God. So this is something like another sort of antichrist figure that we've seen in the book of Daniel. Uh, Jesus in his own little apocalypse in mark 13 other places talks about the abomination of desolation being set up in the temple. Uh, so this author is saying this person is going to call himself God and set himself up in the temple in Jerusalem. Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you and you know what is now restraining him so that he may be revealed when his time comes. Okay? Now the risk, the thing restraining him comes from one Greek word cut tech on and it means something holding back or something holding, holding back something.

Speaker 1:          18:54          And we can't tell necessarily here whether this is talking about a thing, a power or a person. Is there a person who's keeping this guy back in the wings who's not letting this a divine self promoter settings and set himself up in Jerusalem for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but only until the one who now restrains is removed. Ah, so this restraining force, our risk training thing are restraining person is at some point going to be removed from the geographic, from the political scene, and then this other characters is going to come in and then the lawless one will be revealed.

Speaker 3:          19:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:38          Whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with the breadth of his mouth annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming. The coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of Satan who uses all power signs, lying wonders, every kind of wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refuse to love the truth and soul be saved. For this reason, God sends them a powerful delusion. Leading them to believe what is false so that all who have not believed the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned. What's going on here? Well, there's some extent your guess is as good as mine, except that I know a bit more about ancient Jewish apocalyptic and so I have a few resources to draw on. For one thing though, I think what's going on here is this author is referring to some kind of antichrist figure.

Speaker 1:          20:23          He doesn't use the term here, but he's clearly saying this is someone who's setting himself up as as divine has god. He's going to take a seat in the temple in Jerusalem and he's going to proclaim himself to be God, or perhaps he's also referring to a messianic pretender. Maybe he's thinking that this will be another messiah, a false messiah of sorts. That is the anti Christ. If that's true, then what was he imagined going on? I think what he's doing, and this is my speculation, I think he's actually imagining a Jewish false messiah, this cert, somewhere hidden. He knows not where there's some guy somewhere in Palestine or someplace else who's hiding in the wings, waiting for the moment when he can come out, declare himself as the Messiah and enter the Jerusalem temple and set himself up as the Divine Messiah figure. If so, what's keeping him from doing it now?

Speaker 1:          21:19          Well, maybe it's just some supernatural force. Maybe it's even God. Maybe as God has just decided it's not yet time for this to happen. But what if the thing that's keeping them from doing it now is precisely the Romans. In other words, the force that's keeping any Jewish Messiah figure down now would be the Roman empire. They're not allowing kings. No. Look what they did with Jesus. They also executed other, uh, Messiah figures in the first century. The author therefore sees the Roman emperor at work and the Roman Empire, and that's the thing, restraining this false messiah from setting up shop in Jerusalem, but he says that's going to be taken away. How's that going to happen? Again, we don't know. But in my mind, it's the idea that somehow the Roman emperor is going to be moved out of the way by God when the time comes for this all to happen.

Speaker 1:          22:11          And then there's Jewish Messiah was set himself up and then Jesus will come in, destroy the false messiah, and that's when we'll have the setting up of the real kingdom of God. Now, as I said, that's speculation, but what I'm doing is saying what kind of scenario is he possibly imagining? But the reason I do this little scenario is because what would be this guy's view of Rome and the relationship between the Christian movement, the Jesus Movement and Rome? Well, he, if my little scenarios right, he doesn't see Rome as simply an a whole heartedly negative thing. Rome actually has a purpose in God's plan. Rome's purpose is to keep back this false Jewish Messiah from appearing. And then when that purpose has done, God will remove the Roman Empire from being, uh, uh, political, uh, geopolitical force. And then the beginning, the real beginning of the end time schedule will kick into gear and Jesus will come through, destroy this lawless one, the one set of false messiah also destroy the Romans preps and set up the Kingdom of God.

Speaker 1:          23:16          But what that does is that gives us another, another look at what an author may have conceived Rome to be. And it's not nearly as negative as the revelation offer author. It may not also be completely positive either because he still sees Rome apparently is being destroyed in the end. So second Thessalonians though therefore looks like a case where someone's writing a letter in Paul's name precisely to counter the idea that Jesus is coming back tomorrow. And because he believes you have to have a certain number of things that are going to happen, it's still is fairly soon in the future. He's not, he's not expecting a thousand years or anything like that, but he's seems to believe that there's gonna be a timeline of geopolitical events that take place before Jesus comes back. So that second Thessalonians, any questions, comments or outburst about that before I move on? Yes sir.

Speaker 4:          24:13          Is it possible that to give it the cult of the Roman emperor or here

Speaker 1:          24:19          that he might be referring to the Roman emperor here? Uh, it could be, uh, in fact, uh, that that's possibly the way some things set up. But the thing, the reason I don't think it's the Roman emperor, here's because he talks about this character as if he's hidden for the moment. It's a mystery and the won't, he's not revealed the Roman emperor. You could have never said here was not, was not revealed. The Roman emperor was visible everywhere you looked in the Mediterranean. It's time, statues, inscriptions, temples. So I think he's probably not talking to the Roman emperor as the lawless one that cause the Roman emperor wasn't hidden at the time.

Speaker 4:          24:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:53          Any other questions?

Speaker 1:          24:56          Okay. Now though, let's look at first Peter. So we're going to another little text that asking again the same question. What is the politics of the early Christian movement? The early Jesus Movement? First Peter, by most of us scholars, we don't believe Peter Actually wrote it. Um, the reasons are again, numerous. And notice, this is not an anonymous letter like a, the letters of John are that don't claim to be written by John. This one actually claims to be written by Peter the Apostle as does second Peter. Why do we think Peter the actual apostle didn't write it well? For one thing, Peter was even as, uh, the new testament several times, lets us know an illiterate fishermen, he probably couldn't read or write if he could read or write. He, it's almost certain that he couldn't read or write Greek at the level of Greek that this letter is written.

Speaker 1:          25:55          There are other things in the letter that make us think that it looks like a Christianity in a little bit later stage than the very primitive area of Christianity. The development of doctrine, the development of, of the notions of Peter himself. Uh, the idea that that certainly the theology of the letter seemed to look later than the most primitive time of early Christianity. But most of us would just say simply on the basis of the language itself. Uh, we don't believe the Peter, the actual apostle wrote this letter. So look what he's, he's, he's right. He says, he says, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to the exiles of the dispersion in punches, Galicia, Kappa Dosha, Asia and Bithynia. So again, he's writing to, he calls them exiles of the dispersion so that some people might think, well, these talking to Jews then the, the disperse Jews, but he clearly including gentile Christians in this too.

Speaker 1:          26:46          So he's talking about, uh, followers of Jesus who live in all these different, this different geographical area. And again, this is sort of what we would now call Turkey, the area of Turkey, both Asia minor, which proper was just the western side of Turkey, but pretty much all that area of that occupies Turkey. Now he calls them exiles though. And I don't think he's talking about this in an actual political sense. He spiritualizing the notion that followers of Jesus are exiles in our world. We don't belong here. He says. So he says also, um, one 17, if you invoke his father, the one who judges all people impartially according to these live in reverent fear during the time of your exile. Again, followers of Jesus are exiles to 11. Beloved, I urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh, that wage war against the soul.

Speaker 1:          27:45          These are great terms that would have meant in the ancient context precisely what illegal alien means. And I'm co contemporary American context. You're here illegally. So all the followers of Jesus, according to a rider, live in the Roman Empire as illegal aliens basically are not illegal aliens, but definitely is aliens. Maybe they're illegal aliens, but they don't really belong. So he also said, he's talking not just to Jews. He says in one 18, you know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors, not with perishable things like silver and gold, with the precious body of Christ's blood of Christ. So the ancestors referring here, he's clearly from to gentiles who have come into the church, uh, as gentiles, and then now occupy their role, uh, as people, as part of this alien people to now, what's this guy's politics? Look at two 13 for the Lord's sake, except the authority of every human institution.

Speaker 1:          28:47          Uh, now we're pretty clear that the authority here is not at least just referring to angelic type supernatural authorities, but he's referring to the human rulers, whether of the impo emperor as supreme or of governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do. Right? Of course, the governors of the different parts of the Roman empire were appointed either by the Senate or by the emperor himself. This author's not too neat about, uh, the actual politics of the first century. So He seems to believe that all go rub governors are appointed by the emperor, which was in fact not the case, but some of them weren't. Many of them are appointed by the Senate. He doesn't care about those kinds of niceties. For it is God's will that by doing right, you should silence the ignorance of the foolish as servants of God live as free people.

Speaker 1:          29:37          Yet do not use your freedom as a pretext for evil. Honor everyone. Love the family of believers. Fear God. Honor the emperor. Can you imagine the author of revelation saying that he could not, it would have broken his jaw to say, honor the emperor. He also doesn't seem to have a whole lot of love for just people in general. The, the book of revelation seems to have a lot of loyalty for the people who are in the group, but there seems to be a lot of despising for pretty much anybody outside the group. So that's the political conservatism of first Peter. He's writing a letter to followers of Jesus who live throughout the area of Turkey. He's trying to get them to see that they don't really belong to Rome. They're not Romans, he doesn't, doesn't address them as Romans. They don't really belong to the political situations they're living in.

Speaker 1:          30:28          They should see themselves as aliens, as exiles and yet they're still see themselves as properly subservient, honorable, well behaved exiles in a Roman context. And so that plays itself out also in some of the other, uh, social justice issues in this, in the politics. Look at two 18, right where we stopped after. He says, honor the emperor slaves, except the authority of your masters with all deference, not only those who are kind and gentle, but also those who are harsh for it as a credit to you. If B, being aware of God, you're endure pain while suffering unjustly. If you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong, what credit is that? If you endure, when you do write and suffer for it, you have God's approval. This is ideologically very problematic. Telling slaves, you know, just submit. And if you're being beaten, don't blame your master for beating you.

Speaker 1:          31:25          Just endure it. I mean, if you do wrong and your master beats you, then you deserve to get beaten, but you should endure it even when you get beaten for things you don't deserve. Talk about the opiate of the masses. This is precisely the kind of religion that classical Marxism critiques or religion that exists to keep the slaves, the slave, to keep the poor poor, to keep the downtrodden, downtrodden. So part of the honoring of the emperor is to teach slaves just to submit. And if you can't enjoy it when you're being beaten, at least put up with it. Look at, uh, three, one through seven wives in the same way except the authority of your husbands. My mom used to always hate it when that read out these passages in church, we'd have a very loud discussion of such patches. It's over Sunday dinner then after this wives in the same way except the authority of your husbands. So that even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives conduct. She used to. Some of these women are followers of Jesus and their husbands are not Christians. They should still obey them. Though he says he doesn't allow women to use their Christian allegiance, uh, and there the Lordship of Christ over them to get out from under the Lordship of their husbands.

Speaker 2:          32:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:45          Do not adorn yourself outwardly by braiding your hair, by wearing gold ornaments are fine clothing. Rather, let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God's sight. My mom especially hated that gentle and quiet spirit part. She had no intentions of being a very gentle and quiet spirit. It wasn't this way long ago. Did the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves by accepting the authority of their husbands. And he goes on like that and they look at five five chapter five verse five. In the same way you who are younger must accept the authority of elders. And all of you must clothe yourselves with humility in the dealings with one another. For God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. So in all of this stuff, this author is basically telling people, stay in your place. No revolution, no rebellion. Don't even resent the people who are over you and have authority over you. So this is quite clearly political, quieting them political accommodation. Uh, and one of the reasons he's doing this as scholars appointed is that he seems to believe that Christians can help their reputation if they don't rock the boat. So you get versus like this to 12,

Speaker 1:          34:07          conduct yourselves honorably among the gentiles. Now notice he's, these are some, these are converted gentiles themselves, but he doesn't call them gentiles because the gentiles is still now a term for those people outside the body of Christ, outside of Christianity, conduct yourselves honorably among the gentiles so that though they malign you as evil doers, they may see your honorable deeds and glorify God when he comes to judge. And in chapter three verse 15

Speaker 2:          34:30          okay,

Speaker 1:          34:32          in your heart, sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you and accounting for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence. So he's basically very conservative in his politics and his ideology. For one reason, he wants these groups of followers of Jesus not to be disrespected by outsiders. He wants them to develop a good reputation so that they can't be persecuted so that they can't be opposed by local authorities. So here we have a clear case of a totally different ideological take on early Christianity, but it's still apocalyptic. This is what's interesting. He's still this, hi, hi. This other hasn't thrown away. The Christian apocalyptic that we saw working so much in revelation to be anti Roman. He still has it. You can see places. He says in chapter four, verse seven, the end of all things is near.

Speaker 1:          35:24          Well, that's apocalyptic. Cism the end is near. Therefore, be serious and discipline yourself for the sake of your prayers. Uh, in four 12, beloved, do not be surprised by the fiery ordeal that is taking place you to test you as though something strange were happening to you. So any suffering that you have, he says chocolate up to the suffering that comes with the apocalyptic fire. This is testing you. So again, just endure it. And 17 for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God? So he does believe that the people who are persecuting them now are dissing them. Now, I'm not so sure that sometimes it was astrical physical persecution in these communities were enduring. He may just believe that they're being disrespected, that they're being discriminated against in some way.

Speaker 1:          36:12          But what his solution to this is for them not to rock the boat, not to rebel, not to fight back, but actually to just be good boys and girls. Be Submissive. Slaves, be submissive women to your husbands. And then, uh, if possible, people will see your submission and that'll make them respect the message of the Gospel. If not, those people will be destroyed. But we have to into our own punishment and serving. Now also the apocalyptic, they apocalyptic material here there serves a different purpose than it did in revelation and some other Christian and Jewish texts. It's not particularly there to make you to explain your suffering. It's just there to be endured. It's just there because it's part of the message of early Christianity. So it doesn't really help fight against injustice in any way as you might be able to see it doing other texts.

Speaker 1:          37:00          Now, how does this happen in second, Peter, we'll just look at this briefly because we're almost out of time, but I show you one more thing. I believe second Peter was written by someone else, not Peter again for some of the same reasons, but I also believe it was not written by the same person who wrote first Peter because it's rather different. In fact, I believe Second Peter was written sometime in the second century, maybe even decades after the letters of Paul and, and the book of revelation and these others were written. And it seems to me to show a different stage in the development of Christianity, Christianity. Now it looks different in the second century than it did in the first century. And I'll walk you through this and show why I say that and how it works. First look at second Peter Three two.

Speaker 1:          37:43          Well, we'll start reading at the beginning of chapter three. This is now beloved. The second letter I'm writing to you. Ah, so he seems to know about the existence of the first letter of Peter in them. I'm trying to arouse your sincere intention by reminding you so that you should remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles. So this is already something like a post epistolic letter. He's hearkening back to the beginning of the Christian movement when they were prophets and apostles, even though he's setting himself up as Peter the Apostle in the letter, the tone of the letter makes it sound like the apostolic era is somewhere in the past for, for this guy's a version of Christianity for his community. So we read second Peter is actually a really good example of post epistolic new testament writing. He also has references to the gospels themselves. Look at one 17.

Speaker 1:          38:42          Uh, I'll start reading at one 16 for we did not follow cleverly, cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. But we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty, for he had received for he received honor and glory from God the father. When that voice was conveyed to him by the majestic glory saying, this is my son, my beloved, with whom I am well pleased. We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven. When we were with him on the Holy Mountain, what is he referring to? What's the event exactly? The transfiguration. He's red, his gospels, at least one of them. And he's hearkening back to the story of the transfiguration of Jesus on the mountain with Moses and Elijah there. And of course who were the apostles? The disciples were with Jesus at the time, Peter and, and was one of them. There were three of them. So Peter was there and he's recalling that scene from the gospels. So there's reference to Gospel traditions here and maybe even he's actually read some written gospels that we have in our text. Uh, he also says because something like a reference to first Peter is, I already said that my, when he says I've already written to you once, that could be a reference to first Peter. And then he talks about Paul's letters. So he knows Paul's letters. Three 15 wait, is that right?

Speaker 1:          40:01          Yep. Sorry, we get three 14. Therefore beloved, while you are waiting for these things, strive to be found by him at peace, without spot or blemish and regard the patients of our Lord as salvation. So also our brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him. Speaking of this, as he does in all his letters, there are some things in them hard to understand, which are the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction as they do the other scriptures, you therefore beloved. So he goes on to admonish them, but notice what he's doing. He actually calls Paul's letters scripture. Now, Paul, when he was writing his letters, he thought he was riding authoritative letters, but there were authoritative because he was an apostle who had founded the churches. Most of the time he was writing to churches. He himself found it so he felt like he had authority over these churches to write authoritative letters, but Paul didn't think he was writing scripture.

Speaker 1:          40:55          When Paul talks about scripture in his letters, he's talking about Jewish scripture, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. This guy though is far enough removed from Paul's own day that he can actually refer to Paul's letters as themselves. Part of scripture. That's one of the things we run. The reason we think this took a while to develop. You just don't have in early Christianity the automatic acceptance of Paul's occasional letters because they were real letters written to real situations. Being elevated now to the status of holy writing scripture. This author is living now in a post epistolic age in a post Pauline age and he's, he obviously he's is probably by this time, they don't, they don't have a new testament yet, but probably about this time, he's already familiar with maybe a collection of Paul's letters that are being circulated as scripture among different churches in Asia Minor. He also may, as I said, be be familiar with some gospels that are being circulated as off authoritative texts in early Christianity. So he's clearly living in a later time. Like I said, maybe in the second century when these things have happened. And then one last thing that is interesting to, to talk about, uh, what keep your finger there in second Peter, but we're going to look at Jude. So flip over to Jude, which is right before revelation.

Speaker 2:          42:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:18          Jude is a short little letter. Jude 14.

Speaker 2:          42:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:28          It was also about these, he's talking about Tom Evil angels are angels of some sort. That Enoch member Enoch is that character in the very, very early part of genesis who was only a few generations from Adam. But there were apocalypses written and Enoch's name and published just in the last century or so before this, that, uh, two sec, two or three centuries before this. So we have different, uh, different documents called the apocalypse of Enoch or the revelation of [inaudible] you knock itself, Enoch in the seventh generation from Adam prophesied saying, see the Lord is coming with 10 thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict every one of the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against.

Speaker 2:          43:19          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          43:20          So notice what he's doing. He's quoting, he knock it literature, which isn't in our Bible as if it is also true prophecy in scripture from Enoch. Okay? Now that's what Jude does. It's not, it's important because he's having a debate about angels. But now look over at second Peter Two 10

Speaker 2:          43:46          is this right? Yes.

Speaker 1:          43:51          I'm not going to read all of this, but um, if you look at, if you read second Peter Two Verses 10 through 22, you have a bunch of material that second Peter is getting out of Jude. In other words, second Peter, they're all three second Peter doesn't only know the letters of Paul, he knows Jude also and he's using Jude as a source and he copied some of that out. But what's interesting enough, he takes out the quotation from Enoch. He doesn't have that. And there was, he takes Jude as a good Christian source, but he takes out the stuff he found in Jude that he doesn't consider good Christian material and Christian scripture. So he edits out of Jude stuff that by that time he believes is not really part of Christian scripture. What again, what this shows us is that their author of second Peter is living in a time when we actually see the beginning of Christian scripture coming about.

Speaker 1:          44:46          This is a very different time from the epistolic period when they were just writing letters, occasional letters for different purposes, not having any idea that they were creating a new testament themselves. This author is not living in the time by which we have a new testament that'll take another few centuries to come about. As I talked about the very first lecture when I talked about Canon development, that's going to happen, but he's certainly living in a time that's between the epistolic period when everything is much more chaotic and there's not any Christian scripture. And now you do have Christian scripture scripture on its way to becoming its own canon. So Ha. So this isn't a post epistolic period. So the last thing is what does the apocalyptic do here? Look at three verse three Second Peter Three verse three because there is apocalyptic here also. First, you must understand this, that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and indulging their own lusts and saying, where is the promise of his coming for?

Speaker 1:          45:43          Ever since our ancestors died, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation. Notice that's gotta be posts. Peter Peter in his own time would never have talked about. The beginning of the Jesus movement is happening way, way in there with our ancestors, right? They deliberately ignore this fact that by the word of God, the heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water through which the world of that time was diluted with water and perished by the same word. The present heavens and earth had been reserved for fire, had been kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the goddess. So he believes this end is coming, this end of fire, the destruction of the current world, but do not ignore this one fact, beloved that with the Lord, one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day.

Speaker 1:          46:26          The Lord is not slow about his promise as some think of slowness, but is patient with you not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise. The elements will be dissolved with fire and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed so that he does have an apocalyptic scenario, but what does it do for him? Nothing. It's just something that's part of Christian doctrine that he's passing on. He's not, there's no franticness here. There's no idea that it's going to happen right now. In fact, he says it could happen in a thousand years. We're no longer with this letter in a kind of Christianity that has apocalyptic fervor to it. We're in a kind of Christianity that is starting to have its own Christian scripture, this fairly conservative, again, politically that you don't see a lot of stuff against Rome in that sort of thing, and the function of the apocalyptic apocalyptic autism here is simply us.

Speaker 1:          47:24          Just something you believe if you're a Christian. Again, it's another example. Apocalyptic is a political ideology, but what kind of politics it teaches in the early times of Christianity can very apocalyptic, can be something that strengthens you against Roman oppression that labels Rome for you as a whore and Jessebelle and a monster. Or it can teach you to be quiet and go about your business. So one of the things you're going to be talking about today and your in your sections is which kinds of texts and early Christianity that we've looked at function what way politically and apocalyptic is one of those political kinds of forces in early Christianity, although certainly not the only one. You're supposed to look at these texts and say what politics is assumed by these texts. So you next week.
