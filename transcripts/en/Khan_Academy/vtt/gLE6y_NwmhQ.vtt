00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.768
- In a previous video
we talked about trying

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:06.328
to estimate a population
mean with a sample mean

00:00:06.328 --> 00:00:08.716
and then constructing
a confidence interval

00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:10.304
about that sample mean.

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:12.154
And we talked about different scenarios.

00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:15.610
We could use a Z table plus the true

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.558
population standard deviation,

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:20.138
and that actually would construct

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:22.141
pretty valid confidence intervals,

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.172
but the problem is you don't know

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:25.358
the population standard deviation.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.932
And so you might try to us a Z table

00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:29.505
to find your critical values

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:31.685
plus the sample standard deviation,

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.971
but what we talked about
is this doesn't actually

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.001
do a good job of calculating
our confidence intervals,

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.621
and we're gonna see that
experimentally in a few seconds.

00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.620
And so instead we have
something called a t-statistic

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.563
where if we want our critical
value we use a t-table

00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:46.421
instead of a z-table.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.592
And then we use that in conjunction

00:00:48.592 --> 00:00:50.937
with our sample standard deviation,

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:53.666
and then all of a sudden
we are actually going

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.321
to have pretty good confidence intervals.

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.341
To make this a little bit more real,

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:01.044
let's look at a simulation.

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:03.289
So this is a scratch pad on Khan Academy,

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.399
made by Khan Academy user Charlotte Allen.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.159
And the whole point there is to see what

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.806
our confidence intervals look like

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:11.435
with these different scenarios.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:15.195
So let's say we have a true
population mean of 2.0,

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.875
let's say it the average number,

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:20.463
the mean number of
apples people eat a day.

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:22.498
The true population mean
is two, that seems high,

00:01:22.498 --> 00:01:23.889
but maybe it's in a certain country

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:25.064
that has a lot of apples.

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:26.789
And let's say that we
know that the population

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.474
standard deviation is 0.5.

00:01:29.474 --> 00:01:31.650
And we're going to create
confidence intervals with

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.170
a goal of having a 95
percent confidence level,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.187
and we're gonna take sample sizes of 12.

00:01:37.187 --> 00:01:39.505
So first, we can construct
our confidence intervals

00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:43.483
using z and sigma, which is
a legitimate way to do it.

00:01:43.483 --> 00:01:47.432
And so let's just draw
a bunch of samples here.

00:01:47.432 --> 00:01:49.344
And so we do see that it looks like

00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:51.681
it is roughly 95 percent.

00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:54.098
When we keep making these
samples, and constructing

00:01:54.098 --> 00:01:56.962
these confidence
intervals, that 95 percent

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:59.858
of the time these confidence
intervals contain our

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:01.666
true population mean.

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:04.392
So these look like a good
confidence intervals,

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:06.622
but what we've talked
about is normally when your

00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:08.234
doing this type of thing,

00:02:08.234 --> 00:02:09.865
this type of inferential statistics,

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:12.311
you don't know the population
standard deviation.

00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:16.027
You don't know sigma. So
instead, you might be tempted to

00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:19.800
use z with our sample standard deviations.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.503
But if you look at that for
these exact same samples

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:25.081
we just calculated,
notice, now when we did it

00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:28.777
over and over again,
we've done this 625 times,

00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:31.108
in this scenario, where
we keep calculating the

00:02:31.108 --> 00:02:35.682
confidence intervals with z
and s, the true population

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:37.737
mean is contained in the intervals

00:02:37.737 --> 00:02:40.335
only 92.2 percent of the the time.

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:41.905
Now we could keep going.

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:44.684
So we have a much lower
hit rate than we would

00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:47.689
hope to have if we were
actually using z and sigma.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.580
Now what's neat is, if
we use t, use a t-table,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.454
notice, this is getting much
closer, and this is neat!

00:02:53.454 --> 00:02:56.281
Because with a t-table, and
something we can actually

00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.795
get from the sample, the
sample standard deviation,

00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:00.677
we're actually able to have a pretty close

00:03:00.677 --> 00:03:02.452
hit rate to what we would have

00:03:02.452 --> 00:03:06.481
if we actually knew the
population standard deviation.

00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:09.631
So that's the value of t and t-statistics,

00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:11.519
and we're going to give
more and more examples,

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.836
including using a
t-table in future videos.
