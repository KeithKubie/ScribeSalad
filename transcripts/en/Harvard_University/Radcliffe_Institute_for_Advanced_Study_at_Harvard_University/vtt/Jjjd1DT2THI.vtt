00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.610
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.110
- Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.810
Welcome back to those of you
who were here this morning.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.980
And if anybody is
joining us new,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.000
you missed a really
great morning--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.570
so, sorry.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.400
And one of the things
you might have missed

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
was an incredible
introductory poem invocation

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.920
from our Barnstable
High School student

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.917
over here, Ceili Magnus.

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:27.252
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:28.782
Maybe encore at the end.

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:29.490
What do we think?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.450
Encore at the end?

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.680
Yeah, OK.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.221
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:34.200
- Yes, yes, encore at the end.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.430
I am serious, at the end.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.140
So just practice.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.874
But meanwhile, you can
read it for yourself.

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:41.790
So I just wanted to point
out that for anybody

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.740
who missed them in
the poster session,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.250
there were copies of the poem
that you heard this morning.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.750
And there's going to be some
extra ones, because we ran out,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.870
at the coffee break downstairs.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.524
And then just so that
you don't forget,

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:56.190
if you stay through
the whole afternoon,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.731
and it won't be too
long, and it will

00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:59.670
be just as great as
the fantastic morning,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.382
then you get to go to the
reception, which is, again,

00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:03.090
with the posters.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.550
So you'll have another chance
to think about education

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.760
and to have some lovely snacks.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.750
So now, if you
remember, we had life.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.410
We had earth.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.340
And we had space.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.220
So we're up to earth.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.500
And we actually have a
discussant, Conevery Valencius,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590
whose name I can never say
right on the first try,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.060
even though we've known each
other for quite a while.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.289
And Nate Hultman
will be our speaker.

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.830
And let me just tell
you a little bit

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.260
about each of them, because
we're going to let Nate talk.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.570
And then Conevery is going
to guide a discussion,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.210
and then again, the floor will
be opened up for questions

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.440
from the audience.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.050
So Conevery and I met when
we were Radcliffe Fellows

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.630
a couple of years ago.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.510
And I was very confused
as to whether or not

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.110
she was a scientist,
a historian,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.330
a historian of science, or
just an incredibly interesting

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.290
person.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.750
And she's actually
all of those things.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.750
So she is a Professor
at Boston College.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.940
And she studies
Environmental History,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.680
the History of
Science in Medicine,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.540
American Energy, and
the US Civil War.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.410
It's a very normal combination.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.090
And so you can, as
I said this morning,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.327
you can read her full
bio in the program.

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:17.160
And I'll just point out
that she is an alum.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.830
Her PhD is from Harvard
in the History of Science.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.410
We have many alums here today,
and if I pointed them all out,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.990
I would take too
much time, sorry.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.330
And Nate Hultman, who is
our first speaker today,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.120
is currently the Director
of the Center for Global

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.220
Sustainability and an
Associate Professor

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.610
at the University of Maryland,
School of Public Policy.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.500
And you may have
noticed in the program,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.480
or you may have
noticed from his work

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.910
that Nate also was
in the White House--

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.160
not the current White House.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.490
He was there from 2014 to 2016.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.890
And his specialty is
climate and energy policy.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.860
So again, 2014 to 2016.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.650
And anyway, he's
going to talk to us

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.110
about the role of the
undiscovered in his subject

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.610
areas.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.360
And then as I
mentioned, Conevery

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.694
will have a discussion with him.

00:03:07.694 --> 00:03:09.401
And then it will be
open to the audience.

00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:09.980
So thank you.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.814
And take it away, Nate.

00:03:11.814 --> 00:03:23.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.710
- So this is a symposium
about the undiscovered,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.270
what we don't know.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.920
And we've heard
a couple of talks

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.587
this morning that
elaborate on the concept,

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.420
and that have provided
us a couple of really

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.390
exciting examples of
how in science, thinking

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.390
about technology, we can expand
the way we look at things,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.090
and think new, different
thoughts about what

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.320
might be out there.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.850
But unfortunately when it
comes to climate change,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.060
there is a ghastly
certainty in the science

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.190
of what we know about
the climate changes

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.560
that the planet will
witness in absence

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.150
of a dramatic, near-term action
to retool our global economy.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.810
It's a message that
none of us want to hear.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.830
But it is the clear-eyed
reality of our situation.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.420
This is a graphic representation
of global temperature changes

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.940
from 1880 to 2015.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.250
It provides a
striking illustration

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.650
of the increase of
temperatures over time,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.734
and the accelerating pace of
new high-temperature records.

00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:32.900
Of course, climate change
is more complex than this.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.700
It's not just temperatures.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.250
And we've been studying,
as a scientific community

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.530
and certainly in broader
communities such as my own

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.680
in policy, trying to think about
how to capture and understand

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.560
some of the problems inherent in
climate change for many decades

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.060
now.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.060
A few weeks ago, this
knowledge was synthesized

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.460
in a report released by
the Intergovernmental Panel

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.510
on Climate Change, which
I suspect many of you

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.630
at least have heard about.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.390
This report synthesized
thousands of papers

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.910
on our scientific understanding
of the likely impacts

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.320
of climate change under
different levels of warming.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.230
The report concludes
that even an additional 1

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.140
degree of warming from
where we are today, by 2030

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.750
could expose hundreds
of millions of people

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.820
to dangerous climate
risks, stemming

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.600
from extreme temperatures,
floods, rising sea

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.520
levels, and more.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.770
It would endanger ecosystems
and threaten species

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.000
with extinction.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.870
It would likely wipe out
99% of the remaining coral

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.790
reefs on our planet.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.370
And that is for 1 additional
degree from today,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.720
to warming of roughly 2 degrees
above pre-industrial levels.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.270
Without rapid new action,
we could be on course

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.880
to a warming of up
to 4 degrees Celsius

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.220
above pre-industrial
levels, with which

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.140
is a change that is
similar in magnitude

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.510
to the difference between
the depths of the last Ice

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.690
Age and today.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.690
And we know all this with
significant confidence.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.170
In fact, most of the scientific
unknowns-- most, but not all--

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.940
cut the wrong way.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.740
Do we have less time?

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.900
Are we underestimating
the important feedbacks

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.070
or tipping points?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.650
And might it be more severe
than we've thought up to now?

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.230
The report also assessed
what social and technological

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.710
transitions would be needed to
avoid these severe outcomes,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.730
and asserts that a
window is open just

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.830
to keep warming to
roughly 1 and 1/2 degrees

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.960
above pre-industrial levels.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.690
In a way, that is good news--

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.930
in a way.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.430
But the sobering message is also
that radical transformations

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.190
need to happen in our
energy and social systems

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.074
on a very, very short timeline.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.880
That timeline is
about a dozen years.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.970
By 2030, 12 years
from now, we need

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.540
to have reduced global CO2
emissions by roughly 60%

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.570
from today's levels,
and to reach roughly

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:06.990
zero net carbon emissions by
2050, or 32 years from today.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.770
And while that transition
is already underway,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.400
I'm reminded of the
Marie Curie quote

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.230
about we don't look
at what's behind us.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.896
We always look at
what's in front of us.

00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:17.400
We are already on
the transition path.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.630
That transition is happening.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.490
And I'll return to that later.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.380
But nevertheless, it
needs to accelerate

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.700
at an unprecedented scale and
pace from where we are today.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.630
So that brings up this
undiscovered question,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.680
of can we do it?

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:36.650
First, let's get
a sense for what

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.270
that scale and
pace of reductions

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.320
really might look like.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.710
The left figure here is
actually from that IPCC report.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.740
It's a schematic diagram,
which is sort of cartoonish.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.340
But what you see on the
left is from roughly 1970

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.850
to 2020, the path of current
global emissions, followed

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.060
by two simplified pathways to
reaching zero net emissions

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.630
by mid-century, which is, again,
what we know we'll need to do.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.280
The rapidity of
those changes should

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.610
be obvious from just
looking at the chart.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.490
The table on the right
provides some rough guidelines,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.950
or some rough estimates,
for the degree of change

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.770
we need to see between
now and 2030 and 2050.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.270
Take coal, for example--

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.320
coal use needs to decrease
by roughly 60% to 80%

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:27.620
by 2030, and by
nearly 100% by 2050.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.360
We need roughly
60% of electricity

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.422
to come from renewables by 2030.

00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:34.130
And in some scenarios,
we would need well

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.409
in excess of 500
billion tons of CO2

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.030
to be captured and
stored underground

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.720
between now and 2100, using
a technology that has not yet

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.560
been deployed at
any kind of scale.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.060
So clearly, we're
talking at nothing

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.460
less than complete
shutdown of the fossil fuel

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:54.390
system in the world's economy
over the next roughly 30 years.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.140
It is a daunting task.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.820
But like any task, we can take
some steps to ask what we know

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.190
and what we don't know about
what that transition might

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.040
look like.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.770
So we do have some idea
of what needs to happen

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.614
and what that might look like.

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:10.030
It turns out that
such transitions

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.330
have been studied for decades
now by modelers, policymakers,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.700
scientists, technology
experts, and many others.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.400
And there are a few
consistent features

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.670
across almost all scenarios
that keep climate change

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.380
to minimum levels.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.530
So first, you can see
here on energy system,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.090
you use less energy.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.570
That's energy efficiency.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.690
That's a core pillar
of what we need to do,

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.820
so all the technologies
that use less energy

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.920
and use it more
efficiently are core

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.510
and central to this
particular one.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.150
The second piece
is you decarbonize

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.380
all of our electricity.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.320
In other words, take all of the
electricity we generate now,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.060
and make it from renewable or
clean sources of some kind--

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.300
no carbon-emitting sources.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.670
And then finally, you
look at anything possible

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.620
that you can use
electricity to do,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.870
and you switch over from
fossil fuels to electricity

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.890
for all those applications.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.010
So those are the pillars
on the energy side.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.510
And then there's a
few other things.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.030
You have to think about how to
absorb carbon in land sinks.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.870
And to some degree, oceans
might be part of this, as well.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.690
You have to think about
carbon removal technologies,

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.840
maybe in other words, negative
emissions from the atmosphere,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.352
removing them using energy, and
sequestering them underground.

00:10:17.352 --> 00:10:19.810
And then thinking-- and this
is where some creativity comes

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.470
in--

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.990
thinking about where we
can make substitutions.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.840
What can we do differently
about how we organize our lives

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.720
and our societies
that can change

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.480
the practices from one sort
of technological strategy

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.800
to another?

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.570
And this I actually was
inspired by the keynote speech

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.000
there, where we heard
about the debacle,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.130
the breaking up,
where you break it up.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.810
And you reorganize
the pieces, and you

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.393
think about things
that are different.

00:10:45.393 --> 00:10:48.160
So I'll return to
that in a later slide.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.584
So we do have an idea
of what needs to happen.

00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:57.000
These are some characteristics
about the coming transition

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.160
that we are pretty
confident about.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.530
What we're not sure about
is how we operationalize

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.990
the rapid pace of
reductions with what

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.330
I would call the gummy,
imperfect, and sometimes

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.450
intractable social
systems that we have.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.370
In, part, some of
that's unknowable.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.460
But in part, we can look
to some other examples

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.960
to give us some ideas.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.430
So I'll review some perspectives
on transitions of the past,

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.020
and what we know
about the transition

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.070
that we might need to undertake,
to see if we can eliminate both

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.950
what might be possible, and then
how we might organize ourselves

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.890
to go about doing it.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.430
So I'm going to say four
different points on this.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.210
So first, there have been rapid
transitions in technologies

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.650
before.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.250
So we all understand the
concept of it used to be,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.950
generally horse and
carriage, and we're now

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:44.700
using automobiles.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.394
So transition in technologies
is a fundamental issue.

00:11:48.394 --> 00:11:50.310
And we know that those
transitions happen more

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.530
quickly, or can happen quickly.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.540
This particular
figure shows a number

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.060
of different technological
transitions in the United

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:02.759
States from 1880 all
the way up to 2010.

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:04.800
And you don't need to
spend a lot of time looking

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.200
at each individual curve,
but the concept here

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.575
is that this shows a curve
showing early adopters, all

00:12:09.575 --> 00:12:10.950
the way up to kind
of essentially

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.110
full deployment
in the US economy,

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.370
by percentage of households.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.620
And you can see on the left
side, you have telephones,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.640
electricity.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.070
On the right side, you
have things like cell phone

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.520
and the internet.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.490
So what we're
seeing, first of all,

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.450
is that technologies
do transition.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.450
And the question is, can
we make that transition

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:28.870
happen more quickly?

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.220
So let me ask a question.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.900
How many of you in this
room own a smartphone?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.030
OK, I should ask how
many don't, but OK.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:43.220
So the point is, how many of
you remember that in June 2007,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:48.122
there was no such thing
as an app or an iPhone?

00:12:48.122 --> 00:12:48.622
OK.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.380
And this is where we are today.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.100
So that's a familiar
example to many of you.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.290
Roughly 66% of
people in the US now

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.150
own a smartphone, 36%
of people globally.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.315
Here's another
example-- automobiles,

00:13:06.315 --> 00:13:07.720
I mentioned before.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.870
Here's a picture of New
York, Fifth Avenue in 1900.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.790
If you see, there's
a little red circle

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.170
around the single automobile
on the street at that time.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.790
All the rest are
horse-drawn carriages.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.250
13 years later, this is the
same scene, to the day--

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.680
essentially 100%
penetration of automobiles

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.274
in that particular
part of the world.

00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:30.690
Now, that's one
part of the world.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.610
It's not indicative
of the whole country.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.310
For the whole country, it
went from roughly 1% in 1900

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:40.140
to 99% automobiles by 1930.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.140
And this happens across
a lot of different kinds

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:42.850
of technologies.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.558
There have been rapid
transitions before.

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:46.302
One you might not
be familiar with,

00:13:46.302 --> 00:13:48.260
because it happened in
Brazil, was a transition

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.060
from traditional
vehicles to vehicles

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.490
that can use either
ethanol or gasoline, called

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.840
flex-fuel vehicles.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.290
That particular transition
happened in the 2000s--

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:03.480
roughly 5% of sales in 2003
to over 90% of sales in 2009--

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.330
five years to kind
of essentially almost

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.799
full deployment on
the sales front.

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:11.090
So the point there is that
we can see rapid transitions

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.170
in technologies.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.070
I should caveat-- these
are all contingent.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.340
They're all specific to
the local circumstances.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.694
They have a lot of
contingencies as to whether they

00:14:19.694 --> 00:14:20.360
can work or not.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.540
We have to think about how
those really worked in practice,

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.770
and think about how we can
apply it into the future.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.950
I'm not saying it's just
going to magically happen.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.640
Second on the
transition perspectives,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.540
we have had broad
mobilization before.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.124
And in fact, that IPCC report
calls out one specific example,

00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:37.790
which many of you
were probably thinking

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.010
about when I use the
term "mobilization,"

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.790
which is World War II.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.580
So in World War II,
defense expenditure

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.120
rose from roughly $2
billion in 1940 to $91

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.200
billion four years later.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.610
That increase is equivalent to
$1 trillion in current dollars,

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.820
in four years.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.090
The US produced about 40%
of the world's armaments

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.060
over that time, including
300,000 airplanes, 100,000

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.750
ships, and much, much more.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.270
And we increased our
workforce by 7.7,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.859
almost 8 million people.

00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:09.900
People that hadn't been
in the civilian workforce

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.910
before had entered the
civilian workforce.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.284
And you can see
an example of one

00:15:13.284 --> 00:15:16.080
of those people in
the poster here--

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.090
obviously, an icon for
the fact that women

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.125
were moving much more
broadly into the workforce.

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:22.000
So that's an example.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.304
It's called out even
by the IPCC report.

00:15:25.304 --> 00:15:27.220
We know that happened
in one specific country,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.590
under one specific
set of circumstances.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.600
We know that that
level of mobilization

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.210
will likely have to happen
over the next 15 years.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.840
So the real question
is, how can we do that?

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.140
How can we make that
happen on a global scale?

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.780
The third perspective
I want to share on this

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.880
is tying back to
the theme of today,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.060
which is that our thinking
has often been wrong.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.140
And we learn from it, but
it has often been wrong.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.640
I'm going to give
just two examples,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.930
although there are many.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.920
There are many here.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.730
Think back to the 1970s.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.000
The middle of the 1970s,
there was an oil crisis.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.208
There were a lot of smart
people trying to figure out

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:07.590
what energy demand would look
like in the United States,

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.390
to try to plan for it.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.820
This figure shows a number
of different forecasts

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.937
from that period
of energy demand.

00:16:13.937 --> 00:16:15.520
I don't know if you
can see the scale.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.440
It's 1975 to 2000 was
the projection period.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.380
And like I said, a lot of the
smartest people, so we think,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.224
were doing these projections.

00:16:24.224 --> 00:16:25.640
So if you are
looking at this, you

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.700
might say, well, OK, probably
somewhere in the middle.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.947
What the actual
amount of demand was,

00:16:31.947 --> 00:16:33.780
was at the very bottom
end of that envelope.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.810
In other words, the economy
did much better on efficiency

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.760
than people had anticipated.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.735
So people, in aggregate,
were quite wrong about where

00:16:41.735 --> 00:16:42.360
we were headed.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.260
And they were wrong--

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.510
in some way, we kind
of came out better

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.772
than people thought
at that point.

00:16:48.772 --> 00:16:49.730
Here's another example.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.344
This one's a little
harder to follow.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:52.760
But what I want
you to see here is

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.530
that this is a set
of solar forecasts

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.150
over a period of
roughly 10 years

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.390
from a single organization, the
International Energy Agency.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.250
Of course, we presume
that people would--

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.107
we're certainly much
smarter now, of course.

00:17:03.107 --> 00:17:04.940
We have better models,
and all these things.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.950
We've learned from our mistakes.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.410
But what this shows is
that we actually didn't.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.780
Each of those colored
bars shows a forecast

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.849
from a subsequent year.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.550
So the forecast started
out very low for what

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.839
solar would look like.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.700
And they increasingly
got higher.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.829
And if you see the
dotted line there,

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:24.349
the dotted line at the very
upper end of that envelope

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.200
is where solar deployment
actually happened.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.440
So the solar deployment
was way faster, way faster

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.470
than the International
Energy Agency predicted.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.800
So each of these years
the forecasts increased.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.500
And they were always lagging
by a significant amount

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.910
from where reality really was--

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:46.630
so very far behind in terms of
thinking about solar deployment

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:47.360
globally.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.860
And by the way,
it's not just IEA.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.193
There have been studies of this.

00:17:50.193 --> 00:17:52.400
There's been lots of
other organizations made

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.035
the same error in judgment.

00:17:54.035 --> 00:17:56.660
So the point there is that when
we think about the future, when

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.000
we think about what's
possible, we often

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.460
think about kind of
drawing extrapolations

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.980
from where we were
today, and not

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.472
thinking about what can happen
under different circumstances.

00:18:07.472 --> 00:18:09.680
This has happened in energy
demand, as I just showed.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.910
It's happened in eVs.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.320
It's happened in photovoltaics.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.840
It's happened in wind, and
it's happened in batteries,

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.070
among many others, that
we've been surprised

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.100
by the rate of change, even
with smart people thinking

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.944
about where it might
actually end up.

00:18:23.944 --> 00:18:25.360
The fourth piece
I want to mention

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.340
is that we are
actually, right now,

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.040
in the middle of a
revolution in clean energy.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.442
We need to be aware of that.

00:18:31.442 --> 00:18:33.400
We need to acknowledge
that's what's happening,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.210
and be open to that.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.797
I use the word
"revolution" not fliply.

00:18:38.797 --> 00:18:40.380
I think it's actually
really important

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.170
that we're considering what
the implications of that are.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.450
But it actually is happening.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.850
Currently, onshore wind or
traditional wind turbines

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.430
are one of the most competitive
sources for new generation,

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.560
coming in at roughly
$0.03 a kilowatt-hour.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.550
That's at the very low end
of what fossil can generate.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.920
Solar photovoltaic, as I
mentioned in the earlier slide,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.800
has been quite surprising
over the last decade.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.500
The figure here shows
a longer term decrease

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.400
from 1975 to 2007 in
the orange on price,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.560
and a corresponding
dramatic increase

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.020
of photovoltaic deployment on
the right in the bluish color.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.630
Costs have fallen 73%, roughly
80% over the last decade.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.430
Over the last six
years, more money

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.920
was invested in renewable
energy than has been invested

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.850
in new fossil generation.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.760
So that's a significant outcome.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.090
$280 billion last year
was invested in renewables

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.070
globally, outstripping
the amount

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.510
we spent on all fossil
generation investments.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.880
And finally, the international
Renewable Energy Agency

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.610
does estimate, with all the
cost drops we're seeing,

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.380
that renewable energy
will consistently

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.330
be cheaper than
most fossil fuels

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.230
in every part of
the world by 2020.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.010
So for new generation,
we have the opportunities

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.350
to deploy these new
kinds of technologies

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:01.310
without radical
thinking about, will we

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.120
have to pay tons more somehow,
in order to have this happen?

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.850
Now there are other
challenges technically

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.776
about deploying renewables at
fast scale and at rapid rates.

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:12.650
I don't want to minimize
those, but the point

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.920
is that we have the tools
right now at our disposal

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.968
to do a rapid deployment.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.190
So those are some
observations from the past,

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.470
from the present,
about some perspectives

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.630
on what this transition
might look like.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.040
But there are
still some elements

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.006
that we still don't
know what to do.

00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:35.380
We don't know how
to go about it.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.070
And I think we have to
be honest with ourselves

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.319
that we need to be thinking
creatively and differently

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:41.000
about some of this stuff.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.030
The IPCC report that I
mentioned earlier does mention

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.760
that the rates of changes
that we do need to see

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.940
have occurred in the past.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.120
So that's what I was
essentially reflecting to you,

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.970
within specific sectors,
within specific technologies,

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.950
within specific spatial context.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.070
But there is no documented
historical precedent

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.427
for their scale.

00:20:59.427 --> 00:21:01.760
So it's the scaling question
and the social organization

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.500
question that really
is at the heart

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.470
of this particular problem.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.490
So this problem, I want to split
up into a couple of components.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.710
In one of the earlier talks,
we heard about the fact

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.690
that there's individual
components of a system,

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.512
and then there's
a system thinking.

00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:19.470
Part of the individual
components of our system

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.970
will, of course,
be the technologies

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.250
that we use to deliver
the services we need.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.130
And we know that there
are many such technologies

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.660
at our fingertips right now.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.460
Many of you will recognize a
number of electric vehicles.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.130
These are existing
electric vehicles today.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.730
We have batteries that we
can deploy, battery storage.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.290
We have drone delivery.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.930
Very importantly, we have drone
delivery of Domino's pizzas,

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.810
which is shown here.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.630
We have autonomous vehicles,
which are increasingly

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.330
being tested and
deployed, and will likely

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.480
be deployed at scale and in
the relatively near term.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.275
We have offshore wind turbines.

00:21:53.275 --> 00:21:54.900
Some of them are
anchored, some of them

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.450
are not, but increasingly
deployed globally.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.894
We have magnetic
levitation trains

00:21:58.894 --> 00:22:00.060
that have been demonstrated.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.920
We have carbon capture
and sequestration,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.080
which has been demonstrated
and commercialized.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.310
And we even have-- and this is
one of the more different kinds

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.020
of technologies you
might think of--

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.020
meatless burgers,
which could, in fact,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.040
be a significant contributor to
the change in carbon emissions

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.910
from our agricultural sector.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.294
We also have technologies that--

00:22:21.294 --> 00:22:22.960
there's not a bright
line between these,

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.882
but that kind of are
concept technologies.

00:22:24.882 --> 00:22:26.590
We have technologies
that we can actually

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.410
use to suck CO2 out
of the atmosphere

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.470
and sequester it in the
ground or in solid materials.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.900
We have Elon Musk's Hyperloop,
which I'm sure some of you

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.220
have read about.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.650
We have small, modular
nuclear reactors,

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.290
which might be
proliferation-resistant ways

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.490
to get low-carbon energy.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.550
We also have the ever possible
option of nuclear fusion, which

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.330
people continue to
work on, and may well

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.390
come through one of
these days, but is not--

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.560
it could happen.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:59.140
And then finally, we have our
familiar unknown unknowns.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.046
So in technology,
as you all know,

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.170
there's always discoveries.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.730
We're always finding new things.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.530
Many of those things
are hard to predict

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.500
from where we stand today, that
may still make a big difference

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.540
in, say, 2030 or 2040.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.820
And that's one area
where many of you,

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.910
particularly I'm looking at the
young people in the audience,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.550
might be able, with your
scientific inquiries

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.740
or scientific interests
or technological skills

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.290
that you're building right
now, be able to kind of grab

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.360
on to some idea
that you might have,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.610
and make that into
a reality that

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.619
really does help the world.

00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:32.660
But like I said, it is
not just the technologies.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.290
The technologies are
a piece of the puzzle,

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.190
but they're not the system.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.670
So we have to think about the
broader systemic approaches

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.180
that we can take,
reorganizing ourselves.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.910
Reorganizing ourselves--
that mobilization

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.280
which includes technology,
but also includes

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.870
organizations, governance,
personal choices, and more.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.710
And this is where we
have to be creative.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.850
And this is, in some ways,
where it is somewhat unknown.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.584
This is a diagrammatic depiction
of blockchain, which some

00:23:59.584 --> 00:24:00.750
of you may be familiar with.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.900
But people have talked
about blockchain as a way

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.610
that we can essentially use
distributed energy sources

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.820
and distributed storage within
the context of a smart grid,

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.029
which is the diagram
on the right,

00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:15.320
to actually build out these
technologies on a much more

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:20.470
rapid pace, and allow people
to get paid for it as they go.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.720
There's also food waste as
another way to think about.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.303
Some people have
worked on food waste.

00:24:24.303 --> 00:24:26.110
Food waste actually
accounts-- something

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.401
like a third of the food
that's produced globally today

00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:29.020
is wasted.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.710
It counts for something like 5%
to 7% of global GHG emissions

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.910
just from the waste.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.820
So if there's a way that we
can reuse the food that we were

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.530
already throwing away,
or use less of it,

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.320
those kinds of
approaches are going

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.890
to be essentially important.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.015
And then finally, one that's
probably more familiar

00:24:45.015 --> 00:24:47.110
is retooling and rethinking
how we do our work,

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.720
and how we do our transportation
and living situations.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.560
So can we telework?

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.160
Can we do other modes of
engaging with our workplaces,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.390
but also with each other, that
ideally are more personally

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.760
fulfilling, less greenhouse
gas emissions, and also,

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.590
maybe, better for our health?

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.065
So we can track that
with the health tracker.

00:25:08.065 --> 00:25:10.440
One example that I want to
give on organizing strategies,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.924
we are now running an
experiment in the United States.

00:25:13.924 --> 00:25:15.340
A year and a half
ago Donald Trump

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.020
announced his intent to
pull out of the Paris

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.186
Agreement on Climate Change.

00:25:18.186 --> 00:25:20.440
Some of you may have heard
that when it happened.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.650
Within 72 hours of that
announcement, a coalition

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.830
of 2,700 cities, states and
businesses stepped up to say,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.670
we are still in.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.599
We are still committed to the
goals of the Paris Agreement.

00:25:30.599 --> 00:25:32.140
That group is called
We Are Still In.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.160
And they've been
working with a group

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.368
that I'm affiliated with
called America's Pledge, led

00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:37.240
by Michael Bloomberg
and Jerry Brown,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.880
to think about how we can
organize ourselves differently

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.650
at different levels
of governance,

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.050
to accelerate what otherwise
would have happened

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.160
in this country.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.370
So that coalition, which is
depicted graphically here,

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:52.120
is now over 3,500 strong.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.550
It represents over
half the US population,

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.842
and it represents
almost 60% of US GDP.

00:26:00.842 --> 00:26:03.300
So were it a country, it would
be the world's third largest

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:08.450
economy and the world's fourth
largest greenhouse gas emitter.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.800
So I'm going to say two more
things about this topic.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.112
The first one is that we
can choose our future.

00:26:13.112 --> 00:26:14.570
The future that we
have is not just

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:15.890
sort of pain and suffering.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.380
It's very much kind
of a positive story

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.150
of benefits and health.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.650
So first of all,
there's an estimate

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.720
that we could benefit
by $26 trillion dollars

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.080
with this low-carbon investment.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.600
Up to 150 million
premature deaths

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.390
avoided due to
reduced air pollution.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.460
And finally, subsidy
reform in carbon pricing

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.890
that would put another
roughly $3 trillion

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.020
into government
revenues by 2030,

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.500
which is over the GDP of India.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.080
So finally, the answer
is, can we do it?

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.760
And the answer is, yes, we
can under four specific kind

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.000
of possibilities.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.610
First of all, to
improve the odds,

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.680
we have to think about
funding technology, R&amp;D,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.050
and fostering demand
with the private sector.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.212
Second, we have to build
this into the economy

00:26:58.212 --> 00:26:59.920
by investing in new
green infrastructure,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.300
pricing carbon, and
disclosing risk.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.300
We have to reorganize
ourselves, as I mentioned,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.950
acting at all levels
of government,

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.220
using governance and policy as
a way to focus our responses.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.200
And finally-- and this
is where I want to link

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.616
in to the earlier comments
that were made at the front end

00:27:13.616 --> 00:27:14.680
of the session--

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.330
is to embrace our humanity.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.920
This is a broad
economic opportunity,

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.180
but some people will
have to be displaced.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.330
And so we have to
think about making sure

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.220
that the politics and
the transition strategy

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.400
works for all people,
and not just some.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.100
And with that, I will conclude,
and say thanks very much.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.750
And we can go to questions.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:33.190
- Thank you.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.420
Thank you so much.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.300
And I think this is also
a good moment for us

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.090
to send a shout out to all
those watching on live stream,

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:50.030
because as we think
about creative ways

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:54.230
to replace travel, and
especially plane-driven travel,

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.842
with other forms of
virtual presence,

00:27:56.842 --> 00:27:59.300
we need to get better at stuff
like, yeah, I'm going to log

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.417
into that conference now.

00:28:00.417 --> 00:28:02.000
And the Radcliffe,
I think, has really

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.200
been leading the way on that.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.690
So thank you.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:06.797
I want to push us all now.

00:28:06.797 --> 00:28:09.380
I don't know if I'll push Nate
so much, but I want to push us,

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.890
because this is a science
conference on the undiscovered.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.070
And I want to talk a little
bit, or ask a bit about some

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.190
of the pieces that I
think can be undiscovered

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.620
in our conversations
about science policy.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.540
I would like, very
briefly, for you--

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.210
us to talk to us about God.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.362
And the room goes quiet.

00:28:29.362 --> 00:28:31.570
Because that's what happens
in scientific discussions

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:32.800
when we ask about faith.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.750
So you talked about
the need for--

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.910
that this is not
solely a science

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.490
question as it is
a scaling question

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.530
and a social
organization question.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.940
Can you talk to
us about the ways

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.260
in which communities of faith
can, and are being mobilized

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.640
around climate change?

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.080
- Sure.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.310
So first of all, it
is a great question.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.450
I don't know if I can answer
the deep questions about God,

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:04.120
but I can say that your last
point about broader engagement

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.279
across different communities,
different organizations,

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.320
is going to be essential.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.210
If we're thinking
about organizing our--

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:11.310
let me back up.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.930
A lot of people have framed
up the climate question,

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.050
many times, as a question
of sort of consumer choice--

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.550
which is very
important, by the way.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:22.540
It is important to choose green
energy, do all those things.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.970
But it cannot be
just consumer choice.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.790
We have to organize ourselves
to do these transitions

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.472
in a deliberate way.

00:29:29.472 --> 00:29:31.180
And what we all have
right now-- somebody

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:37.090
earlier in the symposium
used the lovely term

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.830
"find your own tidepool."

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:43.540
So find your own way to use
the world that you're in,

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.190
use the sphere that you're in.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.720
Try to think
creatively about what

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.760
can be done within that sphere.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.700
And it's vitally important to
use those spheres that we're

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.790
already operating in
to maximize how we can

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.030
work with those communities.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.800
And so the communities of
faith, the communities of--

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.120
I talked about cities,
states, and local governments.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.830
That's one way to organize,
communities of faith

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:03.329
is another.

00:30:03.329 --> 00:30:04.675
Universities is another.

00:30:04.675 --> 00:30:06.550
You all can probably
think of many other ways

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.290
to kind of organize ourselves.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.030
And long ago, the
climate question

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.430
moved from a science
and technology question

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.230
primarily to a question
of ethics, values,

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.930
and social organizing in action.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.340
And that's where we are today.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.000
It spans the spectrum.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.840
And so the question for us is
sort of how do you link those,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.180
how do you make the links
between all those dimensions?

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.420
And yes, I think making
sure we recognize

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.220
that there are deep
values in what choices

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.970
we're making over the
next couple of years

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.480
is an essential piece
of the answer here.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.150
- OK.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.870
Let's ask you one more,
and then we'll open it up.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.950
So please be thinking.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.670
Be brewing your excellent
questions, please.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.340
So the crudest way I
would put my next question

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:50.590
is, so what makes this not
just a white people question?

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.590
And every time I talk about this
in an elite university context,

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.030
I think about that.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:58.270
How do we open up, how do we
make the "we" really a "we?"

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.400
And you showed us a map
of the organizations that

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.620
are part of America's Pledge
and the We're Still In.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.140
And that's a pretty
geographically spread-out map.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:11.260
What are the ways in which
you see action that is useful,

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.170
that is moving the needle
on climate change, that

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.980
is geographically,
ethnically, socioeconomically

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.100
diverse and inclusive?

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.110
- It's a great question.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.632
I don't have a
full answer to it,

00:31:22.632 --> 00:31:24.340
because I think that's
actually something

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.190
that we need creativity and
energy to help us answer

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.690
collectively I do think
that part of the discussion

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.517
here has to focus on, again,
what are the actual benefits?

00:31:35.517 --> 00:31:37.600
What are we actually getting
from this transition?

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.840
We are choosing in this,
I think, a better path.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.602
We are choosing cleaner air.

00:31:42.602 --> 00:31:43.810
We're choosing better health.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.820
We're choosing more jobs.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.890
And those kinds of
discussions are really

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.810
what ought to be
at the core of how

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.230
we discuss amongst ourselves
and discuss much more

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.140
broadly the benefits and
the strategies of doing

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.990
the transition.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.640
- So here's where
we can go, not just

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.120
we need to eat our vegetables,
about giving things up.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.720
Excellent.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.710
Very nice.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.390
I would like to
invite now people

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.790
to come up and ask a question.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.560
A great writer once
wrote in a book

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.050
that I occasionally
wave at my students,

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.670
"Vigorous writing is concise."

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:19.534
I would add that so is
vigorous question asking.

00:32:19.534 --> 00:32:20.700
So would you come up please.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.810
And state your name.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.240
And ask a question
of our speaker.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.940
- I am Tanya [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:32.190
I am wondering if you
could also talk a little

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.220
about the role of
natural preservation

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.730
in helping slow
down climate change.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:44.130
And that also seems to be the
appropriate last question,

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.200
that that would
also be something

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.240
that would help everyone
of any race or color

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.220
in the economic situation.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.000
- Good.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.200
The answer is absolutely.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.180
There's a lot of reasons
to preserve natural areas

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.380
and to kind of encourage
continued growth

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.210
of those natural ecosystems.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.686
Even in this country,
in the United States,

00:33:05.686 --> 00:33:07.060
partly because of
climate change,

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.643
partly because of
other reasons, we're

00:33:08.643 --> 00:33:11.106
expecting some of, essentially,
the carbon sequestration

00:33:11.106 --> 00:33:13.230
to be tapering off over
the next couple of decades,

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.940
without further kind of
conservation efforts.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.949
So it's going to be
a key part of it.

00:33:17.949 --> 00:33:19.740
And I think it can
happen in different ways

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.698
in different countries.

00:33:20.698 --> 00:33:23.590
But it's got to be at the
core of how we approach it.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.380
I agree.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.590
Yes.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.090
- Hi.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.610
I'm Emily [INAUDIBLE] from
Barnstable High School.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.020
And I have a question.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:37.110
So we do so many movements,
like for instance the removing

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.310
plastic straws movement.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.620
We try to bring about change.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.580
But it always feels like
big businesses or business

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:50.070
practices in general kind
of try to suppress that when

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:54.210
they see the short-term profit,
or they see it as a problem.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:02.350
So how do you think that
you will overcome that?

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.760
- I think that's part of
what we have to think about.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.810
So there are individual
strategies that can be taken.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.900
But as I mentioned in some
of my framing comments,

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.750
we're talking about a pretty
radical transformation

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.870
that a number of industries
will be directly affected by.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:23.179
And so that strategy
has to include

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:26.030
the specific kinds of
targeted efforts like perhaps

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.030
you've been involved in.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.940
And those are really
important to continue doing.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.100
And I commend you for doing it.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.444
On the other hand, it also
takes other kinds of social--

00:34:34.444 --> 00:34:36.360
like when I talked about
organizing ourselves,

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.400
I do mean policy--

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:38.900
partly.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.085
It's not the only thing, but
policy has to be part of this.

00:34:42.085 --> 00:34:43.710
And then finally,
there's another piece

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.239
that I didn't really
address in the talk.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.850
But that is about attitudes.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.730
And you know attitudes can
also flip quite quickly

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:51.969
in our society.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:53.310
And I think people study it.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.560
But we still don't
understand all the drivers

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.980
behind what actually forces
attitudes to, or catalyzes

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.370
attitudes to change.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.910
And that's something
where I'm hoping

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.250
you guys from Barnstable,
as you're doing your work

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.500
and you're grabbing
onto these issues,

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.395
you can help with that
shift in attitudes,

00:35:10.395 --> 00:35:12.990
and with the energy and
the, hopefully, impatience

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.030
that you have about
getting something done.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.180
- Get rid of plastic bags.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.720
- There you go.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.220
- And can I just
add that some of us

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.340
are old enough to remember when
any gathering of human beings

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.910
of this size, the room
would be completely filled

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.220
with a layer of cigarette smoke.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.850
And that no longer occurs.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.340
And that was a rapid shift.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.920
So--

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.660
- My name is Kelly
Bowman, and I'm also

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.100
from Barnstable High School.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.400
And my dad is someone who
kind of believes that climate

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.780
change isn't a serious issue.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.630
He seems to think that nature
will balance itself out.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.647
And I try to talk to him.

00:35:46.647 --> 00:35:48.230
I'll share research
with him and data.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:51.290
And he will tell me either that
I don't know what I'm saying,

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:53.780
or that I've been
brainwashed by liberals.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.660
And so I was
wondering if you had

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.960
any advice on how I can talk
to him and people like him,

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.073
explain that it is a
serious issue, yeah.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.590
- Once again, I thank you
guys for your persistence

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.740
and your energy.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.900
It can be enervating
after a while.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.860
So first, my last bullet, which
I had to run through a little

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.360
quickly--

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.940
I was a little over time--

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.440
the core thing
about this, I think,

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.231
is what I said in that
fourth bullet, which

00:36:24.231 --> 00:36:25.380
is "embrace our humanity."

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.310
We do have to
remember that we're

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.060
dealing with other
people in our families.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.210
We're dealing with other
people in our communities.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.044
That doesn't mean
they're right, but that

00:36:35.044 --> 00:36:36.960
does mean that we have
to deal sympathetically

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.517
and empathetically with them.

00:36:38.517 --> 00:36:39.600
That's part of the answer.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.580
But it won't get you there.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.350
Sometimes, deployment
of more facts

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.260
is not going to actually
make a difference.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.780
In fact, I would posit
that for those you who

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.650
have worked in
science policy, most

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.150
of the time,
deployment of new facts

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.400
doesn't actually
solve the problem.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.380
What does help
sometimes is reframing

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.850
what you're doing, and
reframing why you're doing it.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:00.450
And so I think thinking
about the economic benefits,

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.670
the positive future
that we can embrace--

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.160
I don't want to
overstretch the analogy,

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.350
but who is really
sorry that we don't

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.170
have hundreds and
hundreds of people

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.240
in each agricultural
field scything wheat

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.740
every season to bring it in?

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.340
We don't bemoan the
kind of transition

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.440
that we've gone through,
because people can do

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.820
other things more productively.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.278
And they can do
interesting things.

00:37:24.278 --> 00:37:26.970
And they can have a
better future, in a way.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.690
So what we're talking about
is reframing the issue.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.280
And maybe you could try that.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.481
And maybe report back to us,
and let us know if it works.

00:37:34.481 --> 00:37:34.980
- Thank you.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.590
- Yeah.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:37.090
- Hi.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.010
I'm [INAUDIBLE],,
also from Barnstable.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.860
My question is kind of similar
to Skyler's, in that you talked

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.680
about a rapid transition
in commodities,

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.660
like technology and automobiles.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:51.730
But how do you propose to
initiate such a rapid change

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.030
for energy, when a lot of
people at the national level

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.410
just refuse to acknowledge the
existence of climate change?

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.730
- OK, good question.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.813
- We're giving you the
really questions to answer.

00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:07.020
- By the way, great for
all you Barnstable guys.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.070
Great, great questions,
yeah, and your teacher, too.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:15.045
So yeah, let's--

00:38:15.045 --> 00:38:20.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.040
So a couple answers, and
I'll try to keep it short.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.730
You guys know I like
to talk about this.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:30.810
So first is right now,
the national level

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.750
is tough-- the next
year to two years.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.300
We're just at a tough spot
at the national level.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.437
We've got to go to
plan B right now.

00:38:38.437 --> 00:38:40.520
And that's what we're doing
with America's Pledge.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.320
It's what you guys
can do at Barnstable.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.090
It's what all of us can
do on our own tidal pool,

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:46.457
so to speak.

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.790
So that's one of the strategies.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.520
It turns out that strategy
builds the groundwork.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.000
If we're deploying stuff
in our own spheres,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.590
it makes it easier for national
reengagement down the road.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.340
So that's part of a kind
of theory of the case here

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.020
of how that could be helpful.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.940
But the other one is, frankly,
back to our attitudes question,

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.840
we have to recognize
and realize--

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.290
And your generation is going
to be a key part of this--

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:13.300
that we cannot burn
all those fossil fuels.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.765
It just cannot happen.

00:39:15.765 --> 00:39:17.890
right and I think we have
to be more overt and more

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.130
clear about the implications
of what we're talking about,

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.260
so that we can start getting
ourselves used to that

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.040
in the very near term, so
that when politics does end up

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.880
starting to shift, it shifts
in a way that reflects that.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.516
- Thank you.

00:39:31.516 --> 00:39:32.160
- Hi.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:32.970
I'm Graciella.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.520
I'm from Barnstable
High School, too.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.360
So you mentioned initiatives
that national businesses

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.410
and governments can
take to make a change.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.180
But what can regular people
do every day to make a change?

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.680
- Great question.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.010
So again, it depends
on what your sphere is.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.110
What choices do you have
authority over, so to speak.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.800
So you have the
usual things of you

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.210
can bike more if you
have that option.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.960
People have to think
carefully about this.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.450
And I'm not trying to put
my foot down really hard.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.070
But you can think
about your diet.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.400
Think about changing,
reducing, at least,

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.740
the amount of red meat
that you eat, for example,

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.880
is one way to do it that you
can directly affect right now.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.490
And then also, it is
very important-- again,

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:20.040
consumer choice is important--
if you can get your parents

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.680
to put in a
motion-sensing thermostat

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.990
or you buy an electric vehicle,
then great, and bless you.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:29.370
But also, elections matter.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:30.330
Politics matters.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.540
Organizing matters.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.200
And we have to use
our institutions.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.180
We can't just do it
with consumer choice.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.200
So do the consumer choice
stuff, and godspeed on that.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.420
But also work in
these other ways.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.460
And work vigorously
and with great effort

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.590
to make something happen.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.150
- I'm Rachel, also
from Barnstable.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:56.090
My question coincides with that.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:59.230
Do you think that it's
possible that doing consumer

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.940
choice or a combination,
because you said

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.070
there are four ways that
you can go about it,

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.590
and combined together, that
will reduce it by a lot.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:08.950
But say policy doesn't
end up swinging that way.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.110
Is it possible to
reduce it the amount

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.940
that we need to
reduce it in 12 years

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.680
without policy or
something else?

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.350
- That is the undiscovered.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:25.130
So I don't like to
say don't think so,

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:29.850
but I'll go back to the
second or third slide I did,

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:33.350
which is that just
incredibly rapid reduction.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.230
The fact that we have
to get rid of 70% or 80%

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:41.390
of our coal-fired electricity
by 2030 globally is such a lift.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.610
And I don't want people
to get the message--

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.661
sometimes this is like the
study of psychology of choice--

00:41:46.661 --> 00:41:48.410
sometimes people feel
like when the job is

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.960
so big and so impossible,
they just back away.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.090
And they're, like,
you know, I'm out.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:54.980
I just don't see why
I can do anything.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.900
We're done.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.617
We are not done.

00:41:57.617 --> 00:41:58.700
We're crossing the bridge.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.780
We're part of it.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.920
You saw those dropping costs.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.160
So don't be discouraged.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:09.190
But on the other hand, it's not
going to work without policy.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.387
We're going to have to make
some changes in politics

00:42:11.387 --> 00:42:12.720
to make this kind of thing work.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.980
And it's not just to kind
of impose a carbon tax.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.830
It's also to help
with transition.

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.050
There will be a lot of people
that could be displaced

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.670
by this rapid transition.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.484
And we need to think
about, for example,

00:42:24.484 --> 00:42:26.150
that kind of transition,
and making sure

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.770
that those people
are kept on board.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:34.250
- Hi.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:35.470
My Name's Casey Brown.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.000
I'm also from Barnstable.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.710
I had two questions today.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.920
My first was, I
know that we rapidly

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.437
have to change to
more greener energies.

00:42:43.437 --> 00:42:45.520
But what do we do with the
rest of the people that

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.880
have built their lives
and economy around coal,

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.530
or natural gas, or oil mining.

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.049
And my second is, I know that
we have to make this change,

00:42:55.049 --> 00:42:57.340
but a lot of people won't
change unless it's appealing.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:01.450
So how do you make being more
environmental more appealing?

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.940
- So those are two brilliant
observations and questions.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.890
And by the way, all
these Barnstable

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:07.120
questions-- all brilliant.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.050
So this is a wonderful
set of questions

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:13.450
you guys are bringing
up, and core to how

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.190
we think about this problem.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.440
Very briefly, to the two
questions you raised,

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.880
one was on the people
that are affected.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.610
And that's something--
there is now

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:25.300
a kind of emerging discussion
around what people are now

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.110
calling "just transition," so
thinking about those people who

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.170
are affected, and how
there is a kind of strategy

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:35.080
so that people who are, say, 45
and trained for a certain kind

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.230
of work might have options
beyond just working in the coal

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:39.500
industry.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.840
So that's really important.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.230
If you have ideas and thoughts,
apply your energy and thoughts

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:47.480
to how to help us there.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.870
And then the second piece was--

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:49.870
what was the second one?

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:50.786
- Making it appealing.

00:43:50.786 --> 00:43:52.450
- Making it
appealing, so again, I

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.830
had a slide at the end,
which was sort of fast.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:44:00.650
But this is about a
set of better choices.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.980
And I don't know
how many people have

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.560
driven an electric
vehicle versus driven

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.300
a regular vehicle.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:11.560
And I can say with confidence
that electric vehicles are just

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.790
better cars.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:14.890
They go faster.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:15.850
They steer better.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:16.960
There's less parts.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.010
They're just better.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.990
And what we're talking
about, in the long run,

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:22.390
is choosing those kinds
of better futures.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:24.250
And I think that remembering--

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.860
I mean, a lot of my talk
was about the imperative

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.200
of doing it for this audience.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.720
But as you're sort of
thinking about strategies,

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.680
and messaging, and engaging,
those positive stories are key.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.822
So you're absolutely right.

00:44:36.822 --> 00:44:37.322
- Thank you.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:43.280
- Ricardo Cortez, and
I'm a grandparent--

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.540
- Are you from Barnstable?

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.109
- And I'm thinking about
my grandchildren, but also

00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:50.400
the grandchildren in the world.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.670
Because this is really about
them, and about you guys.

00:44:55.670 --> 00:45:00.670
Based on the [INAUDIBLE]
graph that you have,

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:03.260
I would like to suggest that one
of the most important things,

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.960
perhaps, was left out of that.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.950
And I think you just mentioned
it briefly, is that unless--

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:14.330
unless-- we leave 80% of fossil
fuels underground forever,

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:15.860
regardless what
we do, we're still

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.371
not going to be in good shape.

00:45:17.371 --> 00:45:20.320
Thank you.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.480
- Yes.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.120
- Thank you.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:24.620
- Hello.

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.745
I'm Andrew [INAUDIBLE] from
Barnstable High School.

00:45:26.745 --> 00:45:29.650
Don't worry, I'm the last one.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:32.840
I was just wondering,
will climate change just

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.806
slowly increment up?

00:45:33.806 --> 00:45:35.180
Or will there be
a drastic change

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.240
that forces people to
all see it at once,

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.680
and that they can't
ignore it anymore?

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.270
And they'll have to
do something about it.

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:45.890
- Great question, and
one that scientists

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.425
have been really
struggling with.

00:45:47.425 --> 00:45:49.050
There's two elements
of climate change.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.350
One is sort of gradual
increase, with gradual sort

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.670
of increasing damages.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.410
And there's another
dimension of sort

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.540
of tipping points or
extreme events that

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.250
get people to kind of wake up.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.170
We really hope we don't
hit a major tipping

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:03.887
point in the Earth's system
in the next 25 or 50 years.

00:46:03.887 --> 00:46:05.720
It's thought that the
risk of that happening

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.470
is relatively low
compared to those things

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.340
that we think are
more likely, like just

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.530
extreme heat events, flooding,
and sea level rise, et cetera.

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.110
But this is an area of--

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:19.010
I didn't spend a lot of time on
the science of climate change,

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:22.130
ironically for this forum.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:26.530
But that is an area where people
continue to be actively engaged

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:27.530
in trying to understand.

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:29.880
So that's an area,
if you're interested,

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.267
is very important
to contribute to.

00:46:34.267 --> 00:46:36.350
But right now, I think
it's important to remember,

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:39.740
we are actually living
it at the moment.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:44.420
There are these events that are
unequivocally, or pretty much

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.120
obviously, driven
by climate change,

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.790
and that those are part of
what we're experiencing now.

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:52.960
Those were the predictions
that we had 20 years ago--

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.020
the droughts, the floods, the
fires, the intense hurricanes,

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:56.810
et cetera.

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.550
We are seeing the impacts
of climate change today.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.090
So it's important
when you're speaking

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.490
with people about that to be
aware that that's actually

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:05.957
already affecting lives.

00:47:05.957 --> 00:47:08.940
- Thank you.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.920
- Jo Solid again.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.340
I would like to turn to this
question that was raised

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.890
about communities of faith.

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:18.930
It has been explained
to me that there

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:24.270
are people who see
this potential climate

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:30.360
change apocalypse
as aligned with what

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:35.570
the future of humanity
is meant to be by God.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.540
And they talk about
this as the Rapture--

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.160
that the world will collapse.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.640
And the worthy will
be sent up to Heaven.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.670
These folks don't
see a big incentive

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.890
to stopping that from
happening, because they

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:51.410
see themselves as worthy.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.720
It's been described,
apparently, as part

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.690
of what goes on in Louisiana,
where you see the oil

00:47:56.690 --> 00:48:00.440
companies destroying the
bayous, and the death

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.400
of the once highly valued
natural environment there.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.460
And they accept this,
based on their beliefs.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.750
How do we deal with that?

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.090
- But that's not just Louisiana.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:12.390
I mean, this is a--

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.480
lot of different
opinions in Louisiana.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.830
- I mean, look--

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:22.280
I actually don't have a great
answer to that one, either.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.250
There is a point where you do
want to engage with people,

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.610
and be discussing in good faith.

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:33.740
On the other hand, it's also
possible to make the numbers

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:38.960
work on our side, so that
ultimately, there might--

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.586
some people might
never be convinced.

00:48:40.586 --> 00:48:41.960
And I think we
have to kind of be

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.300
aware, in our social
systems, that we

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.400
have to continue to
kind of carry them along

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.680
with us, as we're trying
to make these transitions,

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.150
and do so in as empathetic and
constructive way as we can.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.560
But there is a way in which--

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.170
engagement is good.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.264
I think there are
people who are very

00:48:59.264 --> 00:49:00.680
much in this
community of thinking

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.870
about the overlap between
ethics, values, faith,

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:07.970
and our choices in policy,
and environment, and climate.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:09.830
And I wish them well.

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:11.250
It's not something
I directly do.

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.860
But other people do
that very eloquently.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.655
I think, of, for example
Katharine Hayhoe,

00:49:14.655 --> 00:49:17.720
who's a climate scientist-- and
you might want to look her up--

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.497
does a lot of
engagement like this,

00:49:19.497 --> 00:49:21.830
with different faith communities
and the Christian faith

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:22.916
communities, particularly.

00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:24.290
So there are people
like that who

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:26.854
can be advocates, who can
sort of bring the message out.

00:49:26.854 --> 00:49:28.520
And I think the other
part of it is just

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.065
to continue to make that case
that this is a positive future

00:49:32.065 --> 00:49:32.690
we're choosing.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:36.890
It's not something
that should necessarily

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.710
lead to a worse outcome for
those people who are perhaps

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:43.600
not doing anything about it.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.100
- There are groups
like Evangelicals

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.170
for Climate Action, for
instance, who are increasingly

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.100
finding their voice.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.520
And I welcome now the last
question in this fabulous set

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.760
of questions.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.590
- Excuse me.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:55.360
Lee Goodman.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.490
I'm a retired
transportation engineer.

00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:59.390
I like to talk.

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:01.310
I'm very much in
favor of what we're

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:02.999
going to do in the future.

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.790
But what can we learn
from the present that

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.400
will help to change attitudes?

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.630
I'd like to know if there's
any research going on,

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:14.460
or if we're checking into
what's happening in Europe.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.090
My perception is that there
are many countries in Europe

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.530
which are way ahead of us
in terms of renewable energy

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:21.030
policies.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:24.140
France in particular, I think,
has a tremendous percentage

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.010
of its electricity generated
by nuclear right now.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.260
Can we learn anything
from them in terms

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.320
of helping to accelerate
the transition?

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.990
- So it's a great point, and I
have two quick answers to that.

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:38.347
So first is, absolutely yes.

00:50:38.347 --> 00:50:39.680
There are a number of countries.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.930
There is lots of experiments
going on globally.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.138
There's been a lot of
leadership from different parts

00:50:44.138 --> 00:50:45.770
of the world in
renewable deployment.

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:47.829
We are kind of trying
to learn from those.

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:50.120
I think it's good to kind of
cross-fertilize with ideas

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.880
and policies and approaches that
have worked in other places,

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.030
and also learn from
what the failures were.

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:57.530
A second dimension
of your question,

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:01.550
that I think we can potentially
wrap on or leave off on,

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.980
we talked earlier in the
day about the connections

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.599
between some of the work
that's being done in science

00:51:06.599 --> 00:51:09.140
and some work that's being done
in, say, humanities or social

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:09.860
science.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.220
We even kicked off today with
some art, with the poetry.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.030
And I think that this is an area
where making those connections,

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.640
thinking about what those
other disciplines can bring

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.430
to the table to help us
understand how we have

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:25.460
organized and how we
successfully organize ourselves

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.390
as human systems, as
cultural, social people--

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.672
how do we organize ourselves?

00:51:30.672 --> 00:51:31.880
How do we motivate ourselves?

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.609
How do we kind of collectively
move in a certain direction?

00:51:36.609 --> 00:51:38.900
That's something that a lot
of these other disciplines,

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.520
I think, have a lot to say.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.810
And it was interesting in
reading that IPCC report,

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:46.921
it was very clear there wasn't
a lot of good literature yet

00:51:46.921 --> 00:51:48.170
being brought to bear on that.

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:49.730
So there's a lot
of wide-open areas

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:52.130
for people to do research
and new inquiry on,

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.140
and to keep this
interdisciplinary conversation

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:54.720
going.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.490
So I thank you.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.491
Thank you.

00:51:57.491 --> 00:51:58.490
Thank you all very much.

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.290
[APPLAUSE]
