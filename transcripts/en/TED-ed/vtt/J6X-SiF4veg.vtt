00:00:00.945 --> 00:00:04.845
What's one interview question you ask every prospective employee?

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:09.042
I like to see how people think.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.951
So, very often I ask questions

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:12.405
that are inferential

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:14.913
so they are not really looking into the knowledge

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:17.344
because I know that someone may have done the research

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:19.279
and someone may have not done the research.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.442
And although I can appreciate the enthusiasm

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:25.019
and the desire that someone may show,

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.219
so I evaluate that,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.426
I often ask questions that

00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:29.770
are questions like,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.237
"How many golf balls do you have

00:00:31.237 --> 00:00:32.691
in the United States?"

00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:34.102
And I am not looking for an answer

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:36.243
that tells me the exact number,

00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:38.106
but I want to know how they think.

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:39.609
And again, this goes to the idea

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.638
that we are moving to a world

00:00:41.638 --> 00:00:43.650
where people don't care so much

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.445
about the product in itself.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.715
Products are becoming more and more commodities.

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:49.789
But people care about our ability

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.353
to challenge their way of thinking.

00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:55.179
They enjoy the fact that we are bringing

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.805
something to a conversation.

00:00:56.805 --> 00:00:58.889
So, you want at the end of a meeting

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:00.635
with a C-level person

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:04.070
who has given you a half an hour, one hour of their time,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.134
to make them feel like they didn't waste

00:01:06.134 --> 00:01:07.473
that hour with you,

00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:10.136
but I don't want to say that they learned something,

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.681
but they saw things with a different perspective.

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.216
So, I like young people

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:16.724
who can really put these thoughts together

00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:19.086
and say, "Yes, I don't know the answer to that,

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:21.719
but this is how I get to an answer."

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.323
And I think very often that gives me a lot of ideas

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:27.058
whether or not that person will be able to master

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:31.492
some more sophisticated and complex thoughts and ideas

00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:33.297
that we will feed them,

00:01:33.297 --> 00:01:34.682
but they would be,

00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:37.416
they would need to be able to accept those ideas

00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:39.750
and then elaborate their own way of thinking

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.486
around those ideas.
