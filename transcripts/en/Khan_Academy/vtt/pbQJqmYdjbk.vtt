00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.910
- [Instructor] A student
builds a circuit with a battery

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.990
and two resistors in series.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.683
The resistance of R2 is
double the resistance of R1.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.720
Below is the graph of the
energy lost at R1 over time.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.600
So that's this graph.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.390
Which of the following shows
the energy lost at R2 over time

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.960
in terms of E1.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.950
We have these four choices here.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.790
So pause this video and see if you can

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.340
figure it out on your own.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.920
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.820
So first let's visualize the circuit.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.825
So you have your voltage source,

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.090
this is our battery here, so
this is the positive terminal,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.810
negative terminal, and
then this could be our

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.320
first resistor, and then
that's our second resistor.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.070
They tell us these two
resistors are in series

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.310
and we complete the circuit here.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.310
This is going to be R1, this is R2,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.620
and then if you just have
one circuit like this,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.680
where you don't have any parts
of it that are in parallel,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.990
your current throughout this circuit

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.100
is going to be constant.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.860
So we could say at any point here,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.660
our current, let's just call that I.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.120
Now they tell us how do these resistances

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.340
relate to each other.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.480
If R1 has a resistance
of, let's call it X ohms,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.830
they tell us that the
resistance of R2 is double

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560
the resistance of R1.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.410
So this is X ohms, this
is going to be two X ohms.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.410
And then to think about, what would be,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.760
if this is the energy
dissipated across R1 over time,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.810
to think about the energy
dissipated across R2 over time,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.850
let's think about power and energy

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.450
and what we know about them.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.510
So we know that power is equal

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.500
to energy dissipated over time.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.670
So we could write, for
example, power is equal

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.970
to energy dissipated over time,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.020
which can be expressed
as your change in voltage

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.430
across a resistor times the current

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.750
going through that resistor.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.620
And so if you want an
expression for energy dissipated

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.870
over time, you can look at
this part, right over there.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.750
We can just multiply
both sides by delta T.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.270
And so we could write that
energy dissipated over time

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.710
is going to be equal to
our change in voltage

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.240
across the resistor times the current

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.190
going through the resistor,
times our change in time.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.610
Now, if we are starting
at time equals zero,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.900
our change in time is
just going to be whatever

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.060
time we are at minus
zero, so it's going to be

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.240
whatever time we're at,
so I'm just gonna write

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.960
times T right over here.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.460
Now your change in
voltage across a resistor

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.440
we have learned before,
your change in voltage

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.940
across a resistor is just going to be

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.770
the current going through that resistor

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.560
times the resistance.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.150
So we could take this and
substitute it back for

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.300
delta V, and what do we get?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.550
We get energy dissipated
is going to be equal

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.620
to our current going through a resistor

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.560
times the resistance times
the current going through

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.560
the resistor times time, or we could write

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.710
that energy dissipated as a function of,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.960
well as a function of all
three of these things,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.560
is going to be the current squared

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.340
times the resistance times time.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.320
Now, we already know
from this that at time T1

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.790
we have an energy dissipated of E1,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.100
and that's what the resistance of X ohms.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.700
So we can say we have
energy dissipated of E1

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.610
is equal to I squared times X ohms,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.943
that's the resistance, times T1.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.770
But now let's think about
what the energy dissipated

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.770
at time T sub one for our
second resistor would be.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.960
At the energy dissipated,
if we just go back

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.840
to this equation right over here,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.840
is going to be equal to T
sub one times our current,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.130
remember we have the same
current going through

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.380
both resistors, they're in series,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.500
so we have the same
current there, I squared,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.590
and then what is going
to be the resistance?

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.230
Well instead of an X,
we have a two X here.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.500
And so we can rewrite
this, we could rewrite this

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.500
as two time I squared times X times T1.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.960
Well, this right over
here is the same thing

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.140
as the amount of energy
dissipated at time T sub one

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.190
in our first resistor.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.940
So this is E sub one.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.780
So at time T sub one,
the energy dissipated

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.160
and our second resistor
is going to be twice

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.600
as much energy.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.460
And so what we wanna look
at is at time T sub one

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.980
we wanna have twice as much energy.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.330
This dissipated, this
only has a fourth as much,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.060
so we rule that out, this has half as much

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.930
energy dissipated, rule that out.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.400
This has the same amount
of energy dissipated,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.160
we rule that out, but then here,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.020
at time T sub one, we have
dissipated twice as much energy.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.200
So we like that choice right over there.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.170
Another way to think about it is,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.600
if you have the same current
going through two resistors,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.800
and the second resistor
has twice the resistance,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.950
and any given amount of time
for the second resistor,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.260
you're going to dissipate
twice as much energy.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.760
Another way to think about
it, you'll have twice

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.820
the slope of this line.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.130
So this one right over here
clearly has twice the slope

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.770
of this, or you could say
for any given amount of time,

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.130
so from time equals zero to T sub one,

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.030
you would dissipate twice as much energy.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.810
So instead of E sub one,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.233
you would dissipate two times E sub one.
