00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.400
Keep this history in mind as we work through

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.360
our exploratory analysis. The first thing you might consider

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.490
doing is plotting key variables against each other using

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.430
the GG pairs function. This function plots each variable

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.990
against each other variable, pairwise. You may want to

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.210
sample first, otherwise the function will take a long

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.030
time to render the plots. Also, if your data

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.660
set has more then about 10 columns, there will

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.520
be too many plotting windows. So, subset

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.000
on your columns first if that's the case.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.050
The first thing we want to do is make

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.550
sure you have these packages installed. We use

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.400
GGally for this particular plot. We use scales for a variety of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.150
things. Memisc to summarize the regression. Lattice for few other things.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.794
Mass for various functions. Car to recode variables.

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:55.007
Reshape to reshape and wrangle your data. Plyr

00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.891
to create interesting summaries and transmissions that you've done.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.513
We'll go ahead and load these packages, and

00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:04.756
then set the seed for randomization purposes and sample

00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:08.210
10,000 rows from the diamonds data set. What's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.340
happening is that ggpairs is plotting each variable against

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.480
the other in a pretty smart way. In

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.920
the lower triangle of the plot matrix, it uses

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.080
grouped histograms for qualitative, qualitative pairs

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.390
and scatter plots for quantitative, quantitative pairs.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.890
In the upper triangle, it plots grouped

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.810
histograms for qualitative, qualitative pairs, this time

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.610
using the x instead of the y variable as the grouping factor. Box

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.100
plots for qualitative, quantitative pairs, and it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.510
provides the correlation for quantitative quantitative pairs.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.780
Remember that our goal is to understand the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.480
price of diamonds. So, let's focus on that.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.430
The price variable is here. So, let's look

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.190
at the relationships that correspond to price. What

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.020
are some things you notice? There's no right

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.380
or wrong answer here, but think deeply about

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.800
the plots and the associations you see. Write

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.590
a few sentences about what stands out to you.
