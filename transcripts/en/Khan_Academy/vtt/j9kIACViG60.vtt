00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:03.216
- [Voiceover] Hello Grammarians,
hello visiting cousin Beth.

00:00:03.216 --> 00:00:04.506
- [Voiceover] Hello cousin David.

00:00:04.506 --> 00:00:05.983
- [Voiceover] So today
we're gonna be talking about

00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:09.189
pronoun-antecedent agreement.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:10.327
- [Voiceover] And what is that?

00:00:10.327 --> 00:00:13.131
- [Voiceover] An antecedent
is a thing that goes before.

00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:17.750
So ante, mean before, and
cedent, is like a going-ee thing.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.095
What I mean by that is that
if we're talking about,

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:23.571
if we setup something in a sentence.

00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:26.845
So okay, we've got a sentence
like Jillian rode her bike

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:28.417
to the grocery store.

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:31.633
Fine, straight up
sentence, pretty ordinary.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:35.044
If we wanna refer to Jillian
again, but we want to use

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:38.291
a pronoun, well, we
refer to Jillian as she.

00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:40.608
That's a women's name, so she.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:44.583
She bought some garlic and
a spoon, like you normally

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:46.350
would when you go to the grocery store.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.476
When we talk about this pronoun she,

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:53.643
in relation to this word,
this proper noun Jillian,

00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:58.710
Jillian is the antecedent,
is the thing that goes before

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.169
the pronoun she, so that
whenever you use a pronoun,

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:04.592
you are referring back to something else,

00:01:04.592 --> 00:01:07.257
the thing that went
before, the antecedent,

00:01:07.257 --> 00:01:09.954
the thing that has come previously.

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:14.358
So you want to make sure
that these things match up.

00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:18.398
So for example, we know
from living in this culture,

00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:21.659
that Jillian is a women's
name, so it would probably be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.409
incorrect to refer to her has he.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.016
Jillian rode her bike
to the grocery store,

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:30.558
he bought some garlic and a spoon.

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:33.490
This sounds like we're
talking about someone else.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.002
So even within this initial sentence too,

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.585
Jillian rode her bike
to the grocery store.

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:45.747
We're referring back to Jillian using this

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:50.006
possessive pronoun to define the bicycle.

00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:53.124
- [Voiceover] Because
it's a longer sentence.

00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:54.921
- [Voiceover] We're
using it to demonstrate

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:56.964
the relationship between
Jillian and the bicycle.

00:01:56.964 --> 00:01:58.728
- [Voiceover] Gotcha.

00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:00.863
- [Voiceover] You also wanna
to make sure that pronouns

00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:04.186
and their antecedent agree in number,

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:07.739
so if you said, what's a fun animal?

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:08.572
- [Voiceover] Monkeys.

00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:10.633
- [Voiceover] Monkeys.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:15.084
So the monkeys threw snowballs,
but they had crummy aim.

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:19.167
So we're using they to
refer back to the monkeys,

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:23.369
so this thing is a plural noun, right?

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:26.726
We're referring to multiple
monkeys, so it would be

00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:30.017
incorrect to say the
monkeys threw snowballs,

00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:33.352
but it had crummy aim,
because this makes it seem

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:37.253
like we're talking about
one monkey, when in fact,

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:41.764
we're talking about an army
of snowball chucking monkeys.

00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:45.931
We got our little monkey, maybe
a calobus or diana monkey.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.419
Got a little tuft, it's
throwing a snowball.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.630
And if that's an Old World
monkey, it probably doesn't

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.463
have a fancy tail, this
one has a little tail.

00:02:54.463 --> 00:02:57.066
Let's say we have a whole bunch of them,

00:02:57.066 --> 00:03:00.020
we want to make sure that
we are operating under

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.579
the standards of agreement.

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.685
Beth, any questions?

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.967
- [Voiceover] So you
can't have it anymore,

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:08.525
because now you've got four monkeys.

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:11.116
- [Voiceover] Right,
let me get rid of that.

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:12.879
What should it be instead Beth?

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.518
- [Voiceover] They,
because they is plural,

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:18.326
and we don't know if
they're he's or she's.

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:19.561
- [Voiceover] And even if we didn't,

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:23.781
they kind of eliminates any
kind of gender distinction.

00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:25.700
- [Voiceover] Oh right.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.512
- [Voiceover] So the
monkeys threw snowballs,

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:29.889
but they had crummy aim.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.938
Although these monkeys seem
to be doing pretty good

00:03:31.938 --> 00:03:33.546
at hitting each others in the heads,

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.213
the tails, with their snowballs.

00:03:38.464 --> 00:03:41.316
So that's pronoun-antecedent agreement.

00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:44.487
So remember to make sure to line things up

00:03:44.487 --> 00:03:46.529
when relevant by gender.

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:50.210
Jillian wrote her bike, she
bought some garlic and a spoon.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.855
And by number, so the
monkeys threw snowballs,

00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:55.636
but they had crummy aim.

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.958
There's more than one
monkey, so you'd wanna use

00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.625
the plural third person pronoun.

00:04:01.754 --> 00:04:03.409
You can learn anything.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.845
David out.

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:06.035
- [Voiceover] And Beth out.
