the way is a significant date because

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
the way is a significant date because
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.390
the way is a significant date because
it's the year after thirteen forty nine

it's the year after thirteen forty nine
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.849
it's the year after thirteen forty nine
and thirty forty nine is the year of the

Great Plague in London one of the great
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.080
Great Plague in London one of the great
plagues and that's that wiped out the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
plagues and that's that wiped out the
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.170
plagues and that's that wiped out the
entire and lower generation in in London

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
entire and lower generation in in London
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700

and some people thought it was an act of

and some people thought it was an act of
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.319

and that's why the five colleges founded

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
and that's why the five colleges founded
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.290
and that's why the five colleges founded
in the first place but anyway we don't

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
in the first place but anyway we don't
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150
in the first place but anyway we don't
have to have that in recording so you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
have to have that in recording so you
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.000
have to have that in recording so you
will have a very strange object and this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010
will have a very strange object and this

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.179
no two zeros at the end but with one and
which is a prime now how surprising is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
which is a prime now how surprising is
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.730

that I'm really listening oh of somebody

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
that I'm really listening oh of somebody

who not only had this idea but actually

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
who not only had this idea but actually
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020
who not only had this idea but actually
implemented this idea and I think even

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
implemented this idea and I think even
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.810
implemented this idea and I think even
today it's a bit difficult to check that

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
today it's a bit difficult to check that
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.460
today it's a bit difficult to check that
this number is a prime I mean there are

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
this number is a prime I mean there are
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.469
this number is a prime I mean there are
lots of Prime's in the world of special

prime checking and primarily is a very

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
prime checking and primarily is a very
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.520

well-known piece of mathematics but this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
well-known piece of mathematics but this
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560
well-known piece of mathematics but this
is a fairly sort of random primum e

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
is a fairly sort of random primum e
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.490

and so and so how do you discover such a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
and so and so how do you discover such a
 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.140
and so and so how do you discover such a
thing is prime and the purpose of his

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
thing is prime and the purpose of his
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670

game of course was to hit the prime

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
game of course was to hit the prime
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.790
game of course was to hit the prime
exactly at 1350 this is because it's the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
exactly at 1350 this is because it's the
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.010
exactly at 1350 this is because it's the
year of the foundation of college so you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
year of the foundation of college so you
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.070
year of the foundation of college so you
can't really found fine tune and lead a

can't really found fine tune and lead a
 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.930
can't really found fine tune and lead a
number of digits that's why I think

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940
number of digits that's why I think
 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.310
number of digits that's why I think
there's an irregularity here in the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320
there's an irregularity here in the
 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.710
there's an irregularity here in the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.320
beginning zero followed by six to one
and we are still looking for the special

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330
and we are still looking for the special
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.090
and we are still looking for the special
significance of the number six to one

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
significance of the number six to one
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.160
significance of the number six to one
I'm sure there is some cosmic importance

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170
I'm sure there is some cosmic importance
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.620
I'm sure there is some cosmic importance
to this number as well what you are

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630
