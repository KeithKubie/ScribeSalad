the interesting part about how the brain

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720
the interesting part about how the brain
 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.820
the interesting part about how the brain
works is that it loves novelty and so if

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830
works is that it loves novelty and so if
 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.490
works is that it loves novelty and so if
you present something over and over the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500
you present something over and over the
 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.019
you present something over and over the
same thing to the brain it quickly

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029
same thing to the brain it quickly
 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.690
same thing to the brain it quickly
starts showing a smaller response this

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700
starts showing a smaller response this
 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.970
starts showing a smaller response this
is called repetition suppression in

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980
is called repetition suppression in
 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.339
is called repetition suppression in
other words the brain really cares the

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349
other words the brain really cares the
 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.050
other words the brain really cares the
first time there's a little less second

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060
first time there's a little less second
 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.310
first time there's a little less second
time by the third and fourth fifth that

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320
time by the third and fourth fifth that
 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.220
time by the third and fourth fifth that
the brain cares a lot less so what this

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230
the brain cares a lot less so what this
 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.109
the brain cares a lot less so what this
means is that we're always leaning into

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119
means is that we're always leaning into
 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.530
means is that we're always leaning into
the future we care about novelty but the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540
the future we care about novelty but the
 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.090
the future we care about novelty but the
interesting part is we don't want too

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100
interesting part is we don't want too
 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.370
interesting part is we don't want too
much novelty because that's disorienting

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380
much novelty because that's disorienting
 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.100
much novelty because that's disorienting
so you might want to go to Burning Man

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110
so you might want to go to Burning Man
 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.810
so you might want to go to Burning Man
for five days but you don't want to live

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820
for five days but you don't want to live
 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.510
for five days but you don't want to live
there all year and so we're always

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520
there all year and so we're always
 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.240
there all year and so we're always
caught in this ground between

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250
caught in this ground between
 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.520
caught in this ground between
familiarity and novelty and this is

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530
familiarity and novelty and this is
 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.230
familiarity and novelty and this is
where creativity lives because brains

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240
where creativity lives because brains
 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.060
where creativity lives because brains
are looking for this balance and you can

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070
are looking for this balance and you can
 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.650
are looking for this balance and you can
see this in lots of ways just as an

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660
see this in lots of ways just as an
 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.569
see this in lots of ways just as an
example take skew Moore's

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579
example take skew Moore's
 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.389
example take skew Moore's
so skew morphs are these digital objects

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399
so skew morphs are these digital objects
 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.270
so skew morphs are these digital objects
that have a relationship to a physical

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280
that have a relationship to a physical
 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.730
that have a relationship to a physical
object so when you're saving something

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740
object so when you're saving something
 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.830
object so when you're saving something
on your computer you press the little

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840
on your computer you press the little
 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.380
on your computer you press the little
floppy disk which we haven't used for a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390
floppy disk which we haven't used for a
 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.420
floppy disk which we haven't used for a
couple of decades now or you make a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430
couple of decades now or you make a
 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.330
couple of decades now or you make a
phone call by pressing a handset which

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340
phone call by pressing a handset which
 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.460
phone call by pressing a handset which
is the old type of handset that kids

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470
is the old type of handset that kids
 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.620
is the old type of handset that kids
nowadays don't even know what that is or

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630
nowadays don't even know what that is or
 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.750
nowadays don't even know what that is or
you send an email by pressing an

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760
you send an email by pressing an
 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.719
you send an email by pressing an
envelope letter or send yo you throw

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729
envelope letter or send yo you throw
 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.030
envelope letter or send yo you throw
away your zeros and ones in a trash can

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040
away your zeros and ones in a trash can
 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.170
away your zeros and ones in a trash can
and so on so these are all illustrations

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180
and so on so these are all illustrations
 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.870
and so on so these are all illustrations
of the way that we like to have one hand

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880
of the way that we like to have one hand
 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.100
of the way that we like to have one hand
on the past when we make new leaps we

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110
on the past when we make new leaps we
 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.050
on the past when we make new leaps we
don't want them to be completely

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060
don't want them to be completely
 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.940
don't want them to be completely
unfamiliar just as an example with when

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950
unfamiliar just as an example with when
 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.179
unfamiliar just as an example with when
the iPad came out with digital books it

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189
the iPad came out with digital books it
 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.859
the iPad came out with digital books it
was on a wooden bookshelf and they were

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869
was on a wooden bookshelf and they were
 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.230
was on a wooden bookshelf and they were
books that sat on this wooden bookshelf

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240
books that sat on this wooden bookshelf
 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.200
books that sat on this wooden bookshelf
so the point is that we're always

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210
so the point is that we're always
 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.600
so the point is that we're always
keeping one hand on the past and then

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610
keeping one hand on the past and then
 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.640
keeping one hand on the past and then
you know one hand on the future and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650
you know one hand on the future and
 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.120
you know one hand on the future and
that's where we are comfortable with

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
that's where we are comfortable with
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.130
that's where we are comfortable with
innovation when it comes to repetition

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140
innovation when it comes to repetition
 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.899
innovation when it comes to repetition
suppression you can measure this in the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909
suppression you can measure this in the
 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.850
suppression you can measure this in the
brain you just show something to the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860
brain you just show something to the
 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.710
brain you just show something to the
brain and you see a big response and

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720
brain and you see a big response and
 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.240
brain and you see a big response and
then you show it again and you see less

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250
then you show it again and you see less
 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.920
then you show it again and you see less
response then again you see less of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930
response then again you see less of
 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.140
response then again you see less of
response and so on by about the 12th

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
response and so on by about the 12th
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.500
response and so on by about the 12th
presentation you're getting

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510
presentation you're getting
 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.300
presentation you're getting
very little response because the brain

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310
very little response because the brain
 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.559
very little response because the brain
just doesn't care so we're always

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569
just doesn't care so we're always
 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.170
just doesn't care so we're always
leaning into the future because we're

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180
leaning into the future because we're
 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.300
leaning into the future because we're
always looking for the next thing what's

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310
always looking for the next thing what's
 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.420
always looking for the next thing what's
interesting when when companies put out

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
interesting when when companies put out
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.789
interesting when when companies put out
their new and improved product it has to

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799
their new and improved product it has to
 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.069
their new and improved product it has to
have some relationship to the old one I

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079
have some relationship to the old one I
 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.619
have some relationship to the old one I
mean if if a cellphone company decided

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629
mean if if a cellphone company decided
 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.720
mean if if a cellphone company decided
to put out a triangular cell phone or

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730
to put out a triangular cell phone or
 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.610
to put out a triangular cell phone or
something weird like that it wouldn't

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620
something weird like that it wouldn't
 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.380
something weird like that it wouldn't
necessarily catch on we want things that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390
necessarily catch on we want things that
 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.789
necessarily catch on we want things that
look pretty much like the old but they

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799
look pretty much like the old but they
 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.309
look pretty much like the old but they
have novelty to them now the interesting

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319
have novelty to them now the interesting
 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.539
have novelty to them now the interesting
thing is that when it comes to creation

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549
thing is that when it comes to creation
 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.210
thing is that when it comes to creation
it's impossible to know exactly how far

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220
it's impossible to know exactly how far
 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.420
it's impossible to know exactly how far
to travel from community standards so if

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430
to travel from community standards so if
 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.849
to travel from community standards so if
you stick too close you'll get passed by

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859
you stick too close you'll get passed by
 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.670
you stick too close you'll get passed by
if you go too far no one's going to

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680
if you go too far no one's going to
 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.649
if you go too far no one's going to
follow you there and there are so many

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659
follow you there and there are so many
 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.660
follow you there and there are so many
examples historically of this sort of

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
examples historically of this sort of
 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.500
examples historically of this sort of
thing happening

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510
thing happening
 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.879
thing happening
so what creators actually what good

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889
so what creators actually what good
 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.759
so what creators actually what good
creators do is they cover the spectrum

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769
creators do is they cover the spectrum
 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.770
creators do is they cover the spectrum
this is this true of individuals as it

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780
this is this true of individuals as it
 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.839
this is this true of individuals as it
is for companies they cover the spectrum

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849
is for companies they cover the spectrum
 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.009
is for companies they cover the spectrum
where they're doing some things that are

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019
where they're doing some things that are
 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.020
where they're doing some things that are
sort of nearby and some things that are

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030
sort of nearby and some things that are
 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.640
sort of nearby and some things that are
whackier and whackier and this is how

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650
whackier and whackier and this is how
 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.180
whackier and whackier and this is how
they feel out the border of the possible

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190
they feel out the border of the possible
 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.250
they feel out the border of the possible
this is how they figure out what's going

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260
this is how they figure out what's going
 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.530
this is how they figure out what's going
to stick with their society because the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540
to stick with their society because the
 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.140
to stick with their society because the
thing about any sort of creative act is

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
thing about any sort of creative act is
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.140
thing about any sort of creative act is
that you never know what's going to

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150
that you never know what's going to
 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.259
that you never know what's going to
stick what what will actually make a

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269
stick what what will actually make a
 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.420
stick what what will actually make a
difference in your society what's very

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430
difference in your society what's very
 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.729
