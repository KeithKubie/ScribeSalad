00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:02.213
- If you were to take a glass beaker,

00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:03.593
so let me draw it right over here.

00:00:03.963 --> 00:00:05.463
If you were to take a glass beaker

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:07.963
and you were to fill it up with water,

00:00:08.323 --> 00:00:09.814
you might expect that the surface

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:11.714
of the water would be flat.

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:13.775
But it's actually not the case

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:14.824
and I encourage you to try it.

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:16.323
You might have even observed this before.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.264
The surface of the water will not be flat.

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:21.053
The surface of the water
will actually be higher

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:24.463
near the glass than it is
when it's away from the glass.

00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:28.571
It forms a shape that
looks something like that.

00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:30.212
And so the first thing we might ask

00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:31.812
is what'll we call this thing.

00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:33.992
And this right over here
is called a meniscus.

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:35.661
Meniscus.

00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:38.002
And in particular this meniscus,

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.402
because the fluid is
higher near the container

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:42.552
than it is when you're
away from the container,

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:47.152
we would call this a
concave, concave meniscus.

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:49.672
And you might say, "Well if
this is a concave meniscus,

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:51.902
"are there any situations where might have

00:00:51.902 --> 00:00:54.422
"a convex meniscus?"

00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:57.203
Well sure, you can have a convex meniscus.

00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:00.261
If you were take that same glass beaker,

00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:01.862
instead of filling it with water

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.641
if you filled it with say, mercury.

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:05.442
If you filled it with mercury,

00:01:05.742 --> 00:01:08.142
you would get a meniscus
that looks like this

00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:09.852
where there's a bulge near the center

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:11.372
when you're further
away from the container

00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:12.753
than when you're at the container.

00:01:13.142 --> 00:01:15.476
And so let me just label this.

00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:19.465
This is a convex, convex meniscus.

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:23.466
But it's one thing to just
observe this and to name them.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.976
To say, "Hey this is a meniscus."

00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:26.355
So this is a concave meniscus.

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:28.136
But a more interesting question is

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:30.025
why does it actually happen.

00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:33.896
And so you might imagine
this concave meniscus

00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:36.416
is because the fluid is more attracted

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:39.226
to the container than it is to itself.

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:40.486
And you might be saying, "Wait, wait.

00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:41.986
"Hold on, hold on a second here.

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:44.365
"We've been talking about how water

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:47.696
"has this polarity, it
has partial negative end.

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:50.535
"Each water molecule
has a partially negative

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:53.135
"and has partially positive
ends at the hydrogens."

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:54.596
So let me write this down.

00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:59.565
Partial positive charges at the hydrogens.

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.245
And that causes this
hydrogen bonding to form

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:04.366
and that's what kind of gives water

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:05.846
all of these special properties.

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:07.365
"You're telling me that
it's more attracted

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:09.266
to the glass than it is to itself?"

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:11.627
And I would say, "Yes,
I am telling you that."

00:02:11.717 --> 00:02:13.455
And you could imagine
why it is going to be

00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:15.335
more attracted to the glass than itself,

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:17.396
because glass actually has,

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:21.466
the molecules in glass
actually are quite polar.

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:26.966
Glass, typically made up
of silicon oxide lattice.

00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:30.645
For every one silicon atom,
you have two oxygen atoms.

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:31.836
You see that right over here.

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:35.105
For every one silicon,
you have two oxygen atoms.

00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:39.466
And it turns out that the
electronegativity difference

00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:42.255
between oxygen and silicon is even higher

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:44.036
than the electronegativity difference

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.386
between oxygen and hydrogen.

00:02:46.386 --> 00:02:49.176
Silicon is even less
electronegative than hydrogen.

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:54.116
So the oxygens are really able
to hog silicon's electrons.

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:57.516
Especially the ones that
are involved in the bonding.

00:02:57.816 --> 00:03:00.486
So you have partial charges,
partial positive charges

00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:02.715
form at the silicon
and then you still have

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:06.827
partial negative charges
form around the oxygens.

00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:08.837
Form around the oxygens.

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:10.106
So these are partial negative.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:11.797
And partial positive at the silicon.

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:13.246
And so you could imagine what's going

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:14.166
to happen at the interface.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:16.025
And let me make this
clear what's going on.

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:20.776
This, what I am circling
right now, that is the water.

00:03:21.306 --> 00:03:23.956
This right over here,
that's the water molecules.

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:26.606
And what we see over here,

00:03:27.176 --> 00:03:30.482
what we see over here, these
are the glass molecules.

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:32.792
So this is the glass right over here.

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:35.342
And sure the water is attracted to itself

00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:37.623
because of the hydrogen bonds.

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:39.343
But it has some kinetic energy,

00:03:39.343 --> 00:03:41.042
remember these things are jostling around,

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:43.313
they're bouncing around,
we're in a liquid state.

00:03:43.653 --> 00:03:44.913
And so you can imagine all of a sudden,

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:48.647
maybe this, let me see,
maybe this character,

00:03:48.647 --> 00:03:50.258
this water molecule right over here.

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:52.559
Maybe a moment ago it was right over here

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:53.618
but it popped up here.

00:03:53.618 --> 00:03:55.169
It just got knocked by another molecule,

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.798
it had enough kinetic
energy to jump up here.

00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:59.019
But once it came up, came in contact

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.129
with the glass surface right
over here, the glass molecules.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.348
It stuck to them.

00:04:04.538 --> 00:04:07.518
Because its partially positive end,

00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:10.149
its partially positive
end at the hydrogens.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.358
Let me do it in that green color.

00:04:12.668 --> 00:04:15.229
The partially positive
end at the hydrogens

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.709
would be attracted to the
partially negative ends

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.559
of the oxygens in the glass.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:21.958
And so it'll stick to it.

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.989
This is actually a stronger partial charge

00:04:23.989 --> 00:04:26.199
than what you would
actually see in the water

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.449
because there's a bigger
electronegativity difference

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.538
between the silicon and
the oxygen in the glass

00:04:30.848 --> 00:04:33.529
than the oxygen and the
hydrogen in the water.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:35.509
So these things just keep bumping around.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:36.758
Maybe there's another water molecule

00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:38.088
that just get knocked in the right way.

00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:39.378
All of a sudden for, you know,

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:41.429
a very brief moment it
gets knocked up here.

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.499
And then it's going to stick to the glass.

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.088
And this phenomenon of something sticking

00:04:47.088 --> 00:04:50.110
to its container, we
would call that adhesion.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.219
So what you see going on here,

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.689
that is called adhesion, adhesion.

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.679
And adhesion is the
reason why you also see

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.298
the water a little bit higher there.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.179
When you talk about
something sticking to itself,

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.509
we call that cohesion.

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:06.619
And that's what the hydrogen bonds

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:07.778
are doing inside the water.

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:10.739
So this right over here, that over there,

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:14.809
that is co-, that is cohesion.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.289
So that's why we have things,

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.299
why we observe a meniscus like this.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.199
But there's even more fascinating
properties of adhesion.

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.309
If I were to take, if I were
to take a container of water.

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.909
If I were to take a container of water.

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.639
And just to be clear what's
going on here with the mercury,

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.579
the mercury is more attracted to itself

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:35.130
than it is to the glass container,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.589
so it bulges right over there.

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:37.979
But let's go back to water.

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.990
So let's say that this
is a big tub of water.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.208
I fill it.

00:05:41.658 --> 00:05:45.569
So, I fill the water right over here.

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:47.729
And let's say I take a glass tube,

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.069
and the material matters.

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:50.869
It has to be a polar material.

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:52.989
That's why you'll see
the meniscus in glass,

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:54.839
but you might not see
it or you won't see it

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.329
if you were dealing with a plastic tube

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:59.058
because the plastic does
not have that polarity.

00:05:59.398 --> 00:06:00.908
But let's say you were
to take a glass tube,

00:06:01.258 --> 00:06:02.960
a thin glass tube this time.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.909
So much thinner than even a beaker.

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.060
So you take a thin glass tube
and you stick it in the water,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.850
you will observe something very cool.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.749
And I encourage you to do this

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:12.689
if you can get your hands
on a very thin glass tube.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.949
You will notice that the
water is actually going to

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.359
defy gravity and start climbing
up this thin glass tube.

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.709
And so that's interesting.

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:22.749
Why is that happening?

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:26.249
Well this phenomenon which
we call capillary action.

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:29.329
Capillary, capillary action.

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:31.869
The word capillary, it'll
refer to anything from

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.119
you know, a very, very narrow tube

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.529
and we also have capillaries
in our circulation system.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.509
Capillaries are our
thinnest blood vessels,

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.119
those are very, very, very, very thin.

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:41.581
And there's actually capillary action

00:06:41.581 --> 00:06:43.329
inside of our capillaries.

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:44.450
But what we're seeing here,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.509
this is called capillary,
capillary action.

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:51.830
And it's really just this
adhesion occurring more intensely

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.780
because more of the water
molecules are able to come

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.149
in touch with the polar glass lattice.

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.499
And so you can imagine we have glass here.

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:03.739
If you also had glass over here.

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:05.169
And actually it would be very hard to find

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:06.779
something that thin that's on the order

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:07.861
of only a few molecules.

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:09.629
But this is, I'm not
drawing things in scale.

00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:10.851
You can imagine now okay,

00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:12.659
maybe another water
molecule could jump up here

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:13.639
and stick to the glass there.

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.310
And one just gets bumped the right way,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.970
jumps up and jump there.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.340
And if we didn't have a polar container,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.490
if we didn't have a hydrophilic container,

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.220
well then the thing might
just jump back down.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.760
But because it went up there,
it kind of just stuck to it.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.419
And then it's vibrating there

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.409
and then maybe another water
molecule gets attracted to it

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:31.509
because of its hydrogen bonds.

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:33.120
Then it gets bumped the right way.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.230
And then it gets bumped with the higher

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.600
part of the container
but then it sticks there.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.899
And so it starts climbing the container.

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:40.799
And that's what capillary action is

00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:43.000
and it's not just some neat parlor trick,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.591
we actually probably use capillary action

00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:47.259
in our every day lives all the time.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:48.929
Beyond the fact that
it's actually happening

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:51.520
in your capillaries in your
body that allows you to live,

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.930
but if you have a, if you spill
something on your counter.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.100
So let's say that's a
spill right over there.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.619
You spill some maybe,
you spill some water,

00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:00.099
or you spill some milk.

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:01.759
And if you take a paper towel.

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:03.669
If you take a paper towel.

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:05.609
In fact, if you took a
paper towel like this.

00:08:05.609 --> 00:08:09.528
If you held it vertically,
you will see the water

00:08:09.528 --> 00:08:12.230
start to be absorbed into the paper towel.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.849
This kind of absorption
action that you see,

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:18.039
that actually is capillary action.

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:20.249
It's the water going into
the small little gaps

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:23.108
of the paper towel, but
that's because it is attracted

00:08:23.108 --> 00:08:25.080
to the actual paper towel.
