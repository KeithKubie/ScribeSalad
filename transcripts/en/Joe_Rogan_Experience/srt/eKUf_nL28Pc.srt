1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,650
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:02,651 --> 00:00:07,150
one of the best boxers on planet earth
and his trainer BOMAC and Terrence

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,040
Crawford. Gentlemen, thank
you very much for coming here.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,920
Thank you ma'am with live now.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Hey man,

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,760
I'm a big fan of yours. I've, we've
talked about many times on this podcast.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,960
I'm a, I'm a huge fan of the way
you switch stances. You know,

7
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:23,690
you switch switch stances as
smooth as anybody ever. Like,

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,640
like you got to go back to Marvin hag
or to find a champ that switch stances

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,790
like as fluidly as you, it's
pretty, pretty impressive stuff man.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,380
Have you always been doing that?

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,400
A lot of practice. Yeah,
since I was little.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,790
I remember getting in trouble
cause I used to always switch him.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,800
My coach just thought he'd say you need
to worry about fighting that one style

14
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:47,780
first and perfecting that before you
try to try to switch and do it different

15
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:52,100
style. But I'll always switch. So it got
to the point where there was just like,

16
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:53,530
all right, well you're
going to fight like that.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,423
We're going to train it like that.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,870
Wow. So you've forced it
through. Right. Wow. Now,

19
00:00:58,871 --> 00:00:59,950
when you first started out,

20
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:02,230
was there anybody that influenced
you to switch like that?

21
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:03,700
Or was it just something
you felt naturally

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,550
or was it just naturally wow.
It was just like, all right,

23
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,230
this is not working so I
gotta do something else.

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,650
Just make it more tricky.
Right. Yeah. Well that's,

25
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:13,380
that's part of what's interesting
about watching you fights,

26
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,600
watching you fight is that you could see
you trying to figure out what's up like

27
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:22,740
first rounds with when you fight is one
of my favorite things to watch cause I

28
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,910
see you measuring dudes,

29
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:27,540
I see things happening and you switch
and stances and then when you start

30
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,680
finding the timing,

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,570
it's like timing is one of the more
fascinating things to watch about boxing

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,580
because a guy who has
perfect timing and perfect,

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,620
like when you see a guy make a read
and then execute and it's perfect.

34
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,630
It's one of the most beautiful
things in all of sports.

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Right? Right. It's like you, you know,

36
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:48,620
you watching every move and then
you just dissecting them slowly.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,230
How do you think, do you
think about it? Like when you,

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,380
when you start around a
first round of a fight,

39
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,280
is it different for every fighter
or do you always want to do that?

40
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:01,160
Do you always want to like put them
into the computer now is different.

41
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:01,570
It's different.

42
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,840
Like sometimes I just want to go out
there and just be like, all right,

43
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,850
I'm going to see what this dude,
God, see if he can tell you,

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,230
just go right to them. Yeah.

45
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,550
And then sometimes I just be like art
and I'm gonna take my time and you know,

46
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,450
figure him out, see how
fast he is seeing, you know,

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,510
what things he liked to do on what he
don't like to do or see if I moved this

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,700
way. His reaction, just certain things.

49
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,610
It's a, you know, we, you came
to the UFC this weekend and uh,

50
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,260
and obviously I love MMA,

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,820
but one of the things that I love
about boxing is when you take them all,

52
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,870
all the elements you take away wrestling
and kicking and all that stuff,

53
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,890
you get the highest level of
an exchange of your punches.

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,870
And you get to see with guys like you
guys like Canelo or Floyd or the the top

55
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:49,620
level boxes you get to see what's possible
with guys that are training with the

56
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:53,970
best scientific methods and with all
the knowledge of all the past fighters.

57
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,310
I mean, when you were growing up, who,

58
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:59,290
what was the fighter that
influenced you the most? Well,

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,940
hands down, Floyd Mayweather
and Roy Jones jr you know,

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,620
I used to love watching Roy Jones
jr I'm pretty sure everybody,

61
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,280
everybody was a fan of Roy, but set aside,

62
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:17,260
Roy always watched it. Floyd
Mayweather and Pernell Whitaker. Yeah,

63
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,890
I was too young for sugar
Ray Leonard and them.

64
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,000
So I'm old enough for that. I was
there for the sugar Ray Leonard days.

65
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:28,840
I was there for sugar Ray, Tommy Hearns,
the, the, the sh, the sugar Ray Duran.

66
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,880
I was there for all that stuff. But
I w I watched everything when I was,

67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,610
when I was young, my coach, ms miner,

68
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,020
he used to always take me to his
house and watch boxing tapes.

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,860
That was the keep me off off the streets
and keep me out of trouble until I went

70
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:48,760
to the gym. Is he still around now?
He passed. Damn. He probably like,

71
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:52,690
look at that. What did
that work out? You know,

72
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,440
we talked about an investment in time
that the worked out tremendously. Yeah,

73
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,880
the, the, it's always a,

74
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,110
in our culture there's a special
place for the highest level of boxers.

75
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,460
It was like a special
place of, uh, admiration.

76
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,800
And I just feel like with guys like Loma
Chanko with guys like you with Canelo

77
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:12,400
and tripleG , this is a great time
for boxing. It's fun to watch, man.

78
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:16,750
There's so many. Earl Spence, junior,
there's so many elite boxers right now.

79
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,570
It's like a really exciting
time. For sure. For sure.

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,710
Do you recognize your place in history?
Do you recognize that? Like you're,

81
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:26,020
you're a special dude?
Of course. Of course.

82
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,120
Like I always tell people when they,
uh, met your me and Errol Spence,

83
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,130
you know, of course I want the fight.

84
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,090
I'll tell everybody I already
say with or without him,

85
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,590
I'm going to the hall of fame.

86
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,780
When you look at audit things that out
of and co accomplish in the sport of

87
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:47,710
boxing people that's in the hall of
fame, then you've accomplished that.

88
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,420
You know? So I was, I just tell people
I don't need him. He really need me.

89
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,850
Well, we need it blocks. Right. Don't you
agree you're boxing? Do you need that?

90
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Boxing needs it. I mean,
it's one of the beautiful,

91
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,550
beautiful things about when a Canelo and
a triple G do get together and you see

92
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:07,150
these guys and their respected way
classes that are in their prime. It's fun.

93
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,760
You know? Like that's what everybody
wants to see. That's the fight.

94
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,230
That's what it's all about.

95
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,950
It just stop a whole lot of Barbara
barbershop conversations. Yes.

96
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,890
We need to stop a whole lot
of comedy club conversations.

97
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,340
Barbara chop garage
everywhere. Yeah. That's the,

98
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:24,070
that's the fight to make in your weight
class right now, right? For sure.

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,990
What's hole? What's the hold
up. You gotta acts down. Oh,

100
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,870
it's that we, everybody has to
hold out a little bit, right.

101
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:35,210
To get the best deal. That's great.
That's cool. You know, uh, it's,

102
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,830
it's all about business,
but at the same time, uh,

103
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,010
my side of of the deal is ready whenever
and you can see all the interviews out

104
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,491
there. Man.

105
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:50,491
You could see where if it's tears
from myself or Bob or anybody that's

106
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,950
affiliated with team Crawford,
we all say wants to fight,

107
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,940
you know? Yeah, we had a fight tomorrow,
you know, if we wanted to, so, well,

108
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,950
we know it's leery,
Alyse, it won't happen.

109
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:04,880
Right.

110
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,530
So when w what do you think that he's
waiting for the right time marketing wise?

111
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,480
Or do you think he's
ready for the right time?

112
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:14,480
Where his skills he feels like
are able to challenge you?

113
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,990
Like what do you think
is the actual holdup?

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,910
I think is, has something
to do with top rank and PBC.

115
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,500
Oh, okay. So it's a promoter issue.
So it's a financial scramble.

116
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,090
I won't say financial because the money
will be there if the fight was ever

117
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:35,050
made. I just think it is,
you know, Eagles. Yeah.

118
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,400
I think he goes up the price of Eagle.

119
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,171
Do you think?

120
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,900
Hopefully this is just something
that's going to take a little while,

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
but it will eventually come to play.

122
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,410
Of course, I think, uh, it
happened, you know, but I think,

123
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,453
you know,

124
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,320
me being with top rank and standing in
the way of a lot of things happening.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,380
Mmm, that makes sense. That
makes sense. He's like,

126
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,010
it's interesting that promoters or boxing
promoters worked together well at all.

127
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,970
Right. You know,

128
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:03,810
like you think about it like if the
UFC had to work with Bella Tor and put

129
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:05,520
together some world
championship fight every,

130
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:08,070
basically there's so many times
we get champion versus champion.

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,850
They have two different promoters and
they have to decide to get together and

132
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,220
make this happen. Who want to
get the more, most of the pot.

133
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,600
That's probably what it is. Yes,

134
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,630
it's going on Fox or ESPN and
who's going to promote it. And

135
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,430
it's also like when someone like Floyd
Mayweather has done what he's done and

136
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:28,300
sold the kind of paper views
that he's sold and then you know,

137
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,410
and achieved this sort of level of
financial fame as well as like people,

138
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,000
he's famous not just for being the best
boxer but famous for being insanely

139
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:42,160
rich. Like that's part of the fame.
Cause he promoted yes cause he promoted,

140
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,130
cause he figured it out and a lot of
other people are gonna probably try to do

141
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:50,270
the same thing as well. Right. That's
that's not my style. Too busy. Right.

142
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,420
Too busy. Yeah man mean you got to
just stay busy being Terence Crawford.

143
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,280
Do you want to be promoting that? Seems
like a lot of a pain in the ass. Well

144
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,290
just [inaudible] I do want to
promote it. I run my mouth and fit.

145
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,710
What about after you're done? When your
career is over, when you've retired,

146
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,780
do you think you'd do some promoting
then or training? What did you do? Nah,

147
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,190
I'd just be uh,

148
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,450
in my gym back at home and my coach got
us a gym and just put my time and effort

149
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:21,200
into the kids in the gym and my
five kids that I have. Beautiful.

150
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,980
Yeah, that's a, that's a,
that's a solid plan. You know,

151
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,860
you don't need to get involved
in that promoting shit.

152
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,990
Now it do get to the gym sometimes and
working with the fighters, do you? Yeah,

153
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,750
I got that funny because it's funny to
see work with them because after about

154
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,040
two rounds he came to this shit man

155
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,120
cause they're not listening like you
telling them over and over and do one

156
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:51,150
little simple thing and like just say
you tell them to keep your right hand

157
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,820
right. And they keep going like this.

158
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,140
Like are you talking about brand new
people like yeah, like even even boxers,

159
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,590
dad's being boxing for years that they
really don't have the fundamentals down

160
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:06,120
to a tee and you're like, dude,

161
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,180
you been boxing too long for you to
still be making the same mistake.

162
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,340
And it's like, I only can
say certain things for solid,

163
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,560
for certain learn for S for
solid learning. And then
it's just like, alright,

164
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,100
I ain't saying it no more. Well, yeah,

165
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,030
your opinion is as
valuable as anybody alive.

166
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,220
Do you one of the best
fucking boxers ever.

167
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:30,030
If you're a beginning boxer and Terrance
Crawford teaching you something,

168
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,790
you're not listening. You're
probably nervous as shit.

169
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,100
[inaudible] for sure. But that's crazy
that you'd be working with beginners.

170
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,920
That's, I must be wild for them.
They must work with all of them.

171
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,930
That's awesome. That's kind
of freaked them out though.

172
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,350
Especially the ones that's professional.

173
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,720
And they'd be in the gym
and I'd be yelling at them.

174
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,430
They'd be on a mess with BOMAC.

175
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,090
I'll come over there and critique them
and they'd be like, shit, here come bud.

176
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,680
They look at me like, am I doing it
right? Am I doing it right? And you know,

177
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,400
so I just want everybody to win.
I'll just keep them sharp. Well,

178
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,570
when someone has achieved that level,
the level that you have, you know,

179
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:09,450
like anybody around you that gets
a chance to watch your train.

180
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,840
And be a part of that. That's, that's
gigantic to see something like that.

181
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,140
And in the gym when you agree
just to see like a world champion,

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,590
I mean for just having
him around, you know,

183
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,150
in the gym when he's not even posed to
be training or just being around in the

184
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:28,500
other fires around is phenomenal because
you'll see this little extra pussy and

185
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:29,550
the guys sure.

186
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,760
You know or like he'll come and run
with them and I can see the smaller guys

187
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,840
just want to try to get ahead of him,
you know? So it's cool man. It's cool.

188
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,970
It's really cool. Yeah. That's
a do you think about that?

189
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:46,410
That how much you inspiring
guys? Of course. All the time.

190
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,850
That's why I come to the gym when
Bomag be like, man just take a rest.

191
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,660
Just relax. I come to
the gym and workout when,

192
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,930
you know I don't have nothing
coming up just so I can show them.

193
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,170
Like even though I'm the
champion of the world,

194
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:06,171
I still work extra hard to make sure I
stay champion cause it's harder to keep

195
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:09,240
the championship title then getting there.

196
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,630
It's one of the more beautiful things
about boxing is there's no shortcuts.

197
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,370
None for the best ever. You have to
train, you have to train hard as fuck.

198
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,730
You just got to do well. You don't want
to do it. There's no doubt about it.

199
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,370
You got to do everything you're supposed
to do. There's no if, ands, or buts.

200
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,600
And if you don't fuck with your head,

201
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,880
and that's one thing I
took from Floyd Mayweather.

202
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,520
You will always see them working out.

203
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,590
I don't care if he was at a bar,
you'll see him running from the bar.

204
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,550
He got his little workout
clothes and his little TMT, uh,

205
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,560
van and he just ran home. Like, I'll
use him three o'clock in the morning,

206
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,690
man, let's go work out. You know?

207
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,010
And that's what I admire the most of is
his work at his work ethic is off the

208
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:53,440
chart. Does the only way you be that
good? There's no other way. I mean, yeah,

209
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:56,500
he understands boxing at a level
that, I mean, grew up with it.

210
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,610
Having his dad and his uncle and all that.

211
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,000
The family was so many great boxers
around him all the time. But he,

212
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,320
you don't get that good without insane
work ethic. There's no shortcuts.

213
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,470
No, not at all. I,

214
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,890
I have never seen nobody like
put as much work in as Floyd.

215
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,800
So that's why, you know, for
me, I'm like thinking to myself,

216
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,130
I gotta work twice as harder, you know,

217
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:29,750
if I want to get above him because
I never want to be like anybody.

218
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:30,860
I always want to be myself,

219
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:34,280
but I want to surpass the people
that I was in front of me.

220
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,950
Was it, um, eyeopening when
you got to watch him train?

221
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,640
Of course. Of course. You know,

222
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:45,641
when I was younger it lets me know
that I wasn't working as hard.

223
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,420
Yeah. So now when,

224
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,900
when fighters come to my camp or I
bring in some sparring partners or some

225
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,240
friends that's professional
that just want to, you know,

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,860
come to camp and just experience, just
being in camp with a world champion,

227
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,460
they all say the same thing, man.

228
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:07,760
I thought I was working hard till
I came up here, man. You work man,

229
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:10,220
you work too hard. And, and
the thing for some people,

230
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,090
cause some people they just be
like, I can't do it today. Like nah,

231
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:15,170
I'm gonna let y'all do them too.

232
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,630
I'm going to go to the gym but I
ain't gonna do the other stuff.

233
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,950
And I just be like, man, come
on man. They'd be like, man,

234
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,080
my body and be like man, see that's
what it's going to determine.

235
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,070
Winning and losing. You complaining
about your body when you can rest later,

236
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,680
you know? Right.

237
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,390
What other stuff you're
trying to get them to do?

238
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:34,210
I know you do a lot of stair running,
right? I do a lot of everything.

239
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,460
I do yoga and I do street
relation. I do swimming,

240
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,230
hot yoga to do hot yoga. I love that.
I joke I used to do it two times.

241
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,880
I believe that everybody can do it.

242
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,820
It's just a mixture of, you know,

243
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,770
just all around body working out. What
do you find that you get out of yoga?

244
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,840
Oh man. Yoga is harder than you
think. You know, you in there,

245
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,560
you got to control your
breathing. You know,

246
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,040
just holding your hands in
certain positions is tiring.

247
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,600
So the little muscles that you
really not using, you know,

248
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:17,460
in a day to day activities you use in
a yoga and it's just burning and you're

249
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:21,300
just like, man, just hold your hands
up like this and going like this.

250
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,270
You be like, you be in
there shaking like man,

251
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,350
it's kind of burning and you see the
girls and you like trying to do it and it

252
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,330
just, it helps you with
your balance as well.

253
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,590
Yeah, it helps me with a bunch of
things. It's just interesting that uh,

254
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,020
more fighters don't adopt it. You know,

255
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:40,100
I think anything that makes your body
more flexible and increases your range of

256
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:43,520
motion and then gives you strength and
all the, it feels like when I do yoga,

257
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:48,020
like all the connecting stuff like
the shoulders and hips and knees,

258
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:51,860
all that gets like this extra stability
workout that you don't get from a lot of

259
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:54,790
other things. I feel like it connects
everything together. Good. And it,

260
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,780
and it helps you prevent
injuries. Yeah. Yeah. No.

261
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,630
So now w speaking of that, like what do
you do in terms of recovery? Do you do,

262
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,530
uh, ice baths or sauna and
massage, that kind of shit.

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,460
Massage and um, I don't, I don't
like the cold so I need to like,

264
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,230
I don't really take absence. All
bass. Yeah. Just did massages.

265
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,030
That's a grownup in Nebraska thing
though, right? What's that cold?

266
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,030
It's cold in Nebraska,

267
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:28,031
but I'm used to that cold but I just
can't fix myself to get in the ice tub.

268
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,970
[inaudible] I never was that
type. It's hard. It is hard.

269
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,440
I'd be like, you pick your
poison. I stick my feet in there.

270
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,000
It'd be like I ain't getting in there.
Yeah, it's rough. They'd be like,

271
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,430
come on, it's going to help you. All
right. It's gonna help me next time cause

272
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,060
fuck. Have you ever fucked
with cryotherapy? Ever
tried? I did that one time.

273
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,420
That's easier. Yeah, it was cool.
Cause only triads. Yeah. Dry, dry.

274
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:57,200
And it's only three minutes. So,
but that, that ice bath, yeah,

275
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,360
I'll do the car crier. Ice bath.
Nah, you want it. I'll be sore.

276
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,840
I don't know what the science says.
What's better? I've heard both things.

277
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,020
I've heard that the ice bath better
cause it's prolonged cause it's like 15

278
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:12,620
minutes and I've heard the cry was better
because you hit your body with such a

279
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,630
high degree of cold that freaks out
and produces these cold shock proteins

280
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:22,400
better. Either one. You do those,
um, you do massage. Do you do yoga?

281
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,680
What kinda S I know you do
strength and conditioning stuff.

282
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,050
Gotta watch your Instagram, you've
got a great Instagram. Right.

283
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,530
And your kids are wrestlers,
right? Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah.

284
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,220
Do you think your kids ever fight
MMA? Nah, I actually, I'm on,

285
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm trying to convert them to baseball,
really piety in the next year,

286
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,620
you know, because it ain't, it ain't
that much money in wrestling. It's true.

287
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,560
You know, when you look
at the MMA fighters, uh,

288
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,300
they ain't making a lot of money to
get beat up. Like they getting beat up,

289
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,890
like look at, uh, pedis.
He broke his feet. Right.

290
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,130
You know, but yeah, it looked like he
broke one of his ankles maybe. And,

291
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,050
or at least heard it. I'm pretty sure he
didn't make over 300,000 for that shot,

292
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,940
that fight. I'd like to know,

293
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,920
see if they find out how much the
Anthony Pettis made for that fight.

294
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,010
He broke his foot for sure. Yes. Oh yeah.

295
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:13,610
He was walking around or being pushed
around in a wheelchair today on Instagram.

296
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,740
Yeah. It's rough. You see people
getting need kicked in the face, teeth.

297
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,670
Do you look at it as being more
brutal than boxing? Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,360
You're taking,

299
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,360
you take more risks and UFC it's like
saying more head injuries but UFC more

300
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:33,910
risks for yes, for sure.
For injuries, right.

301
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,180
Broken bones and ankles
and knees and shit. Yeah.

302
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,220
And I just didn't get and where fall that
boxing ain't worth a lot of things too

303
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,120
cause you seeing people
die in the ring and uh,

304
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,830
and they ain't worth your life at the
end of the day when you decide to hang it

305
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:56,040
up. How will you know when you never,

306
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,790
well me personally, I won't
think I'll ever know when,

307
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,320
but I just got to date and the
age and like, alright, you know,

308
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,430
middle thirties. How old are
you now? I'll be 32 next month.

309
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,900
So your close, close. So you have
it in your head. Just got on top.

310
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,070
Like Marvin Hagler was one of the only
ones that ever do it. He went on top,

311
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,933
another switch hitter.

312
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,930
Marvin Hagler was the only one out of
all the greats who lost that fight.

313
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,350
Controversial loss to sugar. Ray
Leonard is like fuck this, I'm done.

314
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,250
He walked away. Nope.
Never ever came back.

315
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,300
[inaudible] his last fight was a
religion. Yup. Yup. That was it.

316
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,150
Controversial laws to let her
became a movie star in Italy.

317
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,310
He ever seen his movies in Italy? No.
I just watch some clips. Hilarious.

318
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,950
Marvin Hagler fucking people
up. He's like, Oh a movie star.

319
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,710
He does like these crazy
Italian movies. What is this?

320
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,190
How much he made for
155,000. Wow. 55 if he won.

321
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,170
But so Dee has made a flat
two 50 for the win. Yeah.

322
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,360
The, they used to before the Reebok deal,

323
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:04,740
they used to make much more way
more for sponsors. Yeah. Cause, uh,

324
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,850
I've got a buddy Marsala baked it.
You know that guy? He's really good.

325
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,850
Very talented. Brassica. Oh is
he? Oh, okay. Cool. He's fun.

326
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,930
Brought Bosnia buddy lives in
Lincoln, Nebraska. Okay. You know, uh,

327
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,610
real, real good friends. Real good
friends and talented kid. Yeah.

328
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:23,760
And they just always say art,
well we get paid for this.

329
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,430
If we win this for showing up this,

330
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,410
if we get best knockout out
of other data, this is more,

331
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,630
this is why we to Hagler as this
is why money is an action hero.

332
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,860
And this is like not far after
the fight with Indio too.

333
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,940
Cause there was a lot of lot of shit
that was unresolved after NGO one.

334
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,070
He was a, I've never seen that. Oh this,

335
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,950
these are the spaghetti
westerns like, but for you know,

336
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,520
whatever year this league
Harvard Haggard shoot,

337
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,680
everybody can speak the
language. Uh, yeah. Yeah.

338
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:02,990
Apparently speaks little Italian and
you know, he's a star over there. Wow.

339
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,370
Yeah. Look at, let me see.

340
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,820
But he just decided like, I don't want
to [inaudible] box anymore. I'm done.

341
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,840
That's good for him
though. Yeah. You know,

342
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,960
I mean to get punched in the
head no more. He speaks perfect.

343
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,340
When you hear him speak today, they do
a, you know [inaudible] never, never.

344
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,070
I'd love to, yeah, I'd like
to meet that guy. I was,

345
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:30,030
he was my hero when I was kid. Yeah,
I remember there was a video of him,

346
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:33,930
he was trained for Mustapha Hampshire
and he's running down Cape Cod in the

347
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,820
winter with a, with a hoodie
on, just screaming war. Whoa.

348
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,090
All the cold coming out of his mouth,
that steam and he's running. I was like,

349
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,040
Oh my God. Cause I was, you know,

350
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,070
doing martial arts back then and I
was watching him call him like that.

351
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,210
That's the ultimate champion.

352
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,730
That's a chamber that puts
himself in a terrible play.

353
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,630
Puts himself down on the Cape in the
winter time to do all his training in the

354
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,560
cold runs in the cold and it does
it in runs and combat boots too.

355
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:01,870
He ran in combat boots
and he would just be,

356
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,910
he was hard as fuck and he just had
crazy work ethic, crazy work ethic.

357
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,390
And I remember whenever I would think
about being, thinking about being lazy,

358
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:13,790
I would think of him running
down the beach going, Whoa,

359
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,830
just to just shadow
punching in the beach. Oh,

360
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,780
it's crazy that you say that because
I remember when we was little,

361
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,200
we used to always run in the cold. I mean,

362
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,090
it would be so cold where the snow
is freezing up. You tearing up,

363
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,390
but as you get older you'd be like,
man, I ain't buy run. And I go down.

364
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,070
I ran on the treadmill. You already know.

365
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,300
You already know. You know how to fight.
You know you know how to persevere.

366
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,530
You already know you're a champion.

367
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,850
You already know you're
at the top of the game.

368
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:47,140
You don't have to prove
that to yourself anymore.

369
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,770
You know how tough you
all know. No times that.

370
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,210
It'd be times that I'd just
be like, all right, we,

371
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,090
we need that hardcore work.
Let's go every name. I be like,

372
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:01,270
what? We ain't going
to, why not? One time.

373
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,680
One time we ran right
after Thanksgiving, dude.

374
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,440
Oh no. Right after,
right after Thanksgiving.

375
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,030
I don't get out there. Just get and
get in the truck. Let's go. Cool.

376
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,690
So he may, he made Thanksgiving
dinner and we in training camp,

377
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,910
so you know we all gotta lose weight and
stuff and Paul made all this fool man,

378
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:32,470
we all grub in this stuff and then so
I'm eating, after I get down eating,

379
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,370
I'm like man, I'm stuffed. I'm like man,

380
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,350
I can't wake up this heavy. I was like,

381
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:40,660
man everybody let's get
it ready to go around.

382
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,450
And everybody looking at me
laying down like, man, it's cold.

383
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:47,320
You treat you for it. So we run
it with these little flashlights,

384
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,940
like the little yellow man like
[inaudible] you go fishing and stuff.

385
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,190
So we all run in air by hunting
dude, dude, dude, why that night?

386
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,040
It was, it was pretty chill. Wow. Yeah.

387
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,380
But that kind of shit like
what Floyd may wear that does,

388
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,590
that's that two o'clock in the
morning workout routine every night.

389
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,790
Like it's good to just throw
monkey wrenches into your
sense of what you should

390
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:14,380
be doing and when be ready to do it.
Always. Yeah. That's why they're cold.

391
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:15,410
Weather running is big.

392
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,320
Cold weather running is those people that
live in cold climates that run in the

393
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:22,990
winter. Man, that's us.
That's a hearty breed.

394
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:26,830
A human that's not a regular person that
decides like nobody's got a gun to your

395
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:28,240
head. It's not your job.

396
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,450
You decide to put your fucking running
shoes on and lace up and go out there and

397
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:34,444
when it's zero,

398
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,570
it's kinda like when before I fought
America and I was down there shadowboxing

399
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,240
and in the snow and I blizzard. Oh yeah.

400
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,620
I w I'll it on, I'll put it on on
my Instagram. Everybody was like,

401
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,760
Oh he traded for Spence like 10 10 inches,

402
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,000
10 inches that day and it was a pleasure.

403
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,090
And we actually got knocked off
a couple of days of leaving.

404
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,480
Leaving for training camp. Yeah. Wow.
Cause there was so much fucking Snowden,

405
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,440
but there's something about that, like
even you talking about it, you know,

406
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:07,131
it's kind of wild.

407
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:11,210
You're out there boxing in the snow
shadowboxing in the middle of a blizzard.

408
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,670
Something wild about that.

409
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,490
It's crazy though because when it's
snowing it's not that cold. Right.

410
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,460
It's true, isn't it? Yeah. Like
insulates a little bit in some weird way.

411
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,560
I was just sitting in the house
and it was just like, man,

412
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,980
go outside and do something. So I went
outside, ran a little bit and dinner.

413
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,570
I come home and I was like, come here.
He's like, what? Like come and record me

414
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,260
shadowboxing and stuff after I
ran. So it was cool. So when,

415
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,420
when I see you doing those, a little stair
runs, you do that quite a bit, right?

416
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,490
Right. Every Sunday.

417
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,580
What did he do that in a around probably
won't tell anybody where you go.

418
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,590
They know they know last spring. Oh
okay. That's, that's a famous spot,

419
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:51,440
right man to to experience how many
steps is that? That whole thing.

420
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,560
Something crazy. Right? This is, it's a
mile and a half up. I know it's a Mount.

421
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,200
A mile up a Hill. How long does
it take you to get up there?

422
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Probably like 35 minutes before fucking
horrible run and I run and walk.

423
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,780
We walk up but some people running.
Oh you walk it? Yeah. That's insane.

424
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,300
Then people that'd be running the same
cause the air been thinner and thinner as

425
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:21,620
you go. And then the steps, you got
some steps that's like this, that small.

426
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:25,010
And then you got some steps where
you got to really reach. Oh like,

427
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,060
so if you're running the slip,
yeah, it's a fucked up crumble

428
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,590
for real. Yeah. Like when you,
when you were up at the top,

429
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:40,210
I feel like you were in
the clouds sometimes like
looking down like the cars is,

430
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,240
it's a straight shot. Would you
do your training camp up there?

431
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,140
Colorado Springs, right? Just for
the altitude? Yup. Yeah. Actually uh,

432
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,580
got a house up there. Oh really? You
just go back and do that for each camp?

433
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,180
What made you decide to do camps out
there? Just to get away from home,

434
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,300
you know, clear my head, get
away from all the negativity.

435
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:03,320
And I've been doing this since 2013,

436
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,410
37, 13, 2013 so, so do you have a
gym set up at, at the house. Oh,

437
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:13,310
that's nice. I saw like Canelo had
something like that down in San Diego.

438
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:15,380
There was a thing when he was
training for one of his fights,

439
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,640
they just rented the house, turned the
garage into a boxing ring. [inaudible]

440
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,350
that kind of thing. You
have all set up out there.

441
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,420
A lot of guys do that at big bear too,
right? Yep. It's similar today. Okay.

442
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,720
Yeah. Having that high altitude,
is that what you prefer?

443
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,170
Like look for for your wind?
Yeah, that, that helped my win,

444
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,350
but at the same time everything
is, is already set up.

445
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,770
Like everything from the yoga to the
swimming to the gym to everything.

446
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,470
It's like a second home to me. So it's
not like I got to go look in the fine.

447
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,220
Where am I to do this?
Where I'm going to do this?

448
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,850
It's like everything is
everything and you know,

449
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,530
my family come up there and
visit me and we get the job done.

450
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,320
That's all locked in right
now. When you go up there,

451
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:05,130
who sets your schedule as far
as what your daily routine is?

452
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,970
I know you said everything, yoga,
all, everything. Well, it's, it's uh,

453
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,690
it's two more coaches that that helps
me. Solid Diego's and red spike.

454
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:16,980
So we all get together,
we make a make a uh,

455
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,750
calendar like a month in advance.

456
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,170
And now when you do things like
when you add in yoga and swimming,

457
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,580
how do you know when to put those
in? W w everything was always,

458
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:31,140
it started off with a trial and error
back in 2013 grab that microphone pulled

459
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:33,380
up close to it. There we go.
Like I said, it's around,

460
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,200
it moves all over the place,
right? Every, like I said,

461
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,630
it's done with a child
or an ear. 2013 you know,

462
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:43,140
we tried this and we tried that and then
we started doing this and we started

463
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,480
doing that. And then, you know, just,

464
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,560
you just look at the fighter and just
see if it is, if it's working for him,

465
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,920
you know, and if it's working for
him, you want to stick with it.

466
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,790
And then you start adding little small
things into it. Like the old gun,

467
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:00,450
the swim in the run and
you know, the incline.

468
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,060
And so after so many amount of
years, I think we've been since 13.

469
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,280
I mean he just worked like clockwork now.

470
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,510
Now do you monitor in your heart
rate or how do you know, like do, do,

471
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:16,050
do any of that stuff while you're
training? Nothing. Just go by feel. Yeah.

472
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,350
Yeah. There's uh, two
schools of thought, right?

473
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,780
The schools of thought is like
the old way is the best way.

474
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,910
Like just do hard shit. Chop
wood, you know, run, do the,

475
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:26,940
do the standard stuff.

476
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,240
And there's other people that watch
their macros and you know, they're ma

477
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,520
smiling. You're not watching, I know
what you're talking about. But I don't,

478
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,270
we don't do none of that. Yeah.

479
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,490
I think we trained more or
less like the old school way,

480
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:41,570
but we do got like some of the new
stuff in like the strip, the condition.

481
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,420
We've got district to
condition a guy Jamie belt,

482
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,680
he's excellent and he kind
of adds a little stuff,

483
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,610
new modern age stuff in,
in, uh, into the workouts.

484
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,490
Like sometimes I'll be wanting to
do more and he be like, nah, I was,

485
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,270
I was enough for you. Like, you might
not think you did enough, but trust me,

486
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,730
you'll feel it tomorrow.
What? You wake up tomorrow,

487
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:06,050
you like God really is
sore. If there some ties,

488
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:10,190
like I'll add some stuff and just out,
you know, try and make things different.

489
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,580
You look at me saying now,
but we're not doing that.

490
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,820
[inaudible] already be like Danny.

491
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,850
He's like trying to add extra stuff
or would be like one more round.

492
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,331
All right,

493
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:27,390
come on one more round and then you'll
do that one more round and they'd be

494
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,600
like, all right, we got one more round
y'all. You'd be like, man, you'd be like,

495
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,231
man,

496
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:34,170
I just pushed everything down to that
last round because you said that was the

497
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:37,800
last round. Well come on baby. Come
on. I'm not about to argue with you.

498
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,630
So you can be great. So like,

499
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,300
all right, well the fighter,
it's like there's this,

500
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,160
this gotta be a balancing point, right?
Like you don't want them to do too much.

501
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,460
Right?

502
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,400
So like when that guy told you like
that's enough for today and you're like,

503
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,970
want to keep going? That's the natural
inclination is to work harder. Yeah.

504
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,960
It's that weird balancing point. We gotta
figure out when you're over-training,

505
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,570
right? It's if you're not monitoring
your heart rate or anything like that,

506
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:05,830
you just basically have, you have a
flat day, you feel flat, just chill out.

507
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,690
Yup. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes.

508
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,510
Boy always asked me before we go work
out, how you feeling? How you feeling?

509
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,650
Like I'm good at ball, I'm good. Or
sometimes I'd be like, man, I'm tired.

510
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:19,050
Like he'd be like, all right,
well we just gone coast today.

511
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,210
Like if a Spartan day
he'd be like, all right,

512
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,800
well don't be trying to do too much. We
just gonna spar, hit the mist, get out.

513
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:27,880
We ain't gonna do no bad. We
ain't gonna do nothing next year.

514
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,970
And then after I do the bagging,
sparring, I mean not the bag,

515
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:36,420
but the missing spar. I might be
feeling good and I'd be like, man,

516
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:39,060
let's do action and be like, nah. You
say you weren't feeling good at first.

517
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:42,990
Listen, come on, let's go. That's
the hardest part right there.

518
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,700
Pull up to know when to pull it back.

519
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,450
Right? Because he, he knows me. He
been with me since the beginning,

520
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,250
so he knows just by looking at me,
you know what type of day I'm having,

521
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,430
like either in the gym or outside the gym.

522
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,910
That's gotta be important, isn't it?

523
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:02,510
Like knowing him from the time when he
was younger and just start now to today

524
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,640
is definitely his way.

525
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,890
Plays a big part in the relationship
as far as like say inside the ring and

526
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:11,420
outside touring. Cause uh,
you know, as a trainer, you,

527
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,580
you'll never want your fighter to
overtrain or you'll never want him to

528
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,080
under-trained. So, but w I,

529
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,460
I'll never have to worry about him under
training because he's always in the

530
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,294
gym,

531
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,650
but I do have to worry about him over
training because he always in the gym,

532
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:28,960
you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like
you said, some days and be like, man,

533
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,850
maybe we're gonna pull back
this week. Why, man, man,

534
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,820
you've been training for already
for eight weeks, you know, so,

535
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:39,000
and we still got one or two more weeks
to go before we hit the down date,

536
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,320
the actual peak point, you
know? All right. What level
we have, we'll pull back,

537
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,310
you know, and then sometimes you yell
at hardheaded and say, no, come on man,

538
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:49,440
let me do a little bit more.
Alright dude. A little bit more,

539
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:53,310
but don't do too much. You know, you ain't
gotta put your all into it. You know,

540
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,520
just, just, just move around
a little bit. You know,

541
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,330
you got to do basically all fighters
like that. He says she fighters,

542
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,403
good fighters.

543
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,480
Cause most good fighters like
Terence and other fighters.

544
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:10,260
Jamelle herring, Steve Nelson, you
gotta you gotta pull them guys back.

545
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,350
You always gotta pull them back cause
they always want to go, go, go, go, go,

546
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:17,850
go. Cause I always got this winning
gotta fucking win. I gotta fucking win.

547
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,430
I understand that. I want
you to fucking win too,

548
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:21,810
but I want you to break your body down.

549
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:24,060
I don't want you to [inaudible]
you're boxing inside the gym.

550
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,490
You got to have something
left when you go to the fight.

551
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,280
That's a lesson that's very hard for
young guys to learn around. Yeah. Oh yeah.

552
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,400
Yeah. But it's so critical to know

553
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,440
where you body is. And at
this stage of your career,

554
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,010
I would imagine you just kinda
feel it, you know? Exactly.

555
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,160
And when you're in training camp

556
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,900
and you're gearing up for fight,

557
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,940
is that how it feels like you
know where you're at? Like, Oh,

558
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:46,490
this is where I'm supposed to be. I feel
this right here. Oh, he's just normal.

559
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,340
It's funny though, because every fight,
every single fight before the fight,

560
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,000
you know BOMAC always [inaudible]

561
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,360
waiting to hear me be like,
Aw man, I'm ready. I'm ready.

562
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,470
Like sometimes it'd be

563
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,560
a week before the fight, sometimes
it'd be two weeks before the fight.

564
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,330
But when he hear it, that's what I'm,

565
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,480
that's what I been waiting on.
It's like, nah, nah, I'm not,

566
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:19,560
I'm comfortable because like sometimes
he, he just be like, he'll look at me,

567
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,490
I'll be working and stuff and
then he don't say nothing.

568
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,550
But then when I come to him like,
yeah, I'm ready. He be lightened.

569
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,600
He said he ready. You get
that from the fighting,

570
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,000
right? Fuck down. Shit man. We'll
beat this motherfucker Zack. Well,

571
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:39,700
because you guys know each other so
well and you worked together so long.

572
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:43,120
Like you must like say, okay, here we
are, we're where we're supposed to be.

573
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,470
Right. You've, you've been there,
falls right into place. All right. My,

574
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,333
my biggest thing

575
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,750
in that,

576
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:53,490
I always told bone every since I was
an amateur because I remember losing a

577
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:57,420
couple of fights because I didn't train
as hard and I got tired, you know,

578
00:33:57,421 --> 00:34:00,960
and I couldn't really do too much
and always told bill. I said Bo,

579
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,220
if I'm in the best of my shit,

580
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,450
best shape that I possibly can be in
nobody being nobody named Baldwin,

581
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,483
I know

582
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,830
that's why you need to
quit bullshitting. So,

583
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,880
so it just got to the point,

584
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:20,720
real friend that's a real
trainer and a real friend is.

585
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,690
So it just got to the point where I just
start like training real, real hard.

586
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,840
And I was just like training not
to go over you in this happened.

587
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,950
I was a teenager. I'll just
start training, not to get tired.

588
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,940
If I can go in there and fight
and not get tired, I'm a win.

589
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,130
That's what I always stayed
at. So the switch flipped. Yup.

590
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,680
He figured it out cause I was losing
the people that I shouldn't have lost to

591
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,680
just head down just swinging wall. Wow.

592
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:51,890
But they was in shape and I was trying
to be all cute and slick and get tired.

593
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:56,010
Now it's a matter of life and death,
knee hole. And they pushing me.

594
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm falling all over the place
as a, as a little kid, you know.

595
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,150
And I was just like, I'll never get
that tired ever again in the fight.

596
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,790
Dad is such an important lesson for young
fighters to hear such important lesson

597
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:11,160
that it's, there's no shortcut. When you
look at a guy like Terrence Crawford,

598
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,560
you'd say, well that guy
must be insanely talented.

599
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,090
I mean his timing is reads on people, the
ability to switch dances. And he said,

600
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,250
well duh. Yeah. Well
how'd that come about?

601
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,120
That talent came about through
relentless hard work. Right? That's what,

602
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,390
that's what makes that talent
emerge. I'm sure you have a,

603
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,680
an amazing inclination for boxing.
Every elite of the elite fighter does,

604
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,740
but you don't get to be there without
any hard work. It doesn't exist.

605
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,870
There's no way. There's no,

606
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,510
it's so important for young fighters
to hear and that's what a lot,

607
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,660
a lot of guys that don't see you
as that hard work in the jail.

608
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,913
You know what I'm saying?

609
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,320
[inaudible] with anything that when you
look at any top fighter and you look at

610
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:54,321
all the sacrifices they make
just to be where they at and you,

611
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,560
you have people taking shots at them
and stuff and they'd be like, man,

612
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,101
yo know what?

613
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:03,840
I didn't put my body due to be here today
or you didn't know what I went to went

614
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:08,841
through and is just like total disrespect
for somebody that haven't even stepped

615
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:12,330
foot in the ring to be trying
to critique you when they ain't.

616
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,630
They ain't even stepped foot to
get punched in the face before.

617
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,550
They can never really
understand though, right?

618
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,940
No one could ever really understand what
it takes to be an elite boxer when your

619
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,240
whole, the future of your
family, the future of yourself,

620
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:28,440
your financial success and all the
people around you is dependent on you

621
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,460
navigating the most shark filled
waters in professional sports budget,

622
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,340
train killers with their hands.

623
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Everybody's real good at knocking other
people out with their hands and you are

624
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:41,490
successfully navigating
those waters like Nope.

625
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,720
No one really understands
that other than you, right,

626
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,560
you and all the other people like you
will like the real me people on the

627
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:49,050
outside that are close to you
kind of get it a little bit.

628
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,050
You are the only one that's ever
going to be able to understand that.

629
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:54,660
So all those people talking shit like
they might as well be speaking a language,

630
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:57,300
they don't even know what the
meaning is. Fact, it's nonsense.

631
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,900
Just say nonsense and it's just like
you got a bullseye on your head in your

632
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:05,460
back because you, you, you reverse first.

633
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:08,610
You had your eye on somebody
and you was like, man,

634
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:11,520
I gotta beat this door after this
dude. I gotta beat this dude.

635
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,600
So you was I in that person that
was in your shoes, you know,

636
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,330
that was once champion of the world.

637
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,220
Like I was iron Ricky burns when I was
coming up, you know, and not there.

638
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:26,250
I be him now. Everybody's
IME because I'm chatting now.

639
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,100
So it's no more Ricky burns.
It's Terrence Crawford.

640
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,660
We got to get Terrence Crawford. He's
the chin. So now, and it's like damn,

641
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,400
everybody wants your head.

642
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:40,130
So now you've got Cheney were harder to
keep the title [inaudible] got show up

643
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:45,170
at your gym. Talk shit like Shannon
Briggs style and nobody coming home.

644
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:49,700
The hall man, Shannon Briggs
where his weight class,

645
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,980
he would show up in Omaha. Let's go

646
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,830
try to break. He's a Lyria. He will leave
on the hall the same way he gave me.

647
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,590
He told me I got beat up by somebody. Uh,

648
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,660
do you ever see what he did to Vladimir
Klitschko when they cut each other and

649
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,643
then when they were,

650
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,650
well there's a couple of times one at
a restaurant poured water on his head,

651
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:15,970
but he comes out that's right
from the broken glass. Right.

652
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,840
But the other time was, Oh, he was,

653
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,490
he was on a wakeboard or
on a paddleboard and uh,

654
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,200
Shannon came by in a boat and knocked
him off the fucking bat and the waves

655
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:27,510
fell. That's, I picked that
one stage, all that stuff.

656
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,380
I think it was seems like it was
stayed just like, man, how are you?

657
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:33,650
You know where it is, man. That every
single time he lets go some point.

658
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,020
It's good point and then you just so
happen to have some good cameras getting

659
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,660
the footage. It's true.
Then wasn't good cameras,

660
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,740
but Shannon wisely would travel with
good cameras and then just start making

661
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:49,650
these these scenes. He never fought
him. Yeah. He didn't ever fight them.

662
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,660
Yeah. I think you fought him when he was
younger or something knocked him out or

663
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:56,590
something like that. Vitaly Vitale
knocked him out. Yeah, he fought.

664
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,010
He fought the older brother
Vitaly. He was a monster. Yeah.

665
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,660
That's why we fought. Right. I
believe Vito V it's how you say it.

666
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,280
That's how you say vitally does. That
guy had an iron jaw. The brother.

667
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,200
Nobody could knock out
the brother. It was crazy.

668
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,700
That guy would just take bombs.

669
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:16,140
Remember when he fought Lennox
Lewis immediately? Yeah. Took bombs.

670
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,520
I mean that that guy
was so God damn durable.

671
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,820
He would've won that fight if he wouldn't
have got that cut. Giant cut. Yeah,

672
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,290
he was winning. What a
weird style too. Right?

673
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:29,410
He had the one of the most awkward, like
so strange watching him throw punches,

674
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:34,411
but it was effective and he remind
me of a Drago off Iraqi a little bit.

675
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,710
That guy's a doc, like he's got a pH D
I think he speaks like five languages.

676
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,170
What'd they call them? Doctor iron
fist was that his name was a character.

677
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,460
It's interesting too,

678
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:51,880
like the heavyweight division has now
become the focal point of boxing again.

679
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:54,580
It's very exciting. I was
like, yeah. For a long time,

680
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,780
Vladimir Klitschko was the heavyweight
champion of the world and for whatever

681
00:39:58,781 --> 00:39:59,980
reason, nobody gave a fuck.

682
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,850
It was weird because he was
dominating all those years.

683
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,160
He was jabbing clutch, jabbing clutch,

684
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,380
because we didn't have the American
champion for sure. So everybody was like,

685
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,260
Aw, forget it. We went there.
Probably something to do with it,

686
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,900
but if he was fighting, it's like,

687
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:18,790
can you just find the way
dr Deontay Wilder does?

688
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,450
Who cares if he's from the moon? Right.
You start showing people like that,

689
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,490
like we want to see that guy fight. Like,

690
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:27,250
you don't care if that guy's from
fucking Brazil, wherever he's from.

691
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,750
When you're laying there right
hand, good night, God damn.

692
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,150
It's one of those punches
where people just go,

693
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:39,250
you see people in the audience
go, God, he hits hard.

694
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,990
Even when he don't fully extend.

695
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:45,991
It'd be like the crazy thing is when he
fought Tyson fury who was two Oh nine

696
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:51,400
two Oh nine, just nothing to
any punches. So fucking hard.

697
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,700
It's crazy. That dude is a, an anomaly.

698
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,210
The fact that he won a bronze medal in
the Olympics three years after taking up

699
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:02,830
boxing. Right. Does insane.
Insane. It's just insane. Yeah.

700
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,110
Cause there a lot of people they asked
me, cause we was in the same, you know,

701
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:12,010
trials in 2007 and it was like,

702
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,060
do you ever remember Deontay Wilder
and, and the amateurs? I said, man,

703
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:18,040
he came out of nowhere cracking people.

704
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,700
He never went on none of the,
the uh, duals or nothing.

705
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,640
He just came out of nowhere. Yeah.

706
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:34,430
He's all the top guys
in the division. Crazy.

707
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,050
That's a, let's say he's a unicorn.
You know when you look at his record,

708
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,060
what is it like 39 knockouts out
of 41 fights, something like that.

709
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,310
40 knockouts, 40 knockouts and
41 fights all his four year gate,

710
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,190
39 39 years. Two only two fights. One.

711
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,140
What is it a the first one was
it Brazil dump? No. No, Brazil.

712
00:41:55,141 --> 00:41:59,240
He just knocked out. Who was, who
else who went the distance? Stubborn.

713
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:02,360
Stubborn went the distance and their
first fights. The Vern and yeah,

714
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,300
and then he flatlined him in the
second fight. That crazy one.

715
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,480
Just the hits dude. Why
in man, people go flying.

716
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,200
He got the law. He got
the right last name. Wow.

717
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,360
What's he doing? Wow, he's
start. How about that?

718
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,640
To this day the dude interviewing
was like, shit, what did I do?

719
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,740
What the fuck did I do? And then
he uses hashtag till this day.

720
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,580
He uses that all the time when his
Instagram so that guys gets shellshocked.

721
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:38,230
He gets PTSD every time. Rash
hashtag till this day. He's like, no,

722
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,190
I, it's funny though, because we
all, we all be saying that now

723
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,340
till this day. I am going back
to that. That story told him,

724
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:53,200
yeah, he took that phrase over.
Yeah, that was a, that was a phrase,

725
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,260
you know that he just owned. He took
it over. That's his now. All right.

726
00:42:56,261 --> 00:43:00,280
That's it. That's this one
interview till his day.

727
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,840
One interview, one interview before
a fight. He's getting geared up.

728
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:07,440
But you seem to look
all my God. Terrifying.

729
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,180
Terrifying.

730
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,130
When you know how hard that guy hits
and he's mad at you like this muffler to

731
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,670
knock me out for sure. 100%
he would never do that.

732
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:22,450
It's like you beat your in the room and
a lion like, Oh no. And he's aggressive.

733
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:25,900
He's mr lion. Oh, you
sure this thing's trained?

734
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,500
You sure it's not going to
eat me. He's so, he's there

735
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,700
too. That must have been terrifying.

736
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Please blink fully geared up and ready
for me for war before this fight.

737
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:47,060
That is [inaudible]. That is
hilarious. That is hilarious.

738
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,540
So this whole division. Now, if you look
at the heavyweight division between,

739
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,900
you know, Andy Ruiz just
beats Anthony Joshua,

740
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,330
and then they're going to try to figure
out what they were going to try and do

741
00:43:56,331 --> 00:44:01,130
that in Saudi Arabia. But apparently
Andy's like, while I'm fighting America,

742
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,810
he should took gay guys in Saudi Arabia,
a big money fight. I'm sure. Well,

743
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,850
they're still gonna do it.
They just arguing over where
is it off the table now?

744
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,720
I don't know this. I did. Who knows, man.
I mean, you guys know better than me.

745
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,210
It's a lot of games have been shipped by
like where you're talking about before,

746
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:20,720
ego and stuff. Same kind of deal, I'm
sure as the arrows. Spence jr fight.

747
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,650
Same kind of deal.

748
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,210
They're jocking to see who could get
the Andes worried about I'm taking from

749
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,360
[inaudible]. Yeah. He's worried about
taking some Mexican supplements. Right.

750
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:31,920
While he's over in another country that
they won't test him. So he should have

751
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,530
Vata or yes. Right. Testing that is
going to go over there and you know,

752
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:39,720
testify it. Yeah, that's a,

753
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,440
that's one of the reasons why people
gonna love a dude like Andy Ruiz as a

754
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:47,160
champion. Like he, he looks like a
regular folk. Right. You know, he's like,

755
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:51,160
he's got a lot of extra body fat.
He's a bad motherfucker. But you know,

756
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,160
Anthony, Joshua looks like
he was made in the lab.

757
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,140
Just got a perfect physique man.
It's crazy how, how big dude guy?

758
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,060
He's huge cause man he wasn't that big
at first, but now he's slim it down.

759
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,550
But I think he put on a
lot of weight to, you know,

760
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:11,310
carry with vitamin mere
Klitschko please go.

761
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,650
Is that when you put all the
weight on? Yeah, I think so.

762
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,810
What kind of testing they do for that
fight? Uh, they test you for everything,

763
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,100
but did they test you for everything
at the wanes? Nah. See, see me.

764
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,560
Um, I'm with the Vada during
the full testing tools.

765
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,980
They show up at six
o'clock in the morning,

766
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:30,540
the whole deal and they
can test out. They,

767
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,480
they can test me right now and if they
wanted to tell him I'd be waiting outside

768
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:37,980
right now. It's cool. Cause I know
I'm good. So, but when he fought, um,

769
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:42,850
Vladimir and he got all big, what did
they do with any kind of wide testing?

770
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,480
I don't know what type of contract,

771
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,920
what they signed for on a
contract when they fight contract.

772
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:52,230
But I know me when I'm in training camp,

773
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:56,460
they come whenever they had come six
o'clock in the morning and turn around and

774
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:58,530
come at six o'clock at
night if they wanted to.

775
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,150
That's a point of diminishing returns
when you get too much muscle, right? Like

776
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,580
yeah, it can make you stronger, but that,

777
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,210
that's going to need a lot of oxygen
too. And if your body's not used to it,

778
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,700
if you, if this is over the
course of like a year or two,

779
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:15,780
all the sudden you got this
extra muscle like is, do you,

780
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,870
are you a fan of guys lifting a lot of
weights and lifting up lightweight? Yeah,

781
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,970
the right way just to stay strong. Yeah.

782
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,810
Well I have a vendor Holyfield we're
scheduling Evander Holyfield. I'm excited.

783
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,640
Huge Evander Holyfield fan.

784
00:46:27,641 --> 00:46:31,540
But he was one of the rare guys that
put on the mass and moved up from

785
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:36,190
cruiserweight to heavyweight and
fucking still never got tired.

786
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,280
I mean Evander never got tired cause he,

787
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:43,360
they put the work crazy work ethic and
he was a guy that got thick and muscular,

788
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:46,210
but it didn't slow him down.
It enhanced him, you know,

789
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,270
especially when you get into
like the Tyson fights like that,

790
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,510
that muscle didn't hold him pack
at all and he was fucking jacked.

791
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,200
I mean he was he comparison to
cruiserweight Evander Holyfield.

792
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:58,450
Do you look at heavyweight of random
old like the Riddick Bowe fights.

793
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:04,030
D D is scroll up a lot. Fuck. He
was just cut though. Yes. Chiseled.

794
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:07,840
Yeah. So that's what
Joshua said, dude, cut,

795
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:10,660
cut down a little bit and she
has a weapon, gets a get mobile.

796
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,680
Do you think this was something that he
got mad at Lennox Lewis for saying that

797
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:17,230
he needs to change camps? Do
you think that makes sense?

798
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,150
Maybe just he should sit down with his
team and figure out where they went wrong

799
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:25,360
at. I don't think about, I don't
think you should change everything.

800
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:29,680
The word was that he had gotten knocked
out in training. That was a true,

801
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:29,980
you heard

802
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,340
that as well by Joey. Well, Terrence
Crawford heard it. Shit's got to be real.

803
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,630
That's what I'm saying. I'm just
going, I'm going. I'm Twitter now.

804
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,580
I want to say it feels real or fake.
I'm just saying. I heard you heard it.

805
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,450
Yeah, but you know,

806
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:44,920
most people heard the rumors go around
and everybody here and it's not even true

807
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,150
because that could happen. Right?

808
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:50,110
Like Richard Gere with that juror
bulb his ass. Remember that one? You

809
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,610
ever heard that? But you never heard
that he said a jerboa PD. You heard it,

810
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:58,820
right? Yeah. Tell him to tell him
the rumor. I just heard the rumor.

811
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:01,810
I don't know. Kids were kids. Um,

812
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,690
there was a rumor that Richard Gere
had to go to the hospital. Get a,

813
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:08,500
we'll take out of his ass. Now
I grew up in the East coast.

814
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,790
My friend Eddie grew up in California.
He heard the same story. I was like,

815
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:14,190
this is the same God damn rubber.

816
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,620
Like how this room we get across the
country with the same age, no internet.

817
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,680
The rumor made it all the way across
the country when we were in high school.

818
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:22,770
So was it true or not? Probably not.

819
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,270
I think you'd get out
of trouble out yourself.

820
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,250
You don't need to go to the
hospital. You know is not,

821
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,410
not worth the embarrassment.

822
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:33,040
You'll take some time to go to the store
and buy some tweezers, but you're, uh,

823
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,100
you don't need to go to the hospital.
Just get a mirror and some tweezers.

824
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:39,310
We could handle this. We don't need
to let everybody know our business.

825
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,380
The other one was rod
Stewart, rod Stewart.

826
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:44,020
There was a rumor where in high
school it was boom, pre high school,

827
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,080
the rod Stewart had swallowed a bunch of
Jews and had to go to the hospital and

828
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:47,914
get his stomach pumped.

829
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,750
It was probably some guy who rod Stewart
fucked his girlfriend and he started

830
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,220
riding the bad guy. And
that probably is true.

831
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,060
I don't think so because I
think when I hosted fear factor,

832
00:49:04,061 --> 00:49:06,310
we made people drink
calm. They had to drink.

833
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,910
They had a drink donkey com you could
drink it and you can drink a lot of it and

834
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:12,190
you're fine. I don't think you
have to go to the hospital.

835
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,790
My experience on fear
factor, it taught me that a,

836
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:19,420
I don't believe that rod Stewart
ever had that real problem. Hey,

837
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:23,260
so did you ever do anything that
uh, I ate attempts. I ate some shit.

838
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:26,650
They wouldn't let me try any of the stunts
because of insurance purposes or you

839
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:27,360
know, they had,

840
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,580
cause the insurance doesn't let
the host just try it out for fun.

841
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,050
Like I wanted to drive some of
the cars off buildings and shit,

842
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,221
but they wouldn't let me do,

843
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:36,340
we had one where they hit a
ramp off the top of a building.

844
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,790
They hit a ramp and the ramp flipped the
car through the air and they flew and

845
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,310
they landed on these cardboard boxes.

846
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,880
They stack these cardboard boxes
up like several stories high.

847
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,020
And that's how they would get these cars
to land softly. So the car would boom,

848
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,050
hit the cardboard box and
just slowly sink down.

849
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,210
And then they would use a crane,

850
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,210
flipped the car over and then
they could use that car again.

851
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:01,420
It didn't even get damaged. Wow. So these
people would fly this fucking car off.

852
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,660
It looked like the craziest amusement
park ride ever. And you wanted to do all,

853
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:07,780
fuck yeah, I want you to get it man.
I'm like, come on, let me do that one.

854
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:12,030
It looks easy. I'm like, I'll do
it for the promo. Like God man,

855
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,620
I be cool with jumping
out the plane. Yeah,

856
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:18,820
we didn't do any of that but we did
have people bungee cord jump off of a

857
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:21,100
fucking helicopter. That was crazy.

858
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,240
We had a people with a cord there was
attached to a helicopter and then they

859
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:28,820
were hooked up to a tree and they had
an unlocked themselves in the tree.

860
00:50:28,821 --> 00:50:30,300
They had all got a ring of keys.

861
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,090
He had to find the right key
in a certain amount of time.

862
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,600
And then when they did it,
they unlocked and trying.

863
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,850
They went flying through the air cause
they were attached to a bungee cord and

864
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,760
the bungee cord was underneath
the helicopter and it
would go fucking launching

865
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:43,370
them out into the middle of this
crazy Canyon. I was like, Oh my God,

866
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,400
someone's gonna die. Someone's
going to die. This isn't worth it.

867
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:47,480
This job's not worth it.

868
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,110
There was a couple of times where I
thought someone was going to die. Hey,

869
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:54,080
that's crazy. Stupid. Ridiculous.
I'm glad. I'm glad we got through it.

870
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,070
When nobody getting hurt, I'm sorry.
[inaudible] came up with the uh,

871
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,380
the stunts and all that. There was a
bunch of people, they had a whole team.

872
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,450
There's teams that people that
came up with eating stunts.

873
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:03,890
There were the beat team stunt guys,

874
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:06,080
and then the AA team
stunt guys was the first,

875
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,800
first stunt and then there was the, the C,

876
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:11,840
which was like the big championship
finale thing. It's ridiculous show.

877
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,860
Last time, man, I used to watch that
show all the time. I'll have the time.

878
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,410
I can't believe it's real. I
watch it to this day. I was like,

879
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:22,870
is that really me? What
is that? So long ago. Uh,

880
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,560
I remember I used to watch
jackass, jackasses. Amazing.

881
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:31,630
Those guys are alive, Steve. Oh,
so healthy. You're fine. Come on.

882
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,530
Making a fourth movie.
They're rolling that dice.

883
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,950
They're rolling that die. Someone's
going to die. Damn. That's crazy. That's,

884
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:44,650
I only seen pimps of that.
Johnny Knoxville was a movie
star for awhile. Right.

885
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:45,890
Cause he's still doing big movies.

886
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,500
I think so he was doing big movies and
then he was still willing to let a bowl

887
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,630
hit him. He put a blindfold on,

888
00:51:53,631 --> 00:51:56,180
stood in front of a bowl and the bull
just fucking launched him through the air

889
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,020
blindfolded. Shit. That's the dumbest

890
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,560
[inaudible] it's like the girl
bus guys got fucked up, man.

891
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:09,770
I mean that is theirs. They're taking
some beatings. I'm, what do we do? Laugh.

892
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

893
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,410
See what you do is control
who gets fucked up. Right.

894
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,020
That's what I like about boxing.

895
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,530
When I watched boxing
express at the highest level,

896
00:52:20,531 --> 00:52:25,250
it's like one guy is controlling who
gets fucked up, you know? Yeah. Red,

897
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,130
the other guy liking or not, whether
the other guy likes it or not.

898
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:28,910
What was that?

899
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,580
The Mexican gentleman that you fought
recently that was talking a lot of shit

900
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:35,510
and stopped him Benevidez
Benevides, right? Yeah.

901
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:39,920
That seemed like a particularly satisfying
one for you because it was a lot of

902
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:43,810
shit talking, leading up
to that fight for years.

903
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,310
There's certain times when you watch
guys talk shit and I go sodden,

904
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,140
this is not a good idea. But it
just came out of [inaudible] and

905
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,530
nowhere, like I never
said nothing to that dude.

906
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,660
Never did nothing until that dude like,

907
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:03,430
and he just out the blue just
for years, like I'm ducking.

908
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,920
I'm like, dude, you went up and wait.

909
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:10,330
I'm at one 40 like when I was at one
35 he was talking about fighting me.

910
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:15,370
He was at one 40 I got up to one 40 he
wanted a little fight and then he moved

911
00:53:15,371 --> 00:53:16,750
up in weight and I'm like, dude,

912
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,410
like you're nobody for
me to be worried about.

913
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,960
So then it got to the point
where he was like, Oh,

914
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:27,961
well they made me an offer to fight
you and you talked me and this.

915
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,390
So he started telling
everybody I ducked them.

916
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:34,950
I been ducking them since one 40
so in a press conference I said,

917
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:38,700
did y'all ever and offer me or
him a fight to fight each other?

918
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:40,020
And I was like no.

919
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,440
So I was so worried come up with
that cause like well it don't matter.

920
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:45,840
We fighting right now. So all right.

921
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,480
It was a good fight. This good fight
is a good fight too to showcase you,

922
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,530
you know, particularly the knockout. And
that was a beautiful combination man.

923
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:57,190
When we clipped him right. And then
he gets up and then you put him away.

924
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,550
When you watch a fight like that where
you have a guy who talks shit and then

925
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:03,760
you wind up fucking him up. Was
it ever more satisfying? Oh yeah.

926
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,170
Cause you seem to enjoy it.

927
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,430
It's like Hey the best fighters enjoy
putting a beating on someone. Yeah,

928
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:10,623
of course.

929
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,410
Going into the fight,

930
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,780
I had to calm my emotions down
cause of the anger. Right.

931
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,370
Because I really want the hurt that
dude, you know. So going into the fight,

932
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:28,230
I got to keep reminding
myself, stay calm, relaxed,

933
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,190
don't go in there and do nothing stupid.
Cause this is what he wants you to do.

934
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,580
And you been here before, you
know, this is nothing new.

935
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:40,530
You didn't have people talk crazy to
you, but not to the level that he did.

936
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,540
But you didn't have people
talking crazy until you,

937
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,880
so that's why when I first got
in there, I was being patient,

938
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:50,220
taking my time and just filling them out.
You know, cause he's long, he's tall,

939
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:54,630
he's long, got some speed on
him, but he's a naturally uh,

940
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:55,950
counter-puncher.

941
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,490
So it was like I wasn't going to go in
there and be careless and get countered

942
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,080
because I already knew
what he wanted to do.

943
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,420
Okay. So when you, when you see a guy, a
guy like that, and you're fighting him,

944
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,370
what, what is the strap like?

945
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,850
This is a different strategy than a normal
fighter because of the length and the

946
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,970
counterpunch mobility. So you
have to adjust, right. So what is,

947
00:55:13,971 --> 00:55:15,470
what was your plan going in there?

948
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,330
Well, see me,

949
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:21,380
I got long orange to be in
a division and my height.

950
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,850
So I was just like, all right,
just pick them apart, you know?

951
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,910
And then once you go
into your combinations,

952
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:31,700
make sure you throw more than once
because you're going to counter that first

953
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:32,534
one properly.

954
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,800
And when you watch the fight, you feel
like that's exactly what you're planting,

955
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,000
preparing for right now. When
you see Errol Spence, excuse me,

956
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,290
we see Errol Spence jr.

957
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:48,020
Does he represent to you like the one of
the best of the upcoming guys that are,

958
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,790
that are possibly on your radar? At least?

959
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,700
I really can't say that.
You know, because arrow,

960
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,520
this is the first real big test
that he's up against. You know,

961
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:00,390
um,

962
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:04,320
his last fight was with, uh, Mikey
Garcia. That was a good fight. I mean,

963
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,030
that was a good test.

964
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,700
It's true. You know, uh,
Mikey came from, what, one 26?

965
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:15,790
No. Um, he's what, five, six? When

966
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:19,540
you see the two of them at the Wayans and
you really could see the difference in

967
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:24,040
the size of arrow. I mean, Earl's ripped.
Right. You know, so that's, that's why

968
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,120
I say you really can't tell with
my DRCs, don't get me wrong.

969
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:30,490
Mikey's a hell of a fighter, you know?

970
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:34,660
But that was his first fight in the
division. Uh, he's a smaller guy.

971
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,370
He's short and his arms is shorter.
Arrow, taller, longer, bigger,

972
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:43,690
you know, so faster. So
you, he really couldn't,

973
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,050
I really couldn't see what I
was trying to see. So Mike,

974
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,780
Mikey went up just because it
was a big fight. Right? Right.

975
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,950
Is he going to stay there
do you think? Or is he, yes,

976
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,750
I believe he's going to fight Danny
Garcia. Oh, interesting. Interesting.

977
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,920
There's so many different outlets for
boxing now. You know, there's PBC,

978
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,140
there's Fox, there's, you know,

979
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:06,490
ESPN is putting on high caliber fights
now too. Right. It's very interesting.

980
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,650
But HBO is out of the game. Doesn't that
feel weird? It does bend that, that,

981
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:16,380
that was the GoTo channel to watch a
boxing when I was coming up, when he,

982
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:20,320
people you had on Showtime was Mike
Tyson and it was the best commentary crew

983
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,970
twos, Jim Lampley, max Kellerman, Roy
Jones, jr or sometimes George Foreman.

984
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,690
You know, Larry merchant America
was the, was doing that. Yeah, man.

985
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,680
Emmanuel Stewart and Harold Letterman
would come in between rounds and give you

986
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:36,250
his score. It was fucking great. I
missed that. Yeah. Don't you miss that?

987
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:39,530
I mean, Harold Letterman, rest in
peace. He passed away recently. Um,

988
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:44,330
didn't he did it? Yeah, he passed. Um,
but I, I missed that man, Jim Lampley.

989
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:48,610
It was fucking great and max Kellerman
was great. It's like you don't have that,

990
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,450
there's not a commentary team
like that right now in boxing.

991
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,600
My Ron not to the,

992
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:58,720
to the level of why don't
they have expertise go over
to one of these streaming

993
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:03,550
services like the zone or
ESPN or something. It just
seems like that's the team,

994
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:08,140
right? Yeah. Well, Andre ward,
Andre Ward's fantastic at it.

995
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,300
He's coming down here to have
him on, uh, Tim [inaudible].

996
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:15,820
Tim Bradley coming along pretty good
too. Yes. Very good. Yeah. I mean,

997
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:19,800
he's taken, he's taking look like he's
taking that role of a Teddy Atlas. Yeah.

998
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:23,200
It's like he got all of
that energy. Yes. Well,

999
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:26,550
Teddy's fucking what a character. I know

1000
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:30,523
he'd get it. Is

1001
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:40,650
daddy. I rather get out there and
fight. He was screaming. I was kidding.

1002
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,190
Fucking scared. It's funny.
I, he'll say on, on here,

1003
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:48,550
these judges deed to be fired.
Yeah, don't give a fuck.

1004
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,530
He doesn't give a fuck. You got skill
notorious at bad decisions and he's right.

1005
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:56,350
He's right. Sometimes, you know
he's right. He's wrong about that.

1006
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:00,130
Jeff Warner flight, the
Jeff Warren Pacquiao fight
watched when he freaked out.

1007
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:02,050
Is that one of the ones who
freaked out when he freaked out?

1008
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:07,030
I watched when I first watched it,
you know, listening to the commentary,

1009
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,300
I was like, man, back, y'all whooping
him. You know what I mean? Why they,

1010
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,820
why they, why they, why
they cheat them. You know?

1011
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,090
Cause I wanted to fight pack y'all
because I was the next in line,

1012
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,310
of course the champion. So of
course I'm rooting for Peggy.

1013
00:59:19,311 --> 00:59:22,040
I don't want any cause that's
a bigger fight. But after

1014
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,570
watching the fight again, I was like,

1015
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,840
they not saying nothing
about autumn shots.

1016
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:31,220
Jeff Horn was hitting Pat Galloway and
he was just brutally bullying them,

1017
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,790
roughing him up. Uh, they can
say all he was being dirty.

1018
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:38,570
Sometimes your head bud, but it's a
fight that's going to happen, you know?

1019
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:41,240
But he was real life man handling pack.

1020
00:59:41,241 --> 00:59:46,010
Y'all like pushing them all around and
you see Keith Thurman couldn't even do

1021
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:47,980
that. Yeah. You know, and

1022
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,080
beat Keith Thurman at 40 years old
like God damn, this guy is great.

1023
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:57,220
I mean, just look at his career
w eight different weight classes,

1024
00:59:57,221 --> 00:59:59,890
world titles in eight
different weight classes,

1025
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:05,230
40 years old beats Keith Thurman who,
who's in his prime. Right. Crazy.

1026
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,460
I mean w what a man man, what a world
champion and he should have turned bright.

1027
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:14,740
Dan's the time on that one. Crazy.
Any foreign inspire. It's both of them

1028
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,480
bursts. And I thought Keith
was going to pick up on it,

1029
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,870
but pack y'all was only fighting,
fighting the end of the round.

1030
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:26,850
Like Keith would come on strong at the
beginning of the round and they'd be

1031
01:00:26,851 --> 01:00:29,070
like, all right, Keith
winning, winning this round.

1032
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,430
And then Pat geologists were like,
sure, yeah, pop, pop, pop, pop.

1033
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,410
And then Keith will be like, [inaudible].

1034
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,780
You're like, Aw man,

1035
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:39,380
I ain't even seen the phone when he
dropped him with that right hook early in

1036
01:00:39,381 --> 01:00:43,750
the first. You're like,
Oh right shit. Yeah, no,

1037
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,593
it was like a,

1038
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,620
he jumped in with that laughing and
followed by like a straight right.

1039
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,510
It was crazy. Yeah, it was crazy. It's
like wow, what was his shoulder? Yup.

1040
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:57,140
That's his plans. Yep. They was showing
him, hitting other fighters with it.

1041
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:01,220
The same thing, who boom, boom.
He also has a unique style.

1042
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,560
The leaping [inaudible] if he
came in with that shit on you

1043
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,450
[inaudible] Oh man. Nah,

1044
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:18,610
but I give, I take my hat
off to pack y'all like,

1045
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,220
do you think it's possible that
you could get a crack at him now?

1046
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:25,600
Cause now there he's, you know, he's
in the hunt right now. I wouldn't,

1047
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,493
I wouldn't say,

1048
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,500
I wouldn't say so because I was in the
mentions and talk to fight pack y'all

1049
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:37,710
since 2014 and we was in
the same promotional company
and they couldn't make it

1050
01:01:37,931 --> 01:01:40,330
happen. So you think it's because
he's not interested in that?

1051
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,960
I don't think he was interested in it
because his coach mentioned numerous

1052
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:50,770
times. He didn't want him to fight me.
He wanted him to stay away from me.

1053
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:55,540
So I don't think they was
interested. Yeah. Well,

1054
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,650
I could see that

1055
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,170
this stage of his career.

1056
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,290
But you know Keith Thurman is a
fucking murderer puncher. Right.

1057
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:04,260
Which what was one of the reasons why
it's more impressive that he beat him.

1058
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,870
And so who are they talking about?
Patio matching up with next.

1059
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:11,980
He chasing the Mayweather.
So why not right.

1060
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,040
Come on. I know you love money.

1061
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,070
He was saying that he thinks Floyd's
out of money already cause he says Floyd

1062
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:20,280
spend so much money. He's probably already
out of it. Well he spammed money too.

1063
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,910
I think pet cows spam where money named
Floyd and when everybody else Oh that's

1064
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:28,020
right cause he's got like 50 people
that he just has supported. Yeah.

1065
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:31,450
I mean he's a, he's an interesting
guy man cause he's so friendly. Right.

1066
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,920
You know like Pat even like
when people are trash talking,

1067
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:36,960
he was like smiling and then he gets
in that rang kick your ass later.

1068
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:39,560
Different. Fuck you do.

1069
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:43,530
What's the gypsy that Rose like this
is a whole different set of rules he's

1070
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:47,970
flying with like Keith Thurman talking
about he going to crucify him and stuff

1071
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:52,650
like that. And he just like don't say
that. Yeah, it got crucified. Yeah.

1072
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,050
He's the best to [inaudible] lucky enough.

1073
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,810
I like he's a killer pool players.

1074
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:02,490
There's no that about pack
yo know like world class.

1075
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,260
Like he could play pool professionally.
Me tune. Really? Yeah. You could play.

1076
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,600
Oh we got play in that. I heard you.
You got got some little personal stents.

1077
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,890
Pretty good. You're good? Yeah.
Okay. Well what do you play?

1078
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,280
Whatever you want to play. You play
like nine ball, 10 ball, whatever. Okay,

1079
01:03:17,281 --> 01:03:20,730
we'll play it. Cool. So if I leave

1080
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,300
five balls on the table, you owe me.

1081
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,890
If farmer your balls on five balls on
the tee, my boy playing eight ball,

1082
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,690
you can't Bay. That's nonsense. It's a
nonsense game. Hey, belts a silly game.

1083
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:37,170
You're trying to get me leave
my balls on the table. No,

1084
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:41,080
I'm saying if you take
your balls, if I win. Okay.

1085
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,970
And you still got five balls on your
table. Five. Five are your balls.

1086
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,510
If you, you got seven
balls if you can't a ball.

1087
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:52,590
So the only way that I went,
explain what you're saying. Okay.

1088
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:54,540
So you guys seven balls.

1089
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,960
So start if I beat you and you still
got five of your balls on the table.

1090
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,980
Okay, then you, Oh, Oh what? What?

1091
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,600
So if you mean if you break and
run out and I don't get a shot. No,

1092
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,200
that's seven ball. Then you get all
the balls. Yeah, that's seven ball.

1093
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:14,250
If I have five balls left and
you went, yeah, what does that,

1094
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,030
what kind of weird gaze? You
ain't get it. I'm not getting it.

1095
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:23,100
So if I win and you still got five balls
on the table. Okay, then what happens?

1096
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:27,450
You owe. I owe what but see if
we play time ball or 10 ball,

1097
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:31,260
you can't win if there's five balls,
nine ball and Tim ball, that's different.

1098
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:32,420
But that's what we were
saying. Yeah. Yeah.

1099
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,920
So you were saying like fly eight ball,

1100
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,480
but I don't like playing that cause
that's tricky. Yeah, it's tricky. You play

1101
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,380
as a strategy. Yeah. You got
to learn how to get out. Yeah,

1102
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,860
I'll hit all of them and missed
the last one. Play ball though.

1103
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:49,860
That's a cool like ball. It's
okay. But it's a simpler game.

1104
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:53,610
And you popped me for the last,
yeah, I leave you hanging if fuck up.

1105
01:04:53,611 --> 01:04:55,290
Leave that 10 ball wobbling in the hole.

1106
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:57,900
Like he didn't did all this for
nothing. I've done that before.

1107
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:01,560
It's very heartbreaking. Very
heartbreaking. That's the worst way.

1108
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:05,910
Using games where it's like
all that for nothing and the,

1109
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:07,860
and the guys. Thank you for cleaning up.

1110
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,130
That's a game that no one
wants to lose to a girl.

1111
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:14,820
It gets hilarious watching dudes play
pool against women. When women are good,

1112
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:16,500
they panic. They start getting nervous.

1113
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:18,700
Like there's something
about losing to a girl.

1114
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,120
It's almost like getting your ass kicked
by a girl. Some of them call honest.

1115
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:27,940
Seeing some girls at the pool
hall. Oh yes. Taken a lot of money.

1116
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,570
Oh for sure. Yeah, there's,
there's like elite women players.

1117
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,200
You know what I do to the eliminate
that. What I just be like, nah,

1118
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,310
I'm only childlike. Especially where
you watching them and then they try to,

1119
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:43,300
Hey, I got an, I'd be like, yeah
y'all, y'all can play. Cause it ain't,

1120
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:48,310
it ain't for me to be getting washed up
by no female. Well and any professional.

1121
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,550
I've played a lot of professionals like
cause it's one of the weird sports that

1122
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:53,350
you can enter into a tournament and you,

1123
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,340
you could be a guy who you know as a
full time job and you might wind up

1124
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:01,000
matching up with like effort. Rayez I
was like the greatest player of all time.

1125
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:03,460
You might meet him in the first
round of a tournament. You both,

1126
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,130
all you have to do is pay your fee
and then you pay your entry fee.

1127
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:08,620
You join in just like everybody else
and you're playing like a world champ.

1128
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:11,320
Like the Terrance Crawford
a pool. I'm like Whoa.

1129
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,390
And you could just be some regular
dude playing Efron Rez, but it's cool.

1130
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,060
You can be like, man, I lost it.

1131
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,080
We had the greatest lost one of
the greatest of all time. Yeah.

1132
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:20,700
I've played a bunch of like great play.

1133
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,920
I played Mike Siegel before I got
to play a bunch of great players.

1134
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:27,880
Get my ass kicked by him. You will
professional pool player. No, no.

1135
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:31,990
I'm quite a bit like below. Like
if you had like a Manny Pacquiao,

1136
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:36,650
he could play professional. He would
beat me. I'm like one notch below them.

1137
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:40,090
Probably like a notch below that,
two notch below them. But man,

1138
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:42,490
he like plays in tournaments.
He gambles. They call them.

1139
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,790
Unfortunately they call them the cow
cause they're always milking them.

1140
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:52,240
[inaudible] cause he's real high level
pool players, man. I mean he's good man.

1141
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,150
He's too busy with running the
country. It means a fucking Senator.

1142
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,240
On top of that, he's one of the best
boxers in the world and on top of that,

1143
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:01,180
he's got a family. He doesn't have time
to be at the pool hall 10 hours a day.

1144
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,780
All those psychopaths that are like
world champions, they play pool eight,

1145
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:09,040
10 hours a day. They play all day
long, all day long. You go there,

1146
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:12,190
you'll find them. That's where they're
at. You say you go there, you're fine.

1147
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:13,780
They're there every fucking day.

1148
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:17,800
Everybody that I know that's like an
elite world class pool player like Mika

1149
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,380
Immonen and you know these
kind of guys, you go there,

1150
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:23,410
they're there at the goddamn pool every
day. No money in that shit though.

1151
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:26,230
You think there's no money in UFC,
there's no money in that shit.

1152
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:31,420
There's a lot of money on poker.
There is how to play. I know,

1153
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:34,840
right? [inaudible] poker, it seemed
like, uh, my friend Anthony G or Donald,

1154
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:37,840
he a directs those. I used
to direct those poker shows.

1155
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:41,800
He said what changed it is when you had
the TV shows where you could see the

1156
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:42,634
person's hand.

1157
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,020
So like we were all playing the folks at
home could see what I have and they can

1158
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:50,080
see what you have, but we didn't know
what we have. So they're all in on it.

1159
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:52,730
So the fuck, how's he gonna play
that? How's it going to play this?

1160
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:55,510
So it made it way more
interesting than just watching.

1161
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,000
Because if you were watching
three guys play poker,

1162
01:07:58,001 --> 01:07:59,500
you would have no idea
whose hands or what.

1163
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,950
But when you're at home and you
watch on TV, you get to see the hand.

1164
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,470
And I still don't know how to play.
Yeah, I don't know how to play either,

1165
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,790
but I just be seeing people with a
poker face all in, don't have nothing,

1166
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:13,810
and then this dude with a
good Hage just put like,

1167
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,340
Oh, his hands

1168
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,700
look. Just be like, okay,

1169
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,590
take that risk.

1170
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:25,900
Oh man. Something cool about that. Right?
Like a bullshitty. It's bullshitting.

1171
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:28,360
You know? There's something
about that, like the hustle.

1172
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:31,180
There's the thing about poker that
doesn't exist in anything else.

1173
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,690
The psychological hustle, that's why
they call it the poker face. Yep.

1174
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:37,900
That's a lady Gaga song, bro. Pop, pop,

1175
01:08:37,901 --> 01:08:42,550
pop or somebody looking all
like looking all sad like, yeah,

1176
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,480
you got a bad hand knowing you got a
good here. Yup. It's tricky. Then they,

1177
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,733
Hey you

1178
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,560
all in. Okay.

1179
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:55,520
Plus I found gamblers when they're around
each other all the time and then just

1180
01:08:55,521 --> 01:08:59,840
fucking, that's all they do is gamble
and read signs and check each other out.

1181
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,230
They'd probably have a like a highly tuned
sense of someone bullshitting. Right.

1182
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,800
Highly tuned. Oh, there's
something going on behind his eyes,

1183
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:11,030
but that's why they wear them
glasses. Yeah. You know what?

1184
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:12,940
I've always like love watching.

1185
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:17,640
Scary to get good at his chest. Just
seems like it would eat your fucking time.

1186
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:22,230
CTS. Do you play high?
Yeah, I taught him I replay.

1187
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,800
He taught me to not beat him.

1188
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,980
Beat him the same at the
same day he taught you?

1189
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:34,020
He just taught me how to move the pieces
and I'll be like, huh? Jesus. Yeah.

1190
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,670
Wow. That's interesting. So
women are national rights,

1191
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:39,940
so I'm one Monica fifth right now. Do

1192
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:48,180
this age nationally ranked? No, I'm saying
we on the international show. Right?

1193
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:52,020
The whole world is watching. I'll let
these do beat you. Let him beat you. Watch

1194
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:58,530
this up, get his confidence.
Hey, but this is how I do do it.

1195
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,340
There's some fights. Well,

1196
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,990
I want him to play test so I can
so he can use his mind. Right.

1197
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:05,970
[inaudible] that's okay.
All right. All right.

1198
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,000
The whole camp he used in his mind,
you use this miles. I'm like, okay.

1199
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,540
All right. So he'd come out there and
he had great performance. So I'm like,

1200
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:17,220
okay. All right. That's another strategy
to try to get him to do better. Right.

1201
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,180
But there are some mornings, I'm tell
you about this, last morning we had,

1202
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,100
you know, let me beat him. I just beat
him anytime. I really want to win,

1203
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:32,370
I win. [inaudible] come downstairs, right?

1204
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,460
So he comes downstairs and
in his boxers and shit,

1205
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,220
this old terrace Crawford, look,
look in here violent. Hey, good

1206
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:45,410
morning or morning, let's play. All right.

1207
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:50,570
I'm kicking his ass. Right. It
meant he'd get mad. You could see,

1208
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:55,670
you could see it in his face. Right?
So he started making these different,

1209
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,930
but now man, you can't do that. No man,
yes I kiss a kid. No, you can't do that.

1210
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,150
But you know, you can't
do that after a while.

1211
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:04,870
You just gotta kind of fear for
your life a little bit. Cause

1212
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:13,190
no. Yeah. I like Ali big fit in with
this duty chest man. It's funny.

1213
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,070
It's funny when he's

1214
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,570
losing, they beat me. He beat me that
day. I didn't want to play me again.

1215
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:23,610
I was on, I see it in your face right now.

1216
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:28,350
Oh yeah. You can see reliving it
because he just caught me off guard.

1217
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:29,910
It's just like, you know what?

1218
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:33,210
I mean like I come downstairs and eat
some breakfast and he's talking about

1219
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,770
that's plate. He got it
ready and everything. Oh,

1220
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:43,770
I'm making stupid. I'm like, damn man,
I ain't see that. Like fuck. So he,

1221
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:46,890
when he won't play me, but
the next time he played me,

1222
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:51,240
I watched them killed them
so, so bad to where he,

1223
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,770
he don't even want to play me no more.

1224
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,460
It's funny is that's one thing
that champions have all champions.

1225
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:59,310
They hate losing any
game or any like Jordan,

1226
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:00,660
they said if you beat him playing pool,

1227
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:03,390
who fucking hate you
didn't want to talk to you.

1228
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:06,570
Didn't want to until he could beat
you again until he got you again. See,

1229
01:12:06,571 --> 01:12:10,620
my thing is we have a lot of people
that want to play the game, right?

1230
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:14,190
So I'm, I don't play the game
like I used to. I used to play in,

1231
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:17,910
I used to beat them all, but once my
nephew got good, I stopped playing.

1232
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:22,260
I'm like, man, your game here, I ain't
got time the best just sitting on game.

1233
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,273
And you know,

1234
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:27,960
like video games like Xbox two K
and you can't fucking those kids,

1235
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,720
those kids that don't have
their responsibilities,
they don't have children.

1236
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,580
They don't, they don't have,
they have nothing but time.

1237
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,510
They get too good at
those goddamn thing. Good.

1238
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:39,240
So was lose your life
trying to chase him. So now,

1239
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:42,720
so now it gets to the point where
I just watched him play. So,

1240
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,160
so we had this dude named chairs at that.

1241
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,170
Oh man. So,

1242
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:54,300
so chance we got shit
core and we got Chucky,

1243
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:57,060
they all like to play and we got Kenny.

1244
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:02,700
So Kenny was playing Chucky choke you
and chance was always going at it.

1245
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:06,360
We each other and uh,

1246
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:10,940
Kenny was beating Chuckie and he was
just rubbing in his face and it was just

1247
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:15,840
like, you can see how mad he
was. Like, and this dude Chuggy,

1248
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,050
he's the one that always be
like joking around and stuff.

1249
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,770
It's all fun and games and you like,
you could just see, he was like,

1250
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,740
why is you even talking if
you not playing like, Hey,

1251
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:31,020
it gets so bad in the house man
too. You have to put the game up.

1252
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,670
You guys have like moments where you
don't want them to play games and things

1253
01:13:35,671 --> 01:13:38,760
like that. Like during camp, like
you just want to just arrest. No, no.

1254
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:43,410
That's relaxation. Relaxing. Yeah,
but video games are a little,

1255
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,460
they get your tense. That's
why he took the gay gay.

1256
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,180
He did so it get so tense.
People were to fight each other.

1257
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,640
People get in arguments. One want to
do to get mad at other dude like ah,

1258
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:58,830
you mad like man, shut up man.

1259
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:03,850
That's why we sparring when we get to
the gym. Huh? How about that Tiberius?

1260
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:08,790
Be funny as shit, man. It can, it
can cause problems too. Oh sure.

1261
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,980
Well a bunch of competitive dudes all
training together and then you play

1262
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,370
something competitive that makes
you angry if you lose. Yeah. Yeah.

1263
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:20,020
Recipe for disaster. Right. And
they don't care. They don't care.

1264
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:23,830
They don't care an hour and they just
like whatever. I still want to play.

1265
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,120
It's like a big daycare.

1266
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,830
That's basically what it is. Big D me,

1267
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,500
I'm the oldest guy to
start cussing at home.

1268
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,280
You can't eat,

1269
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,550
don't you? Come out your room,
get up for your duties, dishes.

1270
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,290
Oh bad. It seems like you guys
are having a good time. Amaz

1271
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:48,320
it's, it's fun. Campus campus is
fine. It's hard work and it's hard.

1272
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:50,510
But at the same time, you know,

1273
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,610
we work as work and then we
try to come home and you know,

1274
01:14:55,640 --> 01:15:00,390
clear our head and not just
be so mentally drained over,

1275
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,600
over thinking about the fight. Right.

1276
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,820
So we want it to be fun
at the end of the day.

1277
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,950
Do you have like a,

1278
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:11,280
a mental coach or is there anybody
you've ever worked with that's like, uh,

1279
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:15,170
like where you've tried to
do visualization work or
formulate a game plan or is

1280
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,073
it just,

1281
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:20,230
just go out there and get it done?
Just get it done. No need, no need.

1282
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,840
Like my mental is so strong.

1283
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:27,870
Like from what I have overcome and
been through in my heart entire lives,

1284
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:33,550
it's like nothing's going to
break me. That's my mental,

1285
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:37,750
like if that couldn't break
me, you not going to break me.

1286
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,200
I mean in terms of the way your
childhood growing up. Yeah.

1287
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:45,010
Like everything that I went
through. Irreplaceable. Right.

1288
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,540
People that have gone through

1289
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:47,811
Mike, Mike Tyson,

1290
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:52,660
like many great fighters have gone through
hardship when they're younger. That,

1291
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,590
Whoa, that, that ability to endure.

1292
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,860
It's not, I wouldn't say when I was
younger and it's still going through,

1293
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,880
still going through. I still go
through a lot. A lot. How so?

1294
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:06,440
Like it seemed like
before all my big fights,

1295
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:09,350
somebody die or my family, you know,

1296
01:16:09,351 --> 01:16:14,300
like my grandpa just died the day
before yesterday. Sorry to hear them.

1297
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:16,900
Yeah. But I'm here, you
know what I mean? Yeah.

1298
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,530
I'm about to going training camp and
prepare for my next fight, you know?

1299
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:24,930
So it was just like things
always happening. Right.

1300
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:30,090
But at the same time I got a job to do
and I'm going to still be focused and

1301
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,560
nothing's going to distract me. Now

1302
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:38,090
will you go on a training camp with
a date in mind or would you just,

1303
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,030
but do they, but you haven't,
nothing's been signed yet, right?

1304
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,110
Nothing has been signed yet.

1305
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:47,360
So do you just sort of go in and get the
wheels move in and then just get ready

1306
01:16:47,361 --> 01:16:50,930
to ramp up? Like how do you determine
when you ramp up your training camp?

1307
01:16:50,931 --> 01:16:53,630
If you're like, say if you're
getting back into training camp now,

1308
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,450
but you don't know when the fight is
going to be scheduled. So how do you,

1309
01:16:56,451 --> 01:16:57,800
how do you approach it in the beginning?

1310
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,980
No, I don't, I don't,

1311
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:03,570
I wouldn't necessarily necessarily say
I'm getting in training camp right now

1312
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,740
because I'm not like, my training
camp is six to seven weeks.

1313
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:10,010
So you get forward ready
to get into training

1314
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,700
camp? No, I wouldn't even say that. I'm
just saying in general, okay. You know,

1315
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,270
you're not getting ready. Right. State
work now I stay working. Of course,

1316
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:18,283
you know,

1317
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:21,100
now when you're not, when
you're not in the gent, well,

1318
01:17:21,101 --> 01:17:23,020
when you were in the gym, but
you're not training for a fight,

1319
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,090
are you still doing all the
strength conditioning stuff?

1320
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,390
Yeah. Here and there. Yeah.

1321
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:31,020
And not to the same intensity,

1322
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:32,880
but just to keep moving.

1323
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:33,521
Right.

1324
01:17:33,521 --> 01:17:36,820
And so you do that just to make sure
that you preserve your body and don't get

1325
01:17:36,821 --> 01:17:38,020
injured and things along those lines.

1326
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:41,590
So when you think of it in terms of camp
like that as the roughest experience

1327
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:42,401
you're going through it, right?

1328
01:17:42,401 --> 01:17:46,470
You're going through how many nine weeks
that would you say you prefer? Seven,

1329
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:47,590
seven weeks, seven weeks.

1330
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,460
So that those seven weeks there is when
you are pushing it to the limit and then

1331
01:17:51,461 --> 01:17:53,410
everything else is more
like a maintaining thing.

1332
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,730
We like stair steppers,

1333
01:17:56,230 --> 01:18:00,620
we've got a precap and then once we're
in camp it's like this don't, don't,

1334
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,680
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. And
you know what those steps are, right?

1335
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:07,700
So when we get to the, to the end
of camp, we already at the highest,

1336
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:12,860
highest step. So that way when we go
to, to the fight, we already at the end.

1337
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,830
And so this is planned out in
the amount of rounds you do.

1338
01:18:15,831 --> 01:18:20,540
The amount of running every week, every
week is something added on every week.

1339
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,940
If it's for around six round, eight
rounds, 10 12, two minutes, we do minutes.

1340
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:26,780
You know,

1341
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:30,680
what's amazing about this conversation
is if you are a young up and coming boxer

1342
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:31,370
in, you know,

1343
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:34,790
1982 or something like that and you
want to know how Marvin Hagler did it.

1344
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,590
There was no podcast, right?

1345
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:39,680
There was no like Marvin Hagler breaking
down how he does his training camp and

1346
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:40,431
talking all about it.

1347
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:43,820
But today kids can watch you and
they can see what you're doing.

1348
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:48,850
And I guarantee just listening to you
talk about realizing how hard Floyd worked

1349
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,880
and you work it out,

1350
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:52,220
you wanted to work out even harder
and all the crazy shit you're doing.

1351
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:56,480
Like people right now lacing up
the shoes right now and fire it up,

1352
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:59,270
running out the door thinking I
gotta work like Terrance. I have to,

1353
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,410
you know that is one of the coolest
things has to be about being a world

1354
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:06,380
champion is that you are the guy
now, you know when you were a kid,

1355
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:08,990
I'm sure you had like those
ring magazine posters and shit.

1356
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,400
Like you're that guy now,
right? That's gotta be crazy.

1357
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,900
Some kid right now who's
like six years old.

1358
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:18,980
I was just getting the golden gloves
and he's looking up at his bedroom wall.

1359
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,590
Silver gloves, golden gloves,

1360
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,570
the golden gloves. 18 yeah, we use yours,
several gloves. And when your jewelry,

1361
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,310
silver gloves,

1362
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:29,280
it doesn't sound as good.
Yeah. Boxing, amateur boxing,

1363
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,340
kids getting an amateur boxing. Definitely
heroes. You're one of them, man.

1364
01:19:32,341 --> 01:19:34,650
I mean that's gotta be, you
gotta be a cool feeling.

1365
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,120
Oh yeah man. I love it.
I love it. And when I go,

1366
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:42,640
when I go to them little little smokers
or I'm little national tournaments and

1367
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:47,650
see all the little kids run up to me
[inaudible] and I'd be like, what up?

1368
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:51,880
I go grab it all. That's awesome
grandpa. They head mess around with him.

1369
01:19:51,881 --> 01:19:54,730
And if you're out there, a
wrestling tournament, pupil like,

1370
01:19:54,731 --> 01:19:57,640
yo your terrorist car. I'd be like,
yeah, what's up? What's your name?

1371
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,640
And they'd be like, dude, like man, you,
you real cool. Like I'd be like, man,

1372
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:05,740
yeah man. What's up? That's amazing.
So they all gravitate to me.

1373
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:08,010
Was there someone that you met
when you first met them when you're

1374
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:08,220
like,

1375
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,640
I can't even believe that I'm sitting
there with Evander Holyfield or someone

1376
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:12,474
like that.

1377
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:16,140
Someone real famous where you couldn't
believe you were actually being around

1378
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:16,970
them.

1379
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:20,780
Do you want to have to say Roy Jones
Jones? Because I never was like

1380
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:26,180
a big fan boy. I'll always be like,
Aw man, they just humans like me.

1381
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:29,870
But when I seen Roy for the
first time I was like Paul,

1382
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,050
that's Roy Jones jr like
I met Floyd Mayweather

1383
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,090
but this Roy Jones jr like
yeah it was just crazy.

1384
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:44,600
He was real cool and you
know I was just like damn,

1385
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,960
I didn't want to be like all
like shines to out like damn.

1386
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,820
Like I met sugar Ray linner when I was
at amateur and it didn't feel the same.

1387
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,820
It was just like man, that sugar. Right.

1388
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,240
Cause it's a different era cause it was,

1389
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:01,230
you didn't watch them fight watching
Roy Jones, man when I was a kid,

1390
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,340
when he was in his prime,

1391
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,150
he would lead with a left hook
and he's like more than a jab.

1392
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:09,570
He was just whip that left hook at dudes
and they didn't know what the fuck to

1393
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,580
do with that. That speed was
preposterous. So fast. Woo.

1394
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:16,740
Roy was doing stuff to people
that made you just go, wow.

1395
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:19,620
Like he's not even doing the same
thing they're doing right. He's like,

1396
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:22,710
he's on another dimension is a
different record. Speed. You know,

1397
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,120
he was so fast,

1398
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:28,560
like max Kellerman had this incredible
ramp once about just realizing how good

1399
01:21:28,561 --> 01:21:33,300
Roy Jones was in his prime is, it wasn't
like he wasn't around great fighters,

1400
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,990
but they couldn't do shit to him.
Nah, he was around world champions,

1401
01:21:36,991 --> 01:21:40,950
but he was lighting them on fire.
Right. It was crazy. And you know,

1402
01:21:40,951 --> 01:21:44,910
all good things come to an end. It only
lasted for, you know, X amount of years.

1403
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:47,550
I mean, what was the best years
of his championship reign?

1404
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:51,750
But he was untouchable,
untouchable, untouchable.

1405
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,710
When knocked out Virgil Hill with
that body shot. Why? You know,

1406
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:58,340
he's like God to him.
One punch. And when he,

1407
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:01,340
when he put his hands behind his back
and still knocked down Jamestown,

1408
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,203
I mean he,

1409
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,940
when he dropped his hands like this and
James Tony does it too and he leaps in

1410
01:22:05,941 --> 01:22:10,020
and drops him at one duty. Knocked
out what? His hands behind his back.

1411
01:22:10,021 --> 01:22:13,030
Who was that dude? I forgot
what it was on the ropes. Yeah,

1412
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,160
put his hands behind his back.

1413
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:16,020
The dude moves forward and
drops him and knocks him out.

1414
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,720
It's like this is a movie scene,
right? This is a real life.

1415
01:22:18,721 --> 01:22:22,520
No one does that in real life. Roy
Jones was having fun with people. Yeah.

1416
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,480
He was having fun with his entertainment.

1417
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,690
He was incredible how fast he was.

1418
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,910
But like I got him, man,

1419
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:35,790
I didn't met people like Roy.
He's a fan of me. It's amazing.

1420
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,590
And it's like, dude,

1421
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,630
like I'll be like so
starstruck. It's like, man,

1422
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:48,160
I'm a fan of you and he's a fan of you.
You're a fan of me. Wow. Like today,

1423
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:53,420
today, so happy. I was on
Instagram and I was like, um,

1424

LL coolJ following me on Instagram.

1428
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:18,050
It's just crazy just to think of all the
people that you like grew up admiring

1429
01:23:18,191 --> 01:23:23,191
and like you a fan of and for
you to see them fan of you.

1431
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:32,700
Wow. And he came up to me and he was
more happy to see me then I wasn't him.

1432
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:37,420
I tear his car for it. Oh man.
You know mom. Wow. And I was like,

1433
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:41,250
I was just sitting there looking
at him like this, our IRA's

1434
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:48,280
[inaudible] like so it's crazy
like seeing all those, you know,

1435
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:50,500
celebrities and all time greats,

1436
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:53,500
that's big fans of mine
and it's like fuck,

1437
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,930
does it wear off or do
you still freak out?

1438
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,500
I still freak out some times
I still freak out sometimes.

1439
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:03,760
Like it just depends on the person.
Like, fuck, like damn right,

1440
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:07,680
like Snoop or something like that.
Like Snoop too. I know I met Snoop,

1441
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,250
I'll be like, damn, like fuck.

1442
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:14,530
Like that's when you know that you made
it to a certain level and yo yo uh,

1443
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:18,520
professional sports that
everybody watching you. Yeah.

1444
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:18,961
Well you know,

1445
01:24:18,961 --> 01:24:22,470
and that's one more thing that's beautiful
about you meeting those little kids

1446
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,800
is that they can realize
like, Oh, Terrence Crawford's
a man, right? He's a man,

1447
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:31,170
man. He's a superstar and he's a champion
and I see him on TV, but he's a man.

1448
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,780
He's right here. He kept me in
the headlock. Right? Oh shit.

1449
01:24:33,781 --> 01:24:36,600
We're playing together.
He's a nice guy. Oh,

1450
01:24:36,601 --> 01:24:40,830
he's a person because you see someone
that's achieved a certain level of status

1451
01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:44,640
and championship reign and you
see him on TV knocking people out.

1452
01:24:44,641 --> 01:24:46,560
That doesn't even seem like a
real person when you're a kid.

1453
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:48,450
I that can't be a real person. Right.

1454
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:51,900
And then you're there and
then he's shaking his head.
He's like, what the fuck?

1455
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:52,680
This is crazy.

1456
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:57,030
So you changed that kid's world
like his idea of what the future is.

1457
01:24:57,031 --> 01:25:01,440
Idea what a person is. A person
is Terrence Crawford as a person.

1458
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,110
I'm a person too. I got
just got to work hard

1459
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:06,810
and it's crazy because like
a lot of a lot of people,

1460
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:08,490
they would see me and they'd be like,

1461
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:13,200
we are your body and we
entourage like they be.

1462
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:16,230
They be having questions that,
yeah. And I'd just be like, nah man,

1463
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:18,780
I'm a regular person. They'd be like,
man, why you ain't gonna be on TV?

1464
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:22,390
Like Floyd Mayweather? Black man
ain't for me, man. I'm, I'm chill.

1465
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,570
They'd be like, Oh well
where are your cars?

1466
01:25:24,571 --> 01:25:29,010
Like they'd be just acting all kinds
of crazy stuff and I just be like, nah,

1467
01:25:29,011 --> 01:25:33,480
man, you live where you grew
up. Right. Wow. That's crazy.

1468
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,120
And everybody's cool.
Everybody. Nobody gets jealous.

1469
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:37,090
The fact that your [inaudible],

1470
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,630
you always gonna have that
no matter where you go,

1471
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:43,980
you always gonna have the jealousy and
the people that NVU people want loans.

1472
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:50,340
Right. You just gotta you just
got to move different. Yeah.

1473
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,470
You just got to move
differently. Do you need, do you,

1474
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:57,730
what kind of cars you Rob? I drive old
schools. Old schools. Like what kind of,

1475
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:59,250
I got some Monte Carlo.

1476
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:04,130
Oh, Oh, that's right. I saw you and looked
like a grand national, but of a grand

1477
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,590
national. I said Monte Carlo.
That's a Monte Carlo. Oh,

1478
01:26:06,591 --> 01:26:10,730
is this a souped up Monte Carlo?
Nice. This is all original.

1479
01:26:10,731 --> 01:26:14,720
I just put the ramps on it. Oh, the
soup. That one is the silver one. The 87.

1480
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:18,380
Oh, what is that? Another Monte-Carlo.
Oh, you're a Monte Carlo guy. Yeah.

1481
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:23,630
I love Monte Carlo's back in the day.
Like the 70s like 70 Monte Carlo's. Ooh,

1482
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:24,560
those are so pretty.

1483
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,210
Ain't nothing like the 80 [inaudible] 87
that's probably because you're younger

1484
01:26:29,211 --> 01:26:32,780
than me. Super sport. Me, I'm,
I'm like, I get from muscle cars.

1485
01:26:32,781 --> 01:26:36,950
I get as high as 71 with a Barracuda and
then I drop off. Yeah. Everything else.

1486
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:41,390
Like I need 65 to 70 71 that's only,

1487
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,230
only Barracuda and challenger. That's
it. Everything else fell apart by 71.

1488
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:48,800
What about the, uh, the, a Oldsmobile?

1489
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,040
They made some cool shit.
They made some cool shit,

1490
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:57,041
but it's just not as good as like the
sixties sixties and the 1970 cars like 70

1491
01:26:57,411 --> 01:27:01,240
Chevelle Chevelle come on, seven job top.

1492
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:04,560
The drop. The problem
with drop top is the O,

1493
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:08,810
the weekly or you know the like
there's a lot of body flicks to it,

1494
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:13,340
whether you don't get the rigidity that
you feel and like the solid hard top

1495
01:27:13,341 --> 01:27:16,330
muscle car. Right. You know what?
I'd love those old cars, man.

1496
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:20,150
They have something to them, right?
Nay costs a shit ton of money

1497
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:27,980
if you get, if you get one as all
the original, Oh yeah. Everything.

1498
01:27:27,981 --> 01:27:29,780
The paint still like, man,

1499
01:27:29,781 --> 01:27:33,410
you bought this car to put it in
the garage for 30 years. Dude,

1500
01:27:33,411 --> 01:27:36,440
I saw Sarah kudo that was for
sale for over a million dollars.

1501
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:41,020
$1 million for a car that was
like $30 30,000 not even right.

1502
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,330
Didn't we talk about this does in
like five grand when his brand new,

1503
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:48,590
something crazy like that. Now
it's $1 million. I got a J Lindell,

1504
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:52,130
I don't know one of those knuckleheads
that likes everything perfect and

1505
01:27:52,131 --> 01:27:55,580
original. There's certain dudes like
with the original numbers matching,

1506
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,400
look with a V I N number
matches the tires.

1507
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:01,910
These are the original tires
from 1960 [inaudible] paperwork.

1508
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:04,370
You better go slow around the
corner with those shitty tires.

1509
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:07,130
Everything original means
everything's shitty.

1510
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,510
No shitty drum brakes
and shitty suspension.

1511
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:14,100
And I like the size. I used to eyes, uh,

1512
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:17,770
get up and watch them car auctions.
Oh yeah, the Meacham. Yeah.

1513
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:21,260
That kind of shape. Just loved
those. Just to look at the cars. God,

1514
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:24,640
if you have a ton of money and you're
there, that shit could be real bad. Yeah.

1515
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:25,850
Like if you're one of those dudes,

1516
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:28,100
it's like a collector and you
see all those cars moving by.

1517
01:28:28,101 --> 01:28:32,930
Like I want that one to 55 off. 55
Chevy, right. Oh my goodness. Yeah.

1518
01:28:32,931 --> 01:28:37,130
This, there's some, I mean, I'm
just a big fan of those shapes.

1519
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:40,910
Those shapes are the 1960 shapes
because there's something about the car,

1520
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:43,700
they just nailed it. They just knew how
to make a car look beautiful back then.

1521
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:48,470
And it was enabled to build sturdy.
Like nowadays, you bump a car,

1522
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,500
your big old tent pumper falling off.

1523
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,920
Back then you could run a car over and
he'll still steal a little bitty dent and

1524
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:00,530
go on about your way. Yeah.

1525
01:29:00,531 --> 01:29:05,090
It's a different also the now car cars
handled good. They have airbags. Yeah.

1526
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:09,410
There's some good, some good shit about
today's cars too, right? Yeah. Try self.

1527
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,860
Yeah. Yeah. Do you ever do one
though? You had been in a Tesla.

1528
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,700
We just talk about time on a
wheel there. Freakouts man,

1529
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,810
it'll freak you out like you driving that
thing. Oh my God. They fast this shit.

1530
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,690
It's ridiculous. Right? Did
you ever drive one? Yeah, dude.

1531
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:29,910
The crazy thing about the
Teslas is it's like a race car.

1532
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,470
It's like, and you'd be
waiting for it to be like

1533
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:38,510
[inaudible] like, but it don't never
changed gears. It's just straight.

1534
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:44,310
You can all of a sudden it's 150
miles an hour like that. It's so fast.

1535
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:48,090
Disney make sense? It's like a
race car. It's like a time machine.

1536
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:49,590
It's like a compressed time,

1537
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:51,420
like there's a certain amount
of time in a normal car.

1538
01:29:51,421 --> 01:29:52,620
You feel like you have to go?

1539
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,870
There's a certain amount of time that
has to take place before I can get in

1540
01:29:54,871 --> 01:29:57,840
front of that guy and then get over
here and then get to the on ramp with a

1541
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:00,150
Tesla. You just go shoot, you're there.

1542
01:30:00,151 --> 01:30:04,350
It's like time like press
zero to 60 in 2.4 seconds.

1543
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:07,620
You never even felt anything like it.
It so God damn roller coaster ride.

1544
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,890
It's like you're pinned to your
seat. It's just going like fuck.

1545
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:14,730
And they're making a faster one to go.
One's going to be 1.9 the Roadster.

1546
01:30:14,731 --> 01:30:17,760
That really slick looking little
tiny one. They're ridiculous.

1547
01:30:17,761 --> 01:30:21,330
That's the future. Yeah, I got
it. Demon. Oh, Dodge demon.

1548
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,510
Oh those are nice. It's fun.
That's a fun fucking, who is that?

1549
01:30:24,511 --> 01:30:29,280
Like 800 horsepower. Think
909 800 something crazy.

1550
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:33,210
It's crazy. After anything over
seven signed my rights away. Really?

1551
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:38,250
You guys signed all these papers talking
about if you die or get seriously

1552
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:42,030
injured and K nobody else
come back and Sue them.

1553
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:46,890
All kinds of crazy shit. Wow. The car
so fast. They letting you know, like,

1554
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,230
you know, you can get real life fucked up.

1555
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:52,680
And does they make those in a stick
shift or is it just an automatic Oh,

1556
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:56,100
I don't know. I got on. I man, it's
a crazy amount of power, but I think,

1557
01:30:56,130 --> 01:31:00,960
I think nowadays you got the passengers.
Yeah. Paddle shifters. That's cute.

1558
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:05,160
Where you could put manual shifting with
your left foot in a clutch and shifting

1559
01:31:05,161 --> 01:31:07,620
gears. You're right. That's like
part of the whole muscle car thing,

1560
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,080
right? Yeah. Part of the old school thing.

1561
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:17,850
You don't want to old school
automatic. It seems silly. You know,

1562
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:22,020
you just think [inaudible]
school. Yeah, that's true.

1563
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:25,440
It's way faster. Oh, it's way faster.
Cars today are way faster period.

1564
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:29,010
And they're all gonna be electric than
10 years. They're just so much better.

1565
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:31,110
They're so much faster. Right.

1566
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:34,620
As long as they can figure out how to
make it charge quick. That's the thing.

1567
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,450
The gas, as you just
pull into a gas station,

1568
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:40,780
10 minutes later you got a full tank.
Right? So your cart charges up. Yeah.

1569
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:42,003
I'm going to take,

1570
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:48,840
let's take a good solid six or seven
hours. If it's dead, if it's almost dead,

1571
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:52,080
it'll take like six or seven hours at
a super. I have a supercharger too.

1572
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:56,070
Normally it might take 12 like
with a regular outlet. Yeah.

1573
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,320
Fuck it takes a long time. Yeah. Yeah.

1574
01:31:58,321 --> 01:32:00,520
So if you pull into like
one of those supercharges,

1575
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:05,440
I think they can get you up to like 80%
in like an hour to the first charge.

1576
01:32:05,450 --> 01:32:10,400
The first 80% quit pretty quick. So you
could do that [inaudible] for gas. Yeah.

1577
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:14,590
Yeah. You pay for it. Yeah. You
use a credit card for it. Yeah,

1578
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,600
I seen them there. What?
The airport's free.

1579
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,950
You could plug in at the airport and it's
free. It's a, it's a weird experience,

1580
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:24,490
man, because I love the
sound of engines. But uh,

1581
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:28,500
that car makes them all look stupid.
They all, they all seem dumb. It does,

1582
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:32,350
right? Yeah. You don't hear
that, but it's on the, yeah,

1583
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:37,350
I gotta have that muscle
muscle. It's fun. Yeah.

1584
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:40,180
I'm wondering, once you get into
the, you can't burn out in it. Nah,

1585
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:45,160
there's no burning out. It's just
Gusto. It makes a noise like this wish,

1586
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,480
like it doesn't make any noise.

1587
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:51,400
It doesn't like [inaudible] there's
none of that just takes off.

1588
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:54,520
Yeah. It doesn't even
seem real. I like them.

1589
01:32:54,521 --> 01:32:58,740
The inside is crazy with the
big screen touch and, yeah, no,

1590
01:32:58,741 --> 01:33:01,180
they're pretty dope. You just look
like you're in a future where state,

1591
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,120
it feels like you're in the futuristic.
What, what do you spend your money on?

1592
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:07,330
Do you have a thing that you,
uh, you indulge in? Nah, that's,

1593
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:12,370
I don't really have no spinning
habits. Just, that's the main stuff.

1594
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,500
Fishing and, yeah,

1595
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:15,970
we were talking before the show about
bonefish and you're like, bonefish.

1596
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:17,440
I love it. I love it.

1597
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:21,490
I got took on both fishing
one time and I've been hooked.

1598
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,240
I've been spending money on it.
We actually walked in his pond.

1599
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:27,880
I bought waiters, I got
waiters and everything.

1600
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,640
So I'm out there in a water

1601
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,300
in a little mud and stuff,

1602
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:39,490
hitting the little guards and, and uh,

1603
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:45,370
anything I can find. Do you, uh, do you
eat guards? You smoked those, right?

1604
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:47,370
You can't eat them? No, no, no. We,

1605
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:51,230
we mainly trying to get the grass carp
cause they, they're invasive. Right.

1606
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:53,700
They tried to kill as many of
those as they can. Right. Yeah.

1607
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:57,160
So it's crazy though
because the Asian carp,

1608
01:33:58,150 --> 01:33:58,931
we own my boat,

1609
01:33:58,931 --> 01:34:03,931
we in the river and this was the other
night we going through this little spot

1610
01:34:04,481 --> 01:34:08,230
in the river and they started jumping
in the boat. Yeah. That's not weird.

1611
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:12,400
Have you ever seen him? Yeah, I've seen
all of these TV shows. Fucking crazy.

1612
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,110
They like this big, no lie. They
was like, you say car jumping park,

1613
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:19,300
no Asian cart, seven pounds.

1614
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:22,460
And they'd fly through the air and hit
you in the face different than grass

1615
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:26,300
card. We will shoot in grass carpet
and uh, and a pine. But in the river,

1616
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:30,710
the Asian carp dye was jumping in
my boat was every bit of 30 pounds

1617
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:37,180
and they're hitting people in the head,
hay on them, flat line them. I said,

1618
01:34:37,181 --> 01:34:38,090
didn't they bring those States,

1619
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:42,290
those carbons over to eat
up something in a something?

1620
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:43,900
Look at these things here.

1621
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,390
These people fly a boat and got
hit in the back of the head. Right?

1622
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,730
That side ain't joke. Both.

1623
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,920
What are these guys are trying to
shoot them while they're flying?

1624
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:53,510
That is so ridiculous.
What are the rednecks

1625
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:57,350
rednecks court Saturday?

1626
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:02,810
What kind of fucking fish just flows
itself out of boat? It's so crazy.

1627
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:08,750
The sound of the engine that you get
them started. Something like that.

1628
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,270
It's crazy. Like this'll
give you a target panic man.

1629
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:14,000
You're not going to get good at shooting
a bow and arrow and getting hit in the

1630
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:17,420
head while you're pulling back your bow.
Or these guys are just trying to shoot.

1631
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:21,890
No one's even pulling the trigger. Oh
man. That's funny. Look at that. Pop.

1632
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:27,050
Yeah. Look, these keeps getting
hit donk. What a weird dude.

1633
01:35:27,051 --> 01:35:31,490
I just got clipped laughing going.
Gasbag Eddy duck. The second one.

1634
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:37,010
I'll get it. Oh. Oh, that
guy got nailed. Yeah,

1635
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:40,130
I'd have a bat finishing
with a base on a B boat.

1636
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:43,690
I'm telling you what a samurai
sword mugs get big [inaudible] part.

1637
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:45,710
What was that in the river river.

1638
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,080
So they're trying to kill
as many of those they can.

1639
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,670
They're trying to kill as
many of those as they can.

1640
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:52,550
Those things have overpopulated
lakes just taken over.

1641
01:35:52,551 --> 01:35:55,130
I don't know why they brought him
in though originally and more.

1642
01:35:55,131 --> 01:35:57,140
More so of the lakes is grass cart,

1643
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:02,300
not Asian carp and some rivers
big red looking ones here.

1644
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:07,650
Those get huge like yeah
you have [inaudible] it's
crazy enough alone in America

1645
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:10,430
we think of them as shit.

1646
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:14,150
There's like trash fish but
in England they're prized.

1647
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:18,470
Like in England they have carp fishing
contests and they have certain carbs that

1648
01:36:18,471 --> 01:36:22,130
they catch and they weigh in and then
they release them and then they catch them

1649
01:36:22,131 --> 01:36:23,270
again like a year later.

1650
01:36:23,271 --> 01:36:26,950
Like they know the carp and like they
were in world records like the wholly

1651
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:29,960
caught mr fishy again or
mr fishy is now, you know,

1652
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:33,830
85 fucking pounds and they keep catching
them year after year until these things

1653
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:36,170
die and when they die
they make like a big deal.

1654
01:36:36,171 --> 01:36:40,040
We lost his car but they take
carp fishing super serious.

1655
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:44,210
Which is so strange because over here
in America we think of them as trash.

1656
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:46,490
They eat everything. Yeah. When,

1657
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:50,980
when we see the Asians fishing
and whatever they catch they,

1658
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:55,190
they keep, yeah, so it's like the Gar,

1659
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:58,790
the Asian carp, they eat them up.

1660
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:01,910
Apparently Gar taste good if you
smoke it. That's what I've heard.

1661
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:05,750
I've heard he gets smoked car.
Not fucking one that to dinosaur.

1662
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:09,340
I feel w it's a weird thing to eat.
It's like eating a snag. I shot him.

1663
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:14,440
I didn't shop one just to look at the
meat and it's all hard hot like autumn

1664
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:19,100
pones how are you going clean that
day? Yeah, I saw a guy do it on TV.

1665
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:23,000
Can I cooked it on TV? I forgot. What
was one of those wild game cooking shows?

1666
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,410
He smoked a Gar.

1667
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:28,080
I could see an alligator guard like
when you go down like the Texas or so,

1668
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,400
is that a different kind of guard?
Alligator guard and the mugs get pig.

1669
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:32,690
Maybe that's what it is, you know,

1670
01:37:32,691 --> 01:37:37,190
but the guard that we got a little skinny
little pencil wool things like, Oh,

1671
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:41,170
so they're tiny. Yeah. They
like that big eight long. Yeah.

1672
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:45,770
Those Texas ones are freakish, man. They
don't even look real. But listen, man,

1673
01:37:45,771 --> 01:37:47,150
I'm not gonna take up
any more of your time.

1674
01:37:47,151 --> 01:37:50,360
I just want to tell you I'm a big fan.
It was an honor having you in here.

1675
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,870
I really appreciate watching you fight.
One of my favorite, I think when I,

1676
01:37:53,930 --> 01:37:56,160
when I talk to people about, about

1677
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,150
combat sports,

1678
01:37:57,390 --> 01:38:00,900
one of the things that I always talk
about is like the difference between the

1679
01:38:00,901 --> 01:38:02,820
skill level of an elite boxer.

1680
01:38:02,821 --> 01:38:05,730
When you see what that's all
they do versus like an MMA,

1681
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:10,110
you see openings and MMA that you would
never see like in boxing. So I'm just,

1682
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:12,510
I'm happy you're out there,
man. I appreciate it. And I,

1683
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:15,570
and let us know when your fight is.
We'll let everybody know and, um,

1684
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:19,720
just alert the world. I'm excited.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, man. Thanks.

1685
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:20,633
Bye everybody.

1686
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,610
I'll make them get a picture. Yeah.

1687
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:33,910
[inaudible].
