An abnormal cognitive decline is sometimes seen in some people in late

00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:08.151
adulthood, and this is called dementia. The most common form of dementia, I'm

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.861
sure some of you've heard of is called Alzheimer's disease. This is a

00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:17.271
degenerative disease of the brain that seriously impairs cognitive functioning,

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:21.886
for example, memory, language, and mood. It eventually impares brain

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:25.071
functioning so much that it leads to a loss of bodily control and function, and

00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:26.920
eventually death.
