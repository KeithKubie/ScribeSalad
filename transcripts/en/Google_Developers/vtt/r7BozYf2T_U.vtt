KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.620
We are on site in San Francisco
at the Founder World event.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.010
And joining me in studio
today is Sequoia Blodgett.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.880
She is the founder
of 7AM and has

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.976
an interesting story, actually,
about how that all got started.

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:15.350
SEQUOIA BLODGETT:
Yes, so 7AM got

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.170
started literally last year.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.750
So I was working as a
commercial music video

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.920
director for seven years
straight, consistently pounding

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.220
out projects.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.880
And about May of 2014 I ended
up getting really, really sick,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.070
and I didn't know what it was.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.740
And I went to the hospital,
and doctors came in,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.760
and the neurologist came in.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.700
And then they were
like, you need an MRI.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.250
And I was like, wait,
what is going on?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.240
So eventually,
after 20, 30 tests,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.380
they figured out I had
transverse myelitis, which

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.400
is like, you get a common cold.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.360
The cold affects
your spinal cord,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.050
shuts down your
entire nervous system.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.800
Your entire body goes numb.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.030
So now you could see why I
felt like this was it, right?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.519
So as I was in the
hospital, I was reflecting,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.350
and I was like, if
this was it, would I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.070
be excited that all I did was
create pretty amazing visuals?

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.700
And I felt like my life had
more purpose and more meaning,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.300
and I just wanted a
bigger fulfillment.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.940
So I decided to move and shift
into the personal development

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.730
space, joined Draper University,
and went through the program

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.350
to build up the company.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.340
Came in very green, had no
idea what entrepreneurship

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.610
was-- like, a scale?

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.720
What do you mean, that
thing in the bathroom?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.680
What's that?

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.680
So went for the entire
program, committed 130%,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.205
got investment from Tim Draper
at the end of the program,

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:44.560
and started to
build the company.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.101
KORY JEFFREY: Talk
to me a little bit

00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:49.960
about that transition
from the video marketing

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.397
world to entrepreneurship.

00:01:52.397 --> 00:01:54.230
SEQUOIA BLODGETT: It
was really interesting,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.400
because as a director,
you're always pitching.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.350
You're always trying to sell.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.300
So I felt like the transition
was actually normal,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.440
in terms of what it felt
like to be an entrepreneur.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.840
The details were missing.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.830
Yeah, different concept, like,
OK, building the right team,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.940
connecting the players
together, making sure

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.400
that you have the support
system, having the network,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.300
having the access, knowing
how to scale a business,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.000
knowing how to create a
minimum viable product--

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.890
like just basics that you would
need to be an entrepreneur.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.640
But a lot of it before that was
like a guessing game, and now

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.410
I actually had an infrastructure
that Draper University

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.107
provided, in order to be
able to build it correctly.

00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:39.440
KORY JEFFREY: So 7AM, we
talked a little bit about that.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.080
Can you walk me through exactly
what that is and how it works?

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.038
SEQUOIA BLODGETT: Yeah.

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:45.664
So essentially 7AM is
an e-learning platform

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:46.705
for personal development.

00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:48.163
So you may go to
school and you may

00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:51.102
learn geometry, trigonometry,
and unless that's your space

00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:53.310
and that's your focal point,
that's where your career

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.550
path is-- you don't need it.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.000
I have not used trig
since 12th grade.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.270
So for me, I felt like
there was more necessity

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.040
in learning how to deal
with stress, in mindset

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.660
transformation, setting
goals, being accountable

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.860
for those goals.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.980
I thought those were
the basis of life

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.640
and what you actually do need.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.580
So I essentially created
7AM as that platform

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.379
to offer those courses and
teach people how to do that.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.920
KORY JEFFREY: You
see that as filling

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.070
a gap complementary to
traditional education

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.910
institutions, or competing
directly with it?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.990
SEQUOIA BLODGETT:
Yeah, I definitely

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.350
think you need education, right?

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.520
So in your career you have
a very specific vertical,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.780
and you need to know the
education behind that.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.235
However, I think that
with 7AM, there's

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:40.860
also very specific
things-- like you'll

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.693
hear about entrepreneurs
committing suicide,

00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:45.158
and just these really
drastic things,

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:49.510
because you get into this
very pressure-driven society.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.502
You're in a pressure cooker.

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:52.710
You're trying to raise funds.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.860
You're trying to compete with
your competitive landscape.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.750
You're trying to do
all these things,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.920
and you may not know
how to deal with that.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.870
So it can result in
some very tragic things

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.777
if you never figure that out.

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.985
KORY JEFFREY: So you just
came off of the main stage,

00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:08.460
in front of thousands
of people who

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.520
are in that pressure cooker,
who are probably embarking

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.100
or on that journey and
feeling all that stress.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.182
What was your message
to them today?

00:04:16.182 --> 00:04:17.890
SEQUOIA BLODGETT: So
the biggest message,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.410
besides promoting 7AM of
course, was to add value.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.872
So a lot of people
come into relationships

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:29.920
with the intention of
gaining versus giving.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.760
And having a company-- if you're
intention is only to gain,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.170
you're never going to win.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.950
Because that's outdated,
that's archaic--

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.150
that type of marketing, that
type of customer acquisition,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.810
doesn't work anymore.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.490
You have to add value
to your customer.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.520
You have to add value
to your investor.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.920
And that means learning
them authentically,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.560
figuring out how you
can contribute to them

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.390
versus how do I get a check.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.280
A lot of people I'll
see will meet Tim Draper

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.405
and they'll run up to him
and they'll be like, hey,

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:00.072
can I pitch you?

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:03.120
And it's like, he
doesn't even know you.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.680
So get the business card,
exchange information--

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.350
Tim will shoot out his
email to the entire world.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.400
He has no cares about that.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.250
But start to build
the relationship.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.040
And then once you've built that
relationship over time-- hey,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.622
I'm working on this project.

00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:19.830
I'm working on this business.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.240
Would you be interested
in becoming an investor?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.880
And then you want
to have credibility,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.590
because he's seeing you over
time build your company,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.400
grow it, or whatever
check-ins that you've

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.630
been doing with him.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.632
And two, you're not
just another fish

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:34.924
in the sea that's
trying to grab a check.

00:05:34.924 --> 00:05:36.590
KORY JEFFREY: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.210
So today at this
event you're gonna

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.240
see a whole bunch of
different technologies

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.640
and a bunch of different booths.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.570
What excites you right
now in the world of tech?

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.980
SEQUOIA BLODGETT: So I love
AI, and I love virtual reality.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.660
I love the fact that there's
so much technology that's

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.170
now innovating on
such a large level,

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.650
and disrupting so
many industries.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.270
And the future just
looks so much brighter.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.110
And it's happening in
every single vertical.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.220
So I'm just really
excited, especially

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.510
with artificial
intelligence and what

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.450
it has to bring to the markets.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.510
And just overall, especially
virtual reality as well,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.680
I think it's so interesting.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.460
BitCoin is another
very interesting space

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.130
to be in, in terms of
the fintech industry.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.800
So I think there's so many
different innovations that

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.640
are disrupting these
industries right now,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.450
and the future just
looks so exciting.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.916
KORY JEFFREY: Do you have a
favorite Google technology?

00:06:24.916 --> 00:06:26.290
SEQUOIA BLODGETT:
So Google and I

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.240
are like this with Google
Apps, because Google

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.330
runs my business.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.040
Google Docs,
Hangouts, Calendars,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.710
especially like anything
Google for business-- so Google

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.080
email, everything.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.730
We have an account, they
have a lifetime membership

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.900
with my credit card.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.600
Take it.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.050
Do what you need to do,
just keep me afloat.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.400
Yeah, so I'm all
about Google apps.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.900
KORY JEFFREY: Well
that is awesome.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.080
Thank you very much
for joining us.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.680
SEQUOIA BLODGETT: No problem.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.721
KORY JEFFREY: Thank you
very much for joining us.

00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:57.820
I'm Kory and this on
site at Founder World.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.170
