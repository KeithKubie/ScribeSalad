00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.480
Fluoridation is the act of adjusting fluoride
levels in water, with the goal of reducing

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.480
tooth decay.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.369
In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan was the first
city in the world to do it.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.910
In 1999, the CDC declared that water fluoridation
was one of the ten great public health achievements

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.060
of the 20th century.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.680
However, a quick online search will yield
countless articles discounting these claims,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.180
with the general consensus of the dissenters
being that fluoride is actually harmful to

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180
one’s health.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.180
So which is it?

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.120
Is fluoride good or bad for you?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.409
To answer that, let’s take a closer look
at fluoride, what it does in the body, and

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.520
why governments of the world think it’s
so beneficial.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.710
In the early part of twentieth century, Dr.
Frederick McKay noticed that his patients

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.960
in Colorado Springs had brown stains on their
teeth.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.540
He, along with Dr. G.V.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.780
Black, termed the condition as mottled enamel.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.390
Now known as enamel fluorosis, they also found
those brown stains appeared to give people

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.689
a surprising resistance to tooth decay.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.670
They hypothesized that something about the
drinking water was the cause.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.670
In the 1930s, it was shown that fluoride was
the culprit giving the stains and the protection

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.850
against cavities.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.259
Fluoride, in general, is a very common natural
compound.

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.179
Its base element is fluorine, the most electronegative
of all elements.

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.720
(In a nutshell, electronegative means it wants
electrons like a cat wants catnip.)

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.290
It’s found pretty much everywhere in nature,
including the food you eat, and, contrary

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.350
to what many people think, even in the untreated
water you drink.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.929
Fluoride naturally attracts calcium, so in
the body it’s mainly associated with calcified

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.859
tissues, like bones and teeth.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.490
Fluoride will combine with hydrogen to form
the acid hydrogen fluoride.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.479
Most of the reactions, like it’s absorption
through the stomach, and the way kidneys clear

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.609
it from your system, is due to how hydrogen
fluoride reacts as it’s distributed throughout

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:01.619
the body.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.850
For a healthy adult, about 50% of fluoride
consumed is retained by calcified tissues;

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.170
the other half is excreted in urine.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.050
In children, as much as 80% is taken in by
calcified tissues.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.760
This is because kid’s bodies are still growing
relatively rapidly.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.040
Thus, fluoride will attract and help calcify
those developing teeth and bones.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.060
The older you get, the less your body needs
per unit mass, so more fluoride is excreted

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.030
and less is retained.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.769
So what is the recommended intake of fluoride?

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.090
That depends on your age.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.939
Since almost all nutrients needed are based
on an amount proportional to your mass (in

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.060
this case measured in weight), the older you
get, the more per day you need.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.129
For example, infants 0-6 months need about
.01 mg/day.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.579
At 4-8 year of age you need about 1mg/day,
and at 9-13 need about 2mg/day.

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.900
Over the age of 19 and the amount is around
4mg/day for men and 3mg/day for women.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.190
As previously mentioned, fluoride is found
almost everywhere, including your food.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.650
For example, when you consume 100 grams of
table wine, you’ll also be naturally consuming

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.951
about 0.2 mg of fluoride; with 100 grams of
seedless raisins about 0.23 mg, the same amount

00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:22.939
of brewed tea gives you 0.37 mg, and cooked
crustaceans, like crab and shrimp, 0.16 mg.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.540
The question then becomes, if fluoride is
found in so many things, and we take it in

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.281
daily, why did they start adding it to water?

00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:34.390
The answer is that studies showed that in
areas where water isn’t fluorinated, the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.700
average dietary intake for adults was 0.3-1
mg per day- far less than the recommended

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.030
intake for optimal health for adults.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.430
For areas where fluoride in the water was
1mg/liter, the average intake was 1.4-3.4

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.290
mg per day.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.819
Just about the right amount an adult body
needs to fight off those expensive cavities,

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:55.819
among other benefits.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.379
So how does fluoride help with tooth decay?

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.510
Cavities, known as dental caries, begin when
bacteria start propagating in the small cracks

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.390
and crevices of your teeth.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.019
The plaque that naturally builds up contains
copious amounts of these microbes, such as

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.019
streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus.

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.190
When the bacteria begin to consume carbohydrates,
mostly the high concentrations of sugar found

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.890
within the foods and drinks we consume, they
produce acids.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.330
When those acids create a pH less than 5.5,
they will begin to dissolve your tooth enamel

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.330
(carbonated hydroxyapatite).

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.750
The entire process is called demineralization.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.620
Should you get rid of the sugars, and are
the one and only person to follow your dentist’s

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.840
advice to brush and floss after every meal,
ions from your saliva will help with rebuilding

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.080
tooth enamel (remineralization).

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.680
When demineralization exceeds remineralization,
a cavity forms.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.900
That process usually takes months to years.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.830
When fluoride is placed on your teeth, it
combines in plaque fluid, along with the dissolved

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.210
hydroxyapatite found in your tooth veneer,
and will create a layer on your teeth called

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.150
fluoridated hydroxyapatite (FHA).

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.750
FHA limits the uptake of sugar by bacteria,
and reduces the amount of acid they produce,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.120
preventing the corrosion of your enamel.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.210
The fluoride will also help remineralize teeth
by attracting calcium.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.660
The net result of both these actions reduces
demineralization while promoting remineralization,

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.889
and you get cavity-free teeth!

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.680
Since fluoride doesn’t necessarily cure
cavities, more specifically reduces the production

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.160
of them, it requires frequent application
throughout your life to achieve its protective

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.160
affects.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.900
Adding it to the water you drink provides
a fantastic way to accomplish repeated exposure.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.039
So, now that we know the proponents side of
the story, what are the drawbacks to taking

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.850
in fluoride and how much is too much in the
first place?

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.199
There are countless claims on the internet,
and in certain publications, citing studies

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.070
showing excessive fluoride will do everything
from lower your IQ, give you thyroid problems,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.450
cause kidney issues, or even increase your
risk of cancer.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.670
Fortunately, contrary to many somewhat suspect
interpretations of results of studies (where

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.250
present), to date, no study has definitively
shown any of this.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.490
However, you shouldn’t take this to mean
that extremely excessive fluoride intake won’t

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.780
cause health problems; after all, even excessive
water intake can be deadly and, as a paramedic,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.780
I’ve personally seen otherwise healthy individuals
die as a result of the side effects of drinking

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.780
too much water in a relatively short span.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.780
Pretty much everything, including things your
body needs to function, is bad for you in

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.780
high enough doses.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.000
However, with fluoride, at least to date,
no one has ever definitively proven the aforementioned

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.110
claims by many opponents of water fluoridation,
even at far higher regular doses of fluoride

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.370
than most of us imbibe.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.919
That being said, there are two definitively
known complications from taking in too much

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.590
fluoride- Enamel fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.509
At fluoride levels of around 8mg/liter of
water taken in, combined with common dental

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.750
products, you can (potentially) get enamel
fluorosis.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.610
Minor enamel fluorosis will result in horizontal
opaque striations on your tooth enamel that

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.720
can become white opaque patches.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.110
More severe cases will cause changes to your
tooth color, like in the brown teeth Dr. McKay

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.800
noticed in his Colorado Springs patients.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.031
While abnormally colored teeth is undesirable
for aesthetic reasons, functionally, enamel

00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:07.360
fluorosis doesn’t appear to have any negative
health effects.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.330
The pay-off, as Dr. McKay noted, would be
extra protection against cavities.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.319
As to the second item there, the skeletal
problems associated with too much fluoride,

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.240
skeletal fluorosis, can be very debilitating.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.539
Before you begin having symptoms, skeletal
fluorosis can be detected by x-ray showing

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:26.110
a slight increase in your bone mass.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.169
That bone mass is 2-5 times higher than in
people who consume the recommended amount

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:31.360
of fluoride.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.259
Once you do begin having symptoms, your condition
will come in 3 stages.

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:39.340
Stage 1 will result in occasional stiffness
and pain in your joints, and an abnormally

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.180
hard pelvis and vertebra called osteosclerosis.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.919
Stage 2 and 3 can be very crippling, and results
in calcification of your ligaments, osteoporosis

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:54.669
of long bones, muscle wasting, and some neurological
defects associated with too much calcium in

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:55.780
your vertebra.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.539
The amount of skeletal fluorosis is directly
related to the amount and duration of your

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:02.009
exposure to fluoride.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:06.030
Now, if you’re thinking the prospects of
muscle wasting and painful joints aren’t

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.990
worth having a bit better dental health, don’t
worry.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.550
Most people will need an intake of at the
extreme minimum 10mg/day for more than 10

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.680
years to produce even mild symptoms of this
conditions.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.340
In fact, one study showed that even in communities
where people were getting 20mg per day, there

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.990
were no cases of skeletal fluorosis.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.860
Crippling skeletal fluorosis is so rare that
only 5 cases have been reported in the last

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.350
35 years world-wide.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.440
You actually need to take in so much fluoride
that one confirmed case had a 64-year-old

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.290
man ingesting 50mg/day for over 6 years, and
he still only had a mild case of the condition!

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:47.180
Thus, given the known risk/benefit analyses
of fluorinating water, food, toothpaste and

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.000
so on, you can see why so many governments
and health bodies are in favor of water fluoridation

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.490
to help ensure people get enough fluoride.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.800
As those who neglect their dental hygiene
throughout their lives inevitably discover

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.000
as the decades pass- poor dental health is
a major literal and figurative pain once it

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.220
catches up to you, not to mention insanely
expensive.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.580
So anything that increases the odds of teeth
staying “healthy” and functional into

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.640
our twilight years is often going to be a
good thing.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.420
However, while many opponents of water fluoridation’s
reasons for opposing it may not be valid based

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.339
on the current state of research on the subject,
they may have a point on advocating getting

00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:22.339
rid of it.

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:26.310
In short, while you’re unlikely to suffer
any negative side effects from it, water fluoridation

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.560
simply might not be necessary anymore in many
parts of the world.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.781
You see, prior to the 1960s when water fluoridation
was becoming more popular, a person’s diet

00:09:34.781 --> 00:09:37.260
was the only significant source of fluoride.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.019
Today, however, fluoride is consumed in countless
common dental products, among other things,

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:47.000
so water fluoridation isn’t typically needed
anymore to achieve the recommended daily amounts.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.773
On that note, there are a few studies showing
there is an increase in the rates of enamel

00:09:49.773 --> 00:09:54.519
fluorosis in children in areas where there
is optimally fluoridated water, indicating

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:57.730
that these children are getting too much relative
to their mass.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:02.580
And while, as noted, enamel fluorosis isn’t
exactly a cause for concern, other than potential

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.360
negatives on the aesthetics’ side of things,
it is a clear indicator that the water fluoridation

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.990
for these kids just isn’t necessary at all.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.300
When it comes to water fluoridation today,
the most damning evidence against it comes

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.470
from a Cochran review performed in 2015.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:21.830
They looked at 20 studies on the effects of
fluoridated water on tooth decay and 135 studies

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.380
on dental fluorosis.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.940
While they did find that overall water fluoridation
is effective at reducing levels of tooth decay

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:33.820
by 35% among children, importantly, the results
were based on old studies that, as noted,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.440
may not be applicable today.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440
They state;

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.290
The available data come predominantly from
studies conducted prior to 1975…Our confidence

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:46.750
in the size of the effect estimates is limited
by the observational nature of the study designs,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:51.500
the high risk of bias within the studies and,
importantly, the applicability of the evidence

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.060
to current lifestyles (the use of fluoride
in toothpaste)…There is insufficient evidence

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:01.050
to determine whether water fluoridation results
in a change in disparities in caries levels

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.050
across SES (socioeconomic status).

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.050
We did not identify any evidence, meeting
the reviews inclusion criteria, to determine

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.050
the effectiveness of water fluoridation for
preventing caries in adults.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.050
So, to sum up, in 1945 when cities began fluorinating
water, it appears there was definitely an

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.050
overall benefit to the public.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.170
Currently, with the advent of modern dentistry
and fluoride put in many products used regularly

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.720
by most anyway, like toothepaste, the question
of whether governments should continue water

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.380
fluoridation is a good one.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.910
At least as far as I could find, there currently
aren’t any studies that analyze cavity rates

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:23.350
while accounting for exposure to all major
sources of fluoride in modern times.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.209
Until that happens, as with anything that
affects public policy, it appears the benefit

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:32.650
to the majority will always outweigh the potential
problems associated with the minority, especially

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.170
when those potential problems are either relatively
benign or extremely rare.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.100
With fluoridation of water, the potential
problems appear to be so minor or few and

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.420
far between, and continuing the practice so
cheap, that I would assume it will be a long

00:11:45.420 --> 00:12:01.980
time before you see municipalities ceasing
the practice.
