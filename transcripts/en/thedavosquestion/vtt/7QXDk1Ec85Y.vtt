00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:10.620
&gt;&gt;Hi Jotarius. I'm here at Switzerland in
Davos and I want to say I concur. People love

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.359
to complain but then they just continue to
behave in a way that actually supports the

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:22.789
stuff that they are complaining about and
that just makes me sick. So peoples out there,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.810
follow Jotarius' inspiration here, and be
very conscious about what you're doing with

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.180
your wallet. And that's the easiest way to
really make your voice be heard. Cause if

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.700
not, we're going to spend ourselves to death
and as well as contribute to all of these

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.800
other secondary effects that we really don't
want to be doing.
