00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.230
Let's try to get a better
intuition of the chain rule,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.920
and in the process, we'll get
a better intuition of how

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.700
it applies to implicit
differentiation or vice versa.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.710
So let's say-- and I'm going to
get out of the world of x's and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.890
y's and f of x's for a second,
just so that you see that those

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.810
are just letters and there's
nothing special about them.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.720
And I think sometimes it
helps develop the intuition.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:32.000
So let's say that a is equal
to b squared and that b is

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.530
equal to the sine of c.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.240
And my question to you is
what is the derivative

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.310
of a with respect to c?

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.475
We have a defined in terms of
b, so it's not like we can

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:53.530
just take the derivative.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.950
I mean, how do we do that?

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.530
Well, that's where the
chain rule comes in.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.890
And the chain rule just tells
us that the derivative of a

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.550
with respect to c is equal to
the derivative of a with

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.930
respect to b times
the derivative of b

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.980
with respect to c.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.250
And you shouldn't really--
you don't even have

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.370
to memorize this.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.320
We're just multiplying two
fractions where the denominator

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.430
in the first one is the same as
the numerator in

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.990
the second one.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.600
So if you were to multiply
fractions, they would

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240
cancel out, right?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.100
Or if you were to actually
multiply these fractions

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.430
out, you'd get da times
db on the numerator.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.240
In the denominator, you would
get-- da-- sorry, db times dc

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.670
in the numerator, and then
these would cancel out, and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.860
then you're back
with da over dc.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.630
So there's nothing fancy,
really, about the chain rule

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.710
when you actually view
them for what they are.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.380
They're fractions, but the
values in the numerator and the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.090
denominator, they are these
differentials, these infinitely

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.820
small changes in
these variables.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.400
But anyway, the chain rule
tells us: change of a with

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.740
respect to c is equal to the
change of a with respect to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.920
b times the change of
b with respect to c.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.080
And these are pretty easy
to calculate based on

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.110
the information that
I've just given you.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.140
What is the change of
a with respect to b?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.320
The derivative of a
with respect to b?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.960
Well, that's pretty
straightforward, right?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.350
The derivative a with respect
to b is equal to 2b.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.030
So this is 2b.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.970
And what's the derivative
of b with respect to c?

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.770
Derivative of b with
respect to c, well, that's

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.070
equal to cosine of c.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.910
And so we're done.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.810
The derivative of a with
respect to c is equal to this,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.340
which is this, 2b, the
derivative of a with respect to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.360
b times the derivative
of b with respect to c.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.510
So times cosine of c.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.660
And then if you don't like it
in this format, if you don't

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.470
like the derivative of a with
respect to c being dependent or

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.420
being a function of both b and
c, you can just substitute for

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.640
b because b is also
a function of c.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.430
So let's do that.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.880
So the derivative of a with
respect to c is equal to 2b.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.950
But what's b?

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.880
b is just sine of c.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.930
So 2-- just substitute sine of
c for b-- 2 sine of c, and then

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.570
we have the remainder, right?

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:34.020
This is this, and then
times cosine of c,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.640
and that's just that.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.860
And we're done.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.880
And I want to now try to make
the connection between this and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.790
the kind of-- I don't want to
say-- well, you know, kind of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.060
the plain English way I
talked about doing that

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.280
chain rule before.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.200
So all of the chain rule
problems that I think I've done

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.410
so far would have had a
explicitly defined in terms of

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.460
c, but you're saying, oh, but
then, you know, I said outside

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.850
and inside and et cetera.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.080
And we can do that.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.570
We can make a explicitly
defined in terms of c,

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.160
and how do we do that?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.520
We could substitute before we
even take the derivative.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.600
So we can substitute this
for here, and we get what?

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.370
a is equal to b squared,
b is sine of c, so it's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.770
sine of c squared.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.930
And now we could take the
derivative of a with respect

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.210
to c using the chain rule.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.050
And this is the more
traditional way that I showed

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.750
it, but maybe it gave
you more intuition.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.650
It probably gave you more
intuition of how to actually do

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.210
the problem, but it probably
gave you less intuition of how

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.230
it applies to the chain rule.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.510
So hopefully, this will
connect everything together.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.570
So the derivative of a with
respect to c is equal to-- I

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.670
think sometimes I said that I
like to take the derivative of

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.400
the inside and then multiply
that times the derivative of

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.520
the outside, but we could
do it in either order.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.370
So let's take the
derivative of the outside.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.930
So what's the derivative
of the outside?

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.230
sine of c squared, well,
it's 2 sine of c times the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.260
derivative of the inside.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.370
The derivative of the
inside is cosine of c.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.600
The phone is ringing.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.910
I'm not going to answer it.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.540
And so we ended up with the
exact same result, and it makes

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.960
sense, because when I say the
derivative of the outside, when

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.770
I take the derivative of sine c
squared and I get 2 sine of c,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.430
I'm really just taking the
derivative of a with

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.000
respect to b, right?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.400
Because the derivative
of a with respect to b

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.590
is 2b or 2 sine of c.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.800
And then when I take the
derivative of the inside, I'm

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.480
really taking the derivative
of b with respect to c.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.750
So hopefully, that gives
you a little intuition.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.530
So now let's take that
intuition and tackle some

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.110
implicit differentiation
problems.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.190
And if you think about it,
this kind of was an implicit

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.440
differentiation problem.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.780
So let's say I want to take the
derivative with respect to x

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.900
of y squared x to the third.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.610
And some of you all might know
how to mechanically do this.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.080
Well, I won't go into the
mechanics because the

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.550
whole point of this
video is the intuition.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.860
And maybe you have the
intuition in which case you

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.630
might not have to watch this
video, but let me give

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.270
you the intuition.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.060
And I think the best way
to give the intuition

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.760
is to actually do some
variable substitution.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:26.050
Let's define a is equal to y
squared and b is equal to

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.810
x to the third, right?

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.580
Then this is the same thing,
and I just made this stuff--

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.190
you know, this could
have been any letters.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.430
This is the same thing as
the derivative with respect

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.620
to x of a times b, right?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.080
And what does the
chain rule tell us?

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.070
Well, actually, we could just
do the product rule here, so

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.230
let's do the product rule.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.340
So we're taking the derivative
with respect to x of a times b.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.340
So let's do that.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.900
This is just the product rule
so it's the derivative of a

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:03.480
with respect to x times b plus
the derivative of b with

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.220
respect to x times a.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.760
That's just the product rule.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.750
But what's the derivative of a
with respect to x and what's

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.560
the derivative of b
with respect to x?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.280
So the derivative of a with
respect to x-- and this is

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.890
where we get into
the chain rule.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.070
The derivative of a with
respect to x is equal to the

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:33.080
derivative of a with respect to
y times the derivative of y

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.950
with respect to x, right?

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.100
This is just the chain rule.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.160
These dy in the denominator
and the numerator,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.760
they'll cancel out.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.270
So this is just the chain rule.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.940
And what is this?

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.800
What's the derivative of
a with respect to y?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.070
Well, a is equal to y squared,
so that is equal to 2y times

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.130
the derivative of y
with respect to x.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.825
Well, we haven't explicitly
defined y in terms of x, so

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:57.250
we're just going to have
to leave it like that.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.230
So times dy/dx.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.190
So this, right here, the
derivative of a with respect

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.010
to x, is just that.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.450
And what's the derivative
of b with respect to x?

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.660
Well, here b is explicitly
defined in terms of x, so this

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.460
is pretty straightforward.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.600
There's no chain rule
application here, so that is

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.480
just going to be 3x squared.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.210
And so what's our final answer?

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.910
The final answer is the
derivative with respect to x of

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:32.870
y squared x to the third is
equal to derivative of a with

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.670
respect to x, or you could view
that as the derivative of y

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:44.920
squared with respect to x,
which is 2y dy/dx, right?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.060
You could say this is the
derivative of a with respect to

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.100
x or the derivative of y
squared with respect to x, and

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.650
this is just from the
chain rule, right?

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.010
This was the chain rule.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.070
2y times dy/dx and
then times b.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:04.200
Well, what's b? b is x to the
third plus the derivative of b

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.900
with respect to x, well, that's
3x squared, times a.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.090
a is just y squared.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.750
So hopefully, that gave you the
intuition and made it a little

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.630
bit clearer of why implicit
differentiation-- you're really

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.710
just applying the chain rule.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.830
And then, you know, just the
way I've been doing in all the

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.040
problems without going through
all of this mess just to show

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.700
you that it isn't that hard of
a problem, that you could

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.710
just do it straight up.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.520
You could just say, OK,
this is the product rule.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.750
It's the derivative of the
first expression times the

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.390
second expression plus the
derivative of the second

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.740
expression times the first.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.450
What's the derivative of this
first expression y squared?

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.480
Well, it's the derivative of
that expression with respect

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.630
to y times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.160
And it's only because we're
taking the derivative with

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.040
respect to x times the second
expression, x to the third,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.130
plus the derivative of the
second expression with respect

00:09:53.130 --> 00:10:00.070
to x, 3x squared, times the
first expression, y squared.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.950
Well, anyway, I'm
at my time limit.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.440
Hopefully, that helped a little
bit and didn't confuse things,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.610
and let me know if you want me
to do even more videos on this.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.112
See you soon.
