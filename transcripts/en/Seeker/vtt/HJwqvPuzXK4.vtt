00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.550
By a strange twist of fate, video games have
played a role in developing artificial intelligence.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.500
Graphics processing units that were originally
intended just to pump out polygons and pixels

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.340
happen to be the perfect systems to train
neural networks.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.360
But artificial intelligence might repay the
favor, and make video games even better.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.090
And I’m not just talking about AI’s applications
for rendering graphics, like by taking lower

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.360
quality images and through the magic of computerized
guesswork turning them into high-resolution

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.360
images.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.930
Or by helping render realistic reflections
through a process called ray tracing.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.160
I’m talking about AI that could design entirely
new experiences for players.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.380
One area AI could be great for is level design.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.440
Every game genre has different needs.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.760
Maps in multiplayer games need to be balanced
so one team doesn’t have an obvious advantage.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.790
Single player games need to be interesting
to explore but easy to navigate so you don’t

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.130
get stuck going in circles for hours when
you can’t find a stupid door.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.739
Horror games have to build tension and atmosphere
so when monsters pop out of vents you poop

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.850
your pants.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.640
As you might imagine then, crafting an exquisite
game world takes a lot of time and tinkering.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.679
Could AI speed up the process?

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.670
Some scientists in Italy thought so, and they
developed two AI programs to craft new levels

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.920
for the fast-paced first-person shooter Doom.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.170
The original one from 1993, not the 2016 remake…
or the movie with the Rock.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.709
Working with the old game has a lot of upsides
for their research.

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.919
Because it’s old it’s much simpler than
games today, and because it’s a classic

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:36.079
it has tons of levels made by the original
creators and fans alike.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.289
To train their AI they fed it thousands of
human-made levels and asked it to create its

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.289
own.

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.229
Then the researchers used a second AI that
was trained to spot a computer-generated map

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.789
from a human made one.

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.200
They repeated the process until eventually
the AI-made maps were indistinguishable from

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.579
those made by hand.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.809
Doom is not the most realistic game ever though,
what with its sharp edges and the player’s

00:01:57.809 --> 00:02:01.179
weapon seeming to come out of a third arm
in the middle of their chest.

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.779
But AI is not limited to boxes and odd anatomy.

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.259
Some researchers have used AI to produce a
lifelike game world.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.690
Using thousands of hours of footage taken
from cars driving around cities in the meatspace,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.090
an AI was able to generate its own city blocks
a player could drive around in.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.659
AI could also improve the non-player characters
in video games.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:28.430
These poor bots, which are also casually referred
to as AI, are famously pretty dumb when compared

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.520
to human players.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.120
In the single-player campaigns of combat games,
most people will have no trouble mowing down

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.709
hordes of them, giving the player a false
sense of confidence.

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.489
Confidence that is then crushed when they
try the online multiplayer and 13- year-olds

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.700
halfway around the world destroy them and
tell them things they never knew about their

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.700
mom.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.190
AI that behaves more human-like could offer
a better challenge, enhancing immersion and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.719
eliminating the need to have so many bot opponents.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.629
Or to play online multiplayer for that matter.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.629
Video games designers just have to make sure
AIs aren’t too good though, or that can

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:02.880
ruin the game too.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.299
Where does AI go from here?

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.349
Who knows, AI’s uses are limited only by
your imagination.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.060
Perhaps an AI advanced enough could process
whole libraries of games and generate their

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.060
own.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.629
Maybe the next Doom that we’re still playing
25 years after launch will be thought up,

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.720
designed, and coded entirely by a machine.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.120
This topic is near and dear to me as a science
nerd and a gamer.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.939
Am I the only one out there or are there a
lot of other gamers lurking in the comments

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.239
of our science channel?

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.239
Let us know!
