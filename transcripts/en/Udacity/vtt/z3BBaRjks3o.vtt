00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well the answer is about 5.5° and let's see how we calculate that.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well first, we need to calculate the range of the cannon. How do we do that?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's look at our initial velocity vector.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The cannon fires at the speed of 56 m/s, an angle of 45° because that optimizes the range.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now we want to break this into components--V₀x and V₀y.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We can do some trigonometry to show that the x and y components are both equal to 39.6 m/s.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If I'm going to know how far this cannonball is going to go, I should

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
probably know how long it's going to spend in the air.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's use the y component velocity to do that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Looking at the trajectory of this ball, I want to first find out how long it takes to get to the very top

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that's when the vertical component of velocity would be equal to zero.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Using this equation and plugging in what we know, and remember in this case acceleration

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is downward so negative, we find it takes 3.96 seconds to get to the top of the trajectory,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which means it would take another 3.96 to get down which results in a total time of 7.92 seconds.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now we known the x direction, speed isn't going to be changing.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There is no acceleration in the x direction.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So if I look at this equation, this term goes to 0 and we're left with this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So what's the range of the cannon, how far can it reach Δx or it's just

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the x component of velocity 39.6 times the time, which gives us 314 m.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If you got this far, good work. We're almost towards the end.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now we just need to convert this somehow into an angular size.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Well looking at this angle β, we know this flagpole has a height of 30 m

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and in fact, it looks like we know the opposite and the adjacent sides.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So we can write the tangent of β is 30/314.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If I ask Google what the arctan of 30/314, in degrees because remember that's how we go

00:01:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
from ratios to angles, it gives me a value of 5.5°--good work!
