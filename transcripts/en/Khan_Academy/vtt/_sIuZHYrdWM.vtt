00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.750
Factor out the
greatest common factor.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.890
And the expression they give us
is 4x to the fourth y plus 8x

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.927
to the third y.

00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:09.510
When they say to factor out the
greatest common factor they're

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.380
essentially telling us, find
the greatest common factor of 4x

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.150
to the fourth and
8x to the third y

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.500
and factor it out
of this expression.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.390
Or kind of undistribute it.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.360
And to find that
greatest common factor--

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.990
and I always put
it in quotes when

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.655
we speak in algebraic terms.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:25.030
Because we don't
really know what

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.212
x and y are, whether
they're positive or negative

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:29.170
or whether they're greater
than or less than 1.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.420
So it's not always going to be
the greatest absolute number.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.610
But it's the greatest
in it contains the most

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.630
terms of these two expressions,
these two monomials.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.830
So if we were to essentially
factor out 4x to the fourth y

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.940
it would look like this.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.700
We would do the
prime factorization

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.830
of 4, which is just 2 times 2,
times x to the fourth, which

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:02.260
is x times x times
x times x, times y.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.300
We just expanded
it out as a product

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.360
of its basic constituents.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.284
Now let's do the
same thing for 8--

00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:13.520
I'll color code it--
8x to the third.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.990
Let me do it in similar colors.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.140
So in this situation we
have 8x to the 1/3 y.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.230
So the prime factorization
of 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.890
It's 2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.860
Prime, or I should say
the factorization of x

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.470
to the third, or
the expansion of it,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.950
is just times x
times x times x. x

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.120
multiplied by
itself three times.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.950
And then we are multiplying
everything by a y here,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.640
times y.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.140
So what factors are
common to both of these?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350
And we want to include as
many of them as possible

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.320
to find this greatest
common factor.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.030
So we have two 2's
here, three 2's here.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.850
So we only have two 2's
in common in both of them.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.100
We have four x's here,
only three x's here.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.630
So we only have
three x's in common.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.710
Three x's and three x's.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.300
And we have a y
here and a y here.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.840
So y is common to
both expressions.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.340
So the greatest common factor
here is going to be 2 times 2.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.140
So it's going to be 2 times 2
times x times x times x times

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.790
y.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.310
Or 4x to the third y.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.890
So this is what we
want to factor out.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.360
So that means we can write this
thing as-- if we factor out

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.255
a 4x to the third y,
where essentially we

00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:45.740
have to divide each of
these by 4x to the third.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.970
We're factoring it out.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.020
So let me rewrite this.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.850
So this is 4x to the fourth
y plus 8x to the third y.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.667
And we're going to divide each
of these by 4x to the third y.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.250
And hopefully this
makes sense to you.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.740
If we were to
multiply this out, we

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.574
would distribute this 4x to
the third y on each terms.

00:03:07.574 --> 00:03:09.490
And then it would cancel
with the denominator.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.059
You would have the same thing in
the numerator and denominator.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.100
And then you would get
this expression over here.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.870
So hopefully this
makes sense that these

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.426
are the exact same expression.

00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:20.050
But when you write
it this way, then it

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.530
becomes pretty clear that
this is 4x to the third y.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.040
And then you just simplify
each of these expressions.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.100
4 cancels with 4.
x to the fourth

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.290
divided by x to the third is x.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.180
y divided by y is just 1.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.900
So you have x plus
8 divided by 4 is 2.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.250
x to the third divided
by x to the third is 1.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.030
Y divided by y is 1.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.110
So x plus 2.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.060
Another way to see what's left
over when you factor it out

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.610
is if you were to take
out the common factor.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.330
So we took out this and this.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.890
What was left over
in 4x to the fourth y

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.230
when we took this stuff out?

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.234
When we undistributed it?

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:58.650
Well, the only
thing that was left

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.610
was this x right over here.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.110
Let me do that in another color.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.490
The only thing that
was left was this x.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.090
So that's why we just
have that x over there.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.020
When we factored everything
out of the 8x to the third y

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.840
we factored all this
other stuff out.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.200
We factored out
4x to the third y.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.760
We factored it out, so
all we had left was the 2.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.410
Now in general, you
don't always have

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.020
to go through this process.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.890
You could have done it this way,
but this really hopefully makes

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.790
it clear exactly
what we're doing.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.240
You could have said,
look, 4x to the fourth y

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.830
plus 8x to the third y.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.700
You could have said,
well let's see,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.870
the largest number that's
divisible into both 4

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.240
an 8 is 4.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.926
So let's factor
out a 4 out here.

00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:45.550
The largest multiple of x that's
divisible into x to the fourth

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.008
and x to the third, well that's
going to be x to the third.

00:04:48.008 --> 00:04:49.800
And you put an x to
the third out here.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.300
And you say, well,
the largest thing

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.312
that's divisible both
into y and y is just y.

00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:55.770
So you could have done it a
little bit faster in your head.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.228
So you factor out
a 4x to the third

00:04:57.228 --> 00:04:59.880
and you say, OK, if I
take out a 4 out of here,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.807
then this becomes a 1.

00:05:00.807 --> 00:05:02.890
If I take an x to the third
out of x to the fourth

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.780
I'll just have an x left over.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.510
And then if I take a
y out of the y then

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.490
I just have a 1 there.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.480
So this term becomes x.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.250
And then if I take
a 4x to the third y

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.560
out of here, if I
take a 4 out of an 8

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.807
I just have a 2 left over.

00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:16.890
If I take an x to the third
out of x to the third,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.580
that's just 1.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.360
If I take y out of
y, that's just one.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.997
So I'm just left with x plus 2.

00:05:21.997 --> 00:05:24.330
Eventually you'll just do
this in your head a little bit

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.040
faster.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.820
But hopefully this
makes everything clear.
