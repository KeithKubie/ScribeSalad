00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.130
OK, so you know how I said that
this lesson was going to

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.250
be the one where we're going
to add a sign in button?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.670
Well, it turns out I lied.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.940
This lesson is where we add in
all the frameworks and all the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.580
linker flags and do all the
random setup stuff we have to

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.000
do before we add the
sign in button.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.450
But I promise, after this,
we'll be adding a button.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.060
It'll be really exciting.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.780
So let's get into adding
our frameworks.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.510
Now, the first thing we're
going to want to do is

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.110
download the Play Games SDK
and the Google+ SDK.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.060
We're going to make use of both
of these libraries in our

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.520
application.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.727
So first thing we're going to
do is go to developers.googl

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:46.240
e.com/games/services.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.980
And once that page pops up,
we're going to go to the

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.360
Downloads link here
on the left.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.280
Now, on this page, you'll see
a link to the Games SDK.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.590
By the time you see this
tutorial, this will probably

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.290
say version 1.1.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.470
You can click on this link, and
this will download a ZIP

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.080
file to somewhere in
your local drive.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.060
Once that's done, you're going
to want to follow this Google+

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.290
iOS SDK link, and this will take
you to the Downloads page

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.770
for the Google+ platform.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.800
If we scroll down to the bottom,
you'll see a link for

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.590
the Google+ iOS SDK,
and we can download

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.270
the ZIP file as well.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.460
Once that's done, you'll have a
downloads folder that looks

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.960
a little something like this.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.440
We've got our Google+ SDK and
our PlayGamesServices SDK.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.150
And so first thing you're going
to want to do is unzip

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.400
each of these.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.540
And then, I suppose we can trash
the ZIP files just to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.840
clean up a little space.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.320
Great, and now we have
some frameworks we

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.720
can add to our project.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.190
Now, we're going to leave this
PlayGamesServices alone for a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.890
little while, but let's
explore what's in

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.790
our Google+ iOS SDK.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.400
You'll see in here, we've got
a couple of frameworks along

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.120
with a bundle file and this open
source directory, along

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.320
with the changelog, readme file,
and some sample code.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.720
For the purposes of our
application, we're going to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.460
want to add the two frameworks
into our Xcode project.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.100
So the easiest way to do that
is, let's go to Xcode.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.090
And we can simply drag these two
framework folders into our

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.090
Xcode project.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.420
So I'm going to copy over the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.220
GoogleOpenSource.framework folder.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.260
And depending on your setup,
you may want to copy these

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.000
into your destination folder.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.420
Or, you might want to leave
this unchecked if, for

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.210
instance, you have a centralized
location where all

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.870
of your libraries
are going to be.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.150
Then you can have multiple
applications all referring to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.360
the same directory.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.450
And at some point in the future,
when you need to

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.250
update this directory, this
framework, you'll only need to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.900
update it in one place.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.470
On the other hand, if you need
to put everything into a nice,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.260
stand-alone folder that you can
zip up and send around,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.550
maybe it's worth copying this
into your destination folder.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.620
In my case, I'm going to leave
this checked and copy

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.870
everything over.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.910
And then I'm going to
do the same thing

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.840
for the Google+ framework.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.150
And again, I'll leave
this checked.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.290
Make sure that the GuessMyNumber
target is

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.620
checked as well.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.060
And look at that, we've got two
new frameworks added to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.820
our project.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.240
I'm just going to move these
into the frameworks folder.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.900
And we can take a minute to talk
about the few things that

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.530
we're not adding.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.640
You'll notice we have a
GooglePlus.bundle file that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.020
we're not going to copy over.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.700
This contains all the resources
needed to generate

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.220
an in-game Google+
sign in button.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.480
And for reasons that I'll
explain in a future lesson,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.610
we're actually not going to
take advantage of this.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.000
We're going to generate
our own.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.300
But if you were to use the
official Google+ sign in

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.250
button, you would also want
to copy over this bundle.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.670
In addition, there's an
OpenSource folder.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.890
This OpenSource folder contains
the source code

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.100
versions of everything that is
in your GoogleOpenSource

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.320
framework folder.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.280
The framework folder tends to be
a little easier to add into

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.200
your application.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.110
You just kind of drag it
in, and you're done.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.160
But I know that some developers
like to have the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.410
open source folder with
all the source code

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.800
added to their project.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.720
They may want to do this so
they can get in there and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.790
debug what's happening, if their
program is running into

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.500
issues, by going off into
the open source library.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.140
There have been a few bug
workarounds in the past I've

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.450
had to implement where we
actually needed to alter or

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.020
add things to the open
source folder

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.360
instead of the framework.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.430
So there may be times
you want to do this.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.790
However, in our case, to keep
things simple, we're just

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.140
going to stick with
the framework.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.710
But feel free if you'd
like to add the open

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.590
source directory instead.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.340
You definitely want to
add one or the other.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.920
Don't add both, or my guess is
you'll end up with a bunch of

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.200
those duplicate symbol errors.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.950
So the next thing we're going
to want to do to get this

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.530
library to work is add this kind
of obscure linker flag

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.500
into our project.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.360
So I'm going to go to this
target, and under Build

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.960
Settings, I'm going to
search for linker.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.610
And here, Other Linker Flags,
I'm going to double-click this

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.010
and add ObjC as our
linker flag.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.490
You need to do this to get
the frameworks working.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.330
And if you're working, how would
I ever figure out that

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.610
this flag needs to be set
for things to work?

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.650
This is all available on
our documentation.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.260
We walk you through all this,
step by step, on the iOS

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.260
quickstart guide.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.550
So please be sure to check that
out if you ever need a

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.270
review of what's going
on in this video.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.900
So we're going to add that.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.350
And then, the final thing we
need to do is add in our

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.940
custom URL type.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.390
If you'll recall from our
presentation, we need to

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.530
register with the system.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.450
That com.google.Guess
MyNumber:/oauth2callback is a

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.210
URI that corresponds
to our application.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.570
And the way to do that is in
Xcode, in a feature that maybe

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.150
you've never used
before, which is

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.970
adding custom URL types.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.700
So let's show you
how to do that.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.495
Go back to Xcode, and in the
Info tab, this URL Types, a

00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:01.720
drop-down will expand.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.700
We can hit the plus sign to
create our own custom one, and

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.790
this identifier will be your
bundle identifier which, in my

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.040
case, is
com.google.GuessMyNumber.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.740
But in your case, it probably
has your own company name

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.020
instead of Google.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.400
And we'll add the same thing
for a URL scheme.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.340
So just copy and paste that.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.465
And we can leave it at that.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:23.860
That's good enough.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.700
At that point, we've now
basically told the system,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.930
hey, if you see any URL
that begins with

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.020
com.google.GuessMyNumber instead
of HTTP or mailto,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.250
that means go to our
application.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.270
And finally, let's add a
few other frameworks

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.960
we're going to need.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.450
So go to your Build Phases tab,
and under Link Binary

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.040
With Libraries, hit
the plus sign.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.865
And we're going to add
SystemConfiguration.framework.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.070
We can also add
Security.framework.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.790
And then, let's add a few other
frameworks that we don't

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.020
need for sign in but we're going
to need for the game's

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.360
SDK in a couple of lessons.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.820
So I'm going to add
CoreData.framework.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.140
I'm going to add
CoreText.framework.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.020
And finally, let's add
QuartzCore.framework.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.600
We can drag all these to our
Frameworks folder, just to

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.640
keep everything nice and neat.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.760
And there we go.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.470
The setup steps are
finally done.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.770
And now, in the next lesson, for
real, honest, I promise,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.440
maybe, we can add a
sign in button.
