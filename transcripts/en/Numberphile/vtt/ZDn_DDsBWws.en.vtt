00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.630
ALEX BELLOS: This is the Curta,
which is the only

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:12.460
mechanical pocket digital
calculator ever invented.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.360
It was invented by Curt
Herzstark, who's an Austrian

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.890
engineer who had the
idea in the 1930s.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.920
Because for the previous 300
years, there'd been this

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.420
desire for people to mechanize
calculating, because

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.770
calculating was quite
effortful.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.925
It was quite difficult.

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:31.340
Wouldn't it be great if machines
could do it for us?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.660
And the first person to have
this idea was Pascal in about

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.920
1650, who invented
the Pascaline.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.310
And then Leibniz invented his
Step Reckoner, and et cetera,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.130
et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.350
By the Victorian Age, there
were these big desk

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.480
calculators, where that's
where the phrase "number

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.380
crunching" comes from.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.140
People would do these
complicated multiplications--

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.940
not complicated, just long

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.230
multiplications using machines.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.190
But there was always the dream
to try and make it a bit more

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.810
user friendly, to make
a pocket-sized one.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.140
But the challenge was to get the
right kind of engineering.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.900
And Curt Herzstark in
the 1930s thought

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.129
he'd found a way.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.330
But it took him another 20
years to develop it.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.260
And one of the problems
was that the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.660
second World War happened.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.860
He was half Jewish, living in
Austria, so he was imprisoned

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.550
in the concentration camp.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.540
But because he was quite a
well-known engineer, the Nazis

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.810
said we won't kill you.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.000
We'll let you develop your
pocket calculate--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.840
mechanical calculator.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.690
They didn't kill him.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.700
And I'm not sure if he hadn't
got there yet, or if he had

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.630
got there yet, but didn't want
to tell his Nazi captors.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.140
Because very shortly after the
war when he was liberated, he

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.320
worked out how to do it.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.050
And he tried to get
some investment.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.740
It was quite difficult getting
investment for what was

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.770
essentially an executive toy.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.620
And it was only in
Liechtenstein, the Dutch in

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.750
Liechtenstein, that the royal
family there invested in him.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.460
And in the 1960s--

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.960
'50s and '60s--

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.400
about 100,000 of these
Curtas were made.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.560
And they were very--

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.580
they're now a collector's
item.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.040
I'm going to show you exactly
how they work.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.330
You put the number down here,
your input number,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.830
so I put there 68.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.570
And when you turn this around,
it will add whatever number is

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.240
here on the sides to here, where
the output number comes.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.560
So I put in 68.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.136
I'm going to turn this around.

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:31.350
And you can see, it
goes to 68 there.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.620
If I turn it around again, it
adds another 68, and another

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.080
68, and another 68.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.890
And we can keep on going.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.870
And now I've done
it five times.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.490
So 5 times 68 is 340.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.740
Because you might forget how
many times you've been turning

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.480
it around, there's a marker
here, 5, which reminds me that

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.550
I've put it around five times.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.914
So it goes on to six, seven.

00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:09.590
So 7 times 68 is 476.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.060
It can do a whole lot
more than that.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.020
Let's multiply by a
two-digit number.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.480
Firstly, let's zero it, which
is quite good fun.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.720
Zeroing it, you just pull
up and turn that around.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.242
It's now completely zeroed.

00:03:23.242 --> 00:03:24.314
BRADY HARAN: That's like
the clear button on a

00:03:24.314 --> 00:03:24.850
calculator, isn't it?

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.190
ALEX BELLOS: Exactly.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.150
It's the C. Then
you put this--

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.050
put these ones at the top.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.420
So let's say we wanted
to say 24 times 33.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.640
Let's put 24 here, 2
and then 4, so 33.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.730
33, we need to multiply
three times--

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.040
one, two, three.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.730
And then the clever thing
now is that we move it

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.210
from units to tens.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.770
And we do another
three times--

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.070
one, two, three.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.960
So we have multiplied it 33
times, three units, three on

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.560
the tens, and the
answer is 792.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.350
It's a beautiful machine.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.805
This is older than me.

00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:17.625
It's 50 years old.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:19.440
It looks brand new.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.410
It's sturdy and tough.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.430
And what was interesting about
it is in the '60s, it was a

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.980
toy, essentially, of rally
drivers and their copilots.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.350
Because when you're a rally
driver, there are lots of

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.290
calculations you need
to do about

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.380
speeds, fuels, distances.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.220
But if you had a slide rule,
you'd be slipping

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.270
all over the place.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.220
Whereas with this, you could
do this and do the proper

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.020
calculations exactly.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.020
And you're never
going to slip.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.220
And it's just an absolutely
beautiful thing.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.860
It was the zenith of the dream
of mechanizing calculation.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.790
It was the end of the road.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.390
It was the most perfect and
beautiful mechanized

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.840
calculator.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.750
And then what happened
a few years later--

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.060
overtaken by electronic
calculation and calculators.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.760
So this was as far as it got
along the road of mechanized

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.990
calculation.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.380
I bought this on eBay.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.880
You can get them for about 500
quid, although hopefully now,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.060
it costs a little bit more.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.280
So it's an investment.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.554
Let's say we want to do--

00:05:31.554 --> 00:05:34.710
I'll just pull these numbers.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.220
What's this?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.960
This is 3,242,333.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.990
And just say I want to
multiply this by 678.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.050
I will go 8--

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.000
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.330
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.530
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:32.998
So 678 times 3,242,333
is 2,198,301,774.

00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:33.580
BRADY HARAN: That's fun.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.210
What were those little silver
things you moved around there

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.660
at the end?

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.210
ALEX BELLOS: These things here
are just where you would put

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.870
the commas, just to remind me.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.040
These are like the commas.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.450
That's all it is.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.890
Every numberphile's
favorite toy.
