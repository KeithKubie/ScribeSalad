00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.599
Why are Proper Sterlization Procedures Used
During Lethal Injections?

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.750
Besides the fact that manufacturers sterilize
the needles (so no real extra effort is needed),

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.360
other sterilization procedures are also used
in these executions for good reason.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.000
You see, a stay of execution may happen at
the last minute.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.430
If this happens, but then the condemned later
dies from infection, a wrongful death suit

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.020
could be filed against the state -a suit the
state would likely lose.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.570
While this may seem like a scenario that is
unlikely to occur in real life, in fact, this

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.030
is not the case at all.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.430
Relatively last minute granting of a stay
of execution is incredibly common, though

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.370
ones where the needle is already inserted
are rare.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.570
That being said, it has happened before.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.750
Exhibit A: James David Autry.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.399
Autry was convicted of murdering convenience
store employee Shirley Drouet and customer

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.460
Joe Broussard, who was in the store at the
time.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.530
Another customer in the store was Anthanasios
Svarnas, who was shot, but not killed.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.290
What did Autry get out of this?

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.359
Some beer worth $2.70 (about $7.41 today);
he didn’t take any money from the cash register,

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.500
just the beer.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.630
About three years after the murders, on October
4, 1983, Autry found himself strapped down

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.439
with a needle in his arm, about to be injected
with a concoction of chemicals that would

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.450
end his life.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.479
However, at the time, there was a question
whether Texas’ exact procedure for executions

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.109
was constitutional.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.999
After lying there for a little over a half
hour, the call came in.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.279
The Supreme Court had ruled that Autry’s
execution be delayed for 30 days while they

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:38.990
continued to review the issue.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.530
The needle was removed and Autry was taken
back to his cell.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.909
Of course, five months later, on March 14,
1984, he was executed.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.550
But in the interim, had they not used proper
sterilization procedures, he may well have

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.719
gotten sick or even died as a result.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.999
It’s considered okay for some states to
kill condemned prisoners in a properly vetted

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.289
procedure, but not via infection.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.210
Yet another ultra-close call case is that
of Warren Lee Hill, a man with the IQ of just

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.210
70.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.610
Hill received a life sentence for murdering
his girlfriend in 1985.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.650
Five years later, he beat another inmate,
Joseph Handspike, to death and was given the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.819
death penalty.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.090
In July of 2012, just a few hours before he
was to be executed, he was given a stay of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.090
execution.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.269
Later, on February 19, 2013, he was once again
to be executed -this time, a stay of execution

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.970
was granted a scant 30 minutes before he was
to have the lethal concoction of chemicals

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.989
course through his veins.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.239
To date, he has received four stays of executions
and as of the publication of this article,

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.459
he hasn’t been executed yet.

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.379
In as close of a call as you can get -though
this time the individual was not subject to

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.020
lethal injection -Caryl Chessman was given
a stay of execution so near to the set execution

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.940
time that it ended up being too late.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.310
In 1948, Chessman, who’d robbed various
people and raped several women, was sentenced

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.209
to die via the gas chamber.

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.900
After garnering support from the likes of
Billy Graham and Eleanor Roosevelt, he was

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.110
granted eight stays of execution.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.980
The problem was, in the last one, it occurred
about one minute before the execution was

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.989
to take place.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.390
The secretary of the federal judge who’d
granted the stay accidentally dialed the wrong

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.390
number.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.200
By the time she realized her mistake and called
the correct number, the cyanide pellets had

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200
been dropped.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.730
At this point, there was nothing that could
be done to stop the execution, and Chessman

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.530
died.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.370
The lethal injection procedure usually employed
by prisons involves first introducing a saline

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.720
drip, then injecting the condemned with a
general anesthesia, hopefully which won’t

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.749
have worn off before the fatal fluids have
done their work.

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.569
Once the condemned is unconscious, some chemical
is used to cause death via cardiac arrest.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.689
To achieve this, usually Pancuronium bromide
is injected, resulting in the individual ceasing

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:57.689
breathing.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:10.599
After the Pancuronium bromide is introduced,
Potassium chloride comes next, which stops

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.919
the heart.
