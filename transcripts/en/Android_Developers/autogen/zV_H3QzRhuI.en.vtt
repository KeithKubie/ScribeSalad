performance in Vulcan and again these
 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.430
performance in Vulcan and again these
are kind of heavy topics so if you you

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440
are kind of heavy topics so if you you
 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.870
are kind of heavy topics so if you you
find some if you finally say something

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880
find some if you finally say something
 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.520

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300
time you've heard of validation layers
 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.149

error and the general rule of thumb for
 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.409
error and the general rule of thumb for
for validation layers is to turn them on

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419
for validation layers is to turn them on
 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.550
for validation layers is to turn them on
the beginning the project and leave them

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560
the beginning the project and leave them
 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.559
the beginning the project and leave them
on to your shift the validation layers

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569
on to your shift the validation layers
 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.300
on to your shift the validation layers
are cross-platform which means the same

Linux and Windows and one of the cool

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139
Linux and Windows and one of the cool
 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.159
Linux and Windows and one of the cool
aspects of the validation is this it's a

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169
aspects of the validation is this it's a
 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.050
aspects of the validation is this it's a
function callback that you could supply

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060
function callback that you could supply
 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.629
function callback that you could supply
to the validation layers that gets

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639
to the validation layers that gets
 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.189
to the validation layers that gets
triggered every time a validation

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199
triggered every time a validation
 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.929
triggered every time a validation
message gets triggered and this is what

00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:57.939
message gets triggered and this is what
 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:00.029
message gets triggered and this is what
the call signature looks like and this

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039
the call signature looks like and this
 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.670
the call signature looks like and this
is what a sample body looks like as you

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680
is what a sample body looks like as you
 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.469
is what a sample body looks like as you
can see you know since it is you can

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479
can see you know since it is you can
 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.659
can see you know since it is you can
break it down into whatever granularity

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669
break it down into whatever granularity
 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:07.769
break it down into whatever granularity
that you need based on the validation

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:07.779
that you need based on the validation
 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.679
that you need based on the validation
criteria and if you're on a platform

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:10.689
criteria and if you're on a platform
 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.809
criteria and if you're on a platform
where you can set breakpoints in the IDE

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819
where you can set breakpoints in the IDE
 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:14.399
where you can set breakpoints in the IDE
you can definitely set a breakpoint on

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409
you can definitely set a breakpoint on
 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.679
you can definitely set a breakpoint on
any of these and you can look in the

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:16.689
any of these and you can look in the
 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:18.119
any of these and you can look in the
call stack to see where the validation

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129
call stack to see where the validation
 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:22.019
call stack to see where the validation
measures was triggered all right

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:22.029
measures was triggered all right
 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:24.230
measures was triggered all right
so let's get a bit deeper with Vulcan

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240
so let's get a bit deeper with Vulcan
 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.490
so let's get a bit deeper with Vulcan
some friendly reminders before we start

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500
some friendly reminders before we start
 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.230
some friendly reminders before we start
and these are things that you if you

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240
and these are things that you if you
 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.390
and these are things that you if you
were getting a port from OpenGL es2

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400
were getting a port from OpenGL es2
 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.850
were getting a port from OpenGL es2
Vulcan it's good to keep these in mind

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860
Vulcan it's good to keep these in mind
 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.639
Vulcan it's good to keep these in mind
even though they seem very trivial the

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649
even though they seem very trivial the
 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:36.860
even though they seem very trivial the
first thing is the

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870
first thing is the
 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.390
first thing is the

system is upper-left origin and this
 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.050
system is upper-left origin and this
includes both rendering and texture

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060
includes both rendering and texture
 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.790
includes both rendering and texture
coordinates this one caught me off-guard

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.110
coordinates this one caught me off-guard
when I was first working with it

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120
when I was first working with it
 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.970
when I was first working with it
everything I render appeared upside down

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980
everything I render appeared upside down
 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.350
everything I render appeared upside down
and kind of backwards and I thought I

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360
and kind of backwards and I thought I
 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.200
and kind of backwards and I thought I
was doing something very wrong and so I

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210
was doing something very wrong and so I
 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.600
was doing something very wrong and so I
went and like you know Tara told me down

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610
went and like you know Tara told me down
 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.220
went and like you know Tara told me down
and asked him like why is it up or left

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230
and asked him like why is it up or left
 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.380
and asked him like why is it up or left
and there wasn't a clear answer but it

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390
and there wasn't a clear answer but it
 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.840
and there wasn't a clear answer but it
just says a memory from memory

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850
just says a memory from memory
 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.940

management basics and in OpenGL you

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950
management basics and in OpenGL you
 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.460
management basics and in OpenGL you
didn't really have to handle a lot of

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470
didn't really have to handle a lot of
 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.130
didn't really have to handle a lot of
allocations yourself if any in Vulcan

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140
allocations yourself if any in Vulcan
 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.810
allocations yourself if any in Vulcan
you have to kind of handle the majority

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820
you have to kind of handle the majority
 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.150
you have to kind of handle the majority
of the allocations yourself buffers and

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160
of the allocations yourself buffers and
 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.150
of the allocations yourself buffers and
images definitely and pools command

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160
images definitely and pools command
 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.710

pools are kind of handled for you but

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720
pools are kind of handled for you but
 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.260
pools are kind of handled for you but
descriptor pools are not you you still

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270
descriptor pools are not you you still
 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.240
descriptor pools are not you you still
have to point out to volcán what you

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250
have to point out to volcán what you
 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.540
have to point out to volcán what you
need all right so the first Vulcan topic

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550
need all right so the first Vulcan topic
 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.400
need all right so the first Vulcan topic
command buffers so the command buffer

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.410
command buffers so the command buffer
 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.900
command buffers so the command buffer
one of those things in OpenGL that you

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910
one of those things in OpenGL that you
 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.670
one of those things in OpenGL that you
hear a lot about but you don't really

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680
hear a lot about but you don't really
 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.990
hear a lot about but you don't really
you don't really have explicit control

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000
you don't really have explicit control
 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.170
you don't really have explicit control
over in Vulcan that changes a lot they

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180
over in Vulcan that changes a lot they
 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.910

you're looking at so the general wisdom
behind this is that you want to group

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:56.980
behind this is that you want to group
 

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.700
behind this is that you want to group
descriptor sets by update frequency and

00:14:59.700 --> 00:14:59.710
descriptor sets by update frequency and
 

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.820
descriptor sets by update frequency and
you only should update descriptor sets

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:01.830
you only should update descriptor sets
 

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.500
you only should update descriptor sets
that have changed updating a descriptor

once you bind the descriptor stats you
 

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.360
once you bind the descriptor stats you
can't do any updates to it until the

next iteration of the command buffer and
then you should do that before binding

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:19.410
then you should do that before binding
 

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.930
then you should do that before binding
so here's here's the one really

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:21.940
so here's here's the one really

it wasn't obvious from the spec what

it wasn't obvious from the spec what
this thing what this meant and so i

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:37.990
this thing what this meant and so i
 

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.010
this thing what this meant and so i
thought it meant that the index on to

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:40.020
thought it meant that the index on to

the p descriptor sets which is a which
is another parameter and give you a

like so at the bottom you see the
 

00:15:47.889 --> 00:15:52.229
like so at the bottom you see the
signature so this this this parameter

00:15:52.229 --> 00:15:52.239
signature so this this this parameter
 

00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:54.780
signature so this this this parameter

the other way to work around this is to
 

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.370
the other way to work around this is to

for bit copy from the buffer to the
 

00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:21.100
for bit copy from the buffer to the
image so you can basically just read

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:21.110
image so you can basically just read
 

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.440
image so you can basically just read
your image into the buffer and then dump

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:23.450
your image into the buffer and then dump
 

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.259
your image into the buffer and then dump
it into the image itself the depth

saying but it again it catches people
more often than not is that they're

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480
more often than not is that they're
 

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.740
more often than not is that they're
there most of the most of the vendors

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:00.750
there most of the most of the vendors
 

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.330
there most of the most of the vendors
will go above and beyond in certain

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340
will go above and beyond in certain
 

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.250
will go above and beyond in certain
areas of the device limits and not

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260
areas of the device limits and not
 

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.250
areas of the device limits and not
others and some device vendors will just

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.260
others and some device vendors will just
 

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.930
others and some device vendors will just
kind of do the the minimum and it's not

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940
kind of do the the minimum and it's not
 

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.520
kind of do the the minimum and it's not
because one vendors better than other is

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:10.530
because one vendors better than other is
 

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.799
because one vendors better than other is
just implementation right but but don't

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:12.809
just implementation right but but don't
 

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:14.960
just implementation right but but don't
assume that the same classes on devices

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:14.970
assume that the same classes on devices
 

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.760
assume that the same classes on devices
or the same class of devices have

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:16.770
or the same class of devices have
 

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.520
or the same class of devices have
similar functionality they may not and

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:19.530
similar functionality they may not and
 

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.070
similar functionality they may not and
if you run into any errors especially

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080
if you run into any errors especially
 

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.080
if you run into any errors especially
with device limits you can't use a

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.090
with device limits you can't use a
 

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:28.100
with device limits you can't use a
validation layer to track them down all

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:28.110
validation layer to track them down all
 

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.770
validation layer to track them down all
right so that's about 41 slides of me

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:30.780
right so that's about 41 slides of me
 

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.480
right so that's about 41 slides of me
talking with us you shown you any

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:32.490
talking with us you shown you any
 

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.380
talking with us you shown you any
pictures and let me fix that right now

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:36.390
pictures and let me fix that right now
 

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:41.930
pictures and let me fix that right now
so these I know that the word games is

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:41.940
so these I know that the word games is
 

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.180
so these I know that the word games is
using the type of the talk and I'm not

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:44.190
using the type of the talk and I'm not
 

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.620
using the type of the talk and I'm not
gonna show you a game engine demos but I

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:45.630
gonna show you a game engine demos but I
 

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.180
gonna show you a game engine demos but I
would like to show you render demo so

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.190
would like to show you render demo so
 

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.200
would like to show you render demo so
that's okay

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:48.210
that's okay
 

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.419
that's okay
and the point of these demos is to give

00:32:50.419 --> 00:32:50.429
and the point of these demos is to give
 

00:32:50.429 --> 00:32:51.799
and the point of these demos is to give
more credence to the fact that Vulcan is

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:51.809
more credence to the fact that Vulcan is
 

00:32:51.809 --> 00:32:53.149
more credence to the fact that Vulcan is
up and running and you can't do some

00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159
up and running and you can't do some
 

00:32:53.159 --> 00:32:54.860
up and running and you can't do some
pretty amazing things that with it

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:54.870
pretty amazing things that with it
 

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.260
pretty amazing things that with it
already and so hopefully these are these

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:57.270
already and so hopefully these are these
 

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.149
already and so hopefully these are these
examples are really enticing enough so

00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159
examples are really enticing enough so
 

00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:03.440
examples are really enticing enough so
go to the demos please

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:03.450
 
 

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:07.670
 
okay so this is this is a walking

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:07.680
okay so this is this is a walking
 

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.070
okay so this is this is a walking
simulation it runs almost entirely on

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080
simulation it runs almost entirely on
 

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.340
simulation it runs almost entirely on
the GPU it's a it's a it's a

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:13.350
the GPU it's a it's a it's a
 

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.530
the GPU it's a it's a it's a
simulation of about I think about 4,000

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:15.540
simulation of about I think about 4,000
 

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.070

fish and essentially the the fish

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080
fish and essentially the the fish
 

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.890
fish and essentially the the fish
simulation is going on the GPU and

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:20.900
simulation is going on the GPU and
 

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.030
simulation is going on the GPU and
there's a shark that comes in every now

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.040
there's a shark that comes in every now
 

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.680
there's a shark that comes in every now
and then and it basically causes the

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:24.690
and then and it basically causes the
 

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:28.850
and then and it basically causes the
fish to disperse the the code for this

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860
fish to disperse the the code for this
 

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.770
fish to disperse the the code for this
is actually open source it's a sample on

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:30.780
is actually open source it's a sample on

cinder if you want to get it and mess
 

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.720
cinder if you want to get it and mess
with it it's it's totally free whoops

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:35.730

stay awake the original work was done by

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440
stay awake the original work was done by
 

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.480
stay awake the original work was done by
my friend Robert Hodge and he was

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:41.490
my friend Robert Hodge and he was
 

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.700
my friend Robert Hodge and he was
gracious enough to donate it as part of

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:43.710
gracious enough to donate it as part of
 

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:48.170
gracious enough to donate it as part of
the Vulcan launching efforts and the

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:48.180
the Vulcan launching efforts and the
 

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.810
the Vulcan launching efforts and the
next demo I want to show you is it's

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820
next demo I want to show you is it's
 

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.620
next demo I want to show you is it's
also another demo by Robert and

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:53.630
also another demo by Robert and
 

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.090
also another demo by Robert and
essentially this is if you're familiar

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100
essentially this is if you're familiar
 

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.160
essentially this is if you're familiar
with how with NASA's capture of sunspots

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:58.170
with how with NASA's capture of sunspots
 

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.370
with how with NASA's capture of sunspots
this is what they this is what the the

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380
this is what they this is what the the
 

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.110
this is what they this is what the the
images look like so Robert wanted to

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120
images look like so Robert wanted to
 

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.910
images look like so Robert wanted to
create something that was a real-time

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:07.920
create something that was a real-time
 

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.390
create something that was a real-time
version of the sunspots so you know it's

00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:11.400
version of the sunspots so you know it's
 

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.120
version of the sunspots so you know it's
usually to create pretty pictures but it

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:14.130
usually to create pretty pictures but it
 

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.100
usually to create pretty pictures but it
turns out to be very beautiful and the

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:16.110
turns out to be very beautiful and the
 

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.430
turns out to be very beautiful and the
the funny tidbit about this is that

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440
the funny tidbit about this is that
 

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.919
the funny tidbit about this is that
somebody not somebody a few actually

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:21.929
somebody not somebody a few actually
 

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.290
somebody not somebody a few actually
more than a few people have mistakenly

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300
more than a few people have mistakenly
 

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.590
more than a few people have mistakenly
thought this was the actual NASA capture

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:26.600
thought this was the actual NASA capture
 

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.870
thought this was the actual NASA capture
so this one unfortunately as an open
