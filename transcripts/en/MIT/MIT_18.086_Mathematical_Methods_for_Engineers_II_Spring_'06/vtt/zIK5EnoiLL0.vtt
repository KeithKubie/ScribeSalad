00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:24.080
PROFESSOR: So we started last
week on the big topic for the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.630
rest of the semester,
optimization.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.780
Maybe can you close that door
or just part way anyway.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.900
Thanks.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.320
Great.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.020
That's perfect, just
like that.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:44.640
So, since it was a few days ago,
I wanted to recap what I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.970
did in the first lecture about
optimization, which was to

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.110
pick out the least squares
problem as a

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.180
beautiful model problem.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.140
I followed that through --

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.160
the input is a matrix a
rectangular, a right hand side

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.090
b probably measurements.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.730
We would like to get au
equal b but we can't.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.280
We got too many measurements.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.050
We do the best possible, which
is the solution u hat of this

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.540
normal equation.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.470
Then I rewrote the normal
equations -- well, I also drew

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.580
the picture that you see
over here on the left.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.070
The picture that shows
the two optimization

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.020
problems at the same time.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.530
Here is the vector b.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.180
Here are all possible au's --

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.700
this is the column space,
this is all au's.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.570
The best au was the
projection.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.390
The error e was what we couldn't
get right, the part

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.020
that's perpendicular to the
column space we can't help.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.010
It's the solution to another
projection problem that e is

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.460
the same -- of course, it's
the same over here -- as

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.150
projecting b onto this
perpendicular line, which is

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.670
the line of all vectors,
a tranpose e says --

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.290
what that says in words is
e is perpendicular to the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.540
columns of a.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.150
I've drawn it the best
I could as a

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.480
perpendicular to the columns.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.920
So that we have a plane
of columns --

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.790
this is like a 3 x 2 matrix.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.230
We have a plane with the
two columns and the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.830
perpendicular line.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.315
Then just near the end, I said
that it would be great to have

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:10.240
-- this model would be almost
all we need except it should

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.160
have one more matrix and
I call that matrix c.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.990
I want just to show you quickly
where that comes.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:30.080
So this is all section 7.1 of
the notes, except that these

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.550
words are not yet typed.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.660
So they'll, as soon as possible,
and an updated 7.1

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.420
will include this, what
I want to do.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.140
Because I think it's the very
best introduction I could give

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.260
to these pair of optimization
problems.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.040
You might think who needs
optimization.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.470
Your main activity
might be solving

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.000
differential equations.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.570
So, can I just take a time out
here because I happened to see

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.020
the homework upcoming.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.240
I think it's 16930, so it's a
course a little bit like this,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.040
only the first word in the
course title is "Advanced,"

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.930
and our first word is
"Introduction," but, of

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.110
course, it's the same course
or same stuff.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.680
This is the homework that I
don't think has even been

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.630
assigned, even been
handed out yet.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.970
But I just thought it's a great
example of a applied, so

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.000
that you see where optimization
appears and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.130
what's involved.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.240
So differential equations are
involved, but also you got

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.350
something that you
want to optimize.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.750
So I just wrote it on this board
and I simplified it a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.760
little over the homework that
they'll actually get.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.480
so here's the problem.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.670
We want a certain distribution
of heat.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.410
So I could draw a picture.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.690
We want a heat distribution for
whatever reason that maybe

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.020
goes like this over the
integral zero to 1.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.170
What do we have at our
disposal to get the

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.500
heat to be that way?

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.950
Well, we've got sources
of heat.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:50.540
But we don't have a continuous
source, we only have n

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.640
parameters to play with.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.220
I mean right away
you recognize an

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.770
optimization problem.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.430
We're trying to get this
function here u knot of x.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.260
We're trying to match a
function, but we've only got n

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.550
parameters.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.180
Those will be the
right hand side.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.050
So what we're allowed to choose,
we can put in little

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.330
space heaters, and we can turn
them to the temperatures we

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.900
want to -- temperatures
s1, s2, s3.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.590
That was probably a stupid
choice to put an s for down

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.230
there because I don't
even know if

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.940
negative heat is allowed.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.110
Anyway, we wouldn't want it
if we're aiming for that

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.610
distribution.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.370
Now you understand the s's
are not supposed to

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.720
match that u knot.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.640
The s's are the sources of
heat, and the u's are the

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.560
outputs, the distribution, and
they are controlled by a

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.810
differential equation.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.500
What we control is the right
hand side of the equation, but

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.490
we only control n parameters.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.070
Then we have to solve the
equation and find out what

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.900
distribution that gives.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.740
So that's all like differential
equations, we

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.950
know how to do it.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.680
It's one dimensional in this
example, so straightforward.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.030
But now comes the optimization
part.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.610
We take this result
and we compare it

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.340
with the desired result.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.390
So the actual result from some
source of heat might be

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.640
something like that.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:49.250
We want this u of x, the heat
distribution that we're

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.760
actually producing to be as
close as possible to u knot.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.630
Close could mean different
things, but if we measure

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.980
closeness in this integral
square mean square sense, then

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.460
we're going to have
nice problem.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.950
In fact, we're going
to have a linear --

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.080
everything's linear right now.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.930
Well, everything's quadratic
here, so when we minimize it's

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.740
going to give us a linear
equation for the s's.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.980
I just think that's a
good model problem.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.290
A good model of what
we might do.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:32.330
I think actually in the problem
to be assigned --

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.370
well, it's not a big
deal for us.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.500
There is convection as well.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.910
So this is a pure diffusion
problem, just the second

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.780
derivative.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.360
We know very well that if there
was a first derivative

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.630
in there, the stuff's
convecting, passing through

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.670
the region.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:09:02.660
So if I put on a convective
term, cdudx, how does that

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.110
change the problem?

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.580
Not in a big, big major way, but
one thing we can guess is

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.940
that now that is not a symmetric
term, right.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.530
We've seen the difference
between first differences and

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.950
second differences, first
derivatives and second

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:21.360
derivatives.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.790
So now it's a little trickier
and it's not symmetric.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:37.570
So somehow there will be a
primal problem, this one, and

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:42.580
there will be a adjoint
problem, dual problem,

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.350
perpendicular problem, whatever
name you want to give

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:51.790
it, just as there is in our very
first model over there.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:59.220
So that's my sort of quick look
to kind of put on the

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:05.830
board one example that I didn't
invent, that came from

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:11.260
applications and gives
a sort of typical of

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.550
what you have to do.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:18.870
You control an input, you get
an output, so that's the

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.100
analysis problem.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.530
Find the output.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.900
But then comes the optimization
problem -- make

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.880
that output close to something
that you wish.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.470
So what's the typical algorithm
going to do?

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:40.970
It's going to make a choice of
s, it's going to solve the

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.590
analysis problem for the u,
it's going to look and see

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.800
what the error is, it's going
to figure out probably the

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.160
gradient somehow.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.190
What's the steepest way
to make it closer?

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.410
That's going to lead us
to a change of s.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.450
We use a change of s, the new
s, solve that, and iterate.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.110
That would be a typical
algorithm.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.980
We might be able to shortcut
it in a model

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.750
problem like this.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:18.540
But that's totally the typical
optimization idea, is an

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:24.530
analysis problem and then figure
out a gradient to get a

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.510
better source back to
the analysis problem

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.040
with the new source.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:37.120
What the algebra, the math, has
to do is those two steps

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.760
of figuring out OK, how do we
improve the error, how do we

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.660
reduce the error, what's
the steepest direction?

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.690
Somehow we got to compute
a derivative.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.310
Actually, that's what
this month is about.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.310
Derivatives that are not just
like the derivative of x cube

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.990
or something.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.470
I often wondered how many
presidents could take the

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.340
derivative of x cube
and I'm not sure.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.460
Anybody occur to you who you
could count on being able to

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.080
take the derivative
of x cubed?

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.260
I don't think the current
president would

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.980
know what it meant.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.490
But I think Carter could have
done it, because he went to

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.170
the Naval Academy.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.180
Jefferson was probably --
he knew everything.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.270
I don't know.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.280
Anybody else has another
candidate they can tell me.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.080
So there is our problem --
finding derivatives that would

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.140
be definitely beyond the
capacity of the White House.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:13:01.720
Now I want to stay with this
model a little more because

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.440
it's the perfect model.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.710
So this was the like model 1,
unweighted ordinary least

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.400
squared, and it produced the
identity matrix in there.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.690
I mentioned last time what I
want to do, the more general

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:23.920
model has another symmetric
positive-definite matrix in

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.110
there, but not necessarily i,
and it comes from weighted

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.640
least squares.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.070
So that's what I'm going
to talk about.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.050
So what are weighted
least squares.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:40.800
Well, you've got these
measurements and you think

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.650
they maybe don't all, maybe
they're not independent, maybe

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.320
they're not equally reliable.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.930
So you weight them by how
reliable they are.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.760
A more reliable one you would
put a heavier weight, w, on

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.410
because you want that to
be more important.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:05.000
So, you change to
this problem.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.730
But it looks practically
the same.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:12.400
The only difference is a has
become wa, b has become wb.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.650
So the equations will be the
same, but a is now wa, b is

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:22.140
now wb, and those are
the equations.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.370
I guess I should call, just
to make clear that u is a

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.880
different u, that the best
u now depends on

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.410
the choice of weights.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:35.400
I should really be calling that
u -- somehow indicate

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.940
that it depends on the weight.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.890
Now they key nice thing is that
if I write this out as a

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.690
tranpose --

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.080
can you just write this out.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.500
You get the a tranpose, and
the a is over here.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.460
But what's in the middle?

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.160
What's this matrix c --

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.230
I jumped the gun and called that
matrix in the middle c,

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.920
but how is it connected to w?

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.390
You can see it here as c
is w tranpose w, right?

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.180
It's just sitting there
in the middle.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.000
That's great that the fact
that the combination w

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.160
tranpose w is all you
need to know.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.405
So we can forget w
in favor of --

00:15:26.405 --> 00:15:31.420
I'll just put it here -- w
tranpose w is now given the

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.690
name c, and this matrix is
symmetric positive-definite.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.920
So it's a great matrix and it's
exactly the one we want.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.850
This is exactly the
equation we want.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:53.980
So if I go back to writing it in
this -- you know, this was

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.210
the equation.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:01.920
You remember the point that we
could go directly to one

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:09.160
equation for the best u, or we
could keep our options open

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:15.530
and have two equations that
led to the same one.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.410
They're totally equivalent.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.560
But the two equations will give
us not only u, but the

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.960
error, b minus au, as
an other unknown.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.230
That's what we did up there.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.920
So we had two equations,
and if we

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.500
eliminated e we got to this.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.710
Now I want to have two
equations, and if I eliminate

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.530
e, I get to that.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:44.450
So let me see what
those would be.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.000
Well, here's one of them.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.640
a tranpose c -- e is zero --
you see, that's the only

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.150
difference really.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:17:02.000
That the weighted normal
equation, I just took a

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.110
tranpose c, and then I took the
b minus au together, and

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.510
this is what I'm calling e.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:15.170
So one way to do it is just the
new guy is just now e plus

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.630
auw is still b.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:25.920
But now a tranpose ce is zero.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.570
Good deal.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.040
I mean that's quite nice.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.190
It isn't absolutely perfect
though, because

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.380
I've lost the symmetry.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.920
I'm putting a c in there and
I don't really want it.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.720
I want a c but I don't
want it there.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.970
So, I just make a
small change.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.480
I'm going to introduce a new
unknown that I'll call little

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.560
w, apologies for the fact that
it's also a w, it just

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.410
happened to fit.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.730
That'll be the ce.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.960
So I'm just calling this
a new name here.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.230
So that now my e -- of course,
if I just invert, e

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.970
is c inverse w.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.690
So now I'm just going to write
these equations with w instead

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.580
of e because I like it better.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:29.000
So this equation is now a
tranpose w equals zero.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.980
This equation e is disappeared
in favor of c inverse w plus

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:42.100
au equals b.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.300
So that's the system
that I really like.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.100
That's the saddle point system,
the Kuhn-Tucker

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.080
system, the primal dual system,
the fundamental system

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:59.230
of the whole subject in this
linear matrix case.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.740
We haven't got functions, we
got vectors, and we've got

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:10.570
symmetry, and we've got
linearity, and we've got a

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:16.720
saddle point matrix that's now
the s -- well, let me just

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.060
change it here.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.430
It's just changed to
this, c inverse.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.090
That's the fundamental matrix
of the whole subject.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.740
So, s is the saddle
point matrix.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.230
So I wanted to get that far.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:46.470
You see that the whole picture
was elementary linear algebra.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:52.780
Let me come back to the
elementary figure that

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.950
illustrates what's
the geometry.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:02.630
How was the geometry affected
by introducing this guy w,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.320
this weighting matrix or the
c equal w transport w?

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.020
Well, here was the picture
from last time.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.390
A right angle picture.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.810
This was a right triangle.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:22.050
This line was perpendicular
to that plane,

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.500
but not anymore now.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:31.440
The second one it's a
tranpose ce is zero.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.380
That's still a line, but it's
not any longer perpendicular

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.010
to the -- this is still
all the au's.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.600
This plane is still the column
space of all the au's.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:54.780
We have the same b, but you see
the problem is it lost its

00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:00.850
90 degree angle, because
the projection is now a

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.860
projection, it's now an oblique

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.990
projection, it's slanted.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:12.360
This is the best au, and if I
occasionally keep up-to-date

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.190
I'll put that uw there.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.800
There's still an error e, and
this is still a parallelogram

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.340
but it's not a rectangle
anymore.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.620
Forgive my enthusiasm.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.400
I'm sort of happy that the
picture and the algebra both

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.230
come out so neatly.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:41.690
I totally agree that at this
point I'm asking you to follow

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:47.930
a model without giving you an
application, and that's one

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:53.910
reason I threw in this mention
of a specific application that

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.840
came from somewhere else.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.850
But this is the picture there.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:07.280
So I'll say one more word
about the picture.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.790
I said that we lost
the right angle.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.110
We lost perpendicularity,
and, of course,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.360
literally speaking we did.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:25.870
This is no longer -- this is
not a right angle anymore.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.870
This is not a right
angle anymore.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.220
It's not a right angle in the
usual meaning of right angles.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:48.540
It is a right angle in the
inner product that's

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.660
associated with c.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.235
In other words, right
angles here mean x

00:22:52.235 --> 00:22:55.870
transpose y equals zero.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.220
That's the idea of a right
angle, right? x perpendicular

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.720
to y, and they have different
letters here.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:10.870
Now over here I still have
perpendicular, but I don't --

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.060
this is not the right inner
product anymore.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:19.050
It should be a weighted inner
product, weighted with this c

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.600
in the middle.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:26.660
So that's really what I
mean by c orthogonal.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.560
Maybe I'll put those
words down.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.270
So this weighted thing is -- if
I can squeeze it, I doubt

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:40.270
if I can -- is c orthogonality,
weighted

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.670
orthogonality.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.250
So let me circle the
whole thing.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.500
The c is the w tranpose w.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:53.270
Just to say that we aren't
giving up on dot products and

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.520
perpendiculars and good
equations, we're just changing

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:04.240
them by inserting c every
time in a product.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.250
What it means is that this is
the natural inner product for

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.590
the particular problem.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.230
This is the natural inner
product for Euclid, right?

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.720
But then from some specific
application like this one or a

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.140
million others, they have
their own natural inner

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.900
product, and the inner product
for that particular problem

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:33.030
would be one of these guys with
some kind of a matrix c

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.410
showing up.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:41.270
So least squares and weighted
least squares, that's my

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.600
example one.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.200
Now I'd like to give a second
example, a more mechanic --

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.280
will come closer to mechanics.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:59.030
Because this is least squares,
statistics, algebra.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.360
But let me put on the
middle board an

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.170
application out of mechanics.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:13.930
It will be, say, I'll make it
small and just a couple of

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:23.750
springs with a mass between them
and fixed at both ends.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.600
So this spring extends
by some amount.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.380
This spring extends
by some amount.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.580
There's a force on this mass.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.130
So there's a force on there
mass, maybe just gravity, f.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:52.220
That's the external force from
the mass of that's here in

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.200
between the springs.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:02.090
Then also acting on that
mass are spring forces.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.130
This spring is pulling
it up, right?

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.110
There's a spring force, w1.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.330
Here, do you want
me to draw --

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.670
really which direction
is this?

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:26.810
I'm going to draw it this way
just to show the w2 drawn that

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:33.070
way would actually be negative,
because I think that

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.550
this spring would get
compressed, right -- this mass

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.090
is pushing it down.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.310
This spring would be
under compression.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.040
It would be pushing
the mass back up.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.440
So the w2 in that picture
would be negative.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.880
So this w1 will actually be
positive and go the way the

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.240
arrow is showing.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.040
This w2 would actually be
negative and go not that way

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.400
the arrow is showing.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:10.850
But what's the -- oh, what
equations have we got then?

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.070
What's our optimization
problem?

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.470
Well actually, we
have a choice.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:20.270
We could work with equations,
period.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.870
Actually, one of the equations
is pretty obvious.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.700
This mass is an equilibrium.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:30.940
So w1 is equal to w2 plus s.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.130
So it doesn't move.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.660
Or you might prefer me to write
it, I would rather write

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:44.100
it, with w's on one side and
source terms on the other.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:53.410
So that's the equilibrium
equation.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.760
So what decides, we want to know
what these w's are, and

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.920
these springs are extended.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.400
So that first spring is expanded
by an amount e1, and

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.230
this second spring is extended
by an amount e2.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:16.310
Stretched or compressed.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.360
e1 is probably going to be
positive here -- that spring's

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.820
going to be stretched.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.200
This spring is going to be
compressed, so that e2 is

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.710
probably going to be negative.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.620
What's the mechanics here?

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.320
Well, I can state it two
ways, as I said.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.750
I can state the mechanics in
terms of equations -- force

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.810
and stretching elastic
constant.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:48.990
That's how we did it in the
first semester, 18085.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.890
It's a little clearer because
simple equation

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.840
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:02.870
Or I can state the problem as
a minimization of energy.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.520
That's what I want to
do today in 1806.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.320
So I want to minimize 8.6.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.980
I want to minimize
the total energy.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:20.920
The energy in these springs.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:34.650
Subject to the constraint --
this constraint, equilibrium.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.100
So that's the optimization
statement of

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:46.610
the mechanical problem.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.650
Well, I guess all that
remains is -- well,

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:55.910
I guess what remains?

00:29:55.910 --> 00:30:01.670
First of all, I need an
expression for this energy.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:06.520
If the springs are governed by
Hooke's law, then it'll be

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.400
pretty simple.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.050
If they're real springs that
don't quite obey Hooke's law

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:17.010
then there'll be none -- no,
there'll be fourth degree,

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:21.190
sixth degree , whatever,
terms in the energy.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.110
It's like the energy in the
first spring plus the energy

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.970
in the second spring, anyway.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:33.960
e in the first spring, and the
energy in a second spring,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.170
and, of course, the two springs
could have different

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:37.420
spring constants.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.330
So those e's --

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:50.570
I'll make life easy in solving,
if I choose Hooke's

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:54.930
law, if I choose the energy
to be just a square.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:03.500
The constraint is linear, so
that'll be the model problem.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:09.850
And actually, that'll be the
kind of problem I've got here.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:19.740
One reason for introducing a
new example was to get some

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:26.770
mechanics into the lecture,
but also to get a problem

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:33.160
where we're doing a minimization
but we've got a

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.670
condition on the w's.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:42.090
The question is how do
you find a minimum?

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.170
You can't just set derivatives
of the energy to zero.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.520
You would discover w1 equal
w2 equals zero.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.770
Nothing happening.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.680
That would be the minimum.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:57.900
But that minimum is ruled out,
that solution is ruled out

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.340
because we have this
constraint.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.920
We've got to balance
the external force.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.320
So this is the question and
you'll maybe have met this

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:15.870
question in other courses,
but it's essential.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.670
How do you deal with minimizing
when there's a

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.690
constraint?

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:26.520
I guess in some way we
had it over here.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.450
We were minimizing something --
well, the minimum would be,

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.480
take u equal u knot.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:38.660
But no, there was a constraint
that u had to satisfy a

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:43.240
certain equilibrium equation.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.780
Here it was a differential
equation so that problem is a

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:52.280
little harder than this one
where the equation is just

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.690
discrete, one simple equation.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.080
So how are you going to do it?

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:05.910
Well, actually the quickest way
would be -- that's such an

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:12.040
easy constraint that I could
say hey, w2 is w1 minus f.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.060
So I could just, if I wanted to
really like shortcut this

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:21.170
whole lecture, I could say
well, w2 is w1 minus f.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.440
Now I've accounted for
the constraint.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.560
I've removed w2 from
the problem.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.980
I have a minimization, an
ordinary minimization with an

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.240
unknown w1.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.410
I take the derivative.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:40.230
I solve derivative
equals zero.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.610
I find w1, then I go back,
I get that w2.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:44.860
That's the fast way.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.450
Of course, gets the
right answer.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.720
But there's another way
that in the end

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.980
turns out to be better.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.610
It's not necessarily better for
this simple problem, but

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:08.450
it's better for the general
approach to constrained

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:09.780
optimization.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:16.320
So I'm going to not do the
simple deal of solving for w2,

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.680
but I'm going to keep the
constraint around.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.900
It's the idea of Lagrange
multipliers.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:30.550
You've heard those words and
probably seen it happen.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.570
So what is Lagrange
multiplier?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.650
What is Lagrange's idea?

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:41.540
Lagrange's idea is he
constructed a function of w,

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:47.230
which is this to work with,
which is the same energy.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.660
But he's going to include
a multiplier.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.890
Now the next question is what
letter shall I use for that

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:57.260
multiplier, Lagrange's
multiplier.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:02.840
Books on optimization often
call it Lambda --

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.560
Lambda's sort of like
for Lagrange.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:11.410
So, Lagrange obviously wasn't
Greek, but anyway -- close.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:17.780
Lambda for us always
means eigenvalue --

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.490
For me always means
eigenvalue.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.840
So I'm reluctant
to use Lambda.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:30.100
Sometimes in books on economics,
which is we're

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:37.610
doing this all the time, the
multiplier's called pi because

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.570
it turns out to be a price.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:50.350
But let me use u for the
Lagrange multiplier.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:56.100
So that'll be the Lagrange
multiplier.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.420
So what do I do with it?

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.340
I multiply this equation by u
and I build it in to this.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.040
So this thing is this part --

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.590
I'll just copy that down there
-- plus or minus, depending

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:16.510
what I want, depending which
sign I want to end up with, u

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:21.980
the multiplier times the
constraint -- w1 minus w2 --

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.210
let me put it like that.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.140
So the constraint is that
this should be zero.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.170
So you can say I haven't
added anything.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.770
I've added zero.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:41.840
But that will only be true
at the end when I have a

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.650
specific w1 and w2.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:48.700
Right now what I've done is I've
built in the constraint

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.430
into the function.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:58.940
Lagrange's brilliant idea was
that now I've got a function

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.960
that I can -- my derivatives
I can take.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.940
I could set the derivatives to
zero. dldw1 is going to be

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:14.420
zero. dldw2 is going
to be zero.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:20.310
And dldu is going to be zero.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.540
So we got now three equations,
three unknown.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.760
Instead of going from two
to one, we've gone

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.360
from two up to three.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.680
But it's so much more systematic
that it's the right

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.470
thing to do.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.580
What is this last equation?

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.130
What's the u derivative
of an expression?

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:48.260
Well, u doesn't appear here, the
derivative is just w1 --

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:54.670
this just leads us to w1 minus
w2 minus f, which is the

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.000
constraint that we wanted.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:05.740
So the constraint is showing
up as this equation.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.910
Just the way the constraint
showed up as

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.160
this equation here.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:24.900
I guess what I want to say is
when I wrote this down, when

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:30.580
we did this first example,
I didn't say here's the

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.820
constraint.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:37.450
I mean that equation kind of
came out from the normal

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.700
equations here.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:48.950
So what we're doing new here is
the constraint equation is

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.290
sort of part of the mechanics
and we're asking the question

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.280
how do I deal with it.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.950
Here it came out of the
geometry, so it wasn't there

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.280
at the beginning so we didn't
have to say how do we deal

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.730
with this equation.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.620
It just emerged.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:11.220
Here it's really forced
on us right away.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.940
So anyway, we've still got to
figure out the derivatives of

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.730
those, and I guess I do have
to finally now say

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:24.560
what choice -- yeah.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.690
So this is --

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:36.210
what is this, the derivative
of e1 minus u.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.830
If I take the w1 derivative,
I've got the derivative of v1

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.300
with respect to w1.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.130
Then w1 doesn't appear there
but it appears here,

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.370
so it's minus u.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:55.110
This would be the derivative of
v2 with respect to w2, that

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:59.040
second spring minus --
oh maybe plus cu.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.140
Well, those are the
three equations.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:17.480
Let me move now to the linear
case, just so we see the

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.530
beautiful pattern.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:29.290
So if I make the equations
linear, what's the energy in

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:39.360
Hooke's law spring here if the
extension is e1 and if it

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.970
produces a force of w1, I want
to know what is this e1 here.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:48.590
So let me just remember
Hooke's law.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:53.840
I think Hooke's law would say
that -- well, there's some

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:59.520
elastic constant c1, so there's
a c1 and a c2 that

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.810
tell us how hard or soft
the springs are.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.890
So these are physical
constants.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.500
If I remember right,
the energy --

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.170
so I'm going to erase a little
here just to -- well no.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.410
So what is the energy in
that first spring?

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:31.650
You remember, there's a 1/2
of an c1 e1 squared.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:38.800
That's the energy in a spring
with constant c1 and the

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.050
stretch e1.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.770
But now I really want it not in
terms of e1, I want it in

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:53.470
terms of w1, just the
way I did here.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:54.870
I've got to do the
same thing here.

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:58.850
I want to get to w, because
the constraint

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.630
is in terms of w.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.820
What does Hooke's law say?

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:12.510
Hooke's law says w equals ce,
that's Hooke, Hooke's law.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.460
The fourth is the elastic
constant times the stretch.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:24.650
So in place of the e
I have w over c.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:32.310
So this is 1/2, e1 squared will
be w1 squared over c1

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.520
squared, and then a c1 cancels
-- that's what it looks like.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:45.390
I guess I'm certainly happy
to see that I'm

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.380
coming up with c inverse.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:52.320
This c is showing up in the
denominator, and that's

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.620
exactly the -- so this is what
I mean, this is what I want

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:07.880
for my energy is a 1/2, w1
squared over c1, and a 1/2, w2

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:16.820
squared over c2, and now I was
doing a minus sign because

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:21.580
that kind of goes well with
mechanics where a plus sign

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:26.720
would go well with all the
other applications.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.650
So now I've got explicit
energy.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:35.400
So now I can say what
this thing really --

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.860
the derivative with
respect to w1.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.130
OK.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:44.740
The derivative with respect
to w1 is just w1 over c1.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.770
Is that what I'm getting?

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.520
This is zero.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:58.320
This says w2 over c2 minus u is
zero, and this one says w1

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.440
minus w2 equals f.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.200
Our three equations.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:13.885
Yes, so I will help kill these
equal signs and just look at

00:44:13.885 --> 00:44:17.740
-- oh, that's a plus.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:32.170
We've got our saddle
point matrix again.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.950
That's the nice thing here.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:40.410
This is a problem with a 3 x 3
matrix, with three unknowns,

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.760
w1, w2, and u.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.320
With right hand side
zero zero and f.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.030
With what matrix?

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:06.110
That looks like a 1 over
c1, zero and a minus 1.

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:12.640
This looks like zero, a 1
over c2 and a plus 1.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.240
This looks like -- oh,
wait a minute.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.880
I don't want this.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.870
w1 minus w2 equal f.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.130
I can live with 1 and minus 1
there, but it's not really

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.040
what I wanted.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.140
I wanted the signs to -- you
know what I want here.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.550
I want the transpose of that to
be here, and zero to be in

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.330
that block.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:50.200
So that's what my saddle point
matrix would look like.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:55.460
Well, let me just say that
I could live with either.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:46:03.450
I was aiming for this one
because it's symmetric.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:09.180
But a lot of people would rather
have the opposite signs

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:16.140
and have the 1 minus 1 there.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:22.190
I don't care which sign
f has, of course.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:25.640
Some people these days are
liking this form better

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.570
because then it has a symmetric
part and an

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:29.820
anti-symmetric part.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.640
I mean the thing is at some
point we're going to get

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.950
problems like this with
thousands of unknowns, and

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.690
we're going to think how
do we solve them

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.640
and maybe some iteration.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:53.750
So we might want the matrix to
be symmetric but indefinite,

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:59.040
or we might want a
positive-definite symmetric

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.360
part and an anti-symmetric
part.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:07.840
What we can't have is positive
definite-symmetric.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.880
That's like asking for what
can't happen here.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.600
The combination of the problems
is producing a saddle

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:27.650
point and we can play with that
sign, but we can't make

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:33.140
that zero something -- oh,
we could actually.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:36.970
What I was going to say is we
can't make that zero something

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.520
different, but you could.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.260
That would be a possible
way to --

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.010
it's another way people thought
of of solving these

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:56.240
problems is artificially throw
in a big number there, or even

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:02.590
a small number, and push things
towards positive.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:10.910
Anyway, my purpose today is
essentially completed, that

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:17.520
we're getting out of physical
application after I linearized

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.210
and it became a linear equation
and it had that

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:22.380
saddle point form.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:26.800
So, saddle point form here,
saddle point form here, saddle

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.120
point forms everywhere.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.940
I mean we'll have the saddle
point forms for differential

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:36.390
equations, as well as for
matrix equations.

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:46.850
So those are the examples to
sort of hang on to, and it's

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:53.350
section 7.1 that has
a big part of it.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.680
Ah --

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.980
I always have one last
thing to say.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.440
What's the meaning of u?

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.070
So, u was a Lagrange
multiplier.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:09.760
Lagrange just like helped us out
by saying OK, there was a

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.430
constraint by using one
of my multipliers.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:17.140
But the point is that
the multiplier

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.570
always has a real meaning.

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:24.980
I mention prices before.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.950
Here, what's the meaning of u?

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.390
What's the physical meaning of
the Lagrange multiplier.

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:36.220
It turns out to be the
displacement of the math.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:40.040
It's the dual variable,
so it always has some

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.740
interpretation.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:46.510
In this case, with mechanics
it's the amount, the mass

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:51.810
comes down when the
force asks.

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:57.480
What's more, it also has a
derivative interpretation.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.210
Turns out --

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:05.040
I'll just put turns out that
the Lagrange multiplier u

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:14.640
turns out to be the derivative
of the minimum energy in the

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:20.640
system with respect to
the source term.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.710
It's the sensitivity of
the problem somehow.

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.620
I'll just use sensitivity.

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:32.140
You often want to know --

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.380
it's actually this quantity
that we need over there.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:39.720
We want to know how much does
the answer depend on the

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.970
source, and that's what the
Lagrange multiplier tells us.

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:51.420
So, if I computed the solution
here, so the notes do this --

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.850
maybe I'll leave it
for the notes.

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:57.580
The notes solve this
little problem.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.820
That's easy to do.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:05.870
They figure out what the energy
is in the springs.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:09.800
It depends on the right hand
side, f, which is just a

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.150
number here.

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:14.330
The energy turns out
to be quadratic.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:18.830
You can take its derivative and
you find out that it's u.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:25.630
So that Lagrange multiplier,
that's really a key message,

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:28.850
is an important quantity
in itself.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.310
Here it happens to mean
displacement, which is

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:36.360
obviously crucial quantity, and
in general it tells us the

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:41.010
change in the minimum energy
with respect to a

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:44.480
change in the input.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:49.670
That sensitivity's a natural
word to use for that.

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.820
So that's a final word about --
well, a near to final word

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.000
about Lagrange multipliers.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.140
So I'll see you Wednesday and
by that time I'll know more

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:07.450
about the projects and we'll
be moving onward with

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:08.650
optimization.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:08.980
Good.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.230
Thanks.
