Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today, well,

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.890
stories about confrontation row down, base off smackdown.

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.470
We're calling it what's left when you're right. And now at last a.

4
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:13.790
That title will make sense.

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.630
I think it will cause now we have a story about a fight that starts in a cage,

6
00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:19.760
spills over into the human species as a whole.

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.650
It turns out in the end to be nested inside the brains of every single one of

8
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:28.350
us. Oh. And that story comes from our producer pet Walters. Okay,

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
<v 1>I'll start it for me with this essay that I read by this guy named Jonathan</v>

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
Ghoshal. I'm a writer and a fighter. Dad, bad man.

11
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.200
So a few years ago, I'm an English teacher.

12
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.510
I'm sitting in an English department. I'm sitting in the cubicle.

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.940
He was a teacher at a small college outside Pittsburgh.

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.630
And at the time Jonathan had written some articles, even a couple of books,

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.330
but I was still an adjunct, lowly adjunct,

16
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:55.530
you know the academic equivalent of cheap migrant labor.

17
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.840
I'm pretty low on the totem pole.

18
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:02.820
So I was sitting there in the cubicle that I share with other adjuncts,

19
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.990
just kind of feeling miserable.

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.530
I'm down about my job and then catch a glimpse of movement through the window

21
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.540
and I go to the window and I look out and nurses that across the street where

22
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.010
there used to be a car parts store.

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.530
This new business had opened up a mixed martial arts gym.

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.810
<v 0>This cage fighting stuff that you see on TV that they're like the kind where you</v>

25
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:29.070
can wait where anything goes. Like that guy or anything goes. Yeah, punching,

26
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.590
kicking mean ground and power.

27
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.100
You can climb on top of the guy and punch him in the face until he, he goes out.

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.850
<v 1>Does that stuff is just too raw? Well,</v>

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.890
I hadn't been watching it a guiltily and very much in the closet for about 15

30
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:46.760
years. I knew it was wrong. I watched it in the way that most men watch porn.

31
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.070
You know, my wife would walk into the room and I was watching.

32
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:52.110
I really quickly turned the channel then out there they were.

33
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.200
<v 0>He's huge muscle bound dudes in the picture window right across the street there</v>

34
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.430
in the cage, right. And each other they're tackling,

35
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.490
they're fighting on the ground. And as he watches them, day after day,

36
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.383
I start to envy them.

37
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.353
<v 2>No,</v>

38
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.310
<v 1>I am the bravery and the way they just seemed so alive while I was in my cube</v>

39
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.510
rotting. And so one day he decides, uh, I decided to do it.

40
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.660
I'm going over there. No, I'm not a tough guy. I'm an English professor.

41
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:23.290
I'd never been in a fight before, but I wanted to try to do a brave thing.

42
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.010
Did you, did you tell your wife? Yeah. Yeah. Um,

43
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.950
and what was your Western reaction? This is almost perfect. Paraphrase.

44
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.990
He said you will be killed. You have no skills. Yeah. It kinda hurts.

45
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.990
It hurts to find out. Your wife has no respect for you're fighting prowess,

46
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.120
but that doesn't stop him. No, that's training sparring with other beginners.

47
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.820
And this is how it all goes down. Um,

48
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.280
maybe I'm four months into my training,

49
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:52.990
let's say I'm about four months into my training and I feel like I'm starting to

50
00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:53.920
get the hang of things.

51
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.440
I'm starting to feel more confident and I'm doing pretty well against the other

52
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:59.260
beginners in, in, in the sort of the weaker guys in the gym. Oh.

53
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.860
So one day I go into the gym and in turns I'm going to,

54
00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:03.640
I'm going to spar this guy named named nick.

55
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.880
And I'm a little concerned about it because he's been at the gym longer than me,

56
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.690
but I'm not all that concerned because I've watched nick,

57
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.680
we all watch each other in the gym and he's just not an athlete.

58
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.060
He even says this himself. He's, he's a kind of a Klutzy guy. Uh,

59
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.950
he's awkward in his movements, a little bit, a little bit stiff.

60
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.720
And I felt that just like athletically, I stacked up very well with him.

61
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:29.830
I was faster than him. I thought I'd get around better. And so, you know,

62
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.210
we'd go into the cage and the bell rings and you know,

63
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.840
we go to the center of the cage and we engage and again,

64
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.841
I'm feeling confident and then he punches me hard in the face.

65
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.260
Then you hit them again.

66
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.600
<v 3>The punches keep coming. Jab, Cross, Jab, Cross, Jab, cross, Hook. He doesn't,</v>

67
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.420
Bobby,

68
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.850
<v 1>he doesn't weave. He doesn't dance. He's right there in front of you.</v>

69
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:52.770
You should be able to hit him. But I can't.

70
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.170
He's as hammering me. Finally the Bell Rings and uh,

71
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.170
I go collapse in one of the chairs and my headache is already thudding in my

72
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:08.130
brain. And I say to myself, well, that seals it. The, the,

73
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:11.550
the 40 Raymond hypothesis has to be true.

74
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.170
40 Raymond hypothesis has to be four 40. Oh,

75
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.330
the 40 Raymond. Yeah. So, okay, what's the right question?

76
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.340
That's 40 Raymond hypothesis. Okay.

77
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:30.000
So 40 and Raymond are these French researchers.

78
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.330
So before we get down to the two French researchers, you could say that Nick,

79
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.230
that Guy Jonathan,

80
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.620
<v 3>because the lefty, nick is a lefty.</v>

81
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.520
Jonathan is a righty in this conflict between lefties and righties.

82
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.210
It goes way back. Oh yeah, absolutely. Just ask

83
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.310
<v 0>David Wohlman. I'm an author and journalist in Portland, Oregon.</v>

84
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.960
You're right handed, right? No, I am very lefthanded like you wanted to kill me.

85
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.790
I was trying to, I was trying to get it out that way. Like if that man defends,

86
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.390
you know, against crime. David is a defender of lefties everywhere.

87
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.000
I am a strong lefthander.

88
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.990
If you look at the Edinburgh handedness inventory, I'm like a 10 out of 10.

89
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.360
I did it. I'm a very strong right hand. Like, uh,

90
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.450
I got all like a perfect score for right handedness. Okay,

91
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:15.840
well our friendship is over now, David, I kinda joking,

92
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.890
but he actually wrote this whole book called a lefthanded turn around the world

93
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.060
because growing up as a kid in a family of right handers,

94
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.600
David says he always felt a little different, or as his family used to put it,

95
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.860
you're special. And this is,

96
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:33.360
this is some little extra sprinkle of specialness in you. Luckily they're,

97
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.890
they're not, uh, you know,

98
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:37.800
they didn't grow up in the Middle Ages and think that I was cursed by the devil

99
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:42.210
and therefore I'm lefthanded because throughout the ages and pretty much

100
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:46.800
throughout every culture, uh, left-handers were perceived as evil and sinister.

101
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.190
In fact, the words industry itself is derived from a Latin word,

102
00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:54.360
which means on the left side and in English, when we say something is correct,

103
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.730
we say it's right. You know, in the Bible,

104
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.810
God always doing really nice and benevolent things with the right hand and not

105
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:01.910
so nice or benevolent things with the left hand,

106
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.770
everything left is all of these ugly or lesser or different or are worrisome.

107
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.750
And the presumption was that if this was not, um,

108
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.140
the result of a curse by it from the devil,

109
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.940
then this was the result of poor parenting or poor posture.

110
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.820
But we know now that now it's genetic.

111
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.060
When you do a genetic study and you look at parents, here's how it plays out.

112
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:27.980
If you have two right handed parents,

113
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.040
their chance of having a lefthander is about nine and a half percent.

114
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.550
If you have one ready one lefty parents, the odds do go up.

115
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.790
Now you've got 20% almost 20% chance then to south parents have a 26% chance of

116
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.010
delivering into the world at South Park.

117
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.920
<v 1>And if you add up those chances and look out across the entire human species,</v>

118
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.570
<v 0>we are about 90% right-handed. 10% lefthanded.</v>

119
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.940
<v 1>90% of people are right handers, which brings us back to Borean Raymond.</v>

120
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.970
So 40 in Raymond realize that left handedness is a sort of evolutionary mystery.

121
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.690
Jonathan says it's a mystery,

122
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.710
at least in part because lefthanded this seems to come with some disadvantages.

123
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.830
It's associated with all these negative health outcomes and I actually wrote a

124
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:14.600
few of them down. Higher risk of schizophrenia, immune deficiency,

125
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.070
epilepsy, learning disabilities, spinal deformity, ADHD, alcoholism,

126
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.580
dyslexia, psychopathy room's disease. It's not even a complete list.

127
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.360
So weight lefties have a higher incidents of all of these things. Yeah,

128
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.890
significant. How much higher? Like a TD bit higher or any bit teeny. Vinny,

129
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.720
bit like a really teeny bit. But evolution works on Teeny bits, right?

130
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.200
So if there are significant health costs of being left handed,

131
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:40.490
why hasn't natural selection trimmed away? Why do we still have lefties at all?

132
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.850
That's the puzzle and the 14 Raymond hypothesis is that we still have lefties in

133
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.050
the world because they have an advantage in one arena. Combat,

134
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.860
which is what Jonathan realized in the ring with Nick,

135
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.140
you get very used to fighting right handers.

136
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.170
You get used to where the punches are coming from and then you face the

137
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.640
left-hander and they do everything backwards and you have to develop basically a

138
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:08.500
whole different approach to, to fighting. And if you go back

139
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.170
<v 4>to a time when wars were won and lost largely because of hand to hand combat,</v>

140
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.640
whether with fifths or spears or with clubs or whatever,

141
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.690
maybe the ancient lefties, like nick had a little edge

142
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:28.190
<v 1>maybe to survival advantage of battling lefthanded washed out those survival</v>

143
00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:32.400
costs associated with being lefthanded

144
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.820
14 Raymond came up with this prediction of prediction based on their idea that

145
00:08:38.821 --> 00:08:41.520
if lefthanded this is somehow linked to fighting prowess,

146
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.110
then wherever they go in the world,

147
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.970
they will find that the most violence societies have the highest proportion of

148
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.780
lefties. How would they define violent? Like over time,

149
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:56.280
the number of wars or why? Rumors of wars, homicide, that kind of thing. I see.

150
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.660
Huh. So they dug up some data on violent and left handedness in three different

151
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:01.860
tribal societies.

152
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.490
Then they went out and did their own field research and five other groups and

153
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.810
they find this beautiful correlation. The least violence,

154
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.770
violence society in their sample had 3% lefthanders.

155
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.240
The most violence societies in their sample tribal societies in New Guinea that

156
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:23.241
were notoriously violent had rates of left handedness a about 25 or 30% Whoa,

157
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.260
whoa. Yeah. She was a sweet,

158
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.410
credible many lefties and yes, as us I guess. Yeah. Wow.

159
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.540
So seem to be true. Case closed.

160
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.210
<v 5>No, no. Here's the thing.</v>

161
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.700
That tribe from Papa New Guinea that had three times as many lefties as you

162
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.410
would expect. That was data that they looked up in the library,

163
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.740
but when some other scientists actually went in the field and checked it,

164
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.790
they found

165
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.790
<v 1>no evidence that lefties were overrepresented in his tribe.</v>

166
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.920
It wasn't heavily lefty. According to this study.

167
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:01.890
They just didn't find any evidence that lefties were overrepresented.

168
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.580
I am disappointed because this was a very cool idea. I was disappointed too,

169
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.100
but I think we can salvage it.

170
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.520
<v 0>Did the original user,</v>

171
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.130
Jonathan had an idea of this hour after nick knocked him out.

172
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:17.190
He thought maybe looking at real battles, real violence.

173
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.090
Maybe that was where Valerie and Raymond went wrong. Maybe left.

174
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.330
The jeans are maintained more through success in the play,

175
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:31.410
fights of sports, then an actual no holds barred violence.

176
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.290
Maybe it's about sports, not war. In fact,

177
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:36.810
actually lefties have long been known for doing better at the,

178
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.830
at all kinds of different sports. Tennis, boxing, baseball.

179
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.840
We look at a Northwestern study, Chad,

180
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.870
which found that 50% of the top players in baseball did highest rbis.

181
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.060
The best pitchers weight, 50% are lefties. Yes.

182
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.260
And you see the same over representation of lefties in any sport that's got a

183
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:57.750
one on one component, you know, a face off kind of thing.

184
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.660
The only scientific question you need to ask is

185
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.540
<v 1>do athletes have more children? Oh wait a second.</v>

186
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:09.770
So you're saying all those lefty pitchers that are really good and that screw up

187
00:11:09.771 --> 00:11:13.680
the right handed hitters. Maybe they're having so many kids. Yeah.

188
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.780
And that's what keeps that 10% 10% well, sorta. Yeah. So,

189
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.200
but we can check this. We can have lefty Gomez, New York.

190
00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:24.030
Giant left-hander has 16 children.

191
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.350
So people [inaudible] people have actually looked into this, you know,

192
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:31.850
they've looked into it to do athletes do better with the ladies and the evidence

193
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:33.980
is pretty strong that they do a [inaudible].

194
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:38.090
You went to [inaudible] high school and college, I noticed that like Duh Duh,

195
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.010
you don't need a scientist to tell you that and so,

196
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.180
but you have to count your babies count the babies or you,

197
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.110
they counting the babies early or you can or you count the reproductive

198
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:47.900
opportunities. What do you mean? Like how many dates they go on? Yeah, exactly.

199
00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:50.270
How many sex partners they have. Why not count the babies?

200
00:11:50.271 --> 00:11:51.370
You don't want to count the baby? Well,

201
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.280
because we live in an era of birth control now, so it's, it's a,

202
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.420
in the environments in which these traits evolved, there was,

203
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.400
there were no reliable means of birth control.

204
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.630
So we use reproductive opportunities as a proxy for reproductive rights.

205
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.910
<v 0>And then, okay, it's starting to make sense to me now.</v>

206
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.840
How could I lovingly say that sounds like total garbage.

207
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.560
You think David would love this idea? He's the lover of lefties.

208
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:18.520
But now it's just, there's too much biology at play here. Uh,

209
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:23.440
so and too much ancient prehistoric biology at play for this to matter as much

210
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:25.950
as your dear English professor friend wants it to matter.

211
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.340
<v 1>But here's, here's the thing,</v>

212
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.080
whether or not this hasn't been proven scientifically, personally,

213
00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:32.920
I know it's true.

214
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.110
I know it's true because I experienced it.

215
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.290
I know it's true in a way that statistics can't touch. You know,

216
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:42.820
I know it's true from being in that cage,

217
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.240
having the undoubtable truth just pounded into my brain literally by my friend

218
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.720
neck. You know, I, I know it's true.

219
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.520
<v 0>Yeah. I mean it's so fun.</v>

220
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.850
These kind of things are so fun cause it's so easy, right? I mean,

221
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.950
who doesn't love an easy answer,

222
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:05.330
but it seems so far fetched and maybe that makes me a little bit of a wet

223
00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:09.380
blanket. But after this year, plus investigating this topic,

224
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.870
David says about halfway through writing his book,

225
00:13:11.871 --> 00:13:14.630
this whole handedness puzzle kind of flipped for him.

226
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.210
Instead of worrying about why lefties have stuck around,

227
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.330
he started to wonder about that 90 10 number cut.

228
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:25.160
Like why inhumans de lefties only make up 10% of the population when in pretty

229
00:13:25.161 --> 00:13:30.050
much every other creature on earth, this asymmetry is random. In other words,

230
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.280
it's a coin flip.

231
00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:36.140
Whether a monkey in South America is going to be left or right handed.

232
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.490
Several studies have shown that it's about 50 50 in cats. See Mister for dogs,

233
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.640
people have looked at mice, toads, various kinds of birds,

234
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.980
and all of them have a pretty even split.

235
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:51.050
It looks like what is unique to humanity is the 90 10 so how did we end up at 90

236
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:54.600
10 well,

237
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.820
one of the strongest theories for the origins of handedness hooks hen is onto

238
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.180
left hemisphere dominance for speech. The idea says,

239
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.590
David is that humans are way back in the day.

240
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:12.580
So these would be like early humans. Prehuman ancestors were 50 50 so that is,

241
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:14.850
they were 50% righty. They were 50% left.

242
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.510
You like all the other animals in the forest.

243
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.540
So the things that our brains were doing back then were also even on both sides.

244
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.530
So the motor cortex on the left controlled the right hand as it still does.

245
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.070
The motor control on the right controls the left hand as it still does,

246
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.910
but then at some point in our evolutionary history,

247
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.310
the language begins to develop and there was this shift in brain organization.

248
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.870
<v 6>Yeah, the part of the brain that controls speech,</v>

249
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.400
I don't know why this happened,

250
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.460
but it began to move over to the left side of our brain according to one theory.

251
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.000
That shift ended up making the left side of our brains better at motor control.

252
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:55.130
Because think about what speech is. I'm going to say,

253
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.900
let's pick a pair of pickled peppers, my tongue,

254
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.790
my lips, my teeth are all in a middly of complex motion there.

255
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.070
That is all about motor control.

256
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:10.850
So the left side of my brain is doing that and it's getting bigger and stronger.

257
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.910
As the species gets more and more speechy,

258
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.630
it gets more and more left brain or right hand.

259
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.000
As you're saying that a speech grows on our left side.

260
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:24.710
The motor cortex grows on our left side and since the left motor cortex controls

261
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.593
do you

262
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.500
<v 0>the end result is a bias to the right. Yes, but weirdly buried, similar,</v>

263
00:15:31.501 --> 00:15:36.501
deep in our DNA still is this gene that confers the chance to become a lefthand

264
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.770
in which results in about 10% of the population being lefties.

265
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.950
But they're not dwindling though. They just seem to stick there. Well,

266
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.580
they don't seem to be dwindling in the, in the blink of an eye that is not I'm,

267
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.240
we've been looking at dwindling, but do you know what I mean?

268
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.020
Or whatever. Maybe there's just, you know,

269
00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:59.560
you're just still around because you're like the vestige of, of,

270
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.270
of what we used to be. Thank you. Thank you. I'll call my,

271
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.290
as soon as my kids are old enough to, I'll tell them that the daddy's a vestige,

272
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.170
which sort of brought us back to our original question,

273
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.220
like why aren't lefties dwindling? And when we pushed David,

274
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.690
here's what he finally said.

275
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.490
I would argue because I'm a lefty and a strong lefthanders. So you know, um,

276
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.330
take many, many grains of salt. You're arguing from pride. We understand,

277
00:16:25.331 --> 00:16:28.480
of course. No, I will pride in a little bit of research,

278
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.510
but I would argue that a splash of diversity within the brain as far as brain

279
00:16:36.131 --> 00:16:41.131
organization has had a cumulative beneficial effect for our species.

280
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.630
Now, if you, how exactly does he mean? Well, because if conditions on earth,

281
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:50.230
true change radically nature just likes to have a little variety in the,

282
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.153
in the gene pool.

283
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.050
So if everyone's doing really well with one set of genes and the situation

284
00:16:56.051 --> 00:16:59.200
changes drastically, right? You don't want everybody to get sick and die.

285
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:03.520
So in variety there is a slightly heightened chance of survival.

286
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.120
I think it's a subtle advantage to the population, but I think,

287
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.190
I think there's a beauty to it. Nevertheless,

288
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.720
lefties are coming at the world from a slightly different angle.

289
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.801
But this puts,

290
00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:19.120
David didn't kind of a weird spot because even if lefties don't dwindle away,

291
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:22.990
if sports are brain diversity or some other random reason keeps them around,

292
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.590
they'll always be the few. You know as I said in the book,

293
00:17:26.591 --> 00:17:30.970
I don't think this is caused for for the next March on Washington, but,

294
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.260
but lefties are their own special minority group.

295
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:41.010
Unless you are Eric [inaudible] Coco.

296
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.490
He was, yes. Somehow I knew you guys would go for the parrot.

297
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.043
As it turns out,

298
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.500
parrots seem to be I it's 90% left handed or left footed or left Claude left

299
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.130
talent, whatever. I just supposed to call it rubber band.

300
00:17:55.131 --> 00:17:59.280
Went to visit this artist named Hunt Sloan in boot rescues and a lot of parents

301
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.580
cockatiel whose name is Crayola and we tested 11 of his parents.

302
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.940
So they told us that their test that they've used before is he put a piece of

303
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:13.440
food on the table or in a platform and whichever foot they pick it up here is

304
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:17.610
their preferred foot. Well that makes sense. Right. Would walk up to Kay,

305
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.330
this is Clive. Hi Greet.

306
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:26.390
The parents want to give you a potato chip present with our treat and then we

307
00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:30.540
would wait to see what he did. I lefty, we never, we have a left.

308
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.920
They went up to another cage and if the same thing I left it left, left foot,

309
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.570
another left g and then the end left again.

310
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.210
The final count was, okay, let's do our final tally with what?

311
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:47.130
Nine nine two two two one nine lefty, two righty.

312
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.910
And one went both ways. Most of that is close to 90% close to. Yes.

313
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.940
If David was a parent would have felt right at home.

314
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.910
But why do you suppose parents are 90 to 10 the other way? I have no idea.

315
00:18:57.911 --> 00:18:59.900
I don't think anybody knows that. Uh,

316
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.473
on the other.

317
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.710
<v 4>Hi. Thank you</v>

318
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.860
Ronnie. Hi.

319
00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:23.060
<v 0>Where's this? We can say as me, him,</v>

320
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:29.080
nothing there on there. Before we close, we have a little sad news.

321
00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.090
Our producer, Pat Walters,

322
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.430
carrot Walters will be moving on moving to the left coast after the show.

323
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.410
If you listened to this show over the last few years,

324
00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:43.411
you've heard all kinds of wonderfully strange and diverse tails.

325
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.760
Yeah.

326
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.800
It'd taken pat to all kinds of different places and put them in all kinds of

327
00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:52.230
different wounds. And you hate to lose the rainbow, you know, he is one himself.

328
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.520
Definitely. Definitely Pat, we love you. We wish you the very,

329
00:19:55.521 --> 00:19:56.560
very best out there.
