00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:04.938
These are questions that I got here from
the North Carolina State University paper.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:07.188
I'm just going to answer
them in video format so

00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:10.948
everyone can enjoy them. If
they find them enjoyable.

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:13.942
Question number 1. Where
did you get the idea of

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:17.355
making such a website? What
was the inspiration or reason?

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:22.210
Forgive me if any of you
are tired of hearing this

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.204
story. It really did start
with my cousins [Naudia]

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:26.607
in particular. In 2004
I started tutoring her,

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:28.950
and really everything that
is the Khan Academy now,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.956
or at least a lot of it's initials stages,

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:34.352
were out of me as a tutor
needing tools to help my cousin.

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:37.737
The first software, it was actually
written before the first video,

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:40.205
I started working on it
2005. It was a way to

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:42.543
give my cousins, [Naudia]
being one of them, and then

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:46.606
her brothers practice,
for me to keep track of

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:50.536
what they were doing, and
for me to be able to not

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:52.208
use the time that we had on the phone,

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:55.873
kind of doing all of
the practice problems.

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:56.888
They can do it own their own.

00:00:56.888 --> 00:00:58.142
Then I started making the videos, so

00:00:58.142 --> 00:01:00.150
they could pause and
repeat and watch a lot

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.803
of the stuff at their own
pace at their own time.

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:06.728
We could use our in-person
time, is was to remote tutoring,

00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:09.062
but our in-person time
to do the exact problems

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:12.732
they were having. It's
been a very organic process

00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:15.508
all the you get to last
year where we got our

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:19.266
major funding. Once again
it was what were our needs

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.598
of the students that we're
hearing from on YouTube

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:24.486
that are messaging us.
Even this whole notion

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:26.805
of what's happening and
[unintelligible] and the pilots

00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:29.376
and the other pilots were
starting in this year.

00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:32.378
We kind of thought, that
eventually, we could us it

00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:34.469
in schools, but it was
one of these opportunities

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.459
that just happened through happenstance.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:38.965
Where someone reached
out to us and hey, what

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.944
would you do if you could do
anything with a 5th grade classroom?

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:43.376
We told them, and that's
what we've been doing.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.858
There's the inspiration or the reason.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:49.798
I guess I can give credit to my cousins,

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:55.726
and a little bit to my
own ... when I was going

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:58.268
through schooling myself.
I did sometimes feel

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:01.022
frustrated that we
couldn't use class time in

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:03.364
a more interactive way,
or that we couldn't learn

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:07.435
at our own pace. It really
has been a very organic

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:10.196
and gradual process of
lairing on things that

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.799
seem to make sense, building
them, and seeing if they work.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.660
We actually think we're
still in the very early

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.659
stages of that process.
We have a long way to go,

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.597
and a lot more things
to experiment and test.

00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:25.182
Question number 2. Where do
you get all the videos from?

00:02:25.182 --> 00:02:28.269
The simple answer to this
first part of the question is,

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.796
we get them all from me
right now. I am the only

00:02:31.796 --> 00:02:34.944
faculty. I'm the only person
on the site right now.

00:02:34.944 --> 00:02:37.267
We have 2,500. I think
we're even pushing 2,600

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:40.730
videos right now. The
second part of the question.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.465
Are the coaches allowed to
upload their own personal videos?

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:46.796
Right now the coaches
are not allowed to upload

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:48.532
their own personal videos.
Obviously, they can

00:02:48.532 --> 00:02:50.942
tell students independently
at Khan Academy

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:53.368
they could watch those
videos. This is something

00:02:53.368 --> 00:02:56.731
we are very seriously
looking at. Not just coaches,

00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:00.729
we're very seriously
looking at a way for people

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.943
to create their own
Khan Academy experience

00:03:03.943 --> 00:03:06.024
on top of our platform.
That they could expose

00:03:06.024 --> 00:03:08.128
to their students or
to the world generally.

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:10.392
We hope they would expose
them to the world generally.

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:13.770
Right now, it's just an
engineering bottle-neck.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.000
We don't have the bandwidth
to do it, although

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.800
we think it could be a
really powerful thing.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.329
Closer to that, in terms
to where do we get all

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.876
the videos? This is something
that you expect to hear

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:26.462
a lot more from us soon.
Some people might have

00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:28.361
noticed that I have
started to do some videos

00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:30.407
experimenting with this
interview form factor,

00:03:30.407 --> 00:03:33.287
where I'm getting outside
experts. I'm there as well.

00:03:33.287 --> 00:03:36.803
I'm there as well talking
to them about some

00:03:36.803 --> 00:03:40.532
of these concepts, and them educating me.

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:43.801
You'll also see we're
bringing on some full-time

00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:46.135
faculty members in the humanities soon.

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:48.659
Who, I think have made
some tremendous videos.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.277
Their libraries are going
to be interrogated soon.

00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:53.931
I think people are going
to really enjoy it.

00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:56.669
The short answer, all
the videos right now are

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.532
from me. In the next few
months you're going to see

00:03:58.532 --> 00:04:01.368
some other very talented
teaches come into the mix

00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:03.870
that we've really found to be rock stars.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.032
You go out maybe another
year, year and a half

00:04:07.032 --> 00:04:10.067
I think you're going to
have ways for coaches to

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:13.063
create or just people
generally to create used

00:04:13.063 --> 00:04:15.443
Khan Academy's more
generalized learning platform.

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:18.332
It's an open question
on how much that becomes

00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:21.128
a main stream experience,
or do we use crowd-sourcing

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:24.129
to curate the content
to say what's good and

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.529
what's not. It's still an open question.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.332
We haven't really figured that one out.

00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:31.066
What is your target audience?

00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:34.367
It's kind of a simple
answer. I hope you don't

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.865
find that I'm not
answering the question, but

00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:39.124
it's really everybody.
It's really anyone who ...

00:04:39.124 --> 00:04:43.027
independent of the
traditional schooling system

00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:45.128
or the traditional hurdles
people have to jump through.

00:04:45.128 --> 00:04:46.956
It's anyone who wants to
learn. Anyone who's curious

00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:48.945
about the world. That's
our target audience.

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:50.626
We see it. We get letters
from people who are

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:53.994
in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 70s,
who are learning for fun.

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:56.469
That is our target
audience, but on top of that

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.536
we obviously care about
the stakeholders in

00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.659
other peoples learning's,
teachers and parents.

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.044
We are also trying to
make sure they find us to

00:05:05.044 --> 00:05:07.143
be a very useful tool and their arsenal,

00:05:07.143 --> 00:05:09.802
and hopefully a transformatinal tool.

00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:13.373
Their arsenal to make
their classes all that more

00:05:13.373 --> 00:05:15.818
rich and interactive.

00:05:15.818 --> 00:05:20.135
Number 4. In many cases,
the students open some

00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:22.802
social networking or other
websites or play games

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:24.953
as soon as they sit in
front of a computer.

00:05:24.953 --> 00:05:26.262
I think that is true.

00:05:26.262 --> 00:05:28.460
So, do you think online
lectures education can

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.262
substitute the in-class way of teaching?

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:34.133
It depends what the
in-class way of teaching is.

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.532
It's depends on what
students motivations are.

00:05:36.532 --> 00:05:39.639
It's true. Students like
to go to Facebook or

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.540
social websites, or whatever
else, and the reality

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.931
is that's getting in the way
of not just online learning

00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:48.401
that's getting in the
way of learning period.

00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:50.729
I'm sure that's getting
in the way of traditional

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.623
homework and studying
they have to do right now.

00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:55.288
To some degree, the fact,
that the studying is only

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.133
a click away makes it a
little bit easier than the

00:05:57.133 --> 00:05:59.331
fact that the studying
is, go to your knapsack,

00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:02.715
take out a text book, turn
to page 543, read that

00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:06.323
dense text, then open
up your notebook, and do

00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:08.061
every other odd problem. Whatever it is.

00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:09.553
Whatever your homework
assignment might be.

00:06:09.553 --> 00:06:11.890
I actually think it lowers
the threshold to starting

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.998
the actual the learning.
I think it also lowers

00:06:14.998 --> 00:06:18.063
it, because I would hope
our content is viewed as

00:06:18.063 --> 00:06:20.666
approachable content
and content that focuses

00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:22.876
the beauty of the
learning as opposed to the

00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:26.285
mechanical nature of the
learning. I think when most

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.398
people are exposed to that they
find it much more satisfying.

00:06:28.398 --> 00:06:31.871
On a broad level, maybe, this
is being a little too hopeful.

00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:35.730
I think when content
becomes interesting everyone

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.621
does feel better when
their learning then when

00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:42.143
they spend 5 hours stalking people
on a social networking site.

00:06:42.143 --> 00:06:44.876
I think once people
experience it, their like

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:46.965
I actually enjoy it when
I spend more time learning

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:50.210
than when I do other
things. With that said,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.806
it's an open question, and
we don't claim to solve it.

00:06:54.806 --> 00:06:58.332
Like I've answered in
a previous interview,

00:06:58.332 --> 00:07:03.462
if people are going to skip
out ... when they go home

00:07:03.462 --> 00:07:05.874
if their not going to
do their assignments, or

00:07:05.874 --> 00:07:08.059
if their not going to do
their learning, I would

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:13.398
rather they skip out on lectures
than skip out on doing problems.

00:07:13.398 --> 00:07:15.883
That's where I think this
whole notion of flipping

00:07:15.883 --> 00:07:19.218
a classroom or whatever is
important. If someone's not

00:07:19.218 --> 00:07:21.927
going to do any work at
home, whether it's watching

00:07:21.927 --> 00:07:23.335
videos or doing traditional
homework, when you

00:07:23.335 --> 00:07:25.551
go to the classroom, I still
think it's more important

00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:28.641
that students do problems
there with their peers,

00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.814
and their teacher there,
than getting this lecture

00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:34.871
they may or may not be
prepared for, or be able

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.888
to pay attention to, or
they may not find engaging.

00:07:36.888 --> 00:07:38.299
They never get to do the practice.

00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:41.999
The idea obviously is that
they use the human time

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:45.147
in the classroom for
interaction, and then they go

00:07:45.147 --> 00:07:48.796
home and there they do exercises
and videos at their own pace.

00:07:48.796 --> 00:07:50.729
It's not just watching lectures at home.

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:52.551
It's actually exercise and videos.

00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.150
Whatever's appropriate at that
stage of the learning process.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.397
Question number 5. What
according to you is the

00:07:59.397 --> 00:08:05.224
future of online education?
I don't think I answered

00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:06.864
the second part of that first question.

00:08:06.864 --> 00:08:08.636
So do you think online
lectures education can

00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:10.397
substitute the in-class way of teaching?

00:08:10.397 --> 00:08:14.979
I think online lecturers
education can substitute

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:18.220
the in-class way of
lecturing. Especially, the

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.225
relatively non-interactive
lectures that I've been

00:08:20.225 --> 00:08:22.395
a part of in college,
and the rest where it's

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:24.532
really a professor lecturing,
and everyone taking

00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:26.130
notes. There's very [demeanor] action.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.477
I don't think it's a substitute
for in-class discussion,

00:08:29.477 --> 00:08:32.809
in-class simulations,
in-class problem solving,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.204
or in-class interaction.
To take it a step further,

00:08:36.204 --> 00:08:39.895
I think it's catalysis.
I think online lectures

00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:42.477
education solve these
problems. Their not something

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:45.473
that's a substitute for
in-class interaction,

00:08:45.473 --> 00:08:47.480
their a catalysis for
in-class interaction.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.535
When you can get everything
done at your own pace

00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:51.930
at your own time, then
that makes the conversation

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.228
you have in class, the
projects, the experiments,

00:08:54.228 --> 00:08:56.832
the expiration's you have in
class that much more productive.

00:08:56.832 --> 00:09:01.595
It frees up time for them. I think it's
a catalysis for it, not a substitute.

00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:03.508
Number 5. What, according
to you, is the future

00:09:03.508 --> 00:09:05.935
of online education? Will
having lectures online

00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:08.272
have any impact on the way
students are taught in the class?

00:09:08.272 --> 00:09:09.731
I'll answer the second part first.

00:09:09.731 --> 00:09:12.733
It's kind of what I just touched on. Yes.

00:09:12.733 --> 00:09:16.075
I think, right now,
universities are all ready

00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:18.231
telling their student
you're not in high schools.

00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:20.564
Go do the reading, read
page 40 through 70 tonight,

00:09:20.564 --> 00:09:22.670
and then come back to
lecture the next day.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.277
You'll get a better experience.
Some students do it.

00:09:26.277 --> 00:09:29.822
Some students don't. We
think the videos are much

00:09:29.822 --> 00:09:33.986
more approachable thing to
have to do the night before.

00:09:33.986 --> 00:09:36.738
Even if the student doesn't
do it the night before,

00:09:36.738 --> 00:09:38.933
the value is you always have it there.

00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:41.735
Even if you don't do it
the night before, in a

00:09:41.735 --> 00:09:43.542
traditional hall right
now, you go to class.

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:45.333
and your lost, because
you didn't do the reading.

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:46.999
At least now you have the
equivalent of a lecture

00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:50.228
that's better, because it's
granular and all the rest.

00:09:50.228 --> 00:09:52.652
You can review when you need to do it.

00:09:52.652 --> 00:09:55.065
Pause and repeat, review
things from previous years.

00:09:55.065 --> 00:09:58.943
It's going to have a
way. It has a huge impact

00:09:58.943 --> 00:10:00.927
the way students are
taught in class. They will

00:10:00.927 --> 00:10:03.403
no longer be lectured. That
is what's happening outside.

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:06.401
I think our biggest role ...
I can't emphasis this enough.

00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:09.232
We are all about taking
lecture out of the class.

00:10:09.232 --> 00:10:11.067
We're not saying lecture
is the best way to learn.

00:10:11.067 --> 00:10:12.903
We're just saying let's
take it out of the class.

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:15.259
We're saying that
interaction with teachers and

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:17.344
your peers are the best way to learn.

00:10:17.344 --> 00:10:20.398
We hope to be a catalysis for that.

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:22.742
In terms of what is the
future of online education?

00:10:22.742 --> 00:10:25.230
Open question. We don't
even know what the future

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.322
of Khan Academy is. It's
something we're consistently

00:10:27.322 --> 00:10:30.735
experimenting with. Be open
minded about what works

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:36.603
and what doesn't, then
adapting. It's not something

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.076
that I'm 100% sure of.
I hope there's a future

00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:42.436
5 or 10 years where anyone
can go online and get a deep

00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:45.751
learning or understanding
of anything. On top of that,

00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:47.940
I hope there's a way to
prove what they know.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.591
They can credential. They
can say look, I don't

00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:51.282
need to take Algebra
anymore, because I've proven

00:10:51.282 --> 00:10:53.603
that I understand this.
It could be a traditional

00:10:53.603 --> 00:10:55.466
exams or it could be ...
this is what's interesting

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:58.021
about online. Maybe it's
something with crowd-based

00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:00.604
oral exams, where if you
want to become a level

00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:03.474
5 Algebraist. You're level 4 right now,

00:11:03.474 --> 00:11:07.673
there's 5 out of 5 level
5 people have to say

00:11:07.673 --> 00:11:10.282
you're ready for level 5. Or,
ready to be deemed level 5.

00:11:10.282 --> 00:11:12.434
You do a Skype or meet
up, or who knows what

00:11:12.434 --> 00:11:15.207
it might be to be evaluated.
There's even ways online

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:18.282
education to bring the
best of physical education

00:11:18.282 --> 00:11:21.093
into a scalable rate. Right
now, the goal standard

00:11:21.093 --> 00:11:22.878
of examination is the oral examination.

00:11:22.878 --> 00:11:25.936
It only happens during PhD
qualifiers, because they

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:30.202
don't have resources to do
it for the undergraduates

00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:33.804
or regular K through 12 level.
I think with crowdsourcing

00:11:33.804 --> 00:11:37.471
we could start to explore
some really interesting ways.

00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:39.346
We don't know the answers there.

00:11:39.346 --> 00:11:43.609
Number 6. With respect to your
article in the Wall Street Journal

00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:45.226
regarding the Khan
Academy, could you please

00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:46.670
elaborate the concept of
taking lectures at home

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.125
and doing homework in class?

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:49.878
This is something I
really want to emphasis,

00:11:49.878 --> 00:11:52.464
because this really caught
on after I gave a talk

00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:56.220
about flipping the
classroom. The idea there was

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.075
I mentioned is that I made these videos.

00:11:59.075 --> 00:12:01.473
I started getting letters
from teachers who said

00:12:01.473 --> 00:12:04.374
hey you made the videos?
The teachers then started

00:12:04.374 --> 00:12:06.042
to assign the videos as
homework, and then using

00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:10.069
class time for actual homework for
actually doing problem solving.

00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:13.305
Which, I think is super important.
That was halfway through the

00:12:13.305 --> 00:12:15.462
[temp] talk. What we're trying
to do with Khan Academy,

00:12:15.462 --> 00:12:17.587
is really go a step further than that.

00:12:17.587 --> 00:12:23.717
Whether your at home, in a
classroom, or on the train,

00:12:23.717 --> 00:12:26.451
learn at your own pace.
Whether, it's watching videos

00:12:26.451 --> 00:12:28.782
or doing exercises. Whatever's
appropriate for you.

00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:32.753
Learn at your own pace.
Then, your teacher will have

00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:36.186
data on what you've been
working on and maybe

00:12:36.186 --> 00:12:39.118
whether you are stuck.
So, when you go with that

00:12:39.118 --> 00:12:40.982
interaction with the
teacher, if you don't need

00:12:40.982 --> 00:12:42.460
any help maybe some of it is still working

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.455
continuing to work at your own pace with

00:12:44.455 --> 00:12:47.005
videos and exercises. The
teacher will know when

00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:48.851
you do need help. Even if
you're shy they'll have

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.442
that data, and they can
come up to you and hopefully

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:53.512
have a productive intervention with you.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:56.589
What we're saying is, it's
not so much as a pure flip,

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:58.861
we think it's a step
beyond that. Everyone works

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.585
at their own pace at their own time,

00:13:00.585 --> 00:13:03.005
mastering concepts before they move on.

00:13:03.005 --> 00:13:05.856
The real crocks of what
the Khan Academy is

00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:09.193
about is making that
class time as interactive

00:13:09.193 --> 00:13:12.126
as possible. Leveraging
that human in the room,

00:13:12.126 --> 00:13:14.202
whether it's the teacher or your peers.

00:13:14.202 --> 00:13:17.065
So, they can do what
humans are best at which is

00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:21.452
mentor, diagnose,
understand what exactly is

00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:24.409
the students problem is, and
take it to the next level.

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:27.657
Do what the videos and
exercises could not do.
