00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.060
During lopsided games or pauses in action,
it is the sports team’s mascot that keeps

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.060
fans entertained.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.029
Be it with dancing, shooting t-shirts into
the crowds or goading opposing coaches into

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.210
attacking them, mascots make sports a little
more fun – even if a few of them gives kids

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.210
nightmares.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.600
While we tend to think of mascots as distinctly
American, even the San Diego Chicken can trace

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.990
his origins to 19th century France.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.220
You see, the word “mascot” probably derives
from the French word “mascoto,” meaning

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.150
“witch, fairy or sorcerer.”

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.070
This, in turn, gave rise to the slang word
“mascotte,” meaning “talisman” or

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.750
“sorcerer’s charm” in the 1860s.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.520
It was often used in the context of gambling,
in hopes that a “mascotte” was there to

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.380
pull luck to the bettor’s side.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.400
The word was first popularized and brought
to the mainstream by the 1880s French opera

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.460
“La Mascotte,” written by playwright Edmond
Audran.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.610
The opera was about an Italian farmer whose
crops just wouldn’t grow- that is, until

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.410
he’s visited by a mysterious virgin named
Bettina who, as long as she remains a virgin,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.680
functions as something of a good luck charm.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.250
With her help, his fortunes soon turn around.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.620
It’s hard to decipher who – or what – was
the first sports mascot.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.310
According to esteemed etymologist Barry Popik,
the word “mascotte” was first used in

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.719
the context of a good luck charm in sporting
events around the 1880s in American baseball.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.950
According to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary,
the first use of it was in an 1883 issue of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.039
The Sporting Life about a boy named “Chic,”
who carried bats and ran errands for the players.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.729
Beyond his practical usefulness, the players
also considered him a good luck charm.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.079
As Sporting Life wrote, “the players pin
their faith to (Chic’s) luck-bringing qualities.”

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.180
As for the first animal mascots (of sorts),
in an 1884 edition of the Cincinnati Enquirer,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.869
seemingly in regards to a goat wandering around
their baseball team, there is this line, “The

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.039
goat was probably looking for some show-bills,
oyster-cans, or some other usually palatable

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.179
dish for his stomach, but the audience could
not see it in that light, and thought he was

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.579
even a better ‘Mascotte’ than the old-time
favorite.”

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.170
In an 1884 issue of Sporting Life, there’s
also a reference to a mascot involved in the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.479
Boston’s baseball team recent ability to
win games, “Have the Bostons a Mascotte?

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.359
They have crawled out some very small holes
the past two weeks.”

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.460
Two years later, Sporting Life again connected
the word to being a good luck charm, but dropped

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.590
the “e” getting us closer to the modern
day spelling- “Little Nick is the luckiest

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.230
man in the country, and is certainly the Browns’
mascott.”

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.890
williehahnIn 1886, the New York Times dropped
the extra “t,” marking the first known

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.340
time the modern word “mascot” is used.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.360
The reference was about a boy named Charle
Gallagher who was “said to have been born

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.090
with teeth and is guaranteed to possess all
the magic charms of a genuine mascot.”

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.170
In yet another 1886 reference that used the
modern spelling, The Chicago Tribune noted

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.980
on June 18th of that year,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.760
(T)he Chicago players and their mascot marched
down the platform and placed themselves at

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.569
the head of the double column of visiting
Chicagoans that had formed at the depot, and

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.480
then with their brooms elevated, the delegation
marched out of the depot…The odd looking

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.160
procession, extending nearly two squares,
attracted a vast amount of attention….

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.220
[They] were escorted to the ground by a band,
and entered the field behind little Willie

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.590
Hahn, who carried an immense broom on which
were the words ‘Our Mascot.’

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.760
In any event, in late 19th century and into
the early part of the 20th century, it appears

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.310
that all sports mascots were children or real
animals and, contrary to the version of the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.230
mascot we have today, they were taken very
seriously.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.670
For instance, the 1888 St. Louis Browns’
team photo featured a little, uniformed boy

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.010
and two dogs, all three given ample credit
for being part of the team that was nicknamed

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.310
the “World Beaters.”

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.239
The first football mascot may have been Handsome
Dan, a bulldog that belonged to a member of

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.239
the Yale class of 1892.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.120
126 years later – and 17 bulldogs (as of
this writing, the university is searching

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.580
for the 18th) – Handsome Dan is still Yale’s
mascot, with a statute and a Shake Shack hot

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.970
dog to his name.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.030
The 1919 Chicago White Sox credited a physically
disabled orphan named Eddie Bennett for providing

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.650
them enough luck to win the American League
pennant.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.849
This was the same year of the infamous “Black
Sox” scandal involving several players on

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.690
the team conspiring with gamblers to intentionally
throw the World Series.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.110
Unfortunately for the rest of the team, Bennett’s
luck couldn’t overcome their efforts.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.940
As for the professional mascots we have today,
the first sports mascot that made a career

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.569
out of it (in other words, wasn’t a kid
or an animal) is generally thought to be Max

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.370
Patkin, known as the “Clown Prince of Baseball.”

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.569
Patkin began his mascot career as an actual
baseball player, pitching for a White Sox

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.609
minor league team.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.359
He ended up on a Navy team during World War
II and once, during an exhibition in Hawaii,

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.769
he found himself pitching to the great Joe
DiMaggio.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.690
Legend has it that Patkin served up a pitch
that the Yankee Clipper hammered for a home

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.690
run.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.080
On a whim as DiMaggio rounded the bases, Patkin
followed.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.530
Mocking his trot and making goofy faces- the
crowd loved it.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.370
Such antics were not unheard of back then.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.890
For instance, Major League Baseball player
Herman “Germany” Schaefer once stepped

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.220
up to bat wearing a raincoat and galoshes,
along with carrying an umbrella to hit with

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.880
instead of a bat- he was hinting to the umpire
that maybe they should call the game due to

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880
the rain…

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.880
You can read more about his many antics here:
There Once was a Major League Baseball Player

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880
Who Stole First From Second.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.060
As for Patkin, his playful mockery of DiMaggio
began a nearly five-decade career entertaining

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.460
baseball crowds.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.450
While Patkin did have his traditional garb
– loose uniform, sideways hat, and goofy

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.880
expression – it wasn’t a costume per say,
so he wasn’t the first there.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.090
The first live costumed mascots were probably
Mr. Met in baseball and Brutus Buckeye in

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.370
college football, both debuting in 1964.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.080
But it was a chicken that plucked his way
into American hearts and made the idea of

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.270
a costumed mascot a staple of sporting events.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.199
It all started as a cartoon.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.140
In 1974, the San Diego rock station KGB hired
cartoonist Brian Narelle (who would also star

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.400
in John Carpenter’s first movie Dark Star)
to create a character for a series of commercials.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.849
He drew a chicken…

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.020
It was such a hit that the radio station created
a colorful chicken costume to go along with

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.889
it, one that debuted on Easter handing out
eggs at the San Diego Zoo.

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.130
In need of a person to go inside of the costume,
they found a journalism student paid two dollars

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.150
an hour (about $11.40 today) for the gig.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.949
His name was Ted Giannoulas.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.340
He was so good at being the chicken he was
asked to come to Padre games to entertain

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.380
the crowds.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.449
Thus began an over forty year career as the
most influential mascot in American sports

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.520
history – the San Diego Chicken.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.470
Dancing, goofing off and emerging from eggs,
many credit the Chicken and Giannoulas for

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.310
creating the modern mascot.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.540
Influenced by the chicken, other sports teams
created mascots to promote and cheer on their

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.540
teams.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.080
In 1977, the Phillie Phanatic (designed by
the same person who created Miss Piggy) made

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.160
his debut.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.410
The Oriole Bird hatched a year later in Baltimore.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.539
By the mid-1980s, many baseball, football,
soccer, college athletic teams across the

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.699
globe had dancing, costumed mascots.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.629
Even the Olympics had their own mascots starting
in 1968 (the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.280
the first to have a living, costumed mascot).

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.129
Today, seemingly every pro, college and high
school sports team has a mascot.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.729
There’s even a Mascot Hall of Fame, which
is in the midst of opening a brand new facility

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:37.729
in 2017 in Whiting, Indiana.

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.379
And they owe it all to rampant superstition
among sporting enthusiasts and athletes along

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:49.830
with a rather obscure 1880s French opera about
a curious virginal good luck charm- all culminating

00:06:49.830 --> 00:07:05.039
in a gyrating banana slug being a thing

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.699
to celebrate.
