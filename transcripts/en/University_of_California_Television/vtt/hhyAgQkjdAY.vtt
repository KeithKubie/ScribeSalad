00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:23.731
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:47.550
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.840
I'm Harry Kreisler of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.530
the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.090
Our guest today is Professor Carol Greider

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.131
who is the Daniel Nathans
Professor and Director

00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.959
of Molecular Biology and Genetics

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:04.730
at Johns Hopkins
University Medical School.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.730
She won the 2009 Nobel Prize
for Physiology or Medicine

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.770
along with Elizabeth
Blackburn and Jack W. Szostak.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.926
Professor Greider is the 2014

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:23.770
Hitchcock lecturer at Berkeley.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.229
In 1885 the Hitchcock Endowment Fund

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.640
was established from a bequest

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.910
made by Dr. Charles M. Hitchcock

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.060
to institute a professorship
at the University of California

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.250
for free lectures upon scientific
and practical subjects.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.180
Professor Greider,
welcome back to Berkeley.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.370
- Thank you, it's nice to be here.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.110
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.780
- I was born in, actually,
San Diego, California,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.220
but I was raised in Davis, California.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.900
- Looking back, how do
you think your parents

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.950
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.010
- Well my father was a
physicist at UC Davis

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.780
and he very much encouraged
me and my brother

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.200
to be able to follow what
we were interested in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.400
and to try and keep all doors open

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.520
and very much encouraged us to be able to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.940
explore things that interested us.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.810
So I think that that really shaped

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.590
how I thought about a career.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.780
- And your mother also
had a PhD from Berkeley.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.750
Both your parents had PhDs from Berkeley.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.440
- Both my parents had PhDs from Berkeley

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.970
although my mother died when I was young

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.550
and so it was my father that raised us.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.150
So his influence on, sort of, where I went

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.070
is what I remember most.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.750
- Was there a lot of
talk at the dinner table

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.840
about scientific matters?

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.570
- Sometimes, usually about physics,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.730
which was a little bit above my head,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.480
but, certainly, it was clear that

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.420
being able to pursue what you
were interested in was a goal.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.840
- Because of your father's
role as a professor,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.230
part of your early
years were spent abroad.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.650
- Yes, he was on sabbatical

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.650
at the Max Planck Institute
in Heidelberg when I was 12.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.310
So I went to Germany and was
put into the German Gymnasium

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.880
and, as a consequence,
learned to speak German

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.140
either the hard way or the easy way,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.760
depending on how you think about it,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.745
just being thrown in and immersed.

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:28.810
- In biographical material,
I've read about you,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.500
you had an older brother and
your relationship with him

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.130
was very important and
both of you developed

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:41.380
a sense of autonomy and independence,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.420
even by walking to school.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.360
- Yeah, walking to school
when we were also in,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.480
when we were young, but also in Germany

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.650
and being able to get around on our own

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.220
through the public transportation
when we were 12 and 13.

00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:57.140
It was important.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.790
- Were thinking skills, critical thinking,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.090
just something you absorbed
with the atmosphere,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.890
a physics professor
father studying abroad,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.760
even as a young person?

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.130
- I never really thought
of it that way so much.

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:14.560
I didn't think of myself as somebody

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.100
that was particularly
good at critical thinking.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.420
I was just trying to follow
things I was interested in.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.390
- In your early years
you had dyslexia, right?

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.390
So you had to develop, drawn
this independence and autonomy

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.390
to figure out how to really cope

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.440
to make up for what you couldn't do

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.950
with things that you could do very well.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.270
- Well it wasn't clear what
dyslexia was back then.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.640
All I knew was that I had to be

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.100
taken out of my regular classroom

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.670
for this remedial spelling

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.050
and then I had a lot
of trouble in spelling

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.400
and, it wasn't really defined as dyslexia.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.180
So it wasn't until I
was a little bit older

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.700
and looking back, that it was
clear that it was dyslexia.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.300
So I think that's part of what contributed

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.930
to my feeling like,
maybe I wasn't as bright

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.070
as some of the other kids were,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.690
but if I worked hard, I
could still do what I wanted.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.450
So that was sort of the
image that I had of myself.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.460
It was embarrassing to be
sitting in grade school

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.080
and have a special teacher come in

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.690
and take you out of the classroom

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.350
in front of all of the other kids.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.180
- But you learned to compensate, really,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.350
and develop coping strategies and skills.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.200
- Later on, they ended
up being very useful.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.620
I remember in my high school biology,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.750
when we had a lot of
memorization with anatomy.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.964
We were doing anatomy of the cat

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:43.090
and I found it very
easy to memorize things.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.980
I realized, retrospectively, that that was

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.940
probably because, when I saw a word,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.050
I couldn't sound out the
word and so, instead,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.740
I would memorize it.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.880
So that developed those memory skills

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.380
that ended up having
advantages in other settings.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.796
- Did you have any teachers
before you went to college

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:07.560
that helped further what was

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.070
to become your interest in science?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.980
- I was very interested
in biology in high school.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.910
It wasn't necessarily
something that I said

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.240
I wanted to have a career in.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.820
And I wasn't one of the
kids that did science fairs

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.990
or had a chemistry set.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.140
But when I was a senior in high school,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.310
I thought biology was interesting

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.010
and I was interested,
particularly, in marine biology,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.660
which is what prompted me then
to choose UC Santa Barbara

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.060
as the place to go for
my undergraduate work.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.000
- For you, Santa Barbara
was a special place

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
because of a special college
within Santa Barbara.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.032
Talk a little about that because it seems

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:56.032
that you really developed
some important skills there.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.540
- Yeah, so, in addition to applying

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.210
to the University of
California at Santa Barbara,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.630
I also applied to the
College of Creative Studies.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.600
And I knew about this because
there was professor there,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.610
Bea Sweeney, who had been
a colleague of my mother's

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.850
and my father still kept
in contact with the family.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.470
She was a professor of biology

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.180
within this integrated college.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.180
So, literature, science, math,
arts within a small group.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.530
That was particularly wonderful

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.980
because there was a lot
of individual attention.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.720
Each student had an assigned advisor

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.140
and you could develop a
curriculum with that advisor

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.170
without necessarily having to
take certain blocks of classes

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.210
as the rest of the university did.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.880
I found that very wonderful

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.630
'cause it allowed me to
be able to do experiments

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.020
in laboratories earlier
than I otherwise would.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.230
- You really got into the science

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:07.230
and doing the experiments
across different areas.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.170
Talk a little about that.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.470
- Yeah, so, I remember when Bea
Sweeney, who was my advisor,

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.790
said to me as a freshman, she really felt

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.930
that I should be working in a laboratory.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.620
I remember being thrown in as a freshman

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.570
and having all of these
college classes and, again,

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.670
thinking that I wasn't as smart

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.230
as all of my other colleagues.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.550
And I thought, well that
would be overwhelming,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.580
and she said, "I think you
should try it anyway." (laughs)

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.560
(Harry laughs)

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.950
And so I did and I started
off in a laboratory

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.970
doing some ecology, beach ecology.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.980
I quickly learned that,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.630
although I was interested in biology,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.630
that area of biology didn't
really fit my way of thinking.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.600
It was more statistics.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.140
So then, through Bea Sweeney,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.360
and interactions with her,
she was able to help me

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.860
get into several different
laboratories at Santa Barbara

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.870
and it was when I got into a laboratory

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.450
that was doing more biochemistry,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.670
where one could really
look at what we now call,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.520
sort of mechanistic interactions,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.310
how you make a change in a system

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.350
and then you can see the
outcome of that change,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.770
that that really fit my
intellectual way of thinking.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.030
So that was really a wonderful opportunity

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.100
to test out different areas.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.570
Because sometimes you can't know

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.150
what is most interesting to you

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.457
until you're actually in the environment.

00:09:29.457 --> 00:09:33.207
- So it was a matter of self-discovery

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:36.570
what really worked for you
and, interestingly enough,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.570
it sounded like you
wanted a physics dimension

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.590
to the biology you
- well certainly

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.470
a physical dimension, yes--
- a physical, yeah.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.280
But that's what physicists do, right?

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.550
Yeah, so that's,

00:09:53.938 --> 00:09:55.190
that's fascinating.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.740
But the structure, the
curriculum structure,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.620
and the mentoring, sort of helped you

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.270
find what it is you actually wanted to do.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.820
That's rare, sometimes, in
undergraduate education.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.550
- Yes, and it also helps because
I also took a year abroad.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.100
Because I already spoke German,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.450
I was able to take a year
abroad at Santa Barbara

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.680
and go and study in Göttingen.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.590
So it was my second year abroad then

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.540
and it allowed me then
to take the courses there

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.990
and fit them into my academic program.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.580
So, in taking a year abroad,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.200
I still graduated in four years.

00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:32.910
- It sounds like a lotta your experience

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.780
made you observant of people

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.380
and different kinds of people, in a way.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.213
Is that fair?

00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:43.750
I mean, to be immersed
in a foreign environment

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.710
at a young age and then doing it again,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.770
it must have helped make
you an observant person

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.530
of the differences out there.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.560
- Yes, I mean, I think that
that is certainly something

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.950
that I was always aware of is,

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.650
people and interactions with people.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.120
So, I think that, because I
liked that, I liked going abroad

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.190
and the going abroad then helped me

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.720
learn to do that as well.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.190
- Now, then, after getting your BA,

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.270
you came to Berkeley
as a graduate student.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.270
Talk about choosing Berkeley
and why you wanted to be here.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:24.070
- Well, when I was applying
to various graduate schools,

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.520
again, one has to take standardized tests

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.938
and, because of my dyslexia,
first for the GREs,

00:11:29.938 --> 00:11:32.500
sorry, for the SATs and also for the GREs,

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.620
I didn't do so well on those.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.700
So, of the 13 places that I applied to,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.520
only two considered me
for the graduate program

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.070
and one was Cal Tech and
the other was UC Berkeley.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.370
My advisor, Bea Sweeney, at the time,

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.060
she said, "Oh, you just
wanna go to Berkeley

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.300
"because that's where your mother went."

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.930
And she advised me,
instead, to go to Cal Tech

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.228
to do something different.

00:11:56.228 --> 00:11:57.830
(both laugh)

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.960
But when I came to interview,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.810
I was very captivated by the
program and, specifically,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.200
my interactions with Elizabeth Blackburn

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.250
during my interview here, and
that's what really swayed me

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.230
to come here rather than Cal Tech.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.910
- What were the years
that you were at Berkeley

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.570
and what was Berkeley like then,

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.780
just atmospherically, in general?

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.600
- I was here from '83 to '88.

00:12:27.628 --> 00:12:32.410
It was a wonderful, open
intellectual environment

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:37.040
and I very much liked the interactions

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.110
with my classmates in the
molecular biology department.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:43.990
People really were interested

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.950
in what other people were working on.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.020
Friends would talk, not just about

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.840
what was going on socially,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.950
but, mostly, it was about experiments.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.120
There was a lot of
support amongst the group.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.840
So, today, many of my best
friends are still the students

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.440
that I was here with at
Berkeley during my PhD.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.080
- I like to ask my guests what they see as

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.450
both the skill set and the temperament

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:22.450
that are important for
the kind of work you do.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.967
- What they would see or what--

00:13:26.967 --> 00:13:30.650
- What you, looking
back at your own career,

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.570
and doing the work that you do,

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.270
what is the skill set involved?

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.480
- Being able to be able
to have the freedom

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.980
to do something that one's interested in

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.850
without, necessarily,
worrying about obstacles.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.770
I think that that's something that

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.150
is different today than it used to be.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.680
People are a little bit more
worried these days about,

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.340
what are they gonna do for their career

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.860
or what might get in the way.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.130
But, I certainly felt,
as a graduate student,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.175
that I just wanted to
do what was interesting

00:14:05.175 --> 00:14:07.520
and I didn't really see

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.520
that there were limitations or obstacles.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.960
Now that may be unique to me
because I learned early on,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.090
perhaps through the dyslexia,
to just put blinders on,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.080
and when I saw something I couldn't do,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.430
just to ignore the fact
that I couldn't do it.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:27.430
So it's not clear to me if I
was unique in that setting.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.770
But, certainly, I felt that
I was extremely encouraged

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.440
to follow what was interesting

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.510
and not worry about any consequences.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.060
- You had some choices once you were here

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.660
in terms of what you would specialize in.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.930
What was your thought processes like?

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.480
Had your experience at
Santa Barbara sort of

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.010
pointed the way, so to speak,
in the choices you made there?

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.405
- I knew from Santa Barbara that

00:14:57.405 --> 00:15:01.580
I liked this sort of
mechanistic way of thinking.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.900
That was in both biochemistry

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.280
as well as in molecular biology.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.280
But conversations with some of
my mentors at Santa Barbara,

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.370
Kevin Sullivan and David
Asai, were really saying,

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:20.370
DNA is the way of the
future in terms of where

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.710
these kinds of interesting
questions are going to lead.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.370
So that, then, prompted me to apply

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.160
for the department of molecular biology

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.560
rather than to the
department of biochemistry

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.720
because, naively, I thought

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.230
that there was more of
that in molecular biology.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.880
It turns out that it was
going on in both departments

00:15:37.016 --> 00:15:39.150
but that's what I was sort of looking for,

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.910
was something where one could study things

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.667
in a very mechanistic way
and understand the DNA.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:53.150
- So you decided to work
under Professor Blackburn

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:59.350
and you became interested in her work

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.440
and extending her work in telomeres.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.410
So help us understand what a telomere is,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.810
yes.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.200
- Yean, so it's the very
end of the chromosome

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.420
and Liz had been working on
this for a number of years

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.240
and it was something that I hadn't

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.940
really heard very much about.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.240
So I was particularly interested in it

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.460
because it was a little
bit out of the main stream.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.740
But they are the ends of chromosomes,

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.630
the functional unit at
the ends of chromosomes

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.940
which are essential for
protecting the chromosome ends.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.240
- So it's like a little cap.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.230
- A little cap that
protects the chromosome end.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.540
But it turns out that, in addition

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.350
to protecting the chromosome end,

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:47.450
it's important for maintaining
the length of the chromosome.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.680
That was something that, at the time,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.680
Liz and others were recently
aware of, that the way that,

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.550
When you copy a whole
chromosome, it turns out

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.070
that the way you copy a chromosome,

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.590
the very end of that
chromosome, the telomere,

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.240
can't be completely copied to the end.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.170
So there was this mystery about how it is

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.100
that the end of the
chromosome can be maintained.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.760
Why isn't it just that
the telomeres get shorter

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.690
and shorter and shorter
every time a cell divides?

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.890
That was certainly the prediction.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.650
So, we were interested in
how that problem is overcome.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.950
- As you begin this work and
really extend it over time,

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.710
you're, and I've learned
this in interviewing

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.330
the scientists who've come aboard,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.480
you're actually on the back

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.800
of people who have preceded
you and made discoveries.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.090
So let's just talk a
little about that so, in,

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.980
let me see if I have this here.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.980
In the '30s, what did
Muller and McClintock do

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.070
that set the stage for
what you were doing?

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.630
- The function of telomeres,
in terms of this protective cap

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.540
that's what H.J. Muller
and Barbara McClintock

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.530
showed, was that,

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:03.950
Mueller was working in Drosophila

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.870
and McClintock in corn or maize,

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.050
showed that there must be
something protective at the end

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.500
because when you break
that chromosome end,

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.650
that you get the chromosome
is either degraded

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.310
or it will fuse with other chromosomes.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.770
So they were the first to
functionally define the telomere

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.300
as we just described it.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.380
Then it was in the 1970s
that Elizabeth Blackburn,

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.270
working together with Joe Gall,

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.540
showed the molecular
characteristics of the telomere.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.790
So they defined the actual
DNA sequence at the time.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.240
Then understanding that
molecular characteristic,

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.050
we could then go forward
and ask questions about

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.250
how the end of the
chromosome is maintained.

00:18:47.283 --> 00:18:48.183
- Explain a little more what understanding

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:54.020
the end and the molecular
structure at the end,

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.850
what is that about?

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.480
In other words, it's,

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.720
Help me understand that.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.220
- If you understand the detailed
make-up of the chromosome,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.920
then that allows one to do experiments

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.050
to be able to test how is it

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.150
that the end of the
chromosome can be maintained.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.750
But if you don't know what
it functionally is made of,

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.570
then you can't design
experiments around that.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.960
So, it was really understanding
that DNA sequence,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.390
and, in the case of the telomere sequence

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.990
that Liz Blackburn defined,

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.770
it was from the ciliated
protozoan Tetrahymena,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.490
which has 40,000 chromosomes.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.080
- So you pick a one-cell organism

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.710
that's doing a lot of this work.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.620
- Exactly.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.930
It's got 40,000 chromosomes,
so you go to the source

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.410
to find out what the
material is actually made of.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.040
They found that it was this
very simple, repeated sequence.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.090
In DNA we use the four-letter alphabet

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.030
for the building blocks of the DNA.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.300
And that's T, C, A and G.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.050
But what they found was that this telomere

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:07.050
was made up of a very, very
repetitive TTGGGG TTGGGG TTGGGG.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.770
Hundreds of repeats.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.050
Very, very simple and repetitive,

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.090
and that that's what actually

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.400
provides the protective cap
at the end of the chromosome.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.880
- Does that mean that the cap
is made up of individual caps

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.300
or it's one continuous structure?

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.970
- It's one continuous structure and then

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.290
that DNA sequence actually has
proteins that bind along it

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.730
to carry out the function of the telomere.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:39.640
- Do different organisms
have different lengths

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.750
and then, throughout the aging process,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.250
what happens to these caps?

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.760
- At first it was only identified

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.220
in these single-cell ciliates and then,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.420
as more people started doing experiments,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.280
one you know what an initial sequence is,

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.000
then it gives you something in mind

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.070
to look in other organisms.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.680
So, one of the very nice things

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.980
about working on something as
fundamental as the telomere

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.110
is that things that are that
fundamental inside cells

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.330
tend to be conserved
throughout organisms and so,

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.220
how it's solved in one organism

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.670
will tend to be true in
many, many organisms.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.700
It turned out that that was
very true for telomeres.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.640
So as people started identifying

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.120
telomere sequences in different organisms,

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.430
there were also these simple, repeated

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.610
sequences on the ends of chromosomes.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.710
So, we were able to
then do more experiments

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.550
to try and understand
how those are maintained.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.910
- Blackburn and her associate, Gall,

00:21:42.619 --> 00:21:47.330
part of their experimentation
which really pushed this along

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.350
was the discovery

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.340
that you could take one organism

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.640
and, essentially, build caps

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.160
in another related organism,
but a different organism.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.560
- So that was the experiment
that had been done

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.500
just before I came to
Berkeley and that was

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.180
a collaboration of Liz
Blackburn with Jack Szostak

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.520
and they took a piece of DNA from yeast,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.380
which is normally a circle,

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.990
and then they opened that circle

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.750
and added the telomeres
that they had identified,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.890
that Liz had identified from Tetrahymena.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.920
So, instead of a circle, they now had

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.000
what would be a linear
chromosome, like most chromosomes.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.640
Quite remarkably, they found that

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.650
when they took that linear
piece of DNA with telomeres

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.010
and put it inside yeast cells,

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.390
and Tetrahymena and yeast are

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.700
in two different kingdoms of life,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.300
that that function,
that telomere function,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.100
was maintained inside the yeast.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.520
So the telomeres functioned

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.730
and you now had this linear chromosome.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.510
That was really a key experiment,
but even more importantly,

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.660
was then going and looking to see,

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.440
within those yeast cells,
that Tetrahymena telomere

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.990
had a little bit of telomere
sequences added onto it

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.750
that were yeast-specific
sequences as it was dividing.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.640
And that provided the clue

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.730
that made Liz and Jack
suggest this mechanism,

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.770
how is it that telomeres
are actually maintained?

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.910
They made the very bold
proposal that, maybe,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.170
there is an enzyme that actually will just

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:22.070
add these repeated sequences
onto the ends of chromosomes.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.480
So, as I said, normally you
would expect the telomeres

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.580
to shorten progressively
with each cell division,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.010
but they proposed that, if
you can then add something,

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.920
then you can balance out the
shortening with addition.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.490
So that's what I then set out to test

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.190
when I came to work with Liz Blackburn.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.460
- Just out of curiosity, is the sequence

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.030
in the different organisms the same?

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.340
- It's not exactly the same.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.730
It's the same flavor.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.060
That is, it's tandemly repeated sequences.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.060
But, very conveniently, the yeast sequence

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.000
is just slightly different
than the Tetrahymena sequence.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.020
So you could see that you
had Tetrahymena telomeres

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.230
and then there was a
transition into yeast telomeres

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.310
at the very end of the sequence,

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.310
which allowed them then to propose

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.150
that they could be added by an enzyme.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.680
- So, okay, you're a
first-year graduate student.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.680
You've studied enough to
know who you wanna study with

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:22.380
and you have been exposed to the history

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.220
that we've just talked
about in terms of discovery.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.780
So then what did you say to yourself

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.730
about what you wanted to focus on?

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.590
- For first-year graduate
students, at least at the time,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.110
and I think this is still true,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.600
is you're required to do projects

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.150
in three different laboratories.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.320
So I did a project in one laboratory

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.640
and then I did a project
with Liz Blackburn

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.410
on telomeres from unrelated
an unrelated organism,

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.620
and then I did a third project.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.310
You're not officially allowed

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.950
to make a deal with who
you're gonna work with

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.560
until some time in May of the first year.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.070
I knew that I wanted to work with Liz

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.690
during the time that I had
done the rotation with her

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.300
and I knew about this idea,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.840
how do chromosomes replicate,
how are they maintained,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.140
and I thought that that was

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.340
the most exciting thing
going on in telomeres.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.870
So, in May, at the end
of my third rotation,

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.640
I made an appointment to go and see Liz

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.680
and I had two things
that I wanted to ask her.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.280
One is, can I work with you?

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.640
And two is, can I work on this project?

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.340
I was thrilled because
she said yes to both

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.530
and the conversation
lasted maybe five minutes.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.030
And then, once I finished
up my third project,

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.920
I went back to Liz's
lab and started the work

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.030
to try and identify, is there such a thing

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.160
which will add these telomeric sequences

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.280
onto the ends of chromosomes?

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.680
- It sounds to me like,

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.080
just following your
intellectual journey here,

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.060
that you were really,
everything in your life

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.990
came together to prepare
you for this choice

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:58.950
of what you wanted to work
with and set about doing it.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.580
- It just seemed like
the obvious thing to do

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.210
because it was a very exciting problem

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.930
that I was just curious about.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.010
But, certainly, that is built up by

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.740
my experiences from the past
that brought me to that point

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.370
where I felt that this was
an interesting project.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.550
And Liz was very interested in this

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.950
and she was happy to have
somebody that wanted to pursue it.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.750
- You start this work and then,

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.750
what is involved in the experimentation

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.040
that says, okay, what's going on here

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:42.390
and how do I play with these
creatures, shall we say,

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:47.253
or these chromosomes, to
figure out what's going on?

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:51.963
At some point I read you
said, you need a strategy to,

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.840
and so, what was the strategy you set upon

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.510
and what were the different
things you had to adjust

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.070
to come up--
- So it's an empirical science

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.560
and we started, of course,
again with Tetrahymena.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.490
Tetrahymena has 40,000 chromosomes.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.990
Then it must have a lot of whatever it is

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.230
that is needed to
maintain the chromosomes.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:18.230
So we used Tetrahymena
cells and, basically,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.240
made a little cocktail of
ground-up Tetrahymena cells

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.400
with what we hope would be

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.990
the right pH and buffers
and concentration.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.840
But then the key was,
really, trying to understand

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.280
how we were gonna look for
something being elongated.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.060
We tried a variety of different things.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.660
We tried isolating a specific piece of DNA

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.160
that had a little bit of
telomeric sequence on it.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:51.460
Did experiments for five
or six months with that,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.880
getting little hints here and there.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.570
But it was really, because
it's an empirical science,

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.370
it was just trying different things.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.910
It was about nine months after
starting these experiments

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.210
where every day I'd come in
and make a little cocktail

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.790
of the Tetrahymena cells and put them in

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.670
with some radioactive DNA precursors

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.570
to look if those precursors
would be elongating something.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.910
And then, instead of doing a DNA fragment,

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.130
I switched to trying, well,

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.610
maybe a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.930
would be the thing that
could be elongated.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.810
The very first time that
I did that experiment,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.170
when I came in to develop
the result of the experiment,

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.260
I saw this pattern that looked like

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.730
a six-base repeating pattern of DNA.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.670
The key, in retrospect, was in switching

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.480
to using that DNA oligonucleotide,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.020
not because it was synthetic,

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.410
but because of the amount
that you could get in

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.640
because it was so short.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.640
It was 18 nucleotides long,
18 building blocks of the DNA,

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.400
as opposed to something
that was a thousand or more.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.160
Because of that, there could be

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.160
more molecules in the experiment

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.520
because it's so small that,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.730
when you're adding a certain amount,

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.130
the number of ends that were there

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.180
was over a thousand-fold of
what we had been adding before.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.480
So it was just trying different things.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.780
It was very clear, as soon as we had

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.200
enough of the material in the extract,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.260
that there was this repeating pattern.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.540
But that's when things got interesting

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.680
because it was like,
wow, this is exciting.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.200
There's something that
we expect to see here.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.610
But then it's like, what
could be fooling us?

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.490
And there was a whole 'nother year then,

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.460
of trying to figure out,
maybe this was a known enzyme

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.770
and we were just interpreting
it in a certain way.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.190
We had to then convince ourselves

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.670
that this really was something new.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:53.340
And this is something that I
talk to students about often,

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.750
is that, when you have something
that's new and exciting,

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.177
rather than saying, oh,
I wanna find evidence

00:29:58.177 --> 00:30:01.020
to support my hypothesis, instead,

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.960
we tried to bash down our own hypothesis

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.520
and to find ways to knock it down,

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.230
to find out, how could
this possibly be wrong?

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:14.230
Because I would rather
disprove my own crazy idea

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.100
than have somebody else disprove it.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.200
And so--

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.990
- We'll talk about what you
had to do in the following,

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.200
but I just wanna go
back to this aha moment.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.690
I believe I read that
this was on Christmas day

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:35.680
that you came in, you
see what has happened,

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.910
and so this was your wow moment.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.743
Then what did you do?

00:30:39.743 --> 00:30:41.750
You went home and, you were so excited

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.980
and you did what we all do,
played Bruce Springsteen.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.813
- Exactly.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.300
Because the pattern was
something that was suggestive

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.560
that this could really be
something very exciting.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.880
And then after that, it was, well,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.310
what else could be fooling us here?

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.310
- I wanna go back to this thing about

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:05.310
the collegiality because the new item

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.310
that you were using
that made the difference

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.740
was actually something that
you were able to borrow

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.430
from a colleague who had
been working on this the,

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.790
- Yes, there was somebody else
in the lab, Eric Henderson,

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.030
at the time, that was working on actually

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.470
the structure of these
DNA oligonucleotides

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.990
and doing nuclear magnetic
resonance to try and understand.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.390
So he was just doing
experiments just with this.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.170
So he had it in the laboratory and I said,

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.490
well, can I have some of that

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.800
to try in this elongation experiment?

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.680
- So once you see this
lengthening process, then the,

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.120
you're then asking yourself,

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.080
well what is this enzyme
and where is it coming from?

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.090
Is that the--
- Is it really a new enzyme

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.600
that is just adding onto
the ends of chromosomes?

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.990
Nobody had ever heard of
anything like that before.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.710
Typically, if you have
something that makes DNA,

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:58.150
what it does is, it has something to copy,

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.550
what we call a template.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.550
So a typical DNA synthesis
is, there's a template there

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.050
and then the DNA polymerase as we call it,

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.570
the thing that makes the DNA,
just copies what is there.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.570
So we were wondering,

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.600
maybe there's some
small template somewhere

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.480
that we don't know about and, really,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.850
this is just a normal DNA polymerase

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.830
that is making these copies.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.610
And so, we then set out to devise

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.720
a series of experiments to disprove

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.610
or to rule out that it
was just a DNA polymerase.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.000
That took about a year's time.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.670
So, the discovery was
made in December of '84

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.790
and the paper was published
in December of '85.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:43.560
- What, then, is involved
in the experiments

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.370
that followed in the next year?

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.860
Seeing where this enzyme was coming from

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.610
or what made its work possible?

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.950
- If we could rule out that there was

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:57.790
some other template that was being copied.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:02.110
So, purifying the enzyme,
trying to get rid of

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.980
any contaminating DNA that might be there.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.385
But what really ended up convincing us

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:10.520
was really the converse of the experiment

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.200
that Liz Blackburn and
Jack Szostak had done,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.370
because what they had done was
to take Tetrahymena telomeres

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.770
and put them into a yeast cell

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.440
and see that yeast
sequences were added on.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.210
So what we decided to try, was

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:27.960
to make a synthetic telomere
of the yeast sequence

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.310
and put that into a Tetrahymena extract.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.580
Sure enough, it was elongated

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.400
and the yeast sequence
was the initial sequence,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.730
but what was added was
the Tetrahymena repeat.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.460
- Which was the opposite
of what had happened--

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.293
- Which is the opposite,

00:33:42.293 --> 00:33:44.450
is exactly the converse of
the previous experiment.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.840
Because of the way that
the sequences are set up,

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.850
there was a slight shift
in the banding pattern

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.460
that we saw on the gel

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.570
and that was the second aha moment

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.600
of this series of experiments
that went into the first paper

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.395
because, then, I was really convinced

00:34:01.395 --> 00:34:05.440
that it wasn't just copying
something that was already there

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.700
and that it probably was actually

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.550
adding onto the end of the chromosome.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.390
- Now when you say a shift in the banding,

00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:15.930
you mean the, explain that.

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:18.720
- The way, as I mentioned,
they have this six-base

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.390
periodicity that was the six nucleotides

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:23.300
that are added, TTAGGG,

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.750
well, the yeast sequence, it turned out,

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.440
didn't have four Gs in
the initial template,

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.190
the initial primer that
we were putting in.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.830
It only has three because
that's the yeast sequence.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.360
So, the pattern then, has to make four Gs

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.220
and so it adds one before then

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.800
going into the rest of the pattern,

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:46.800
so everything is shifted up by
one with that yeast sequence,

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:51.590
which, really, fascinated us.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.390
- The next step, as I understand it,

00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:56.710
and, again, this is not my background,

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:00.320
so I'm trying to get you here to explicate

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.370
and you're really doing a great job here.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.760
When does RNA, the realization

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.040
that RNA has something to do with this,

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.110
Explain that--
- So that was the next.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.770
Once we convinced ourselves
that we really have

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.290
a new enzyme that is
actually taking an end

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.440
and adding things on to it,

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.700
then the question becomes,

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.510
well where does that information come,

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.780
how does it know how
to make TTGGGG TTGGGG?

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.490
Because typically things
do copy a template.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.440
And that's when we thought, well, perhaps,

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.820
the enzyme itself has,
within it, a little template

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.410
and that, perhaps, could be made of RNA.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.830
So that was the next thing
we then set out to test is,

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:45.910
could it be that this enzyme
is what we call an RNP enzyme?

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:49.310
It has both protein and RNA within it.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:52.134
And that was the next
series of experiments

00:35:52.134 --> 00:35:56.550
that we identified
something that looked like

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.420
it might be an RNA template.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.350
But then we had to ask ourselves,

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:03.390
can we really prove that
it is the RNA template?

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.690
Another series of
experiments to come at it

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:09.320
from a variety of different angles

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.450
to ask, could we be being fooled

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.514
just because you take the enzyme

00:36:14.514 --> 00:36:18.060
and treat with something
that destroys RNase

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.540
and activity goes away?

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.360
Is that because there's an RNA template

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.510
or is that for some other reason?

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.310
So it was really setting
ourselves a series of challenges.

00:36:31.573 --> 00:36:34.880
- When you published your initial findings

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.260
and then the ones that followed,

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:42.260
how controversial was what you were saying

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:44.940
for the field at that time?

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.720
You said you had to be
your own devil's advocate.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.160
So, clearly, you anticipated

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.590
that people would be coming at you

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.070
and what did you anticipate and--

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.650
- I just to be sure that we were right

00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.980
if we were gonna go out on a limb

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.820
and propose something like this.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.330
There was an alternative model

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.410
whereby one could use a DNA recombination

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:07.420
to get this elongation.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.500
So there were two models
that were out there

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.170
that were published and we were

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.410
looking for evidence for one of them.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.520
But, it's very interesting
because it didn't end up

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.390
really being too controversial.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.780
People accepted it.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.370
We had to make some changes to the paper,

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.940
but, all along, people
said, well, isn't that cute?

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.170
That's a nice little thing that they do

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.140
off in this organism, Tetrahymena.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.820
There wasn't any
realization that this might

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.790
have some sort of a general role.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:39.030
Now, what we know about
telomeres and telomerase

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.350
and they play a major
role in human disease,

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.690
and we had no concept of that back then.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.350
We were just trying to
understand the fundamentals

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.830
of how telomeres were maintained.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.540
We didn't even know that
the human telomeric sequence

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.030
was this same repeated, kind of

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.630
very simple telomeric repeats.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.820
So I wouldn't say that it was,

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.180
necessarily, controversial, but,

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.490
We published in good journals,

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:08.750
but it wasn't taken as a huge deal.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:12.090
- So your aha moment, in a way,

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.650
wasn't a big aha for the community

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:19.100
generally because it wasn't clear,

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.480
Well, so what.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.310
- For the telomere community,
the group of, maybe,

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.850
40 labs across the world
that worked on telomeres,

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.050
it was a big deal.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:31.110
But I would say, the
molecular biology in general,

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.260
telomeres weren't really on the radar.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.990
There's some little problem
over here with replication

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.110
but what's that got to do
with people who are interested

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.840
in understanding how genes are transcribed

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.090
and regulation and
development of organisms?

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:48.440
So the fields that were
really big-deal fields

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.290
were a little bit aside
from what we were doing.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.660
So it was sort of on the side.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.630
- So, in a way, we're learning here,

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.350
something about leadership and science

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:03.350
because here we have curious
people building on a tradition,

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.950
learning stuff from their colleagues

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.850
that helps inform what they're doing

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.910
and, in a way, opening
up a whole new field.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.450
So, initially, you're opening up the field

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.460
for the people who study these telomeres,

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.270
but now we go on to say, hey,

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.390
this may have something to do

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:29.040
with our understanding of
cancer, cystic fibrosis

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:29.873
and other things.

00:39:29.873 --> 00:39:31.750
Talk a little about that next step.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:38.080
- So there had been
experiments, or proposals,

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.610
back in the 1970s.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.110
So this idea about how

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.020
when you replicate the
end of a chromosome,

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.360
you can't replicate to the very end.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.790
Liz Blackburn and I were
aware of a publication

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:52.910
that Jim Watson, the
discoverer of DNA, had proposed

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:55.440
showing that you can't replicate

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.550
to the very end of the chromosome.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:00.150
So we were citing his papers all along.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.000
Well, it turns out that,
around the same time,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.630
there was a Russian
scientist, Alexey Olovnikov,

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:08.040
who had, independently,
come up with the same idea,

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.100
but he didn't call the ends
of the chromosomes telomeres,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.870
he called them margins and so,

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.460
his paper was called a
theory of marginotomy,

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.410
so it wasn't pulled up
by any of our references.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.020
But a colleague of mine,

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.630
who I met while I was in
graduate school, Cal Harley,

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.530
who worked in the field
of cellular senescence,

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:29.800
was aware of this paper and
that this fellow, Olovnikov,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.850
had proposed, not only
did the telomeres shorten,

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.650
but that might play a
role in the fact that,

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:39.240
when you take primary human
cells and put them into culture,

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.787
they go through a certain
number of divisions

00:40:40.787 --> 00:40:42.250
and then they stop dividing.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.080
And that's known as the Hayflick limit,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.680
proposed by Len Hayflick in the 1960s,

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.290
that there's a finite lifespan
that normal human cells have.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.290
So, in talking with Cal Harley,

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.730
he made me aware of this other literature

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.530
which was going back to the '70s as well.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.380
So then, when the human telomeric sequence

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.820
was identified, which wasn't until 19,

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.820
I think it was 1988, was the presentation

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.100
at a conference that I was
at at Cold Spring Harbor,

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.560
and I believe the publication was in 1989.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.510
Then, once we knew what the
sequence was, so, really,

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.180
understanding what the
components are is enabling,

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.810
once we understood that, then
we could do an experiment

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.480
to ask, what does happen
to human chromosomes?

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.130
So I collaborated with Cal Harley,

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.570
and this is what's nice about science

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:36.230
is that you can do experiments
in a blinded fashion.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.070
Because I really like to
know what is the truth,

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.120
and if you do a blinded experiment,

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.390
and you don't have any way of pre-judging

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.360
what the answer is, then you
can really believe it's true.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.730
So Cal Harley had grown some
of these human cells in culture

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.220
for a number of divisions,

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.750
and then he prepared the
DNA and he sent it to me

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.880
with just numbers on the tubes.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.410
I then took that DNA and was able to

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.160
look at the length of the telomeres

00:42:03.719 --> 00:42:06.419
because I now knew the
sequence of the human telomere.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.090
So I did this experiment
and some were long

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:11.990
and some were short and some
were long and some were short

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.020
and then I called him up and
said, okay, what's the key?

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.540
And sure enough, those cells

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.040
that had been dividing for more times

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.380
had shorter telomeres than the ones that,

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.400
And, again, that was very satisfying

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.040
because I couldn't have
been biased in any way

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.820
because I didn't know,
when I did the experiment,

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:29.730
what the results would be.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.350
- So help us understand what the meaning,

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:36.220
the possible meanings of this is for

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.870
coming up with, say, drugs
for cancer, and so on.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:41.980
- What we were able to show is that,

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.360
this cellular senescence,
that is when you take cells

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.300
and they divide for a
limited time in culture,

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.810
that the telomeres would limit them

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:54.520
from dividing more times.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:59.320
One thought, at the time,
and now I think it's also,

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.340
there's support for it,
is that the fact that

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.060
normal cells only go through
a finite number of divisions,

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.100
means that cancer cells have to

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.680
have something wrong with them

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.550
and perhaps the telomeres
might play a role in that.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:16.210
So the finding of the
telomeres that shorten

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.360
with normal cells in culture,

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.910
then led to the question of, well,

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.170
what happens with cancer cells?

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:22.250
Because the difference in a cancer cell

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.390
is that it goes through many
more rounds of divisions

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.030
than it normally should.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.710
So, sure enough, again, with Cal Harley

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.800
and Silvia Bacchetti, we
were able to show that,

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.570
when the normal cell
becomes a cancer cell,

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:38.940
now this enzyme telomerase becomes active.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.450
So, telomerase is active in cancer cells

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.040
and not as active in the normal cells.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.570
- So that if you could figure out

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:49.094
a way to work on that process,

00:43:49.094 --> 00:43:53.610
then you might have a pathway
to all kinds of discoveries.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.740
- There were many thoughts
and many papers published,

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.680
that if you had a way
to inhibit telomerase,

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.100
you could inhibit the
growth of cancer cells.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.230
Now that we know a little bit more

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.440
about the role of
telomerase in normal cells

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.910
because, as it turns out,
it's not just cancer cells

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:11.182
which have to divide many times,

00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:13.380
there are cells in your body,

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.590
which have to replenish other cells.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.650
One example, for instance,
is the blood cells.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.630
Within the bone marrow,
there are cells that normally

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:26.090
divide every day to allow
new blood cells to be born

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.290
because blood cells have
a very limited lifespan.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.530
So there are normal
cells in the human body

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.250
which also have to have telomerase

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:37.320
to be able to maintain their telomeres.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.700
So, the initial story,
which was a cancer story,

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.230
we are very interested in that still

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.720
and we've done a lot of
experiments to show that,

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.520
in fact, limiting the telomere lengthening

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.710
does limit the growth of the cancer cell.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.370
But if you're gonna take that as a way

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.340
to do some sort of therapeutics,

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.730
you also now have to keep in mind,

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:00.710
the role of telomerase in normal cells.

00:45:01.781 --> 00:45:02.636
- I see.

00:45:02.636 --> 00:45:05.100
So, how

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:11.050
it was when you saw these other pathways

00:45:11.468 --> 00:45:13.410
and the general implication

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.742
for medicine and disease and so on,

00:45:15.742 --> 00:45:20.050
that you were then recognized
with the Nobel Prize,

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.160
'cause it took, there was no Nobel Prize

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.040
when you made the initial discovery.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.360
- Right, the initial discovery was just

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.670
understanding the elongation
of telomeres in Tetrahymena.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.250
But then, by continuing
to follow our curiosity,

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.700
I collaborated with Cal Harley

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.860
on the senescence side of things,

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.330
and then got interested in understanding

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:40.320
the role of telomerase in cancer.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.630
We made a mouse that
doesn't have any telomerase

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:45.000
and looked at what happens

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.400
and what are the consequences
of not having telomerase

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.320
and how does that affect cancer?

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.050
By just continuing to be
able to follow our curiosity,

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:56.350
which is what's so nice about
being able to work in academia

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.970
and the National Institutes of Health

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.500
has supported my research
for the last 30 years

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.490
and, if I can write a grant
that's interesting enough,

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:07.820
then I could follow and do those things.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.070
So, by following those things up,

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:15.390
the consequences then for
human health became clear.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:17.680
The thing, as you're saying
about the Nobel Prize,

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.210
is that it's given for
physiology or medicine and so,

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:24.370
the medical implications of the telomerase

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:28.820
and the role in cancer and in
stem cells became apparent.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:33.140
Then, what the Swedish Academy looks at

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.150
is then, okay, who was it
that made the discovery

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:38.050
that allowed this to be clear?

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:41.570
- In an interview you gave
when you won the Nobel Prize,

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:45.060
you made a point that I
found very interesting,

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.980
which is that, it was
very important for you

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.980
to bring your children to
your first press conference.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.010
Talk a little about that
because you make the point

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.960
that men don't do that when
they win the Nobel Prize,

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.410
or hadn't done it.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:01.710
- Oh, I forgot that I had made that point.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.130
But certainly I wanted
my children to be there.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.670
I wanted them to share the day with me.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.310
Mostly that's how I felt, that

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.360
it was a family event and so,

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.130
when I got the call at
five o'clock in the morning

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.040
and then after the phone call
with the Swedish Academy,

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.380
I went and I woke up
my children and I said,

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.050
by the way, I won the Nobel Prize

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.530
and the first thing my son said was,

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.331
"Do I have to go to
school today?" (laughs)

00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:28.164
(Harry laughs)

00:47:28.164 --> 00:47:31.490
Then I said, nope, you don't
have to go to school today.

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:33.390
- The reason I wanted to pursue this is

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:36.520
it's really about, it's saying something

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.430
about women and science,
as opposed to men,

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:42.350
and I wanted to talk a little about that.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:45.270
So, in this work, obviously,

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:49.570
two women are very important in the work

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:54.570
and we're grappling with
the issue as a nation

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.100
of how do we get more women into science.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.090
Talk a little about what women bring

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:03.830
and how to scientific discovery.

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:06.270
You're still doing the same process.

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.740
It's not as if you're
inventing a new science,

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.250
but talk a little about
why we need more women

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:14.990
and what they bring to the table.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:18.380
- Well, the fact that there's only about

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.700
30% at the assistant professor level,

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.950
30% and even higher at the,

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:25.460
at higher ranks of women in science,

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:28.980
really is just unfortunate in terms of

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:32.060
the amount of brain power that
we have in the United States.

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:35.820
If we're gonna have 50% of the people

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:40.220
that may have creative ideas
not really be able to engage,

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.720
then that certainly takes away a lot of

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.480
the possibilities for discoveries.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.220
So I certainly don't think
that women, necessarily,

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.420
have anything unique to offer
for the scientific enterprise

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.550
but they have a lot to offer,

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:56.550
and a lot of times the way our
institutions are structured,

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:01.170
women aren't included in that process.

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:04.650
And so, science is to the
detriment because of that.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.190
- What can we do about the structures?

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.940
What, in particular, holds women back?

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.600
- I think that that's a
really, a larger issue

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.210
than just women in science.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.710
That really has more to do
with our society in general

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:22.800
because, in society at large,
there are discussions ongoing

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.380
about women at higher
positions in business,

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:32.380
on corporate boards, on
various institutions like that.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:36.900
So I don't think that science
is unique in this area,

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.510
that, as a society, we have certain norms

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:45.860
about how men are perceived

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.440
and what kinds of jobs they should have

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.570
and how women are perceived.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:54.280
Although a great amount
of change has occurred,

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.430
for instance, since my
mother's generation,

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.530
really, the numbers haven't followed suit.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.740
For instance, when I was at
Berkeley in graduate school

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.820
50% of us were women in graduate school.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.580
But that has not tracked along.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.290
You would expect, then, if
it were, as people have said,

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:12.400
it's a pipeline issue.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.130
There aren't enough women
coming into the sciences.

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:17.940
If it were a pipeline
issue, we would be at 50%

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.430
at the level of full professors now,

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.150
and we're at the 10 or so percent level.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:26.840
So, it's not a pipeline issue.

00:50:28.558 --> 00:50:30.890
I'm certainly not an expert
in what are the causes

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:32.770
but I've read a number of reports.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:33.880
There was a very nice report

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.470
by the Association of University Women

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.230
that suggested that it's a leaky pipeline

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:44.160
that, although there
are 50% women coming in,

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.990
that, at the different transitions, from

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:48.190
being a graduate student to
being a post-doctoral fellow,

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.570
being a post-doctoral fellow
to an assistant professor,

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:53.710
at each stage, more and more women decide

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.710
not to go on in the pipeline.

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:58.130
So they're coming out of the
pipeline and the questions is,

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:01.300
why and what are the structures

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.460
that we have in place in science,

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.110
but also in general in society, that

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.960
more women make those choices

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.530
than men make those choices?

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:15.380
- You're suggesting that it may
be a larger structural issue

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.810
that applies to the society in general.

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:22.320
- I, certainly, know when
I listen to national fora

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.600
on these kinds of topics,
the issues that I hear

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.300
for women in banking and women in business

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.390
are very similar and,
actually, I feel like

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.130
the women in science probably

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.090
have a little bit of an advantage

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:37.610
because if I were a banker today

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.140
I would have to be certain hours at work

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.970
and I do have two children,
and so it's nice for me

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:49.654
to not have to be quite so constricted,

00:51:49.654 --> 00:51:53.390
proscripted in how many hours I'm at work.

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:55.690
If I have to go off and
see my son in a play

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:56.990
or something like that, I can do that.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:01.220
I have a lot more flexibility
as an academic scientist

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.870
than I would in other areas.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:08.610
So, but yet, still the
same kinds of issues

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:13.390
of this leaky pipeline
exist across the country.

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:15.970
I was very interested
when Anne-Marie Slaughter

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:18.100
who was at Princeton and was working

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:23.100
with Hillary Clinton
in the State Department

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.090
came out with a very provocative
paper in The Atlantic

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:30.440
on why women still can't have it all.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:34.090
And clearly, even in her
field, in political science,

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:36.910
there's very, very similar issues

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:38.900
that prevent women from advancing.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:42.860
- If we look back at your
intellectual journey,

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.520
you were blessed with

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.910
many informal mechanisms,

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:55.640
formal, informal
environments that made you

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.540
the great scientist that you became.

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:01.070
I wanna ask you about science education.

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:04.600
You were blessed with a family environment

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.880
in which you breathed
science even if you didn't

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.910
decide you wanted to be a physicist.

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:12.440
At Santa Barbara, it was a very,

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.530
it was a setting which was not formal

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:19.250
and that would draw on your strengths

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.500
and really prepare you for science.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:25.410
When you came here, you were lucky enough

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:29.230
to work with a distinguished
woman scientist,

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.460
and that might have
been sort of conducive.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.430
So, do you have any thoughts on what

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:40.710
your journey tells us
about what we might do

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.680
with regard to science
education generally?

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.330
- The one thing that was very
clear that helped me a lot

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.320
was being able to try
out different things,

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.290
because sometimes you can't
just read about something

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:54.510
and say, yes, that's what I want to do.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.690
To find out what fits intellectually,

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:59.600
sometimes you actually have
to be in the situation.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.160
So that's something I definitely encourage

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.690
all young scientists or
young people in any area,

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.660
is to go out and experience
a lot of different things.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.500
Because when you're in the environment,

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.540
you can then see what captures

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.910
and what fits best with
your intellectual style.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:18.890
And then you can know what it
is that you want to pursue.

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.826
So I think that having
those kinds of opportunities

00:54:21.826 --> 00:54:24.570
in a number of different settings

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:28.290
was really very, very helpful to me.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:33.053
- And sorta looking to the
future of the work that you do,

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:39.330
what vistas do you see in terms of

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:42.480
questions that we have to answer

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:47.060
along the path that
you have helped define?

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:51.740
- Well this issue of telomeres
and cellular senescence

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:56.350
has really become much more
focused on age-related disease

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:58.500
and the role of telomeres
in age-related disease.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.530
I mentioned the blood cells.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:04.480
So, bone marrow requiring telomerase.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.610
It turns out that there are a
number of age-related diseases

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.850
like immune senescence,
bone marrow failure,

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:15.850
something called pulmonary
fibrosis, liver fibrosis.

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:20.120
There are these diseases that
tend to be diseases of aging,

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.610
where the short telomeres

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:25.630
clearly play a causal
role in those diseases.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:28.330
So, we're even more interested now

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:31.110
in understanding the detailed mechanisms

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:33.100
of how telomeres are maintained.

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:33.933
And despite everything that we've done

00:55:33.933 --> 00:55:35.960
for the past 25 years,

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.380
there's still a lot
that we don't understand

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:41.820
about the regulation of this process

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.110
of the telomere elongation

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.170
and how does it know how much to elongate

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:46.660
and, if it doesn't elongate enough,

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:50.020
then people are at risk for
these age-related diseases.

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.630
So, really understanding that,

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:55.220
and we have to know more
of the actual components

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.920
because that's an enabling
kind of discovery.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.960
So there are still many
open-ended questions

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.940
about both the detailed mechanism

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.580
and then how that relates to disease.

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.940
Why are there these particular
age-related diseases

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.720
that are sensitive to
telomeres and not others?

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.780
So, I really think that there's

00:56:14.814 --> 00:56:17.580
a huge amount still to
be done in this area.

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.970
- Well, on that note, Professor Greider,

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:23.670
I wanna thank you very much
for coming back to Berkeley

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.300
to deliver the Hitchcock lecture

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.390
and taking the time to be on our program.

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:28.350
Thank you very--
- It was my pleasure.

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:29.183
Thank you.

00:56:29.183 --> 00:56:31.040
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.353
for this Conversation with History.

00:56:33.353 --> 00:56:36.853
(upbeat electronic music)
