00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.600
Oooh, reggaeton.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.660
Even as of a couple of years ago, you know, I’d be told specifically by certain club owners, “Don’t play that sh*t.”

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.900
And now those are the same club owners that are booking perreo parties and reggaeton parties.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.080
So it’s like, well, what happened, right? What changed?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.880
Hey guys, it’s Sana, and I’m in New York City exploring the roots of one of the most

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.640
popular musical genres today,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.400
and its journey from being an expression of Afro-Caribbean identity to, well, everywhere!

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.280
You definitely know the reggaeton sound.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.220
While those songs aren’t reggaeton, they do use that very unique rhythm know as Dembow.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.720
And Wayne Marshall, a music historian, can break that rhythm down.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.540
If you've ever heard reggaeton, you've probably heard that running underneath.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.180
You could say somewhere between three-quarters to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.060
100 percent of all tracks contain these actual sounds.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.780
A really good and popular example of a reggaeton song that uses these sounds

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.540
is Daddy Yankee’s 2004 hit “Gasolina.”

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.000
So what are the roots of that rhythm?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.700
Reggaeton is deeply diasporic music

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.320
in a number of different ways.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.320
All of this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for Jamaica, straight up. I always say,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.940
passageway from Jamaica, to the immigrants

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.060
who went to Panama to build the canal,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.080
which is part of my personal lineage.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.400
Reggaeton has this history of being born out of the way

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.540
that people were playing in the clubs, like in Puerto Rico for example,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.120
of taking hip-hop samples, hip-hop loops, dancehall loops, from the original records.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.740
The early origins of reggaeton actually go back to the emergence of dancehall reggae

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.040
in the late ’80s and early ’90s in Jamaica.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.000
It started in literal dance halls, where the “selectors,” or DJs, would mess around with the sound by using the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.460
volume knob to let in as much of the rhythm as they wanted, creating what Marshall calls a “polyrhythm.”

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.080
And then artists actually started building this effect into their own tracks. And it sounded like this:

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.360
So that's an example of what started to become a sort of prevailing pattern in dancehall reggae.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.880
The most influential of these tracks, of course, is Shabba Ranks’ “Dem Bow,” and the original for Dembow

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.360
sounds like this. You'll note that it uses the same

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.880
snare-drum rhythms that we just heard

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.600
on “Poco Man Jam.”

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.280
In Panama, artists like El General started remaking dancehall reggae hits, translating them into Spanish.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.400
This became known as “reggae en Español.”

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.060
And DJ Nelson, a pioneer in reggaeton, explains why the use of Spanish by those Panamanian artists

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.000
was important for him in Puerto Rico, years ago.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.180
“Oh my God, these guys are singing in Spanish, I can understand!”

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.040
Imagine artists from Puerto Rico, singing in Spanish on a hip-hop beat? Dancehall beat? House beat?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.420
Techno beat?

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.700
It's crazy.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.980
OK, so back to Panama.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.920
Many of the artists making reggae en Español songs were the descendants of immigrants from Jamaica and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.440
the West Indies who had moved to Panama in the early 20th century to work on the Panama Canal.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.680
And they wanted to keep in touch with their roots.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.760
A couple generations later, they still had familial and cultural ties

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.640
to Jamaica. Reggae was one of many regional musics that were part of the sort of popular mix.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.580
It was in New York that Panamanian artists like El General actually recorded in Jamaican recording studios.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.700
And a lot of reggaeton’s history and development happened here because it’s here where Panamanians,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.880
Jamaicans, Puerto Ricans and African-Americans crossed communities and sounds.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.940
Those communities, and New York’s hip-hop scene, were instrumental in the development of reggaeton,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.080
as Petra Rivera-Rideau, who studies race and pop culture, explains.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.620
If you talk to early reggaeton artists, you know

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.680
many of them list hip-hop artists in the U.S. as some of their biggest influences.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.560
In New York, Puerto Ricans settled everywhere, but among the neighborhoods where there was

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.440
the largest concentration was the Bronx, the South Bronx, and this is where hip-hop originated.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.720
And that hip-hop sound

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.380
traveled from New York to San Juan.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.160
While a lot of people consider Puerto Rico to be the home of reggaeton, the question of who owns it is

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.680
actually a lot more complicated – because the history of reggaeton is the history of diasporas and migration.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.500
The Noise was one of the most influential collectives to come out of Puerto Rico in the ’90s.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.540
We actually came to the Red Bull Music Festival – you can totally hear the reggaeton playing in the background

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.380
– and we caught up with DJ Negro and DJ Nelson of the Noise.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.280
Before the Noise became a musical collective, it was actually a club in San Juan,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.800
and it’s where artists like Daddy Yankee and Ivy Queen got their start.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.060
The Noise, as a club, was founded in 1991 by DJ Negro.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.420
At the same time, the Noise was pretty much the only place where

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.280
you could listen to music that later became known as reggaeton.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.780
That’s because “underground,” as it was known then,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.960
wasn’t really widely liked and it was associated with criminality and obscenity.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.660
Talking about asses, talking about guns, talking about caseríos,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.140
talking about crazy things. It took the country by surprise.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.660
This is where the parallels between hip-hop in the ’90s and reggaeton in the ’90s get really interesting.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.360
The way hip-hop came from New York’s projects,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.540
“underground” music – proto-reggaeton – was coming out of caseríos,

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.340
or public-housing developments in San Juan.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.640
And just like the projects of New York – or really anywhere in the United States

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.020
– caseríos were associated not only with the working class, but with blackness.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.840
And while a good part of Puerto Ricans are believed to have African and Indigenous ancestry,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.100
the Afro-Puerto Rican community has a history of being stigmatized.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.300
I mean, check this – in the ’90s in particular, black Americans were stigmatized on the mainland through

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.420
associations made between their communities, the projects, drug use, increased so-called “urban crime”

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.060
and “obscene” music.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.560
And so were Afro-Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.740
It's not necessarily true that caseríos were the epicenter of criminal activity.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.460
But they developed a reputation as being a place where a lot of criminal activity, particularly around drugs,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.660
was taking place.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.560
Between 1993 and 1996, the Puerto Rican government actually launched a campaign called

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.500
“Mano Dura Contra el Crimen," or “the Iron Fist Against Crime,” and targeted caseríos in particular.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.060
They used the National Guard and the Puerto Rican police to occupy the caseríos

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.000
as a way to curb violent crime.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.140
And it was a pretty violent occupation.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.960
At the same time Mano Dura was happening, the government also undertook a censorship campaign.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.300
The police came out to the stores and took the tapes, the cassettes,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:07.020
people listening to the reggaeton in the cars get stopped by the police. It was crazy times.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.820
And then in 2002, there was another censorship campaign

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.980
and it was focused on pornography, largely targeting reggaeton music videos.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.840
But because Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, the constitutionally protected free speech prevailed.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:36.260
But that didn’t stop the the stigma that was associated with the music – and that in turn encouraged artists

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.200
to explore their own realities more so in their music.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.340
Popular music in Puerto Rico has been a space where people have contested a lot of these racial ideologies

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.260
and pointed out racial discrimination.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:53.460
Tego Calderón has several songs where he directly calls out this idea of racial harmony as a myth,

00:08:53.460 --> 00:09:00.080
where he talks about institutional discrimination facing black Puerto Ricans in an explicit kind of way.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.480
I also want to point out that even though reggaeton has this reputation of hypersexualizing women,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.160
women singers and rappers were actually part of the scene from really early on.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.100
Take, for example, Ivy Queen, who was part of the Noise.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.360
And today you have women like DJ Bembona and DJ Riobamba

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.980
who are changing the reggaeton scene and image.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.220
We love perreo, but even when you throw some tracks in, you’re like ohh,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.460
hmmm, dayum, maybe I shouldn’t be playing this right now.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.360
But I just love to throw my ass back.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.100
I play those tracks and I’m going to stand in front of it and be like, I’m not supposed to be here.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.700
Like, I’m not supposed to take up this space, but like I’m going to reclaim that space, in the club,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.400
in a way that this was never intended to be.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.860
And then there’s also the question of the whitewashing of reggaeton.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:08.000
I think a big reason that reggaeton has had this huge crossover, general-market moment is that

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.640
it's become whitewashed.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.580
It does erase the roots of the genre, and it does erase a lot of artists that have been there since the beginning

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.600
that are equally if not more talented and amazing that have never had this moment.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.900
But the history of the genre is a history of diaspora communities,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.620
connected through their Afro-Caribbean heritage, trying to reclaim it.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.780
I am Afro-Latina, I am black and I’m proud.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.240
I’m Panamanian, I’m Puerto Rican and I’m all these things together.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.680
No more assimilation, none of that. We have to take up the space that, you know,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.840
the generations before us weren’t able to.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.800
Hey guys, thanks for watching. Hope you enjoyed the video.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.000
Let us know what are some other pop culture histories you want us to delve into.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And hopefully we'll get around to it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.160
