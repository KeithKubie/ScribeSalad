00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.250
Okay Michael, so I would like to give you a quick quiz.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.640
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.420
&gt;&gt; You're welcome, Michael. I'm about helping others. Okay, so

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.710
here's the problem. Let me set it up for you.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.500
You let me know if the, if, if the question

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.240
doesn't make any sense. Okay, so we have a set of

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.180
fea, we have a problem, we have a learning problem

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.730
that has four features in the input space, and I'm labeling

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.240
them a, b, c, and d. And here's a table

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.550
that has some training data. You'll notice that it's all binary,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.640
I'm representing the binary as zeroes and ones

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.760
here, and that's the space that they're in. And

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.870
I have a label, minus or plus, which you

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.450
could also think of as zeroes and ones. Okay?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.140
&gt;&gt; And, here's what I want you to do. I want

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.380
you to find the smallest subset of features of a, b,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.810
c, and d, that's sufficient to get zero training error, for

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.110
these two different learning algorithms, decision trees, the first one, and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.160
the second is perceptron, but a very simple perceptron

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.350
where you simply have w transpose x greater than

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.960
zero. If it's greater than zero, you return positive.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.379
If it's zero or less, you return negative. Got it?

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.840
&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, and so what I have out here are a bunch of checkboxes and I want you

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.520
to check off the variables that you need, or

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.170
the features that you need, in order to allow decision

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.230
tree to get zero training error or to

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.490
allow the simple perceptron to get zero training error.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.050
&gt;&gt; And are we supposed to do this thinking of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.570
it as a filtering thing or a wrapping thing, or?

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.740
&gt;&gt; I see, so you just want to ans, us to answer the question.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.540
&gt;&gt; yes. I want to answer the question and as a hint,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.040
you should be thinking about this as a filtering or wrapping problem.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.290
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was kind of hoping you would tell me

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.030
which of those two.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.410
&gt;&gt; Well let's see, you were really good

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.540
at picking filtering, so think about it as filtering.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.070
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.950
&gt;&gt; So, so, I'm not going to ask you, I'm not going to require as a part

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.880
of the quiz, that you tell me

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.630
what criterion you were using, information gain, or

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.750
entropy, or variance, or anything like that,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.390
but when you give me the answer, I'm

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.240
going to ask you to explain it to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.080
me, because I'm curious what you're thinking, okay?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.120
&gt;&gt; Okay, but I'm allowed to use the label to answer it too?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.288
&gt;&gt; Yes, you're allowed to use the label if you want to, if you

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:09.919
think it's necessary.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.510
&gt;&gt; Right, because filtering methods, I, well I guess you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.270
said that they, they can have access to the label.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.059
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.520
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.550
&gt;&gt; You got it?

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.330
&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah, yeah.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.450
&gt;&gt; Alright, good. Okay, okay. Well so, go.
