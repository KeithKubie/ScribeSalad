00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.430
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron: Welcome
to the first meeting

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.320
of Washington Area
Group for Print Culture.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.580
For 2017/2018 academic year,
we do six meetings a year.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.670
We do September, October, November.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.780
We do February, March, April.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.660
And we have a very wide-open idea
about print culture, anywhere,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.630
anytime is our mantra and we have
also done a lot digital humanities

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.840
technology presentations
in this group as well.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.310
So, if anyone is local or
non-local for that matter,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.570
that maybe interested in
talking to us anytime,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.190
we are always happy
to hear about that.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.770
We have been doing this more than
fifteen years, maybe knocking right

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.270
at twenty, which is kind

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.720
of frightening sometimes,
when we think about it.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.060
But it's been a roaring
success and in all

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.360
that time we have never
had a bad day, never.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.410
&gt;&gt; We don't mean to be putting
so much pressure on you.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.480
&gt;&gt; And we know this is going to
go in the annals of that as well.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.060
We continued this group, when
we started meeting as, you know,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.770
everybody local, anywhere anytime,
because there were a lot of people

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.070
in the area, locally
who were interested

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.370
in creative cultural studies
and there was no forum,

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.670
there was no outlet here, locally.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.970
That's what we aimed to serve,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.270
and hopefully we have
done that a little bit.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.570
We have a reflector email
list that if you're not

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.810
on the list you can talk
to myself or my colleague,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.070
Donald Sutherland [phonetic
spelling] at some point

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.730
in today's proceedings we would
love to get you on the list.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.680
We have a website; our
schedule is up there.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.550
And we are going to be having
Tommy Lee, as one of our attenders,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:42.550
as he speaks to us, Victoria Burke
who is going to be at the folder

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.330
from the university of Maryland,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.340
who is really interesting
media transition stuff.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.070
So, we have an exciting program.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.390
So, we hope you, if you're
in the area, you can join us,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.370
for as many of those as possible.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.820
We go for drinks and dinner
afterward, it's a great place

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.820
to continue, continue the
conversation, meet folks

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.120
and I think we are a
pretty congenial group,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.430
we have a good time doing
that and we invite you along,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.170
if you're interested, in
coming along for that.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.000
So we're going to be new, we
are webcasting, so we're going

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.180
to be working, what do you call it,
kind of dip the blocking on this,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:49.150
so this is a new adventure for us
certainly and I think and to a lot

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.450
of us I think, to a certain extent.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.050
We're very grateful to
the support we've had,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.350
especially from John Holden who is
with the center for the book fair

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.970
at the Library of Congress
and now Mark [inaudible]

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.410
in the rare books division,
have been more than wonderful

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.710
to help us with this group.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.010 position:56%
So, Eleanor Shevlin is going to
give our speaker today Paul Salzman,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.400
who is with us all the way
from Australia an introduction,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.080
and we will move on to
the heart of the matter.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.380
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin:
Thank you [inaudible],

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.180 position:56%
will be giving a short introduction,
so we can hear and spend a lot

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.350
of time listening to Paul.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.650
I would just say, that next
week October, not next week,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.000
our next meeting is October 6 with
Michele Troy from the, working on,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.620
who has worked on the Albion press
and her book will be coming out.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.610
Today we are very pleased to
have Paul Salzman at the HA,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.280
he's an emeritus professor,
of English Literature

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.150
from the La Trobe university

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.830
and he has recently been
appointed a Professorial fellow

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.480
at the university of
Newcastle in Australia.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.320
So, he is from quite far away.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.490
He has published widely,
on early modern literature

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.580
and his most recent book
is literature and politics

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:15.250
in the 1620s, Whispered
Council, 2014.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.770 position:56%
He's here on a Folger, short term
Shakespeare at programs 2 fellowship

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.940
and he is working, the project he's
going to be speaking about today,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.500
his work he is doing there,
is related to his next book.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.980
It's scraps, titled today's
talk is Scrapbook Shakespeare,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.330
[inaudible] preparation

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.340
of a nineteenth century
Shakespeare edition.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.310
Let's give Paul [inaudible].

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.260
[ Applause ]

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.560
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: So
I was going to start

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.570
by giving you a quick guided
tour through the history

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.390
of Shakespeare editions before we
reach the mid-nineteenth century,

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.380
which is where we are going
to be for most of my talk,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.300
and some people here are going to
be familiar with what I'm going

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.930
to start with outlining, so you can
nod off at this point and I'll let,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.230
you know, when you can wake up,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.020
which will be when we reach James
Orchard Holywell in the mid 1650's.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.180
So, start with about how were
Shakespeare's plays were initially

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.790
published individually, in
a form known as a quarto,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.310
approximately the same
size as a modern paperback

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.010 position:56%
and was seen as similarly ephemeral.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.780
Some of the plays were
published more than once,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.350
in the quarto format,
Hamlet which appeared

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:37.430
in two quite different quarto
versions in 1603 and 1604.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.730
The very first publications,

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.820
the very first Shakespeare
publications were in 1594,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.540
when what we now call
Henry VI part two

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.360 position:56%
and Titus Andronicus were published.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.050
It was only seven years
after Shakespeare's death

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.350
that his plays were
gathered together,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.640
and you might say were
edited for the first time.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.140
The first folio published in
1623, large numbers of them,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.060
sitting at the folio Shakespeare
library, just around the corner,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.150 position:56%
was put together by John Himmeys and
Henry con Dale, who were important

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.480
in the Shakespeare acting
company, the King's Men.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.050
Contains few texts of the plays
previously published in quarto

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.970 position:56%
and I see plays that were never
previously published, making a total

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.630
of thirty-six and establishing
Shakespeare's cannon.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.160
Though that cannon did
end up in various ways

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.800
from the later 70s century
through to the present day,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.510
when the attribution Phyllis
are currently having a field day

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.860
on who wrote what compared to,
Shakespeare and [inaudible].

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.460
for the rest of the
seventeenth century,

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.330
three further folios appeared,
and each one could be said

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.550
to be a revised, but
unauthorised Shakespeare's play.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.980
So, the second, which was
published in 1632 was edited

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.220
to include minor updates of
spelling and punctuation.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.020
The third, 1663 is significant,
because it was published just

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.310
after the restoration of the
monarchy, meant that the theatres,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.060
which of course had been shut
for nearly 20 years had reopened

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.420
and Shakespeare's plays
were being performed again.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.060
For the second impression
of this addition,

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.960
seven new plays were added.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.020
All of them except the parts
of Pericles and that was seen

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.440
to be opraful and finally

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.540
in the seventeenth century the
full folio was published in 1694

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.420
and was essentially a
reprint of the third,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.560
although it's a significant volume,
because it served as a source text

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.530
to many of the eighteenth
century editions of Shakespeare.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.730
So, the publication of
the restoration folios,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.320
coincides with the revival
but also the adaptation

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.630
of Shakespeare's plays, in
the new re-opened theatres.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.360
For example, Dryden's adaptations
of the Tempest and Anthony

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.000
and Cleopatra and this
was the historical moment,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.530
when Shakespeare was to
adapt Ben Johnson's tribute,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:08.300
in his dedicatory poem, in the
folio, suddenly seen as not

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.020
for all time but rather of age.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.620
Dramatists felt it was
necessary to drag Shakespeare

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.840
into the second half of
the seventeenth-century.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.510
So this is when we had most famous
example, Mahem Tates adaptation

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:28.120
of King Lear 1681, and which
alongside many other alterations

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.800
by a happy ending.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.760
Tates version of Lear had
dominated the stage for much

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.290
of the eighteenth century, although
it too was altered in various ways.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.490
The editing of Shakespeare in the
eighteenth century was inspired

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.560
by similar ideas, which was that
Shakespeare was certainly a genius,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.570
but he was an antiquated one, who
had to be approved by an editor,

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.910
in order to be comprehensible.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.070
The eighteenth century was when
Shakespeare began to be edited

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.060
in a way that we might
recognize as modern editing.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.730
His language and punctuation
were modernized,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.640
editors annotated passages
that needed explaining

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.400 position:56%
and they changed words and phrases,
that they considered to be mistakes,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.880
whether the mistakes were
made by early printers

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.270
or possibly even by
Shakespeare himself.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.220
Unfortunately, from the
very beginning editing seems

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.040
to have gone hand-in-hand with
mean minded bad-tempered rivalry

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.660
between editors, something
I'm afraid to say,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.530
that continues to this very day.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.390
Setting that aside,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.070
in the eighteenth century there
were great editors of Shakespeare,

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.930
but they didn't really
produce great additions.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.360
In 1709 with the publication
of the collected edition,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.850 position:56%
edited by Nichols Road and published
by Jacob Thompson, whose firm was

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.650
to maintain a tight hole on
Shakespeare during the century.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.350
the structure of collected
Shakespeare additions was set

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.790
in a format that perseveres
to the present day.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.720
This six-volume edition begins
with a biography of Shakespeare,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.090
with Road excusing this with
the formula that was also

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.230
to become common during
the period, He says.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.560
Though the works of Mr. Shakespeare
may seem to many not to want

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.540
to comment, yet, I fancy some
little account of the man himself,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.300
may not be thought improper,
to go along with them.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.750
His hesitation of the biographical
details and the necessity

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.040
of them was to shift
quite dramatically.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.710
So that by the nineteenth century
every possible biographical tidbit,

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.470
related to Shakespeare was
treated with reference.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.460
Including many that were
of doubtful veracity.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.910 position:56%
Road, also established a practice
of regularization of things like act

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.580
and scene divisions, as well
as standardized cast lists

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.280
at the beginning of the play,
along with the modernization

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.730
of spelling and punctuation.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.180
Road based his texts
on the forth folio

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.610
and again he set a
precedent whereby most

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.200 position:56%
of the succeeding eighteenth-century
traditions,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.450
simply build on their
immediate predeceases.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.590
Alexander Pope's addition
followed in 1725,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.390
an in addition the quickly
attracted controversy

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.730
because Pope went much
further than Road,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:12.320 position:56%
in correcting Shakespeare's text,
in a move that we might say benignly

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.710
as one major poet reproducing
another,

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.280
in line with the literary
taste that prevailed,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.480
a century after Shakespeare.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.270
Apart from Pope, the most famous
writer who edited Shakespeare

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.670
in the eighteenth century
was of course Samuel Johnson.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.880
Johnson 1765 edition became
famous for his commentary

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.180
and his much-quoted preface,
rather than his textual authority.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.010
Preface, contains Johnson's
axiomatic reflections

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.150
on Shakespeare's universality
including the much-quoted phrase,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.760
"Nothing can please
me and please long

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.390
but just representations
of general nature."

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.320
Johnson exemplified the idea
that I have been suggesting,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.650
is reflected in 18 century
editing, practices in general.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.620
That is that Shakespeare
needs to be extracted

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.820
from his historical context and
helped by editors to be confirmed

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.660
as universal, as not of
an age but for all time.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.800
Johnson's addition was revised
by Stevens and then by Read.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.800
And Johnson exemplifies
another significant aspect

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.790
of Shakespeare editing, that
again has had an influence

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.380
down to the present day,
and that's the practice

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.510
of incorporating earlier
editors, annotations

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.990
and often their emendations
in to successive editions.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.730
The idea that each addition
built upon its predecessor,

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.720
was really only counted
by an addition

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.430
of Edward Tycho was
published in 1760's.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:42.840
It was Tycho who pioneered the
idea of returning to the source.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.150
So that he actually
collated the original quartos

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.380
and folios producing
thoughtful emendations

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.530
that are still referenced by
current Shakespeare editors.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.820
Unfortunately for Tycho, his
achievements were overshadowed

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.510
by the work of Edmond Malone,
the first editor to be considered

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.810
at least by modern scholars,

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.820
as someone who approached the
methodological rigour required

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.880 position:56%
from more reliable and somewhat less
subjective approach to the plays.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.940
Malone tried to determine
a chronology for the plays,

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.640
which had in previous
editions been gathered together

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.450
under the generic categories,

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.890
that had been gathered
together in the first folio.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.660
With the Tempest coming first,
and Sibling coming last.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.120 position:56%
Malone's edition was a benchmark for
authenticity, given his careful use

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.600
of early texts especially
his use of the first folio.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.630
The influence of Malone's work
was consolidated, after his death

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.310
by an expansion and
revision of his addition

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.020
that was undertaken by
James Boswell Junior.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.350
Published in 1821, this revised
version of Malone became known

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.430
as the very early edition,
because it incorporated So much

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.340
of the material from earlier
editions, reprinting the prefaces

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.420
from the editions of Pope,
Tible, Panda, Woverton, Johnson,

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.820
Caple and Stephens and using
many of their annotations.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.640
This addition helps sway as
authoritative, until the middle

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.030
of the nineteenth century, when
in terms of editorial rigor,

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:11.100
it was superseded by the so-called
Cambridge edition, in the 1860's.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.580
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: So, it's at
this point that I want to talk

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.990
about James Hallowell,
so you can wake

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.890
up if you were sleeping
until this point.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.880
But I just need to say a few more
things about the state of editing

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.570
in the mid-nineteenth century.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.420
The most significant and in the
end notorious event in the editing

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.990 position:56%
of Shakespeare in the ninth century,
was the announcement in 1852

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.040
by the eminent scholar JP collier,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.360
that he had come upon a second
folio filled with emendations

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.490
in early seventeenth century hand,

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.040
sorry it's not easy
to see that photo.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.520
Collier's discovery caused a great
stir, which he capitalized on.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.340
First that the book containing
a selection emendations,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.920 position:56%
which he considered to be by an
early owner of the folio whose name,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.820
Thomas Perkins was inscribed
on the front of the volume,

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.850
and then in his 1857
edition of Shakespeare,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:08.770 position:56%
suddenly the subjective alterations,
and emendations of modern editors,

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.020 position:56%
could be weighed against the bedrock
of someone, who is not only close

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.880
to Shakespeare in time, but Collier
implied perhaps possessed early

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.840
manuscripts, but gave
Pickens his alterations

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.760
to the text considerable authority.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.440
And this authority of course was
transferred to Collier himself

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.950
until the whole situation
began to unravel,

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.150
as people became suspicious
the folio was finally examined

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.890
by various experts in the
British Museum and it became clear

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.090
that the Pickens annotations
were written in a modern hand,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.910
pretending to be a
seventeenth-century hand.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.770
this point in time
that James Hallowell,

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.720
had taken a cautious
approach to the denunciation

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.720
of Collier even though
he was certain

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.390
that the Pickens emendations was
spurious, began work on what was

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.900
to be the most ambitious and
expensive Shakespeare addition

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.460
of the nineteenth century.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.340
There he is, in a very
handsome pair of trousers.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.120
Hallowell was born in 1820,

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.250
when even as a schoolboy he began
collecting books and manuscripts.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.070
Hallowell then went to Cambridge,
where he was at Trinity College

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:15.340
as an undergraduate and then
life, later at Jesus college.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.940
He had a particular
interest in scientific

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.070
and mathematical manuscripts and
began publishing in that era,

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.410
when he was only 18 years old.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.880
Unfortunately, his
love of this material

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.540
and perhaps [inaudible] the income
astray and he seems to of made off

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.300
with a number of Trinity
College manuscripts.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.850
Which he made the mistake
of selling to a bookseller

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.920
who then on-sold them
to the British Museum.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.730
That was, I want to stress because
I've become very fond of him,

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.070
which you do when you work
on someone for a long time,

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:52.630
his only lapse, unlike Collier,
who didn't do any thieving,

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.530
but he did do a large amount
foraging in his career.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.580
Hallowell moved from
Cambridge to London and set

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.410
about establishing his
credentials as a man of letters,

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.750
becoming foundation
member of the Percy society

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.550
and the Shakespeare Society,

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.200
and editing numerous obscure
works for both institutions.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.490
Hallowell combined his scholarly
and his commercial pursuits,

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.770 position:56%
moving between collecting rare
books and manuscripts, editing them,

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.980 position:56%
issuing bibliographical descriptions
of them and then selling them.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.380
While he was still a student,
Hallowell had some dealings

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.490
with Sir Thomas Phillips, who
was perhaps the greatest book

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.410
and manuscript collector
of the nineteenth century.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:37.270
Phillips spent a small fortune
collecting an enormous range

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.440
of literature and when he
was approached by Hallowell,

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.440
he allowed Hallowell to visit
his house at Middle Hill

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.710
in Worcestershire,
to help classify some

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.210 position:56%
of the material that was held there.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.720
When he was there Hallowell

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.340
and Phillips's eldest daughter
Henrietta fell in love.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.460
Henrietta was a great catch
because not only did she stand

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.270
to inherit Phillips' estate, but
she has been trained by her father

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.720
to be a skilled copyist
of early manuscripts.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.980
She was her letters and
diaries reveal clever was she,

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.350
and forthright.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.000
Unfortunately for James and
Henrietta, Thomas Phillips who was

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.460
at the best of times and irascible
and greedy man I am to pray

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.650
with Hallowell's father and,
so he forbids the match.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.580
The young lovers decided to elope

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.380
and Henrietta's father's response
was to disown his daughter

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.050
and then he spent the rest of his
life trying to ruin James's career.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.160
There's a wonderful letter from
Henrietta to James explaining

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.410
that she is prepared to abandon
her home and her family in order

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.620
to marry him, but she
needs to know first of all,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.550 position:56%
what kind of financial settlement
he would make, if he predeceased her

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.640 position:56%
as she believed that she would
never be reconciled with her father,

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.640
which was indeed the case.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.550
James evidently set aside
Henrietta's prenuptial [inaudible]

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:59.160
and they were married
in August 1842.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.220
Henrietta's furious father waged by
psychological war on his daughter,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.320
who was his air, and
he spent a great deal

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.540
of time running his estate down,

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.290
in order to reduce what she would
inherit and most especially,

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.750
he wanted to prevent his son-in-law
from ever accessing his collection

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.090
of books and manuscripts.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.810
Which he managed through the
contrivance of packing them up

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.970
and shifting them from the house,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.030
despite all of Thomas Phillips
efforts, the marriage between James

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.900
and Henrietta was a very happy
one and Henrietta continued

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.280
to be an enormous resource for
her husband's literary labors,

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.690
undertaking copious
amounts of transcription

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.340
as well as proofreading for him.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:41.070 position:56%
James carer nearly came to an end in
1845, when those suspicious dealings

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.090
with the Trinity college
manuscripts came to light,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.370
and his prosecution
was of course urged on,

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.580
by the constantly antithetical
Thomas Phillips.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.860
But in the end, James was
if not entirely exonerated,

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.220
left relatively unscathed because
the accusations couldn't be proven.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.290
He therefore continued
his combination of dealing

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.570
in early modern books
and manuscripts

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.720
and his editorial work moving
towards his Shakespeare edition,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.260
for which a prospectus appeared
in notes and queries, in 1852.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.570
Hallowell planned for an
addition that would be

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.320
in many ways a monument to
Shakespeare, it would act as a kind

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.440
of illustrated Shakespeare
encyclopaedia.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.650
So in the notes and queries,
on note which is hard to read,

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.950
I'm going to read it out.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.970
It says, "the works of Shakespeare,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.530 position:56%
the greatest of all uninspired
authors, should surely be surrounded

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.520
in one edition at least, by
the reading of the student,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.470
the pencil of the archaeological
drafts-man.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.140
In one edition, let every source
of useful illustration be explored

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.250
and rendered accessible to the
student and future editor and even

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.970
if that is something redundant,

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.980
much will remain suggestive
familiar explanations

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.480
of obscurities and
more popular uses."

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.100
During on his entrepreneurial
side, James decided to ensure

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.770
that the addition would be rare
and concomitantly expensive.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.480
It was to be open for
subscription and will be published

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.820
in an edition limits to 150 copies,
printed on the best possible paper,

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.140
in a format mimicking the
size of the first folio

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.290
and copiously illustrated
by Frederick Fay Holt

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.000 position:56%
and also would be full of facsimiles
of manuscripts and documents,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.650
using techniques that James
had perfected for some

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.010
of his earlier editing
work and there's a copy

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.770
in the wonderful State
Library of Victoria

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.340
in my hometown, of Melbourne.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.310
The key to this massive editorial
project is Hallowell's obsession

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.590
with illustrative material.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.850 position:56%
From a textual point of view, the
addition is relatively conservative.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.890
However, I was able to draw a large
personal collection of early texts

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.810
and was also given access
to many held by others.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.430
Perhaps the most notable example
of this was the University

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.660
of Edinburgh's willingness
to loan him,

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.700
it's then apparently unique
copy of the second quarto

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.070
of Titus Andronicus, which resulted

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.900
in Halle bequeathing the university
library and extensive collection

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.880
of his early modern books.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.540
In that respect the edition,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.690
had the merit of Hallowell paying
attention to early source texts.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.800
However, he did not do a great deal

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.050 position:56%
of what we would now call serious
editing, relying mostly on the folio

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:20.010
as his authoritative source
text, and while stating a policy

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.340
of relatively cautious emendation,

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.560
Hallowell frequently
changes the text

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.760
without offering much explanation
for why he does what he does.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.610
He did however make the
vitally important point

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.090
that the first folio
had an authority

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.030
that the second and
third folios lacked.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.060
This was not necessarily
taken for granted at the time,

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.160
when many early editors, as
I pointed out earlier on,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.370
had given the emendations
and alterations

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.340
of life it folios some authority.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.250
This is also an indirect criticism

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.340
of Colliers is supposed
Perkins folio,

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.310
because as Hallowell
gently pointed out.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.490
Even if one believes that the
emendations and annotations

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.830
in that book where authentic,
they would in a second folio,

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:07.970 position:56%
not the first, which have to be seen
as having only limited authority.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.680
In terms of explanatory matter,
it's important to distinguish

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.990 position:56%
between Hallowell's
illustrations, which are an original

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.480
and fascinating attempt to
contextualize everything

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.930
for the radar and his
annotations which tends

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.560
like so many previous
editions, to reproduce

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.420
but with due acknowledgment, the
explanations of earlier editors.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.880
Hallowell was only unusual

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.220
in favoring Edward Thypo whose
fascinating editorial labors

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.530
as I already mentioned, in
the light editing century,

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.900
had been largely eclipsed by those

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.640
of Edmund Hallowell
will was writing.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.130
So while Harriet Hallowell's
edition is not a very norm edition,

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.670
it does often sought the
most obvious annotations

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.990
from past conditions.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.970
Looking at some pages of the
addition is rather like looking

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.920
at a Shakespeare encyclopaedia.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.360
I'll take a relatively
minor play, the Merry Wives

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.100
of Windsor as an example.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:03.620
Hallowell offers facsimiles of
the two early Merry wives quartos.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.670
The facsimile process
for the edition,

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.360
was carried out by the highly
skilled printer, Edmond Ashby,

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.320
who had collaborated with
Hallowell in the past,

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.830
especially in the production

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.160
of the facsimile series
of Shakespeare quartos.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.920
This facsimile process
involved tracing the original

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.530
and then reproducing it through
lithography, as opposed of course,

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:28.280
to modern a graphical
processes of facsimile making,

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.730
which develop later in
the nineteenth century.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.150
So, the existence of
numerous facsimiles like these

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.690
of the Merry Wives of Windsor
quartos, adds to the rarity,

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:42.250
expense, an overall attractiveness
of how the Hallowell's edition.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.000
Hallowell also incorporated
numerous painstaking illustrations

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.990
by Frederick Fair Holtz.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:49.350
Fair Holtz had the unique quality

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.190
of being both a skilled
engraver, and an antiquarian.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.790 position:56%
Fair Holtz woodcuts are often
produced through his own researchers

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.840
as much as by Hallowell's
directions.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.730
So just to take a fairly
random example.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:07.730
Fair Holtz, both illustrates and
explains the partisan referred

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.390
to in the opening scene of Hamlet

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.280
when Marcella's office
to strike the ghost.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.920
Fair Holtz gives us a description
of the particular type of weapon,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.610
he's managed to find an
example at Goodrich court

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:22.230
and he offers an illustration
to show us what one looked like.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:26.000 position:56%
When you look through the 16 volumes
of Hallowell's edition or even only

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.180
through one of them, you can
see what an achievement was,

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.410
the edition, in terms not just of
its monumentality but also in terms

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.470
of its scope and the sheer volume
of information it contains.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.450
It's true that the two
main criticisms aimed

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:44.590
at Hallowell's edition when it came
out was that it was too expensive

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.320
and also that it was overwhelming
and that the illustrative material

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.750
over powered the actual plays.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.780
Now that second criticism is
of course a perennial issue

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.900
for Shakespeare additions
right through to the present.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.320 position:56%
Hallowell did not intend his edition

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.300
to be what we might
call a reading edition,

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.690
it would would certainly knock you
out, if you try to read it in bed,

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.240
but rather, a reference addition.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.500
So the modern equivalent has been
the Arden series, where the notes

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.870
in some people's opinion
overwhelm the text.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:19.900
Mind you, an item page looks like
this, while Hallowell put his notes

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.500
that the end of each
acts, so his actual types

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.510
of text are clean and elegant.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.460 position:56%
Despite its size though, the edition
was not able to incorporate all

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.240
of how Hallowell's
monumental research.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.450
Hallowell might be described
as a compulsive collector

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.690
of material related to early
modern literature in general

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.200
and Shakespeare in particular.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.600
And this was manifested in
an extraordinary collection

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.440
of scrapbooks, which he
assembled as part of the task

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.570
of putting the edition together
and also as part of his researches

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.860
into early morning
literature in general.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.360
He then decided to put these
together to form a kind

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.140
of supplementary archive
to the addition.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.440
Creating these scrapbooks
become a fundamental part

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.260
of Hallowell's research procedure
and examples are now large

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.470
at the University of
Edinburgh Library,

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.780
where I was looking
at them a month ago.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.210
The Shakespeare Birthplace
Trust Library

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.410
and of course the Folger
Shakespeare library,

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.590 position:56%
which is why I'm here in Washington.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.750 position:56%
University material was presented
along with a considerable collection

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.090
of early morning books
and manuscripts.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.960
As I said before in gratitude
for the line of the times

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.970
and drunkest quarto and I'm
also Hallowell presented Denver

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.280
with 300 volumes of his
correspondence, they may

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.170
or may not have been so excited
about that, because the gift,

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.470
Henrietta's diary and about 100
volumes of notes, scrapbooks,

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.320
indexes, and other material
that was essentially devoted

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.710
to Shakespeare himself
as opposed to clients.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.730
This included notes on
how Hallowell's meticulous

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.690
and usually completely
fruitless troll through records

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.880
of many counties and of sources
such as court roles, chancery

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.680
and exchequer records, in search
of references to Shakespeare.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.590
Motivation to all things
connected Shakespeare extended to

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.880
and entire volume,
devoted to material related

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.180
to a story almost completely
discredited by Hallowell's time

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.270
of Shakespeare going
on a drinking spree

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.760
and passing out under a crabtree.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.910
Hallowell even acquired two
volumes of material produced

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:24.160
by the notorious light 18th century
forges Samuel and William Island.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.700
Samuel was a desperate
and frustrated search

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.110
of full authentic Shakespearean
relics and his son William obliged

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.530
by forging copious correspondence
supposedly by Shakespeare,

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.310
and an entire play and even a
love letter from Shakespeare

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.160
to Anne Hathaway complete with
a lock of Shakespeare's hair.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.880
A similar lock has long been part
of the Folger collection along

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.050
with five copies of the love
letter and it's been the subject

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.850
of very interesting essay,
by Jonathan Gil Harris.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.310
It seems that no one has noticed
the companion lock and poem

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.590
in Edinburgh University Library.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.290
Probably like pieces of the true
cross, I suspect, lots of shapes

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.270
where in the late eighteenth
century.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:10.200
Hallowell decided to deposit
the scrapbooks associated

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.150
with the actual folio edition,

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.680
at the Shakespeare Birthplace
Trust library in Stratford.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.680
This was fitting because
Hallowell was instrumental

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.730
in establishing the trust,
pushing for its acquisition

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.990
of the various properties
associated with Shakespeare,

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.490
so he kind of pioneered
the tourist industry

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.910
for which we may or
may not be grateful.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.830
And also with the establishment
of a library as part of the trust.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.090
And he donated many
rare and precious items

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.980
from his own collection to the
trust as it was being established

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.630 position:56%
and throughout the rest of his life.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.990
When I first heard about the
scrapbooks that were associated

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:45.890
with the folio edition, I expected
them to be rough and ready,

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.430
perhaps like the recipes pasted

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.200
into old exercise books,
that we have at home.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.960
Not at all, Hallowell has a series

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.290
of beautifully bound volumes,
roughly quarto in size.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.430
There are four main things
that Hallowell collected

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.840
in the scrapbooks, cross-references
to ideas or images in the plays,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.600
taken from the sixteenth and
seventeenth century writing,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.980
actual textual variants of words or
passages between different quarto

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.010
and folio texts of the plays,
visual illustrations of ideas

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:19.610
or objects referred to in the
plays taken from other books,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.700
and a very small number
of illustrations drawn

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.020
or painted by Hallowell himself.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.450
So, starting with the first
category, Hallowell would

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:31.570
for example go looking for examples
of an expression such as Hamlets,

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.320 position:56%
his quotas make with a beard bodkin.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.980
So, Hallowell found
one, in a 1635 copy

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.280
of George Haeckel's apology
first published in 1627.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.630
The first thing to say about
this, is that is evidence

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.230
of Hallowell's enormously wide
reading, because Haeckel is far

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:50.660
from being a mainstream author.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.770
But of course, the main thing that
leaps out for a modern scholar,

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:56.990
is the fact that Hallowell blithely
cut the bid out of Haeckel's text

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:00.730
that interested him and
pasted it into his scrapbook,

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.240 position:56%
leaving behind a mutilated pamphlet.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.490
Perhaps we won't get too
agitated about a chunk as it

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.300
out of an obscure pamphlet.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.670
But what about chunks cut
out of the second folio

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.950
in fourth quarto of Hamlet?

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.710
Here are some examples
as Hallowell ruminates

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:17.570
on the scene of Hamlet's fifth.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.320
Starting with the quarto, where
the dying grown found only

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.890
in the folios written in, and
then from the second folio

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.500
with a suggested emendation
of all grows,

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.160
for all crows again written in.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.100
There are many examples
of the sliced up quarto

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.690
and folio texts in the scrapbooks.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:41.470 position:56%
I should say that the current staff
at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust,

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.370
are rather conflicted
about this evidence

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.940
of devil may care scissor wielding.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.990
On the one hand they are
horrified that anyone would cut

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:53.410
up a Shakespeare quarto on folio,
on the other hand they all write it

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.210
to Hallowell, who is
responsible for many

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.480
of the unmutilated
early Shakespeare texts.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.180
In the ninth century in particular,
collectors were quite prepared

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.500
to my imperfect copies of the
early books with pages taken

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.820
from other copies as well as
with hand-drawn facsimile pages.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.830 position:56%
So, Hallowell in his role as book
dealer, rather than editor was happy

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.180
to engage in this process.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.690
This occurred most relevantly
with his purchase and resale

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.930
of the first folio, that's
known as the George Smith folio.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:28.170
He resold it at a loss, I should
say to Frederick Overry offering

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.750
to replace the pages
that had rust holes,

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.750
with pages that he would happily
take from what he described

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:38.020
as the six imperfect copies
that he had lying around.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:43.090
Interestingly Hallowell said,
quote "it would be a pity to do so,

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:45.960
the defects being insignificant
and the operation,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.020
one which would impair the
integrity of the volume."

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.010
But Overry did take up the
offer and Hallowell Julie cut

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.830
out the relevant pages
and slipped them in.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.630 position:56%
So, scrapbooking from Shakespeare
quarters and folios was not uncommon

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:04.260 position:56%
and far from a hanging offence,
however startling it might be to us.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.820
Taken together with the editing
process as practiced by Hallowell,

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.540
this is really a notion of
the archive as an assemblage,

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.790
that it is empowering for the
assembler, it takes source material

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.420
as raw material to be shaped in
the service of a set of ideas,

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.600
being tried out as part of
the recontextualizing process.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.190
If Hallowell cut up pieces of
Shakespeare quartos and folios

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.720
as part of his book
dealing, it's less surprising

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.870 position:56%
that he might also do so, as part of
the scrapbook process where the cut

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.410
out sections, related
to textual issues,

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:38.350
that he was mulling
over to his edition.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:41.070
However, when assembled
within the scrapbooks as part

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:45.280
of the accumulation of material
related to the individual plays,

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.300 position:56%
the textual extracts become part of
what I've been considering is a kind

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.300
of supplementary archive
for the edition.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.180
This process also bears
some resemblance

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.000
to the early modern
practice of common placing.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.160
In general terms this is being
seen as a process of gathering

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.650
and reordering of information,
usually by writing

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.430
into a commonplace book
extracts that might

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.690
or might not be gathered
together thematically,

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.360
under a variety of topics.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.880
This is generally been seen
as a process of recording

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.840
and to some extent even
rewriting the source material.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.810
Either through the sifting process,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.210
undertaken by the individual
reader/writer

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.150
or through scribal copying.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:29.800
Recent approaches have
stressed that the practice

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.010
of common placing was eclectic
and that individual readers

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:35.290
or writers compiled
material for a variety

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.670
of reasons using a
variety of methods.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.590
Adam Smythe for example
sees what he describes

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:46.050
as commonplace book culture, as
eclectic and highly individual.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.490
Examples of commonplace
books look rather different

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.420
to Hallowell's scrapbooks,

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.660
because commonplace books were
generally manuscript compilations

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.050
of extracts, that were written out.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:00.520
Printed commonplace books, a genre
that in some ways he dissected

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.820
with miscellanies of verse,

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.880
in the seventeenth century
were similarly compilations,

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.850
that looked somewhat
like anthologies.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.310
But scholars have also
started to explore the way

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:14.360
that at least some instances,
texts were cut up and reordered

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.220
in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries,

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.320
and these reconstituted texts
I think offer suggestive way

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.290
of reconsidering Hallowell's
procedures.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.800 position:56%
Juliet Fleming has been at the
forefront of a materialist approach,

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.330
which has uncovered
a whole range of what

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.820
in the past would be have
been seen as transgressive

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.300
and unusual instances of writing,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:40.280
notably graffiti, tattoo,
s and collage.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.050 position:56%
Fleming argues that what is being
seen as abhorrent was in fact common

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.800
and that writing was enacted
in the material fashion,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.550
that's also evident in the more
conventional context of print,

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.950
whereas now will recognize
every individual copy

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.500
of an early modern book was unique.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.310
Fleming together with William
Sherman and Adam Smythe,

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.700
Adam is actually talking
at Johns Hopkins,

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.740
I think the week after next.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.600 position:56%
So well worth going and hearing him.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.030
So that is it a special edition
of the Journal of medieval

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:14.540
and early modern studies, devoted
to the idea of renaissance collage,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.800
which includes the
process of cutting up

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.690
and reconstructing
books and manuscripts.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:23.220
In the introduction, Fleming
stresses that early modern readers,

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.140
as they read and read by
cutting printed books.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.800
Individual essays in this special
issue examine various instances

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.420
of this process in detail
through a series of case studies

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.350
of what Fleming succinctly
calls the customizing of books.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:43.200
Flemings positive re-envisaging all
of the cut Is especially pertinent

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.080
to Hallowell's practice
in the scrapbooks.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.910
She says "while it requires the
obstruction of one composite word,

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:54.240
it creates a new work within which
details of the old are revivified

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.720
and given a new purpose."

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.360
In his provocative
revisionist account

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.610
of the textual practices is
a Little Gideon community,

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:05.040
Adam's mind focuses on
what he terms the dynamism

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.550
of the reconfigured
gospel harmonies.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:11.200
The gospel harmonies were folio
books that contained cut up

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.540
and reordered printed
texts of the four Gospels.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.630
Members of the Little
Gideon community under,

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:20.250
the direction of Nicholas Ferris,
through this process of cutting

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:24.810
and pasting, turn the printed
texts into a harmonized narrative,

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.120
that would reconcile the
differences between the gospels.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.930
One of the most controversial
aspects of this activity

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.180
at the time, in seventeenth century
was the including of large numbers

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.080
of images, redeployed from a
variety of sources and arranged

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.640
in the harmonies with
increasing artfulness.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.110
I'm sorry controversial because
it smacks of Catholicism.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.080
Adam Smythe stresses the way
this process was characterized

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.910
by an energy manifested as much
in the cutting as in the pasting,

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:54.170
so to speak and that the
reordering was dynamic

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:57.150
and ideologically charged.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.070
Smythe lays equal stress
on what is excised as well

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.220
as what is created
during this process.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.510
An insight is especially
relevant I think,

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.350
Hallowell scrap, scrapbooking.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:10.420
Smythe says these books are
awkwardly placed on the border

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.780
of destruction and creation

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.280
or to put it more precisely these
books derive their liveliness

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.300
in part from an entangling
of the two.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.480
One might say that the
confident slicing of the Bible,

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.340
at Little Gideon is replicated in
Hallowell's insouciant use of what

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.800
by the nineteenth century and
certainly by us, were books seen

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.350
in almost the same light.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.220
Shakespeare folios and quartos.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.320
A description of Hallowell
at work towards the end

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.160
of his life captures some of
the paradoxes of this process.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.960
This is a quote, "along
one side of the antechamber

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.180
if you study stretches what Mr.
Phillips has named his book bin.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.300
Every afternoon his habit is
to look over a score of books,

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.500 position:56%
cut out of each the fractions he can
use and throw the rest as refutes,

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.850
refuse into his mammoth
wastebasket."

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:01.710
Hallowell's process of
refocusing cut from his collection

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:04.340
of Ellie my books can
also be seen in relation

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.990
to the nineteenth century
idea of the scrapbook,

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.420
as a form of information ordering.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:14.180
This activity is being studied in
relation to the scrapbook ordering

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.420
of information gathered
from newspapers,

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.660
in Ellen Grouper Givese Writing
With Scissors, great title.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.980
Erectile writing notes that
scrapbooks are the direct ancestors

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.220 position:56%
about digital information management

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.450
and nineteenth century readers
adapted to the proliferation

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:32.800
of print by cutting it up and
saving it, and reorganizing it,

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.340
putting their own stamp on it
and sometimes recirculating it.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.920
This is a process which
Givey describes

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.510
as performing archivalness.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:45.050
The net description of at least one
aspect of Hallowell's scrapbooking,

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.220
although his stretches
beyond cutting and pasting.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.110
We're nowadays perhaps more used to
the repurposing of illustrations,

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:57.390
the responses to these also the
is between the happy adoption

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.060
of illustrations removed from
the books of flora and fauna

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.440
and repurpose as nice
prints for our walls,

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.260
and horror at the vandalism
practiced upon books

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:10.630
that were intended themselves to
be encyclopaedic repositories.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.580
A good example from the Hallowell's
scrapbooks is the illustration he

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.900 position:56%
found for the referencing in Othello

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.930
to the men whose heads do
grow beneath their shoulders.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.510
In the scrapbook Hallowell
places a hand colored engraving,

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.170
which he describes as rare.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:29.990
In the edition, the illustration
is taken from a 1609 on mask,

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:33.370
held at Stuttgart by
the Duke of Gutenberg.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:36.500
Finally, Hallowell, he was quite a
decent amateur artist [inaudible] a

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.950
few sketches and watercolors
of his own.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.250
This one had me puzzled,

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:45.280
until I recalled Prospero's
trip to Ferdinand.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.670
Seawater shall drink by food
shall be the fresh muscles,

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:53.860
typical Hallowell that he should
seek out and illustrate this

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.930
with a giant freshwater muscle,
from Sir Henry Dryden's Lake.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.080
Sir Henry was an eccentric
antiquarian who lived

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.690
at Cannon Ashby where
the lake still exists,

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.470
and I assume the muscles do too.

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:08.100
Having assembled the scrapbooks
and then produced a final volume

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.700
of the addition in 1865,
Hallowell devoted himself

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.030
to writing an ever-expanding
biography of Shakespeare,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.020
having produced his first
biographical attempt,

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.880
as far back as the 1840s.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.710
The scrapbooks and the folio
edition were a kind of monument

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.120
to Hallowell's obsessive
archiving, but the biography

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.720
in its final form was highly
regarded and used well

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.660
into the twentieth century.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:35.370
Personally though, Hallowell's
was life went off the rails

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:39.460
when Henrietta had a bad fall from
a horse in 1872, which resulted

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.030
in some kind of acquired
brain injury.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.760
As a result of which she
went into a nursing home

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.630
until her eventual death in 1879.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.860
Hallowell went into
something like a depression.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.620
He moved to place near Brighton
and build himself an eccentric set

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.110
of wooden buildings he
referred to as wigwongs.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.930
He also proclaimed himself to
be over the whole enterprise

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:05.500
of scholarship, devising a
postcard he sent out to inquiries,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.740
which eloquently expressed
his current state of mind.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:13.060
He labels this nose thumbing, my
reply to those idiots who asked me

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.380
to resume my literary studies.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.080
He did in time resume, but I
think this eloquent statement

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:23.390
of the cheeky on way that can over
take even the most devoted editors

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.210
and scholars, is where
I'm going to conclude.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:35.670
[ Applause ]

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.970
I'm happy to answer any questions,

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.020
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: That's
what I was going to say,

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:42.740
is it time for questions, do
we have any questions there.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.140
&gt;&gt; Would you say anything about
his relationship with his printers,

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.070 position:56%
because it seems like these
scrapbooks were the penultimate stay

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:56.740
he had there in the printer,
he might be able to integrate.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.830
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: I don't think,
well sort of two sides of that,

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.690
he had a very good relationship
with his printers and in fact

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:06.940
when the final edition of
the folio version came out,

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:13.410
he had a kind banquet for the
men of the press, in London.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:14.960
There's quite extensive
correspondence

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.640
about exactly how he wanted
the individual volumes to look.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.200
But in terms of, could have put
more you know, could have put more

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.320
in a not need the scrapbooks
my sense of what is going

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.240
on with the scrapbooks it that
scrabbling is an essential part

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.240
of methoding of his doing research.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.700
So, there're kind of
two sorts of scrapbooks

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.210
and because I wrote this before I
had a chance to look at the folio,

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.740
the Folger material that there's
kind of archiving scrapbooks

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.380
like the ones at the Birthplace
Trust that a part of the edition.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:53.650
And there's what we would now,
you know, stick on our computers

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:59.370
and our phones, take photos as kind
of you know, working in progress

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:04.830
and I don't think, I don't think it
could even be an edition, kind of,

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:10.080
had it been sort of a sense of
what he's up to, that he got stuff

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.330
out in print, but he
never really wanted it all

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.660
to be incorporated
because it kept growing.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.500
So, the folders actually
have a very light scrapbooks,

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.760
where he kept revising
his biography,

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.630
came out in about five
different editions.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:26.660
The very, very last time days of
his life he's still sticking bits

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.570
into a scrapbook that
are about Shakespeare

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.410
and I don't think would ever
really had a place in the book.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:36.910
So, I think that's
what's going on there.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.390
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: Yes Bill, we're
going to repeat the question too

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:46.340
because of this new procedure.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:52.890
&gt;&gt; Bill: I'm aware of at least
two major Victorian bibliophiles,

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.320
who cut up books, one
was John Roscan,

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.990
and the other was Philip
Augustus Handmark.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:08.300
They achieved some notoriety, with
the kinds of things that they did,

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:13.790
how did this contemporary respond
to what Hallowell was doing?

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.350
Did they know that
he was doing this?

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.040
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: So,
this is a question about,

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.500
so Bill first pointed out there
are two figures, I know Roscan,

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.790
I don't know your other
person, who was famous

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.940
for cutting bits out of books.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:32.460
I see, did Roscan cut Illustrations
out rather than text, or?

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.200
&gt;&gt; Bill: Yes, and it tended
not to be Shakespeare,

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.540
more illustrations and manuscripts.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.840
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:45.190
On the whole, nobody realized that
this was what Hallowell was doing,

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:49.090
except in so far as Hallowell I
had said was a book dealer as well

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:52.730
as an editor and bibliographer.

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:55.110
So, he certainly had
correspondence with people

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:59.630
about that very common practice, of
how, how perfect you want to book

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:06.650
to be, shall I slip a few pages
from something else into it.

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:09.350
Yeah, that quotation
about him throwing stuff

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:13.520
into his big waste bin, comes from
very late in his life and prior

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.250
to that I don't think anyone
was paying any attention

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.580
to what he was doing
with these books.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:23.350
He had a very keen eye for
collecting early in his career,

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:26.560
not just for pilfering
but for actual collecting.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.420
So also think, you know,
there's a sense in which dealers,

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:38.110
dealers see books differently
I think, one the one hand,

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:43.250
they may see them as, you know,
sacrosanct at a certain point,

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.230
but that the opposite
at another point.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:49.580
So, I wonder whether there's
the dealer Hallowell Phillips,

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.610
as opposed to the you know,

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:54.270
collective bibliographer
Hallowell Phillips.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:58.310
I think was, was not happy
to do the that the chopping

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.950 position:56%
and shifting and chucking away even.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:07.060
As you see often in rebound books
that have what we now might think

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:12.530
of as, rather wonderful pages from
you know eighteenth century pages

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:17.010
that that wraparound
earlier books, when they,

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:22.310
that kind of process I think,
is, is, is at work too.

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:29.340
&gt;&gt; [ Inaudible Speech ]

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:38.310
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Oh yeah,
yeah, yes [inaudible].

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:42.660
More than fair, I think,
I want to put Hallowell

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:46.230
at a slightly different
category to that one,

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:51.440
but I also see the connection.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.270
&gt;&gt; It's a very interesting
theme, in your talk,

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.200
of adding and subtracting.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.930
And the ways in which the early
examples that you gave us,

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:06.370
subtract from Shakespeare
what was not to be permitted

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:13.040
as not sufficiently moral or
not sufficiently contemporary,

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.730
and the now what we would regard as
sort of the editorial in succience,

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:22.140
would just stick in what would
be relevant, now of course,

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:26.770
so that is what kind of
addition and subtraction

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:31.650
and then we have the other end
of the spectrum, sort of massive,

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:37.650
endless almost a concatenation
of foundation materials,

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:41.310
which is this some of which
go into this reference edition

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:49.760
with almost a sort of parallel text
running currently with the text

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:54.220
of Shakespeare, which you said
was rather conservatively edited,

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.020
but still edited.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.740
Now perhaps I'm working too hard
to make this into a trajectory,

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:04.230
but it does strike me that there
is a very different perhaps periods

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:11.040
specific set of attitudes
that are at play here,

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:17.380 position:56%
it would bring you these different
sorts of additions and subtractions,

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:22.520
I mean I understand that Hallowell
may be a class by himself,

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.100
but surely the archive

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:30.610
or foundational impulse would be
something that he would understand

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:35.790
as need or appreciated, could
you say a little more about that?

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:39.710
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Yeah, I mean
what I think is quite fascinating

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:47.390 position:56%
about him, is his historical context
is that he sort of is the end

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.280
of tradition of editing
and Cambridge text

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:56.420
which is the Cambridge text in the
1860s is in a way the beginning

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.820
of the new tradition of
editing and so far, as you know,

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:03.670
that's the text based upon
much more scientific collating,

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:07.270
not scientific, but much
more meticulous writing

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:11.040
than the previous editors
would have thought,

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.410
what was relevant or necessary.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:18.230
So, I think he's, he's
like that Victorian notion

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:22.470
of indefatigable assemblage.

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:27.470
And he's seeing a kind of shift
going on to some degree around him,

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.770
that in terms of editing is working
in a slightly different direction,

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:35.540
but in terms of things like the
biography for example, that was it,

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:41.370
so he thought quite well,
thought of, but then if you think

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:44.570
of how a Shakespeare biography
works through the 20th century,

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:49.690 position:56%
it also works kind of accumulatively
on this subject to you know people

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.620
like Greenway, who won't get into
to trouble for making too much up.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:56.440
But prior to that,
we've got that you know

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.540
that notion of give me the facts.

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:05.550
So, got the facts, this is
it Chamber whose who did the,

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.640
so Sean Baum does, Sean Baum
does Shakespeare documentary,

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:12.490
like which is just
kind Hallowell Philips

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:15.350 position:56%
in the sense that's found anything,
everything that's got anything to do

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:17.950
with Shakespeare and just
stuck them all in a book,

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:20.250
because you don't write
a conventional biography

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:23.420
of Shakespeare because there
isn't enough material to handle,

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.820
though that doesn't stop people.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.690
So, I'm not sure if I'm
answering the question, good.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:38.190
&gt;&gt; How do the places that hold
the books today, classify them?

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:43.440
Do they consider them to
be manuscripts or books?

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.840
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Thats a
very, very good question.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:50.170
They actually consider them
to be headaches I think, so,

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:55.210
so Edinburgh they're kind of a
miss, because things there's a,

00:52:55.210 --> 00:53:04.290
they're classified as manuscripts
in Edinburgh, and it defining list

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:09.490
that was typed up in the 1960s
is no, is no help at all.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:13.840
The Birthplace Trust, treats
them with as I said kind

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:19.050
of ambivalent reference and I think
there, they're possibly classified

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.690
as books rather than manuscripts.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:24.380
Folger, they definitely classified

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:29.350
under the manuscript call
number [inaudible] . Okay good,

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:35.770
good and I noticed that
in fact at least in,

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:41.380
at least one that I was looking
at yesterday, I mean, it's quite,

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.100
I don't know why this
was done because almost

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:47.430
at random just one engraved
map, has been removed

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:52.110
and re-catalogued you know, as a
map and put somewhere as a map.

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:55.020
This is in of volumes full of
engraved maps, I can only see

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:59.990
that this was, you know, a
rarer and more wonderful maps.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:05.080
&gt;&gt; There is a whole history,
right as a collection,

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:10.320
one of the things we are looking
at, is how these classified,

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.390
because they were predominantly
pictures became art,

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:17.050
those scrapbooks are not a
collection, they primarily words

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:18.350
that made it a collection.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:21.990
Ones that were meant to
be turned into scrapbooks

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:24.970
that never were, are
called scrap-boxes.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.240
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Yes, yes
exactly the loose stuff.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.830
&gt;&gt; And Howard Phillips often
he changed his mind about some

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:33.520
of the pictures, so our
concern being art scrapbooks,

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.170
rediscovered with different
pictures underneath,

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:43.140
because they pasted
stuff over, so this.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.960
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Yes, yes, I've
been doing very well, it's great.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.550
The only thing we couldn't,

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:50.800
so someone was asking me I
think sorry not at this talk,

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:59.630
about kind of reuniting the cut
up pages, which I'm delighted

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.310
to say I will never have
anything to do with, but,

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:09.060
I was exercising I think three
quarters the folders of stuff today

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:12.510
and yesterday, So at one of
the folders, the very first

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:16.730
of the scrapbooks I opened,
had page carefully cut

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:23.740
out of Rowley's history of the
world, Folgers, got four copies,

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:27.590
but on the various imprints
of the history of the world

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:33.810
and Sean Baum who's the person who
wrote the history of biographies,

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:37.200 position:56%
written about Shakespeare, Sean
Baum's got this intriguing foot note

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.820
that they expect to probably
the late 60s where he says

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:44.370 position:56%
that the librarian folder told him,
that this page from Rowley's history

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:48.550
of the world, was cut out
of an otherwise perfect copy

00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:51.410
of the history of the
world, that the folder has

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:55.110
without giving it a
call number or anything.

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:59.990
So, we've now gone through all
Folgers copies, of the history

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:07.030
and certainly can't find the one
that the page was cut out of,

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:11.160
so you know, even way you would
think that would be really simple

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:16.070
to match page to book,
everyone's scratching their heads,

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:22.380
sorry but my point is a fact that,
that's a kind of false quest,

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:26.370
to try to match things
in, in that way.

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:28.840
But that's not being
true to the purpose

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.650
of what Hallowell Phillips was
up to, and I think what he is

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.790
up to is actually really
interesting, both in relation

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:37.250
to kind of early modern and in
relation to nineteenth century

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:40.160
and in relation to
current ideas about editing

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.670
and material book history.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:50.150
&gt;&gt; Just to follow up, and this is
just speculation, but as I think

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:54.040
to what I would have done myself,
in his situation, but today,

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.360
do you think he had access to
a scanner or a Xerox machine,

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:03.670
he would have been satisfied with
facsimile that he could paste in

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:07.640
or do you think, because I would
be satisfied with that facsimile.

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.530
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: He was really
interested in, so he was very good

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:14.040
on facsimile, so he actually
published the whole series

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:19.180
of quarto facsimiles
which was quite early on.

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:22.930
So, he was good, when I
say he was good at it,

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:26.200
the facsimile maker was good at it,
but Hallowell was quite keen on it,

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.470
he was mostly keen on it
for mercenary reasons.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:36.320
Because you could sell those early
facsimile editions at a good price

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.690
and you could also if you were
very naughty use facsimile pages

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:44.670
to makeup deficient pages,
you know in general books.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:50.110 position:56%
I guess, I was taking my photos
today thinking, so what I'm doing is

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:55.380
like what Hallowell was doing,
I'm snapping away madly really,

00:57:55.380 --> 00:58:00.380
I don't think if each
given human a smartphone,

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:04.000
I don't think he would've felt that
was satisfactory I think he wanted

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.760
to type which is why I'm very much
in accord with people like Julie

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:13.070
and Smythe about the
process of cutting is,

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:18.080
is different to the processes
reproducing, so yeah.

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:24.740
&gt;&gt; I think my two-part
question comes together.

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:30.620
I think that you mentioned earlier,
that a quite different concept

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:38.910
in ones are also nearly all
folios and I saw you looking

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:41.940
at folios the other day
at Folger, and I wondering

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:46.950 position:56%
that at any given time, Hallowell
Phillips had two or three scrapbooks

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:48.250
under process, he would put
that kind of thing here,

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.840
that kind of thing over there,
so that their kind of organized?

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.140
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Oh yeah, they
are quite different kinds,

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:56.610
so the Edinburgh ones are
also nearly all Folios.

00:58:56.610 --> 00:59:03.220
So, the folios are kind of
rough, so I would call them kind

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:09.180
of research scrapbooks and
the beautifully bound quarto's

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.950
at the Birthplace Trust, that
are arranged in order of plays.

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:17.060
So, if you call out Hamlet,
there are, you know, 12 volumes

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.500
and they're beautiful, like
they're really nicely bound,

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:23.920
they actually have stamped
titles on the bindings.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.490
Whereas the big folio ones, are
much, much rougher, so I would say

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:30.420
that there are two
completely different categories

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.490
and sometimes things
migrate from one

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:34.820
to the other, but I agree with you.

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:39.190
I think that he's got them
piled high, as he does,

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:44.470
and his work is cumulative, it's
also say, instead of index cards

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:47.810
and instead of, you know,
whatever other process you've got,

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:50.940
through the years, there
are more and more of them

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:55.790 position:56%
because every time you say something
that's relevant, he cuts it out

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:57.670
and sticks them in and
he classified them.

00:59:57.670 --> 01:00:03.510
So, they are also, they're in will
categories, various categories,

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:08.010
in scrapbooks, which I would
say Folgers also got what were

01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:14.070
in drawers in his study, which are
now boxes, all sort of ready to be,

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:17.340
ready to be pasted in,
but not, not there.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.490
&gt;&gt; Oh I was thinking the
objects, example of something

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:24.490
that is mentioned in Shakespeare,
and he would go for an example

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:28.250
of that thing and those
are now in the boxes.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.880
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Yep,
they also had again,

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.640
but there's stuff that's also paper
things, not pasting into yet, so,

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:43.260 position:56%
I think on his death bed, he's still
thinking what will I put in now.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.560
&gt;&gt; So what was his method?

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:50.220
Did he choose a play and then look
for things related to that play,

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.810
or was it higgledy,
piggledy whatever he ran

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:55.840
across he matched in to folios?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: I'm not absolutely
certain, so for the folio edition he

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:07.420
in volume by volume so to speak,
so I think there he was its Hamlet,

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.260
looking for everything
to do with, with Hamlet.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.690
For the material, that's
everything to do with Shakespeare.

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:16.930
I think it kind of accumulates
as he goes, so he's a,

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:22.920
there's a really nice little
piece about him, by Bagby Somerset

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.590
who was the foundation
of regional, regional,

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:29.900
the records of early English
drama project and Hallowell,

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.710 position:56%
is a kind of precursor to records of
early English drama, because he went

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:36.130
from county records office,
to county records office

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:38.670
and he would write down
whatever he found there

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:41.340 position:56%
and that was this kind of, you
know, that was whereever he happened

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.080
to be, if he was in Colchester,

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.490
then let's have the record
office in Colchester.

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:50.510
So there, it was just kind of
everything that was anything.

01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:52.420
I think for the editing
of the plays,

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:58.400
it was more methodical
play-by play, by-play.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.950
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us anything
about how the various collections

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:04.690
of scrapbooks ended up
in these various places?

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:06.880
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Oh
yeah, it's quite simple

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.000
because the Edinburgh stuff he,
he actually left in his will.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.220
He also left Edinburgh a lot of
his actually early modern books

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.530
and then it was, he
was such a great guy.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:27.600
He was very keen on,
the library at Plymouth,

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.380
and he left the Plymouth
library this massive collection

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:35.370
of early modern books,
and the Plymouth library

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:39.130
in its wisdom decided in the
1960s that it would sell them,

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.650
and Edinburgh University
stepped in, and bought them.

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:46.970
So, they kind of doubled
their Phillips collection.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:50.040
The Birthplace Trust material,
he was instrumentally setting

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.660
up the Birthplace Trust library.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.870
So, they got theirs as
part of that connection.

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:59.720
Unfortunately, a bit of
a sort of sticky end,

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.290
because there were all
these quarrels at Stratford,

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:06.550
over the running of the Birthplace
Trust and he ended up kind

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:07.850
of cold shouldering them,

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.360
but not before he had given
them quite a lot of material.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:19.060
The Folger, bought theirs
and quite early on I think.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:27.410 position:56%
So, they came from, so they went up
for sale, probably in the late 1890s

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:32.950
and now I can't remember if the
Folger's bought them or whether,

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:37.520
anyway so the Folger acquired by
purchase, as opposed obviously

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.370
by the quest, because he
wasn't there when he died.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:54.060
&gt;&gt; Bill: Did he have
a team of people,

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:57.240
the way Murray did
for the dictionary?

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.300
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: That's
a really good question.

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.300
His team basically
consisted of Henrietta,

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.010
who worked furiously for him.

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:12.350
She left this quite wonderful
diary, that is in fact in Edinburgh

01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:16.630 position:56%
and I know people talk about you
know, Victorian men of letters doing

01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:20.630
so much, here's the Victorian
woman of letters, who gave birth

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:23.160
to a number of children and
helped raise them and managed

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.360
to do enormous amounts of
transcribing, proofreading,

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.000
compiling, but as far as I can
make out, he would sometimes do

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.030
that thing a lot of people
in the nineteenth century,

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:39.030
where he would write to
someone at the Bodleian

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:45.930
and say I want these four pages
of this book, could you trans,

01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:47.690
could you write it out for me?

01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:58.480
So, but, but not a team like the
dictionary team, no not at all.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:04.560
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: I'm just
going to say, because of a couple

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.460
of the comments too, that starting
the addition and subtraction,

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.630
other people collecting and
scrapbooking, but there are also,

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:17.330
and I know this isn't, I think the
whole project is very interesting,

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:23.280
this is not the focus, but I think
in some way this could to kind

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.200
of the technology of
writing and research.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.030
I mean there's a lot that has
been done on this, but there seems

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:36.470
to be different formats, I'm
thinking of people scrapbooking not

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:42.370
in the 18th century for knowledge
production and collection,

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:53.090
that's also making me think, we are
going to end up in classifications

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:58.490
because that is that's more, and
some of the questions that came up,

01:05:58.490 --> 01:06:07.540 position:56%
because I think when we are writing
our meta-level, we are always taking

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:13.570
and subtracting from
different things,

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:18.550
to create our own kind
perspective and take of something

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:23.920
and the individuality of assembling
the pieces weather we are doing it

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.950
figuratively, where he was doing it
literally as well as bringing in.

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:34.070
So, it is interesting, to take
an even higher step back I think,

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:35.390
and look at this in a term
of a meta-look I think,

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:36.800
and then compare it to
perhaps other figures and look

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.630 position:56%
at similarities according to periods
and then differences that emerge,

01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:40.130
because of the tools and also
because of what the tools do

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.600
for many of us in terms of
what we think is capable,

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.370
what we're capable of, because the
tools I think also sometimes affect

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.670
the way we collect things.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.000
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Yeah,
I think that's true,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.810 position:56%
I not particularly taken back by all
the work recently that has been done

01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:52.660
on renaissance common placing,

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.620
I think it's a really
interesting parallel to,

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:59.590
simply because that
what he's working on,

01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:03.290
and the parallels seem me to be
crying out to what's actually made

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:05.570
and people have come up with
much more sophisticated notions

01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:12.050
of what commonplace is, in the 16th
and 17th century, really you know,

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:21.660
wheels and notions of
yeah, kind of eclectic.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.770
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: I do take
your point on the one hand,

01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.040
but on the other hand sort of
returning to that notion of,

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:31.750
you know, Hallowell Phillips had,
had a smartphone or, you know,

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:35.000
what if the 17th-century
commonplaces had had a laptop.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.510
I actually don't, I would want
to say, that it's not the same,

01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:43.960
for all kinds of of reasons,

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.210
other than that it's
there are similarities,

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:51.380
but the processes and
isn't the same.

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:54.580
&gt;&gt; Bill: I'm sure that's right, but
at the same time, the similarities

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.110
as he took these notes in a
way we put these notes today,

01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:07.120 position:56%
and quite striking, I mean speaking
like myself, always carry my iPhone,

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:14.410 position:56%
even in the library, there's a long
passage that I want to take note of,

01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:18.730
I photograph it and put it
into a note taking program

01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:25.460
and so I may type underneath that
or I may even draw on the computer,

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.140
it's quite a similar process.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.590
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: There's
also the interesting question,

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.940
is he consuming or is he producing?

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:37.810
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron: Right, because
they thought they were producing,

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:42.360
they call it printing
with scissors, they say,

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:47.160
and you know they think
they were improving it,

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:51.440
they're rearranging the text,
they were illustrating it,

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.850
the page is decorated with drawn
lines and so on and so forth.

01:08:55.850 --> 01:09:00.070
So, they think they are
producing, but you know.

01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:01.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bill: So, this is something else.

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.440
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron: for the
people and people got,

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.600
they even requested this
copies of what they did,

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.640
but they didn't look
great for example,

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.330
but that's another
interesting question,

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:13.220
is he consuming or reproducing?

01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:18.710
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: I guess the book
dealings I would say the two are

01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:20.460
inseparable, in a way.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:25.360 position:56%
That what he is putting out, depends
partly on what he is bringing in

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.970
and cutting up and I would suspect
the editing and that he would say

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:34.250 position:56%
that the addition and the
biography couldn't be what they were

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:37.570
without this sort of
endless chopping up.

01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:39.350
So, it's not, it's not
exactly the same but that

01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:42.960
that would be the sort
of parallel process.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.780
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: And you could
preserving in a sense of collecting

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:53.410 position:56%
and producing and you also, when you
are preserving there's destruction,

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:54.710
you know,

01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:56.010
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Yeah, exactly.

01:09:56.010 --> 01:10:00.340
&gt;&gt; I think we have to time
for one more question?

01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:07.920
no? Well thanks everyone,
and thanks Paul.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.950
&gt;&gt; Paul Salzman: Thank
you for having me.

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:19.110
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
