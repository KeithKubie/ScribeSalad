PETER NORVIG: All right.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.890
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.300
So I'm going to talk about
online education.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.720
And so I'm an engineer
at Google,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.110
but I'm also an educator.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.320
And here I am in the classroom
at Stanford University

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.170
teaching artificial
intelligence.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.290
And when I taught this class, I
felt like the subject matter

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.980
was pretty advanced
and up to date.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.710
We tried to make it that way.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.570
But I also felt like the
delivery mechanism hadn't

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.920
really changed very much
since the 14th century.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.200
This is the University of
Bologna, the very first

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.440
university.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.240
And you see we got the sage on
the stage, just like today.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.330
We got the textbook.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.500
And we got the sleeping
guy in the back.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.160
And my class at Stanford was
at 9:00 AM, so I'm very

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.250
familiar with that phenomenon.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.250
Now, over the years, there
have been technological

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.290
advances since those days.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.710
And so let's jump ahead
to the modern era.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.830
By modern era, I mean 1791.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.540
And "Life of Johnson." Boswell
was writing, "Lectures were

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.800
once useful, but now, when all
can read, and books so

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.760
numerous, lectures
are unnecessary.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.630
If your attention fails
and you miss part of a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.600
lecture, it's lost.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.330
You cannot go back as
you do upon a book."

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.000
Now, of course, that's true.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.040
He makes a good point.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.590
Of course, now we do have the
ability to go back with the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.935
little scroller in YouTube.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.850
He hadn't anticipated that.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.910
But it's still true that there's
a lot of things about

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.350
a book that are better
than a lecture.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.600
And so I've done lecturing,
but I've also done a book.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.310
And I began to think
about that.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.760
And here's a passage
from my textbook.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.750
And this is one that my
co-author Stuart Russell did

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.540
the first draft.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.430
And I said well,
wait a minute.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.200
That's not quite right.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.560
And then I did a draft.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.860
And then I wasn't convinced
that was right either.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.720
And we had to choose what
to put in the book.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.610
You're only allowed to
put one thing in.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.090
And we realized we are the two
worst guys in the world to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.350
make that choice.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.160
Because it's been a long time
since we were confused about

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.169
this subject.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.030
But we know that the people
who would be the best at

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.500
making that choice are out
there, but we just lost the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.200
feedback loop.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.440
We know that there are students
who are buying the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.530
book and taking out their magic
marker and highlighting

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.030
the important stuff.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.860
And maybe they have a different
color to highlight

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.220
the confusing stuff that
they didn't understand.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.220
And they're writing notes
in the margin, and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.360
we're losing all that.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.510
And so we said, well, if we can
close the loop and bring

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.430
that online, then maybe
we can get that back.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.200
And we can have rapid
improvement in textbooks.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.220
Here's another diagram
out of the Book.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.270
And it took me a long time
to produce this.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.960
I had to write a program to
munch the data, and then draw

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.920
the 3D plot.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.450
And then I rotated the
3D plot until I got

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.900
just the right viewpoint.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.720
And then, the poor student just
gets these raw pixels and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.570
doesn't get the learning
experience that I got from

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.640
manipulating it.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.620
But I know that there are
techniques where you can have

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.220
all this stuff be running live
and the student could get the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.310
same experience I had.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.180
So Hal Abelson, a famous
educator from MIT, was

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.240
visiting Google.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.630
And I asked Hal, I'm interested
in kind of the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.700
theory of learning.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.370
What do I have to learn
to get up to date?

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.530
And I expected him to
give me an answer of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.190
a big pile of books.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.450
And instead, I got the best
answer I've ever gotten, which

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.690
was he said you only have
to read one paper.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.220
And that's Benjamin Bloom's
paper from 1984 on what bloom

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.280
calls the 2 sigma effect--

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.860
2 standard deviations.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.490
And Bloom says, if you do
one-on-one tutoring and you do

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.320
mastery learning, which means
you keep teaching until the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.940
student actually guess it,
rather than until the date of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.510
the scheduled exam, then you
get two standard deviations

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.470
improvement on average.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.720
And so you see the
chart moves over.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.710
And if you look at the midpoint
there, it means 98%

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.490
are above average.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.420
Almost like [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.050
Now, we'll see a little bit
later that maybe he was

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.710
exaggerating a little and not
all the experiments backup

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.270
exactly that amount
of improvement.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.440
But the improvement is there.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.550
And this struck home, and it
seems to make a lot of sense.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.519
So one-on-one tutoring seems
like a powerful thing.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.470
I think back in my life,
here I am with my

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.990
first tutor, my mom.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.150
And we're going one-on-one and
I'm learning something there.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.270
So I said, can we take that
to the rest of the world?

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.360
But I don't really have the time
or transportation to meet

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.370
with everybody one-on-one.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.340
So can I get close to it
by going one-on-many?

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.660
So I began to try to teach in
that way, teaching not to one

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.890
student at a time but teaching
to one video

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.850
recorder at a time.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.150
And then, interspersing the rest
of the lessons with it.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.640
So my co-teacher Sebastian Thrun
and I said, it's our

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.000
turn again to teach this
class at Stanford.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.950
This time, instead of just doing
it in the classroom,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.520
we're also going to
do it online.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.130
And we're going to offer
it to anybody in the

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.110
world to sign up for.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.820
And 160,000 people
took us up on it.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.810
And since then, there have been
others that are doing

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.740
this as well.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.070
So Coursera is one of the
well-known providers; Udacity,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.400
edX, this partnership of MIT
and Harvard, and now other

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.920
universities.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.230
And at Google, we wanted
to get into it, too.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.890
And the first class we produced
was with Dan Russell.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.920
It was a class called Power
Searching with Google.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.740
It just taught you how
to use Google better.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.510
And that worked so well we were
able to throw together a

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.360
system to do that.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.970
Some of the people taking
and liked it.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.330
Thank you.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.110
That we said, well, why don't
we take the system that we

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.160
used to build this, and then
clean it up a little bit and

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.130
open source it and let
everybody use it?

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.010
So that's what we did.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.380
We called it Course Builder.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.320
And last week, we had
the 1.4 launch.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.760
So we're iterating
through this.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.680
There's the URL.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.380
You can just search for
Course Builder or you

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.330
can remember that.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.668
It's on code,google.com.

00:06:05.668 --> 00:06:09.950
And afterwards, we have five
laptops set up here down in

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.250
front and you can come
play with it.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.660
Or you can do it on your
own with the URL.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.270
And here are some of the
technologies, the Google

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.250
technologies, that we're
integrating.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.210
So it runs on App Engine.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.980
It's not a Google service, it's
an open source product

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.550
that happens to run on a Google
service, App Engine.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.720
So you download it.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.850
You get your own App Engine
instance and you run it.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.460
And you can integrate the
YouTube and the Docs and

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.450
Hangouts and Groups and Gmail
and Account Login and

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.110
everything else.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.020
And we got a couple dozen
different courses up and

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.400
running now from different
universities and nonprofits.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.840
And more on the way.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.450
Here's one example
from saylor.org.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.380
It's a nonprofit that's doing
a bunch of different

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.260
courses with us.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.840
We just announced this week,
this launch of another class

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.520
following up on the
Power Searching.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.540
There's a course on Mapping with
Google that teaches you

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.750
how to use Google Maps
and Google Earth.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.210
And here's just a little bit
more of what it looks like.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.400
So if you've seen any of these
online classes, it's sort of

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.040
representative of those.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.590
But you can have videos.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.310
You can have exercises that
are multiple choice and

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.110
fill-in-the-blank or other
types of exercises.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.320
And so this is what the
student sees, what the

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.720
instructor sees when they're
making the class.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.760
The first version was sort of
do-it-yourself and you had to

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.220
be a webmaster.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.250
Now, with this forth
version, we've got

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.490
this Wiziwig interface.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.500
And so there's a rich
text editor.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.240
And you type what you want, and
then you can sort of drag

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.420
in the various components.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.780
And here, we're dragging in a
YouTube video and a Google Doc

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.580
inline and an exercise with
assessments in multiple

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.860
choice, or whatever.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.350
And each of these components,
we've wrapped a dozen or so

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.530
different types.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.320
And then, we also have an API
that describes how to wrap

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.170
other ones, so that you can
have your own custom

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.020
components that you
can then drag in.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.720
In one day, one of our engineers
put together Khan

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.770
Academy exercises as a
specialized component.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.720
So we just showed how
to wrap that.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.650
And now, if you want--

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.240
these Khan Academies
are all under

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.750
Creative Commons license.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.870
And so if you want to create a
class, you can just choose the

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.900
one you want and drop
it into your class.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.960
So that's where we were with
the first version of Power

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.140
Searching and with the
tool that's now

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.410
available to everyone.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.310
And so you can use it as is.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.120
And we wanted to do that.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.860
We also wanted to start
experimenting.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.530
To say, do we really understand
yet what's the

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.800
right way to make
these classes?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.300
And so we did a second version
of Power Searching.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.060
And there were a couple
of experiments I

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.370
wanted to do there.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.070
So first, I wanted it to be more
project-based rather than

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.310
lecture-based.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.800
To say, we really want to have
the student's experience doing

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.830
stuff, so don't make them watch
a lecture, and then

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.080
answer multiple choice.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.270
Just get them right
into it and say,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.090
OK, solve this problem.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.250
There's no lectures upfront.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.550
It's just a bunch of challenges
and you choose the

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.590
challenges you want to do.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.450
So challenge number one says
during the glory days of

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.650
radio, it was illegal to mimic
the voice of the US president.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.030
Was there actually a law
prohibiting that or was that

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.420
just White House policy?

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.810
And then, you're on your own.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.340
You can go and try to answer
that using Google.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.520
Or if you want, you can
take advantage of

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.570
some of these hints.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.120
So we say, here are some things
you could look at.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.280
You might want to look at Google
Scholar or Google News

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.930
Archive, and so on and so on.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.700
And for each of these--

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.120
Here was the second experiment
I wanted to do, was saying I

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.770
think the first round of these
online classes went a little

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.230
bit too far overboard
in using video.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.450
And we heard from 1791 some of
the disadvantages of video

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.610
versus text.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.630
So I wanted to offer the video
and the text on an equal

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.110
footing and have the students
decide, which one do they want

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.120
to consume?

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.580
And it turned out, it was
about 50-50, their

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.070
choices of which one.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.710
So if you want text,
you get it as text.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.870
If you want video, you
get it as video.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.480
And you sort of watch all
the supplemental pieces.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.990
You can also say, well,
I'm not quite ready

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.040
to answer this yet.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.830
Can you show me an example
of somebody

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.660
solving a similar problem?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.210
And so you ask for an example.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.980
And here, we walk through the
steps of, oh, if we had this

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.400
as a problem, these are the
steps we go through to

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.970
try to solve it.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.210
And then when you're done, you
can type in your answer.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.150
And here they've typed in, I
think it was only a policy.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.290
And type show answer.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.660
And then, see the answer.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.670
And in fact, that's right.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.640
It was a policy.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.370
And for a while we were
thinking, well, these aren't

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.470
multiple choice questions.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.780
These are almost like
essay questions.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.360
And so do we need some
complicated AI software to

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.790
judge whether you got
it right or not.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.360
And in the end we said, no,
we'll just let you judge.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.570
Because we're not giving
you a grade or credit.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.460
So you type in your answer, then
you see our answer and

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.370
you say, yeah, I got it
right, or you say,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.650
no, I got it wrong.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.490
But that's up to you to judge.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.770
And students never even sort
of noticed that we weren't

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.390
giving them a green check
mark or a red X mark.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.930
They just figured it
out for themselves.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.540
And then, another thing we had
was making it more social to

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.720
say see how other solved
the challenge.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.040
So you can click through
on that.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.320
There's a discussion forum where
people talk about the

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.780
techniques they used.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.660
I like this guy here.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.720
How did you solve it?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.900
He says, I'm a law student.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.380
I just know.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.150
So not everybody needs Google
for everything.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.550
Now, I should say that when I
got into this, both in writing

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.290
the textbook, teaching the
class, thinking about online

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:14.690
education, I thought that my job
was access to information.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.100
If I put down the perfect
information and explained it

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.000
in the right way, then
I've done my job.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.490
I also thought that was
true in my job as

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.830
an engineer at Google.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.410
So when I was running the Search
Quality team, I thought

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.730
my job is when somebody types
a hard query like that--

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.300
the movie in which no
babies are born--

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.610
then in 0.21 seconds, we should
give you the answer is

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.390
"Children of Men." And if we
can do that and the other

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.290
search engines can't, then
I've done my job.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.870
But then I realized that that
isn't everything, is just

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.040
being able to get the answer.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.290
And I ran across a quote from
Pablo Picasso who said that

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.260
computers didn't interest him
because all they can do is

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.730
give you answers.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.910
And I think he had
something there.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.100
That really, the hard part is
not coming up with the answer.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.140
I mean, I'm proud of the work
that the Google engineers are

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.130
able to do to answer so well.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.390
But the really interesting part,
the part that's really

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.970
educational, is that somebody
was interested

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.040
enough to ask a question.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.100
And from there, the
answer is easy.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.880
I saw that when we met with
Teach for America.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.530
And we had a teacher who was
given a fourth grade class in

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.590
math, two years behind
grade level.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.020
And by the end of the year, had

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.260
everybody up to grade level.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.770
So that was three years worth
of math in one year.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.230
And I said, well,
wait a minute.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.410
It wasn't information
that did that.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.800
They had the same textbook this
year that they had the

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.220
last year, and that other
teachers had and were

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.870
unsuccessful with.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.520
So it wasn't information.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.620
It was more motivation
or determination.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.400
It was this pact that the
teacher made with the student

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.500
saying, look, I'm going to
work really hard for you.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.450
I expect you to work
hard for me.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.450
And together, we're
going to do this.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.625
That really shifted the way I
thought about what the job of

00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:59.220
a teacher is.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.110
So it's motivation,
not information.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.960
And so the aspect you really
need is willpower to work and

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.390
to succeed.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.670
And I thought back to my college
days and said, well,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.440
what instilled me
to get through?

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.330
Was it willpower?

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.510
And I said, no, it
was due dates.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.350
And so we tried that.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.470
And that seemed to help.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.660
And so we think we did much
better than the classes that

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.360
are open that you can
take any time.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.870
Because if you can
take it any time,

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.940
you can take it tomorrow.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.830
And if you can take it tomorrow,
sometimes you

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.180
never get to it.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.830
And we'll talk more about
the nuances of that.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.890
Then the peer support becomes
more important.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.160
It's not just, can you explain
things perfectly, but can you

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.960
talk to somebody?

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.850
And can you see, hey, here's
somebody else who's working

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.820
hard on this?

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.090
I think that's part of what
college is all about is that

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.060
it's a social environment where
you see other people who

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.390
are also studying.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.020
Well, they're partying, too.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.730
And that's part of
college as well.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.240
But seeing them dedicated to
work and saying I can be part

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.070
of that community that's
working is important.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.610
The faculty encouragement
was important.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.610
So every week we sent out
an email that said,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.950
congratulations, keep going.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.840
And every week, I'd get a dozen
or so back that says,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.880
oh, professor, something tough
came up in my work life.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.820
And I was going to drop the
class, but then I saw your

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.300
email and I realized
I had to go on.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.820
And I felt like saying that
was a form letter.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.520
You do realize I didn't write
100,000 personal letters to

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.140
each of you?

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.380
But it works.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.280
So just that level of human
connection, even though it is

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.090
a form letter, it makes
a big difference.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:46.630
I think there's a pride of
accomplishment we need to

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.800
accommodate.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.130
This authenticity of this
is the real thing.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.570
This is a Stanford-level class
that I'm taking and I have

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.170
this opportunity to
learn this stuff.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.570
I think the excitement of being
in the early stages of

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.440
something new has all
contributed to why people

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.920
wanted to do this.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.900
And this is just pointing out
sort of the depth of the

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.190
social engagement, that people
used all sorts of--

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.040
any social networking site you
can see on the web, people

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.730
were using that to connect
with each other.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.430
And here I show--

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.500
I got this from Coursera, from
one of their classes.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.590
This is a timeline of how
many people are online.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.440
And like all classes, you can
see the superimposition of

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.910
three things.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.560
So there's a ramp up at the
beginning and there's

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.570
exponential decay over time.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.920
Actually, a lot of
classes have much

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.940
steeper exponential decay.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.880
I think this is the one that
Coursera chose to release, was

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.070
the one that has a
shallow decay.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.590
And then, you can see
the due dates

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.620
interspersed, those big spikes.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.770
And I think there's still this
controversy that I haven't

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.670
quite figured out yet of how
important are those due dates?

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.320
So certainly, they do make
people come back.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.500
They do make them work hard.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.040
But on the other hand, they
also make people drop out.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.119
If you miss the due date, then
you say, oh, well, now 'm not

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.902
going to get a perfect
score and I might as

00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:10.950
well just give up.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.980
So I think we need to think
more about what

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:15.829
the processes are.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.460
So I've talked about these.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.460
You can have a synchronous
class, that's the in-class,

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.210
Stanford class, that
meets at 9:00 AM.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.369
And if you're late,
you missed it.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:27.280
You can have these
evergreen classes

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.320
that are always available.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.190
The MIT OpenCourseWare, it's
anytime you want to do

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.670
it you can do it.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.180
But then you miss the motivation
of the due dates.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.560
Our class we called
semi-synchronous, which meant

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.020
there was a due date every week,
but during the week you

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.090
could interact with the

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.300
materials at your own schedule.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.330
I'd like to get to a model I
call the bus route model,

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.870
which says that there's a
schedule and you get on, you

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.920
start doing the class.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.670
But if something comes up at
work or at home and you get

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.540
stuck, you can get off the bus
and say, OK, I'm taking a

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.020
timeout now.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.560
It's going to be fast for me.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.690
I have to stop.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.060
But then you know at some point
in the future, there's

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.600
another bus.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.140
You can get back on and
finish the class.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.300
OK, now the big question.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.120
What's learning?

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.610
One of my heroes, and one of the
founders of the field of

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:16.640
AI, is Herb Simon.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.710
And he reminds us that learning
is something that the

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.530
student does.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.700
And I think as teachers,
sometimes we forget that.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.070
We think it's something that
we, as teachers, do.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.310
And that's not right.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.700
Learning only happens in
the student's head.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.682
And our job is just there
to facilitate it.

00:18:32.682 --> 00:18:36.820
And so I think what that means
is it's not how well can I

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.790
explain it.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.530
It's how much can
the student do?

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.590
And so we tried to make our
class so that the students

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.230
were doing the problems first.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.490
And then they would get
the explanation.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.360
We forced students to
make predictions.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.860
To say, here's a
new situation.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.105
What do you think is
going to happen?

00:18:54.105 --> 00:18:57.580
And the reason we did that is
because we knew, from the

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.940
scientific literature, that if
students have a misconception

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.720
of some kind and you give them
an explanation, no matter how

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.900
great that explanation is, it's
not going to dissuade

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.210
them from their misconception.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.410
They're going to say, yeah.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.480
I got it.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.290
Then you give them a problem
and they still do it their

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.540
old, wrong way.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.570
And the only way you get them
out of that is to say, OK, do

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.150
it your way.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.360
Here's a contradiction.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.240
Your way did something wrong.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.750
And then they're ready
to think about it.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.950
So we made them make
those predictions.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.910
And I got to say, students
didn't like that in general.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.900
That they said, well, no fair.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.340
You didn't give us
the formula.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.510
I can fill in the blanks in
the formula if you tell me

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.810
every step of how to do it.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.880
But it's no fair to make me
think and do it ahead of time.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.350
And I should say, we were also a
little bit clumsy in the way

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:48.710
we specified things, in that we
gave them these problems.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.850
We said, well, don't worry.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.240
It doesn't matter if you
get it right or wrong.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.960
We just want you to
think about it.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.660
But then in the end, we gave
them a check mark when they

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.300
got it right.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.930
And so people had been drummed
in so much to say, well, the

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.970
important thing is whether you
get it right or wrong.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.240
And that's how school works.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.930
We need to figure out ways to do
a better job to say that's

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:09.900
not the important thing.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.700
Playing with the material
is the important thing.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.440
We like to have experiments with
more open-ended problems.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.810
It's easiest to do a
fill-in-the-blank or multiple

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.090
choice because we know
how to grade those.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.750
But those aren't the
most fulfilling.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.000
And there have been some
experiments with peer grading

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.920
where you write an essay or
design a project of some kind,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.250
and then have several of your
peers grade it and average

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.950
those grades.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.440
It turns out that works
pretty well.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.290
Now, I talked with Hal Varian,
who's Google Chief Economist.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.820
And when he was at Bell Labs,
he wrote the textbook on

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.280
microeconomics.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.770
It's one of the standards
in the field.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.790
And he was there with Richard
Hamming, who you may know from

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.567
Hamming Codes and so on, and Hal
said that Hamming told him

00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:54.340
his secret.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.100
That the way you write a
textbook is first yo get

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.400
together the problem sets and
the exams that you want the

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.960
students to be able to solve.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.200
And then you write a book
that teaches them

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.360
how to solve them.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.040
So I think this fits in
well with this idea

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.160
of learning is doing.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.940
And when Hal was explaining
this to me I

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.210
said, hey, I know that.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.090
In software development, we
call that test-driven

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.980
development.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.590
So you write a bunch of m
then the tests fails.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.300
And then you have to
write some code.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.910
And so it's the same
with a textbook.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.020
You should start with a blank
textbook, write the problems

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.670
in the back, hit go.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.790
And every time there's a red
mark where the test doesn't

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.160
succeed, then you have to write
a chapter or a section

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.430
of the textbook.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.090
So I think that makes sense.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.180
I think the one thing you have
to be careful about then, do

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.320
you end up sort of teaching
to the test?

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.790
So it only works if the test
problems that you've chosen

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.370
are the skills that you really
want people to have, not if

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.050
they're just sort of
arbitrary things.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.270
So remember Bloom.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.160
He was the guy who wrote
the one paper that

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.660
you had to know about.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.480
How much do we trust him?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.180
Is he right that one-on-one
learning is the

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.910
most important thing?

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.630
Well, Kurt VanLehn, from
Arizona State, did a

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.130
meta-analysis of
this recently.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.590
I think this was from
2011 or 2012.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.830
And Kurt says, here's the
conventional wisdom.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.460
The conventional wisdom says--

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.550
Bloom claimed that if you had
this human tutor, you'd get

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.150
two standard deviations
of improvement.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:28.440
If you have a intelligent
tutoring system, the sort of

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.110
state-of-the-art computer
system, you get one.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.700
And if you just have the paper
and pencil fill-in-the-blank

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.550
type thing, you get
a quarter or so.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:41.160
And that's sort of what's in the
literature, or the sort of

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.600
expectations that people have.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.210
But he looked very carefully at
every study he could find

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.290
and averaged them all out
and found out it's

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.550
not quite like that.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.400
That you don't always get these
two standard deviations

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.280
of improvement.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.180
And in fact, the good
computerized systems are doing

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.190
just as well as a human tutor.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.540
And the other thing he found is
that it wasn't so much the

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.070
one-on-one tutoring.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.170
The more important part was
the mastery learning.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.590
So mastery learning, again,
means you keep on learning

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.480
until you've got it, which seems
the obvious thing to do.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.060
But mostly, we don't do that
because we've got a whole

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.120
class of 30 or 50 or 200
students, or whatever, and we

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.950
got to move ahead at
a certain pace.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.590
So we say, well, we're going
to learn this for

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.400
this amount of time.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.070
Then, there's going
to be a test.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.010
Then we're going to do
the next subject.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.480
Salman Khan talks about that.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.240
He says, this is crazy.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.350
So this is like if I was
teaching you to ride a bicycle

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.700
and you ride for a while and
you keep on falling down.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.670
Then you'd say, OK, great.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.080
Now we're going to learn
unicycle because it's time for

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.330
the next unit.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.640
That wouldn't make sense and you
wouldn't learn to ride a

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.180
bicycle that way.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.330
But if we kept at it until you
stopped falling down, and then

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.500
with a sufficiently large
box of Band-Aids,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.700
everyone would get it.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.460
And that's what we need to do
for education is let people

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.090
take their own time, until
everyone gets it, and then you

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.440
can move on to the unicycle.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.740
So I think those are the
interesting lessons from that.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.400
And then there's one more lesson
that I thought was

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.212
fascinating, is that--

00:24:09.212 --> 00:24:11.290
there were a couple
dozen studies.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.660
Out of all we spend in
education, there was only a

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.350
couple dozen studies that went
into this meta-study.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.770
And sort of the canonical one,
the one that people cite the

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.460
most has 33 students in it.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.790
So it's like, we're deciding
the future of our education

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.500
based on 33 people.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.100
And maybe 10 of them had a bad
day and we got the wrong

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.520
conclusion.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.760
But now, we have the capability,
when we bring this

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.960
stuff online, we can base
things on 33,000 or 33

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.090
million, rather than just
a small sampling.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.830
We're able to collect more
data and get more

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.620
feedback from it.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.110
So I think that's exciting.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:53.010
So the question then is, how
do we get the advantages?

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.820
We can argue about exactly how
much, but we know one-on-one

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.280
tutoring and mastery learning
are important.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.250
Can we get them without having
to hire a private tutor for

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.650
every student?

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.440
Is technology the answer?

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.950
Well, technology has always
been the answer.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:13.270
So all these technologies listed
here, movies and radio

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.810
and TVs and so on, we're
going to solve

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.230
the education problem.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.440
And one of the earliest
examples, besides the 1791

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.290
example, is this is Thomas
Edison featured here with

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.670
Eastman from Eastman Kodak.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:31.220
And in 1913, Edison said that
books will soon be obsolete in

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.900
the public schools.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.780
Scholars will be instructed
through the eye.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.330
It's possible to teach every
branch of human knowledge with

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.760
the motion picture.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.710
Our school system will
be completely changed

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.650
inside of 10 years.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.040
And you could take that last
sentence about the 10 years

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.460
and apply it to every technology
since then.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.310
And the question is, are we now
at a point where anything

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.120
is any different?

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.220
Or 10 years from now, are we
going to say, well, that

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.760
didn't work.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.940
And now there's a new technology
and that'll work 10

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.960
years from now.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.435
So what's different?

00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:06.445
Well, if you look at these four
characters and say, what

00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:08.850
do they have in common?

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.590
There's probably two answers
that you come up with that

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.670
we've all been involved in
these online classes.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.220
And we're all involved in
artificial intelligence.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.780
And I think there's something
about that.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.910
That this idea that you can
learn from large amounts of

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.960
data, naturally sort of
attracted all of us to say

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.290
this is an application where
we can take that

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.740
data and apply it.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.840
And maybe make rapid improvement
in education the

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.950
way we have in other fields,
like computer vision, in

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.520
speech recognition, so on.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.270
We've seen that now is the
time when it's right.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.300
We've gone from having speech
recognition that's pretty

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.430
crappy to speech recognition
that's now pretty good.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.430
And it didn't really
take a single

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.760
breakthrough or a new theory.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.080
Most of it was driven just
by having better data.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.200
Now, here's the traditional
model of data.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.570
What you get from your four
years in college is a

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.650
transcript that looks
like this.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:10.760
And that works out to about 20
bits of information per year.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.600
Now, here's a consumer
electronics device.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.700
And that's about 192,000
bits per second.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.690
So that's about a trillion
times more.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.670
You also notice that the one
on the left costs more than

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.840
the one on the right.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.200
So the bitrate per
dollar is about a

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.830
quadrillion times better.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.510
So it seems like we should be
able to do better than the

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.520
transcript.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.240
So we should be able to gather
more information, have a

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.490
better picture of you as an
individual, both to represent

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.540
you to a prospective employer
and so on, and also to

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.020
aggregate that information
across all the students so

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.990
that we can make a rapid
improvement in

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.890
the pedagogy itself.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.260
Now, if you've seen other talks
I've given, this is a

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.960
chart I show where I say in
lots of application that

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.970
Google comes up with--

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.080
in search, in speech
recognition, in image

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.530
recognition and so on--

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.240
we often have a response curve
that looks like this.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.430
Where we say we apply some
algorithm to a problem and you

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.040
give it a little bit of data,
and the algorithm's performing

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.040
pretty badly.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.290
But instead of giving up and
going home, you went out and

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.460
gathered more data.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.720
And all of a sudden,
the algorithm

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.980
starts to get better.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.650
And the hope is that education
is going to turn

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:23.480
out to be like this.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.160
And we haven't cashed
in on that hope yet.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.210
We're just getting started.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.980
Nobody knows if it's going
to work or not.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.740
But I think this is what
we're all fighting for.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.150
Now, last thing I want to
talk about is how you

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.870
put together a class.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.780
And this also is
from Coursera.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.410
I asked them, what's your most

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.210
complicated branching structure?

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.280
And they said, well, we got a
genomics class that's got

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.890
these main components.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.820
And then there's a sort of
introductory class that feeds

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:56.030
into that and an advanced class
that follows up on that.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.940
So on the order of a dozen or
two units that are linked

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.410
together in this complex
graphing structure.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.160
Now, compare that
to this graph.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.940
Can you all see that
in the back?

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.120
That all clear?

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.180
You can read those labels?

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.410
So this is from Wikipedia
and this is all

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.485
the mammals in Wikipedia.

00:29:15.485 --> 00:29:19.270
So about 7,000 entries
and a dense link

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.900
structure between them.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.990
So very different than
the other graph.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.370
But in some sense, that's
not ideal either.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.125
I don't want it just-- if you
want to learn about mammals, I

00:29:28.125 --> 00:29:29.680
don't want to just
give you that.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.170
I want to give you some
guidance through it.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.430
And so what I would like to do
is be able to combine these

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:39.700
two models to say what we really
need is some guide from

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.360
a teacher, or some pathways
through this material.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.560
And here I've shown three
different pathways, three

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.640
guides that says here's one way
to look at this material.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.570
And it's a branching
structure.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.600
And now you have a choice
as a student.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.580
I could choose the guide I like
and I could stick with

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.870
them and follow them
along the path.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.930
Or, maybe I can switch to
another guide if I find I

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.510
don't like that one or
if I want more than

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.830
one point of view.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.800
And if I want, I can
go off-road.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.190
I can say, well, the guide's
taken me this far, but here's

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.550
some interesting stuff
that's off the path.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.540
And I'm going to take a
diversion and follow off the

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.030
path and on into Wikipedia.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.910
So I think we want to build
a system that allows that.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.340
Now, the problem is, who's
going to build it?

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.070
I want to make an analogy of
something I call courseware

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.740
engineering to software
engineering.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.360
Now, in the early days of
software, systems were built

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.910
by small teams.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.450
Here we have one guy.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.070
This is Bernstein working
on his chess program.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.840
Here's Wozniak working on
his operating system.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.850
And in those days, one guy or
a small team could build an

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:44.660
operating system.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.940
But those days are gone.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.940
Now we want to build more
complex objects.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.550
And we worked out a system of
software engineering so that a

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.470
team like this-- these guys
built a video game.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.030
We know how we can get teams
of dozens or hundreds of

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.260
people to build something
bigger than one or

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.740
two people can build.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.880
But in education, we're
not doing that yet.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.620
Courses are still built by one
or two people at a time.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.180
We want to find a way to be
able to put that together.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.420
So what's this doing here?

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.130
Well, in some domains, the
artisanal product is what you

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.290
really want.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:22.800
So I want a master cheese
maker to be making me my

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.180
cheese by hand.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.530
And I don't want the mass
produced product.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:29.650
And courses are like that.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.120
And I want to maintain the best
part of the courses of

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.380
saying, here's this
expert teacher.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.760
They have years of experience.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.230
I don't want to lose that.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.340
On the other hand, there are
other domains where the mass

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.500
produced product is
better than the

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.610
individually produced one.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.630
And I want to allow us
to do that as well.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:51.170
To be able to say, can we
combine these experts and have

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.240
them build something so that
we get the best of both?

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.630
We get this large graph, but
superimposed on top of that we

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.690
have the individual expertise.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.570
And that's where we're trying
to be head for, is

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.960
to allow for that.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.750
Now, we built Course Builder
and it's a tool that allows

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:12.160
you to experiment in building
your own class.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.580
I don't know how long it's
going take to get here.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.160
But that's why I'm in it.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.680
And so I guess we
got eight and a

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.850
half minutes for questions.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.940
And then afterwards, this is
the last session so you can

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.810
stay as long as you want.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:27.040
And we've got some laptops set
up here where you can play

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.920
with Course Builder or you
can talk to us after.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.020
So if there's any questions,
you can make

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.658
your way to the mics.

00:32:35.658 --> 00:32:49.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:50.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.240
I was wondering if you believe
that this revolution will

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.530
start from the academic level
or from children in schools,

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.850
which is another direction
that's being--

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.610
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.090
So I think there's a lot of
different directions.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.910
So I started with the college
classes because, one, that's

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.710
what I have experience
with teaching.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.570
Two, the subject matter is a
little bit more well defined,

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.490
so it's easier to measure.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.846
And three, there's no
complicated laws with children

00:33:20.846 --> 00:33:23.020
that are under 13 and getting
permission and all

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.660
that kind of stuff.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.170
So it was easiest
to start there.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.470
But I think you you're
absolutely right, that there

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.870
are other applications
as well.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.170
And children is an important
part of it.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.770
And I think there will be
a mix there of coming at

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.440
children through the schools and
coming at the schools sort

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.120
of with children discovering
it on their own.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.270
And you're seeing that with
things like Khan Academy,

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:49.120
where there are some places Khan
is the official policy of

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.540
schools and they use it.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.170
But there are many more places
where kids just say my teacher

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.140
said some confusing today
and I didn't get it.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.460
But I think it had the word
binomial theorem in it.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.910
And so let me see what Khan has
to say and that will be

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.560
more clear.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.470
So we'll see that.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.160
And we'll also see other uses.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.040
So we'll see on-the-job
training, I think will be

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.120
important-- continuing
education.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.920
And I think we'll see
non-academic subjects.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.610
How do I fix my toilet
when it breaks?

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.030
We'll see better education for
things like that as well.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.270
AUDIENCE: The magic
of YouTube.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:22.520
Thank you.

00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:25.929
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's
Michael Richardson.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:26.840
I work with [? EasyPREP ?].

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.620
We're an educational company.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.065
And our emphasis is actually
on standardized testing and

00:34:31.065 --> 00:34:32.760
the scoring aspect of it.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.909
And I'm trying to move us into
the digital age and get away

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:36.360
from the paper aspect.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.750
But traditionally, there's been
a challenge there where

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.900
testing on the computer is seen
as being very different

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.150
from testing on paper.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.679
Based on your experience, do you
see that continuing to be

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.820
an issue with the generations
that are coming up with the

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.749
computers and the tablets
the same way it

00:34:51.749 --> 00:34:52.610
has been in the past?

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:57.610
Or do you have any words
on that issue?

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:58.420
PETER NORVIG: So that's
a good point.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.650
I mean, I think you want
to be fair to everyone.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:06.810
You don't want to disadvantage
someone by saying you have to

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.060
take this test using technology
that you're not

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.870
familiar with.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.290
But I think the technology that
we're also already using

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:17.180
of filling in little bubbles
on a piece of paper, that's

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.590
not a very natural thing
for people to do.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.920
That's something that
you had to learn.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.030
And so I think replacing that
with learning to use a

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:28.810
computer is fine, as long as
everybody has access to

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.280
training for it and it's not
you're ruled out because

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.380
you've never seen
a mouse before.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.630
I think maybe tablets have a
smaller learning curve and so

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.820
that mitigates that
to some degree.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:47.525
And you'll just start to see
more and more kids growing up

00:35:47.525 --> 00:35:49.320
and being more familiar
with the technology.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.990
And they'll think it's odd to
be using paper and pencil

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.380
rather than using computers.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.460
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is
[? Dario ?] from Argentina.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.380
My question is related
to children.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:05.620
Beside the legal problem dealing
with small children,

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.710
do you think there is a
different [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:15.340
of education because in
university you want to learn

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.140
the thing that the teacher
wants you to learn?

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.300
And it's more like a guided--

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:27.780
there's a lot of things to
learn, but it's more like a

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.800
definite path for
the learning.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.160
In children, I think it's more
like knowing the world.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:40.340
There is experiences with
ungraded classrooms and

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.380
self-guided learning.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:47.170
Do you think it's a different
[INAUDIBLE] of learning that

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:52.390
can or cannot be covered with
this kind of infrastructure

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.330
for learning?

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.710
PETER NORVIG: Yeah, I think
that makes a lot of sense.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:00.540
That in a college class, we're
able to break up the world

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.510
into curricula in a more
well-defined way.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.810
Whereas, for younger kids, I
think you expressed it well.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.270
That there's lots of directions
that they could go

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.510
in and it's not that every kid
has to follow the same path.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:16.410
And that's part of the reason
why I want to have the tools

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.600
to be able to build
up this stuff.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:23.440
I think it would be a shame to
show a kid use this online

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.490
tool and there's only one
linear path through it.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.650
And every kid has to follow
the same path.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.370
I think that doesn't
make sense.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.690
Maybe it makes sense for
differential geometry, but it

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.480
doesn't make sense for a kid.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.780
And so if you want to give them
that, it's got to be more

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.060
you're giving them a playground
that they can

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.150
explore in.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.970
It's got to be this dense
graph-like thing where they

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:45.490
can go in the direction
they want.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.520
And I think also that
we want to think of

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.070
this as being a tool.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.820
It's not like it's
a replacement.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.660
It's not like they don't
have school.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.205
They don't have teachers.

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.230
They don't have anything else,
they're just stuck

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.790
in front of a screen.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:02.880
It's like this is one more tool
and they have books, and

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.000
finger paints, and
everything else

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.290
they have in the classroom.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.930
And this is one more thing for
them to play with part of the

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.970
time, but not the only tool.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.360
AUDIENCE: Hi there, my name
is Jarom McDonald.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.890
I'm the Director of Digital
Humanities at Brigham Young

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.510
University.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:24.540
And myself, growing up with
technology and being in the

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.460
development world as well, a
lot of what you talk about

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.060
makes sense.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.530
But having academic training in
the humanities and working

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:33.770
with humanities faculty on a
regular basis, I encounter a

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.790
lot of general technophobia
anyway.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:39.190
And over the past year and a
half, as we've been discussing

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.190
issues of the types of things
you're talking about, there's

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.440
a lot of resistance we encounter
among literature

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.310
professors, professors of art,
history, and so forth.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.970
And I was wondering, whether
from your personal kind of

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.700
outlook and paradigm, or even
from actual experience, what

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.090
sorts of things you might have
to say in terms of the ability

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.500
to handle the types of problems
that humanities

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.490
education is dealing with,
specifically literature, art,

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.550
and history.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.000
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.440
So there certainly have been
classes that do that, that

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.450
have worked out well.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:15.130
I think it's required a lot
of work on the part of the

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.040
creators of the class
in order to do that.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.490
So it's much easier to do a
math class because I can

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.300
generate an infinite number of
subtraction problems for which

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.710
I know the right answer.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:30.470
And generate them randomly
and test students

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.240
and get that right.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.080
I can't do that for an infinite

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.330
number of essay questions.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.760
The social structure of the
class is different .

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.050
It has to not just be you watch
something and then you

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:46.080
fill in the blank and it's
automatically graded.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.300
Rather, it has to be you're
collaborating with other

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.690
people, you're talking
with them.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.530
They're grading you're essays
and you're grading theirs.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.140
And you're having discussions.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.760
Sort of the structure of the
class is more complex.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.170
But I think it can be done and
I think there are advantages

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.516
to doing that.

00:40:07.516 --> 00:40:12.300
That you can have more immediate
feedback that way.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.320
And you can maybe reach
more people.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.920
So it's this--

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.330
the paragon of liberal
education, where you have a

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.730
small seminar with an expert
teacher and 10

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.320
students at a time.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.550
That's great, but
it's expensive.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:32.120
And if we can get close to that,
but be able to do many

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.160
more than 10 students at a time,
I think that's something

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.410
worth considering.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.170
AUDIENCE: My name's Wyatt
Anderson and I work for an

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.420
education company.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.520
I'm not an educator, but I've
been told by some that

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.020
learning is most effective
when directed by experts.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.520
I've been inspired by Coursera's
talks and by

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.060
everything else that we've seen
at Google with regard to

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.400
the social space.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.750
And we're trying to integrate
more of a social experience

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:57.470
into our learning.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.490
And I'm wondering, what kind of

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:03.400
challenges do you see with--

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.320
when you integrate a social
experience into the sort of

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.910
like online coursework system
with regard to the efficacy of

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:11.160
the course.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.200
What benefit to the
effectiveness of the education

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.730
do you see that sort of
social interaction

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:19.760
with your peers providing?

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.050
Do you think that's a valid
direction for education?

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:22.600
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.100
I think we still have to
understand how best to use

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.350
these social interaction.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:34.450
So I did my class and I go on
the discussion forums and I

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:35.160
say, oh, wow.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.630
This is so great because
students are asking questions.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.140
And I thought I'd have to
log on and answer them.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.040
But before I can even log on,
somebody else has answered

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.090
them and they've given
a really good answer.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:49.540
And so it seems like a very
lively place and a lot of

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.250
participation.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:55.520
So that seems very satisfying,
until you do the math.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.730
When you say out of all of the
students in the class, how

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.500
many are participating?

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.370
And you see, oh, it's only
1% that are doing a lot.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:06.770
And then another 5% that
are doing a little.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.620
And most of them are doing
almost nothing.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.670
So we've found a way to be very
effective for a small

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.060
number of people, but it doesn't
yet serve everybody.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.610
And I think we're experimenting

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:19.680
with different things.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.940
So there's a trial we're doing
with Coursera now to assign

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.310
students into smaller
study groups.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.290
So the one large discussion
forum is great if you have a

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.470
question at 3:00
in the morning.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.370
Somebody's likely to be able to
answer it in a few minutes.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.550
But it's also nice to say, well,
you're assigned to this

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.740
group of 10 people.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.070
And you're a study group and
every week you're going to

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.510
have a Hangout.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.660
And you're really responsible
for preparing

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.370
and showing up there.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:50.500
You feel much more pressure to
show up and perform when

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.900
you're 1 of 10 people than
when you're 1 of 10,000.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.500
And there may be multiple sizes
of groups in between

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.100
that we need to experiment
with.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.582
I think we don't know
yet what works best.

00:43:01.582 --> 00:43:03.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.530
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.670
My name's [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.470
I come from a company
called [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:11.720
We are currently building a
virtual science lab/tutorial

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.350
system for developing countries,
especially

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.690
targeting rural areas where
they have no internet

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.200
connection.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.295
So we have built a system
that is online.

00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:26.840
It works online, but it also has
to have the sort of proxy

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.840
mode, a small box, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.070
based, that works in
these areas that

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:32.530
have absolutely nothing.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:35.120
Now, I know it in Google,
offline is

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.980
probably a swear word.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:43.690
But is there anything in the
education initiative to focus

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.450
on those rural areas as well?

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:51.180
Because this is all fine, but we
have a huge group of people

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.070
that have no access to
everything you've

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:55.030
been talking about.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.920
PETER NORVIG: I think that's
a good question.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.990
I think most of the time,
Google's policy has been we're

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.830
inventing the future, so we're
imagining a future where

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.390
everybody has connectivity.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:07.340
And we're building
towards that.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.670
And if we go in that direction,

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:10.150
eventually it'll come.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.010
We're skating to where the
puck is going to be.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.520
And I think we should keep
following that, but I think

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.150
you are right, that there are
places now where people don't

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.230
have that connectivity.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.810
It would be good to help them.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:25.360
One of the guys on my team just
spent some time at the

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.750
South Pole.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:28.540
And there are times of the
year when they lose

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.890
connectivity because there's no
satellite overhead in the

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:31.480
right place.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.130
And he said, wouldn't it be
great if I had a Google

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:38.760
appliance on-site that could
then serve as a proxy for

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.140
everybody locally?

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.410
And that would be good product
for people who lose

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.280
connectivity, but we haven't
built that yet.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.410
So I think we're experimenting
with that.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.370
There certainly is a lot of
stuff you can put on tablets

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.250
and so on, and pass
those around.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:53.850
Alfred, did you have
something to add?

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:55.720
AUDIENCE: I'll just
make one comment.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:00.720
So google.org is focusing on
a few major activities.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.230
And one of them is trying to
provide better access to

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.520
telecommunications.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.490
So that's something that we're
really interested in because

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:07.270
you're right.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.170
That without telecommunications,
it'll be a

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:10.900
big problem.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.830
And it's hard to come up with
specialized solutions for

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.880
areas when it's not commercially
viable.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.390
To just do something special for
some area, it's not going

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:21.500
to work so well for them.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.920
So we're much better off if
we can find a way to get

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.260
telecommunications.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.960
So I think it's more feasible
than not for large parts of

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.600
the world now.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.800
And we're working on it.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.720
Some of the things we've even
learned with Google Fiber in

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.200
the States and doing these
things cheaply are actually

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.044
fairly relevant.

00:45:37.044 --> 00:45:40.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.040
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm John.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.440
I'm just a developer
who's interested in

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.120
this sort of stuff.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.990
So one of the things that you
really seemed to focus on is

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:52.790
just the general state
of educational books,

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.520
software, et cetera.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.750
But it kind of is apparent,
especially from the Coursera

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.640
graph you showed, that the
motivation you're creating for

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.010
people's really artificial.

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.160
You're just making due dates to
kind of keep them compelled

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.000
as opposed to making the
information that they're

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.760
learning really interesting
to the individual

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.370
and motivating them.

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:15.070
Have you guys done any work on
just trying to create problem

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:18.920
sets that appeal to just general
groups of the populace

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.100
in order to motivate them that
way, instead of just guilt

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.710
tripping them into--

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:25.370
guilting them for not
learning more?

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.990
PETER NORVIG: I don't know if
guilt tripping is really the

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.990
right way to look at it.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.640
Because this is something
that they want to do.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.510
It's just a question of exactly,
how do they do it,

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:40.880
and how do they fit into
the rest of their life?

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.820
So we're not forcing them
to do anything.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.010
They haven't paid any money
for these classes.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.810
They could drop out
at any time.

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:49.610
So the fact that they don't
drop out means this is

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.600
something they really
wanted to do.

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.640
But they needed the motivational
structure to

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.030
figure out when to do it
and when to fit it in.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:02.830
And the benefit of having the
due date is now when you go

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:05.800
into the discussion forum, you
get an answer right away.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.850
Because everybody
else is online

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.120
working on the same thing.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.110
So I somewhat sympathize with
this idea that it's a false

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:18.450
motivation.

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:21.920
But there's also a real
motivation of camaraderie, of

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.440
saying we're all in this
together and we're

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.620
doing it right now.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.250
And I think that part
is genuine.

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:33.190
Now, can you have it so that
we don't need any of these

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.140
dates and people just want
to come back and

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:36.960
do it on their own?

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.210
And people talk about that.

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:41.370
There's talk about
gamification.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.010
If people are so excited about
playing video games and they

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:48.010
don't need due dates to play a
video game, can we do the same

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.120
for education?

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.120
I think that's worth trying
to understand better.

00:47:57.408 --> 00:48:02.030
And people talk about putting
in all these badges and

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:03.300
points and so on.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.220
And people get motivation
for that.

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.460
That's a little bit different
than due dates, but it's also

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.390
external rather than internal.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:15.290
I think the reason people get
excited by video games is

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:18.220
because they're doing something
that's epic.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:22.840
So it's not that you get the
badge, it's that, hey, I saved

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.080
the world from aliens.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.250
How cool is that?

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:29.270
Yeah, I do realize they
weren't real aliens.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:32.350
But it's the fact that I
participated in something

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.940
great that keeps me coming
back to want to

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.860
play the video game.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:39.030
I think we have to make
education like that.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:43.160
And I think part of it is having
them do real stuff.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.020
So I said education is about
you doing something rather

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.070
than listening to something.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:50.640
And if we make you build
something cool, then I think

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.170
people will want to come
back and do it.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.740
I think they get turned off when
they say I have to answer

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.820
a question about this train's
going 10 miles an hour and the

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.740
other train's going
20 miles per hour.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.600
And when I'm done, I haven't
accomplished anything.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.470
I know everyone's done that
problem before and I'm not

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:10.100
proud of having done it.

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.400
But if we can give them things
where at the end, hey, I built

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.500
something that's really cool.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.830
That I can share with my friends
and that I can be

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:20.440
proud of having built, then I
think you'll get people coming

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.880
back for the intrinsic reason.

00:49:24.562 --> 00:49:26.100
AUDIENCE: Hello, my
name is Josiah.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:30.070
I work as a professor at the
University of Paris.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.540
Aren't you a bit afraid
of something?

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.720
The humanity has proven to be
able to keep books on shelves

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.110
for hundreds of years.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:41.390
It has also proven to be able
to lose, for instance, the

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:43.400
source code of [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.800
40 years ago.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:50.420
Aren't you a bit afraid to see
all this material lost?

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.790
And maybe with these kind of
tools we are building a new,

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:59.230
great Library of Alexandria
that is bound to disappear

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.930
with all those wonderful things
that has been lost.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.840
PETER NORVIG: Yeah, so that's
a great question.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.640
Now, of course, the Library of
Alexandria didn't fare so

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.490
well, either.

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:14.500
So centralizing all your
paper in one place

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.610
is not a good strategy.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.500
So it's better to have it
decentralized and stored in

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:21.520
many places.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.250
It's also good to have it stored
in a format that's

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.350
going to persist.

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:28.240
And so why would this
fail to persist?

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.480
Well, one reason would be
that formats change.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:37.320
So whether it's a physical
format, it was on a USB drive

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.200
and we moved on and we don't
have USB drives anymore.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.570
That would be a problem.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:45.300
I think that's becoming less of
a problem as we have these

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.615
cloud services and things are
reproduced everywhere.

00:50:47.615 --> 00:50:50.350
And you don't worry so much
about the physical format.

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:54.700
So then it becomes more
the data format of,

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.740
is this going to--

00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.900
standards going to change and
JPEGs, or movies, or whatever,

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.570
are no longer needed.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.960
I guess there you just need

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.180
documentation of past standards.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.100
That will live for a while.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.570
I don't know if the JPEG
standard is going to be used a

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:17.230
hundred years from now, but I'm
pretty sure if a hundred

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:20.690
years from now you gave me
a JPEG, I could find the

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:22.780
definition of what it
was like and write

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.840
a translation program.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.130
So I'm not so worried
about that.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.990
And then the other thing to
worry about is the end of

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.310
civilization.

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:35.070
If there is no electricity, then
I can't run this program.

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:38.090
Whereas, like the paper stuff
would probably still persist.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.730
And I guess we should
worry about that.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.730
But if that happens,
we got bigger

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:43.988
problems to worry about.

00:51:43.988 --> 00:51:47.327
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:47.327 --> 00:51:49.010
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Dylan.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.110
I used to be a teaching
assistant at Tech for a really

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:55.400
long time, teaching computing
to engineers or people who

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.970
weren't specifically in the
study of computing.

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:01.140
And you talked a lot about how
we can use computing to make

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.620
education better.

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.910
But what are the things we can
do to make education of

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:08.640
computing better, especially in
our younger age groups or

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.230
with female demographics?

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.400
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.303
I think there's a lot of
efforts there now.

00:52:15.303 --> 00:52:19.100
And I guess keep experimenting
is the right way to do it.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.470
Figure out what works.

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.190
Figure out, are there
things that are

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:28.080
intimidating certain groups?

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.870
Are we doing things wrong so
that we're excluding part of

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:32.330
the population?

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.460
I think also some of it is
that it's just hard.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.400
I ran into Don Knuth recently
at an event.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.720
And he had famously said that
he thought that only 2% of

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.890
people could be programmers.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:53.070
And I asked him if he still
thought that and he said yes.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.600
But I think maybe his standards
are just too high.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:00.640
Because if you think of,
well, how many people

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.500
can play the piano.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.840
Is the answer 2% or is
it something else?

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.370
Well, it depends on what
you mean right.

00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:11.830
So I can play "Chopsticks."
Alfred can

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:13.350
play the piano well.

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:18.750
And other people can be
a symphony player.

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:22.530
And where do you draw the line
between who is a piano player

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:23.460
and who isn't?

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.450
So I think we can get a lot more
than 2% up to the sort of

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:31.680
core competency of, yes, I can
bang out a tune, even if I'm

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.970
never going to be a professional
at it.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:38.020
And maybe we should put more of
our focus on that, rather

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:42.970
than just saying, can we hire
more people to have this as a

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:43.910
professional job?

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:47.370
I'd rather focus on, can we get
more people having a basic

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:49.635
understanding, so that they can
apply that to the rest of

00:53:49.635 --> 00:53:50.490
their life?

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:53.270
And there, I think it's got
to be a lot more than 2%.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:56.390
I don't know if it's 50%,
or 80%, or 95%.

00:53:56.390 --> 00:54:00.430
But I think we can get most
of the people there.

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:02.600
And I guess we're going
to have to stop now.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.600
I'm sorry, we don't have time
for more questions.

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:09.887
