00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.848
Now we've looked at addition and subtraction of functions, but what about

00:00:03.848 --> 00:00:11.031
multiplication and division? Let's say that we have f of x equals x plus 1. And

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:17.398
g of x equals 2x minus 5? What then would f of x times g of x be? Please

00:00:17.398 --> 00:00:18.579
simplify your answer.
