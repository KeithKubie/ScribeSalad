need to hold on to and remember and what
can it just throw away so it's like your

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310
can it just throw away so it's like your
 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.830

brain has a large filing cabinet and

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840
brain has a large filing cabinet and
 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.300
brain has a large filing cabinet and
it's opening up each drawer and it's

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310
it's opening up each drawer and it's
 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.609
it's opening up each drawer and it's
taking in various images and memories

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619
taking in various images and memories
 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.410
taking in various images and memories
from the day consolidating what it needs

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420
from the day consolidating what it needs
 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.020
from the day consolidating what it needs
to and puts it in whatever file and then

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030
to and puts it in whatever file and then
 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.310
to and puts it in whatever file and then
if there's something that doesn't fit in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320
if there's something that doesn't fit in
 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.420
if there's something that doesn't fit in
any of the files and doesn't really

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430
any of the files and doesn't really
 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.490
any of the files and doesn't really
belong you'll forget about it so it's a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500
belong you'll forget about it so it's a
 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.600
belong you'll forget about it so it's a
way of really getting a succinct way of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
way of really getting a succinct way of
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.610
