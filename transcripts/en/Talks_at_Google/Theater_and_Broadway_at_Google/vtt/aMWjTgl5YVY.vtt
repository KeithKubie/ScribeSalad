[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.860
AMY SCHULZ: So thank you.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.715
So here we have the
cast and creative.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:11.090
So wouldn't you go down the
line and introduce yourselves

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.520
and let us know what role
you play in the show.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.590
LAUREN YALANGO GRANT: I
am Lauren Yalango Grant,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.585
and I am in the "King's"
company and ensemble.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:20.960
PETER ENGLAND:
I'm Peter England.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.672
I'm scenic designer and
projection designer.

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:25.130
GAVIN ROBINS: Hello,
Gavin Robbins.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.984
I'm the movement
director for "King Kong."

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:29.900
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: Hello,
I'm Carmen Pavlovian,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.615
and I'm the producer
of "King Kong."

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:32.990
SONNY TILDERS:
I'm Sonny Tilders,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.940
and I'm the creature
designer of "King Kong."

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.340
JON HOCHE: My name is Jon Hoche.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.440
I am one of the voodoo
puppeteers for "King Kong,"

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.560
and I am also the
voice of King Kong.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.670
AMY SCHULZ: Great.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.860
So "King Kong" was
first introduced in 1933

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.540
by filmmaker Marian C. Cooper.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.430
And The story continues to be
told in different variations,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.570
and now "King Kong" has
taken over Broadway.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.380
First time ever on stage.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.890
So who came up with
the initial idea of,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.519
I think a "King Kong"
should be on stage?

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.572
Where did this start?

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:08.780
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: Well, I
think the answer ultimately

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.210
depends on whether "King
Kong" is a success or not.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240
If it is, I'm going
to say it was my idea.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.150
And if it's not, I'm going to
say it is Peter England's idea.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.040
Full disclosure-- we're married.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.920
And when we were setting up
Global Creatures back in 2007,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.790
we were in London and
thinking about ways

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.000
that we might use this
extraordinary animatronic

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.500
capability that Sonny Tilders
here is the brains behind.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.090
And Sonny and his team had
built lifelike dinosaurs

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.860
for an earlier
production of ours called

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.360
"Walking With Dinosaurs."

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.550
And I was about to
set up this company,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.390
and I was thinking about ideas
for how we might utilize this

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.770
for another theatrical show.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.510
And so Pete and I
were in our apartment

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.390
in London chatting about
ideas, and in many respects,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.030
it's not a great leap to come
up with the idea of doing "King

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.529
Kong" when you're
thinking about how

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:06.450
you might utilize that kind
of animatronic technology.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.479
On the other hand,
as soon as we went,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.949
won't that be a crazy idea?

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.320
What started to dawn on
us was the possibilities

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.350
of storytelling, because
"Walking With Dinosaurs"

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.880
had been an arena show.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.080
And what "King Kong" lent
itself to, of course,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.490
because it's such an
epic myth, and it's

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.170
a production of such scale
that we thought music

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.150
could have a really
interesting role there.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.160
And so we asked ourselves
this question about

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.170
whether or not the
show could exist

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.215
in a more traditional
proscenium-style theater.

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:40.280
And so from there, we started
this really quite bizarre

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.040
process of what I
call proof of concept

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.740
where Pete and Sonny had to
really think about, well,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.550
if we put a creature that
size in a limited space

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.730
of a theater, how does
he get on and off?

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.560
How does he do that
in an interesting way

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.710
where we're not seeing him just
sort of shuffle into the wings?

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.120
Can he fit in the wings?

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.680
Sonny, can you
make sure that when

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.930
he swipes his arm that
he's not going to knock out

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.980
the whole ensemble?

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.676
And could Sonny create something
where he could scratch his nose

00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:09.050
or beat his chest
without putting

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.250
a fist through his sternum?

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.576
And Pete, of course, had
to think about, well,

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:14.450
once that creature's
taking up the space, how

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.450
do I put a set in there?

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.020
Et cetera.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.490
So that's how we began.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.490
AMY SCHULZ: Was it always
going to be a musical?

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.470
Or maybe a play?

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.569
What made you want to put music
and dance with it as well?

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.110
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: Well, sorry,
I won't answer every question,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.360
but I will just take this one.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.960
So we knew because
of scale that music,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.260
because of, obviously, its
capacity to evoke emotion,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.160
and it was very important to us.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.180
And I'm sure you'll hear
more from Sonny and Gavin

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.496
in terms of Kong as a
creature and a creature

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:45.370
that we connect with.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.750
It was a very important
part of our development

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.500
that we weren't making a
robotic creature that you'd

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.260
expect to see at a Universal
Theme Park ride or something,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.070
that we actually were making
a creature that could be part

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.410
of a story that
moved you and helped

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.230
you use your imagination
as an audience member.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.690
We didn't think, oh, let's
make "King Kong-- the Musical"

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.520
because, let's be frank,
that sounds quite comedic.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.530
We just nonetheless
thought that music was just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.290
going to be important to
give us scale and emotion.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.019
And as time went on,
one thing we really

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.120
wrestled with in the
creative development

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.270
was that we had this
extraordinary creature who

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.200
really did work and function as
a character onstage interacting

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.702
with humans, but we just kept
feeling like no matter what

00:04:30.702 --> 00:04:32.660
we did, this creature
was plugged in the middle

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.190
of someone else's musical.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.490
And eventually, we
realized that we

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.300
had to honor this incredible
conceit that Sonny

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.740
and the team and Gavin had come
up with of Kong being operated

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.760
by puppeteers, and humans move
him around and breathe life

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.780
into him.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.920
And that that idea, if we pulled
it through the entire show,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.740
would give us the kind of
cohesion we'd been looking for.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.700
So it got me thinking that the
pages of this particular story

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.780
really needed to be turned with
a physical language to match

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.590
Kong's.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.480
So then, we started
working with Drew McOnie,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.810
because he's a choreographer
and a director.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.149
And his idea was to have a
cast that could puppeteer

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:18.440
the whole set through movement.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.030
And that became
really fundamental

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.700
to the whole musical
identity of the piece

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.630
as well, because of course, this
sounds so simple and obvious

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.934
now, but we didn't
initially really get

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:31.100
to grips with the fact that
King Kong is the leading

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.770
character in a musical, but
he can't sing and can't speak

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.980
and he can't dance.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.070
And as much as people always
say, oh, does the monkey sing?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.310
He doesn't sing.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.170
And so we needed
to find something

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.270
in the language of
the storytelling that

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.690
really paid deference to
the type of performer he is.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.667
So went the music.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.750
PETER ENGLAND: When Cooper
made that film in 1933,

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.220
it was really the first
Western, at least,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.950
movie with a
purpose-built score.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.290
And so it has a
musical identity that

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.430
is critical to a lot of what
that movie's success was.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.170
And being such an epic, almost
legendary mythological-type

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.520
tale, a "Beauty and the
Beast" kind of archetypal fear

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.130
of monsters and journeying
from one empire, New York City,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.490
to this fallen empire
and this mythical island,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.970
giant boat trip and climbing
up a mountain and coming back

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.190
to New York City and then
climbing the tallest point,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.810
the Empire State Building--

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.130
there's something about
that storytelling,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.960
which is verging on operatic.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.430
And music is one of the
great international languages

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.680
of storytelling, in a way.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.250
And it supports that epic
journey, perhaps better

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.720
than simple words would do.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.510
So I think that's just part
of the drive of the production

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.800
is a musical language as
opposed to being a musical.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.490
AMY SCHULZ: And the story
was created in 1933,

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.210
and your story is
set in 1933 too.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.184
Was there any thought about
making it contemporary

00:07:07.184 --> 00:07:08.600
or putting it in
the 21st century?

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.504
PETER ENGLAND: In
that a modern audience

00:07:14.504 --> 00:07:15.920
needs to take
something away which

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.550
means something to them,
but not in contemporizing

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.900
it to put it--

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.075
like Dino De Laurentiis
did his 1976 film

00:07:26.075 --> 00:07:29.230
and set it on the Twin Towers.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.400
And he was going for a
very contemporary angle

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.840
on the story.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.990
For us, the idea of 1933--

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.080
the Great Depression,
the building

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.860
of the Empire State Building
in 13 and a half months--

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.650
these sorts of things are
really at the heart of the story

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.300
that we've been
trying to tell, which

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.805
is about a gritty courage and
ambition that defies the odds.

00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:55.430
And there's something
about that period

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.930
in this city that captures
that in a very poetic way.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.510
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: I might
add that when we were first

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.210
thinking about this
show, it was 2008

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.390
when we were doing our
creative development,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.320
when that process began.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.820
And we were about six
months in, I think,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.140
when you had the financial
markets crash here,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.270
which spurned on the
global financial crisis.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.670
And we were so struck by
it because, of course,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.830
through our development
process by day,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.610
we were researching New York of
1933 and the Great Depression,

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.350
and then often saying, my god.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.890
At night, our televisions
were on with news broadcasts,

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.970
and all anyone was talking about
was these financial crisis not

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.030
seen on a scale since the
Great Depression of the '30s.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.120
And I just thought, wow, this
story does need to be told.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.270
And in thinking about
what stories one

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.420
might put on the stage, there
has to be a reason to do it.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.270
And you might notice
if you consume

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.280
arts editorial at
the moment, there's

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.310
a lot of frustration on behalf
of a number of reviewers

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.620
of films just being
plumped on stage.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.890
And of course, "Kong"
is not just a film.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.590
It's one of the great
myths of the century.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.260
Originally, it was
a novella in 1932

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.730
that came out as a
publicity tool for the film.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.410
And of course, it's been
told in many forms since.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.780
And so the question
we asked ourselves

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.990
is, what can this story say
that's new to an audience

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.860
today?

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.400
And well, at the
time, we didn't think

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.910
it's going to take 10 years
to realize the production,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.680
but along the way, every
step of the journey, what's

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.750
been really particularly
noticeable to me

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.880
is that there's
something that's always

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.280
relevant in current
events of the day.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.280
So "King Kong"
essentially is a story

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.020
about a beauty and the beast.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.330
Historically in
this country, it's

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.650
really had a lot of debate and
thinking about racial overtones

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.880
and subtext in the piece.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.280
So we had to think about that.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.780
Of course, there's
climate change.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.140
There's the idea
of the other, which

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.030
is a really important
part of our story telling.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.750
And of course, we have a
filmmaker, Carl Denham,

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.300
who's threatening to crush a
young actress if she doesn't

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.160
do what he wants
to do, because he's

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.640
one of the most powerful
producers on Broadway,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.650
apparently.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:23.070
And so, of course, we
were having these scenes

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.840
read during
auditions at the time

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.179
that the Harvey Weinstein
scandal broke, and I just

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:27.720
thought, wow.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.620
Here we go again.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.660
Everything we do
around "King Kong"

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.550
seems to find a relevance
in what's happening today.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.460
So that was important
to us, but we really

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:41.250
felt rooting it in a 1933 period
was important because to us, it

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:46.650
really started to answer the
question of why something that

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.070
was created in 1933 still
has something relevant to say

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.900
to audiences today.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:58.650
But we wanted to not have it
feel like a very traditional

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.680
musical, so it was important
to us that we found a language

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.110
that honored the
'30s, but still had

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.560
it feel like there was a level
of innovation and something

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.140
contemporary that you could
see in the whole aesthetic

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.370
of the piece that carries
through the music as well.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.810
AMY SCHULZ: And so Sonny,
you are the creator,

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.275
the designer of this.

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:20.120
So I read King Kong the
puppet is 20 feet tall

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.560
and he's 2000 pounds.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.115
Where does one begin to
design something of that size?

00:11:27.115 --> 00:11:29.310
SONNY TILDERS: It's
certainly an evolution,

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.500
and as Carmen
described, we really

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.420
evolved this out of
"Walking With Dinosaurs."

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.754
And I think the
instinct was probably

00:11:38.754 --> 00:11:40.920
to do something like "Walking
with Dinosaurs," where

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.970
we made these lovely,
very realistically wrought

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.140
creatures.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.600
And that's where we started.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.690
And we thought, well, I'll just
make this lovely robotic thing,

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.140
and we'll try and get
that sublime realism

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.960
that we saw in the Peter
Jackson film of 2004.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.050
And I thought, that
would be a thrill

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.780
to get that level of
animatronics on the stage.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.110
But then, we
realized it would be

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.000
a bit of a rod for our backs.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.730
Not least, how do
we make this what

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.940
would be probably a
substantially heavier piece

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.700
of equipment work
on stage safely?

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.520
It would be like having an
earth digging machine on stage

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.285
with actors.

00:12:21.285 --> 00:12:23.160
You wouldn't you wouldn't
let anyone near it.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.230
So that killed that idea.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:30.387
And then working with Pete
on the production design

00:12:30.387 --> 00:12:32.220
side of things, it was
clear that Pete's not

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.500
going to make a slavishly
realistic version of New York.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.430
He's going to use all
the tricks of theater.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.310
And it really dawned on
us that it made no sense

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.210
to do something so realistic.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.880
Now, people say
Kong's realistic,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.910
but he is quite aesthetically
different or pushed,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:49.410
if you like.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.160
His proportions are quite
superhero proportions.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160
He doesn't have fur.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.530
He has a bunch of these things
that we wanted to take him

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.604
somewhere else so that
the audiences is doing

00:13:00.604 --> 00:13:02.520
a bit more work rather
than just sitting there

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.200
passively and watching
something so realistic.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.380
AMY SCHULZ: It's interesting
that you say that,

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.930
that he doesn't
have fur, because I

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.470
could have sworn he did.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.600
Being in the audience
and seeing him,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.725
it just seemed so lifelike.

00:13:10.725 --> 00:13:13.410
SONNY TILDERS: Yeah, and the
fur was one of those things

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.060
that, as soon as
we put fur on him,

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.360
he started to look far
too realistic again.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.090
And we tried all sorts of
different versions of string

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.720
and shade cloth, and
whenever we did it,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.090
it just looked
like a shaggy dog.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.780
And we had this
lovely sculptural form

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.440
as a sort of a mannequin to
try out these various surfaces,

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.780
and the sculptural form was
made of these muscle bags.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.660
And one of the
lovely things that we

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.640
do as a company at
Creature Technology

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.700
is to try and make
creatures look a sublimely

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.520
real as possible, and that is
about making anatomical layers.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.500
So the skin of dinosaurs,
usually scaly skin,

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.530
would sit on this
muscular under structure.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.920
And so we'd always cover
this muscular under structure

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.230
that would stretch and
contract and change shape

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.486
like real muscles do, and
we'd pin up all this fur

00:14:05.486 --> 00:14:07.110
and then take it off,
and then just sit

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.200
back and admire this
incredibly strong muscular form

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.390
and go, oh, that's it.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.810
This epitomizes
what it culminated

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.700
to be-- this incredibly powerful
manifestation of masculinity.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.440
But there's something kind
of lovely and vulnerable

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.540
about the rawness, too,
of not having a surface.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.640
And so I think what Kong has
become is a moving sculpture,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.410
and all his muscles
connect seamlessly.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.270
But the trick is, it's
a marionette puppet,

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.874
so none of the joints
could have friction.

00:14:38.874 --> 00:14:40.290
We needed this
freedom of movement

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.780
with a marionette puppet,
because essentially it's

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.490
strings that hold up
the arms, and they

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.400
need to be manipulated
by performers as well.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.700
So there are a bunch
of technical challenges

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.130
to work through.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:58.770
But the decision to have
him hairless, again,

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.960
evolved out of this
thinking about, well,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.521
we've just got to remove him
from this slavishly realistic

00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:04.020
thing.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.360
Because, I think, with a puppet,
the form and the aesthetic

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.682
has to match the movement.

00:15:10.682 --> 00:15:12.310
And there was a
concern, going back

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.280
to the idea of making it
a really realistic robot,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.620
is that we'd probably
get it 90% right.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.470
But that 10% would be the
difference between people

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.000
believing it or not.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.620
So the marionettes-- very
traditional technique

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.420
with a less realistic aesthetic.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.626
I think those two ideas
work well together.

00:15:32.626 --> 00:15:35.350
AMY SCHULZ: And so
Gavin, you choreographed

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.960
the aerial movement of Kong.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.280
And Kong isn't scenery.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.300
Like he is moving
across the stage,

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.390
he's up and down, in the air
like an actor on the stage.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.980
How long does it take to
choreograph a puppet and also

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.525
the people that control
the puppet to move as one?

00:15:54.525 --> 00:15:55.900
GAVIN ROBINS:
Yeah, well, I mean,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.340
we worked in Australia--
we did several workshops

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.670
on prototypes of Kong before
we ended up with this version.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.000
And that was a very
informative process

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.070
where we worked originally
with circus artists

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.210
to try to find a
way of rigging Kong

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.880
in the points in
which Kong is attached

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.550
with marionette operation.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.200
That took trial and error.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.810
And we also had very
talented circus artists

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.920
that would have a knowledge of
working with ropes and strings.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.800
And one of the things I
think we're really proud of

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.510
is the physical risk taking that
the performers involved, where

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.050
they jump off Kong's
shoulders at times

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.760
and haul his arms into
the air to swap the planes

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.620
or to fight the serpent
and this kind of thing.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.610
So we had a lot of
exploration with

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.500
highly-trained
physical performers

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.426
and how that could intersect.

00:16:52.426 --> 00:16:54.050
And so then, when we
were in Melbourne,

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.680
we worked for six months
writing automation cues,

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.410
and we have really
talented team--

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:04.240
Richard Martin, who writes a lot
of the automation programming.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.050
It's the real connection
between automation,

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.380
the animatronics that Sonny's
created, the movement of Kong,

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.020
and the confluence of
all the performers action

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.819
that Lauren's a part of.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.650
So it took a lot
of trial and error,

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.400
and then there's moments where
the voodoo and the movement

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.380
of the head coincides with
the movement of the shoulders,

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.690
and then the
placement of the hand,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.110
and that took months
and months to create.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.610
And with--

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.030
AMY SCHULZ: So all of
that is choreographed?

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.895
GAVIN ROBINS: It's
all choreographed.

00:17:31.895 --> 00:17:33.730
AMY SCHULZ: Every
little step in order.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.521
GAVIN ROBINS: And
everything has an impact.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.630
So the way in which
the automation

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.414
moves, the way in
which the head moves,

00:17:39.414 --> 00:17:41.080
the way in which the
shoulders, and then

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.440
the placement of the elbow
line, and all of these things.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.070
There's so many
elements involved,

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.220
and you can get it wrong
very quickly, very easily.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.980
And so it's about the
refinement of those things.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.990
And even now in the
theater, we're writing,

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.090
we're adjusting cues.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.220
There's a team in
there taking notes

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.840
that Sonny and I've given to try
to refine the movement of Kong

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.470
even more.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.569
So yeah.

00:18:06.569 --> 00:18:08.110
CARMEN PAVLOVICH:
So Gavin and Sonny,

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.450
is it worth you explaining
a little bit about what

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.524
voodoo technology is?

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:12.940
Because, of course,
it's the thing

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.372
that delivers all of the
emotion in Kong's face.

00:18:15.372 --> 00:18:17.830
And you've always talked about
the importance of the puppet

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.400
breathing.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.130
SONNY TILDERS: Yeah, so it
is an absolute combination

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.560
of a whole bunch of groups
of people, if you like.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:33.940
And whilst much of it
is automated in terms

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.920
of Kong's position on stage--

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.960
and Kong is
essentially suspended

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.815
by what we call Kong's
apparatus, which is this--

00:18:41.815 --> 00:18:44.290
it's like a gantry
crane above him,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.740
which has this disk which
houses all the winches that

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.200
hold his 2000 pounds.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.370
That part of it, because
of the safety aspect,

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.630
is automated and pre-programmed.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.350
But the rest, 90%
of it is all live.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.900
And so it's that concert
of all these live things

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.170
coming together every night
and getting to that point

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.590
where it's all working together
to create this sense of one

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.060
sentiment being on stage.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.142
That's the beauty, I
think, that we really,

00:19:16.142 --> 00:19:17.600
really enjoy bringing
to the stage.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.390
But the voodoo aspect--

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.550
we call it voodoo--

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:26.470
there's three puppeteers
who operate all

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.570
the internal functions of Kong.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.850
So Kong has a very
expressive faces.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.850
There's about 16 servos
or motors in the face that

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:35.170
deal with his expression.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.550
There's a bunch of hydraulic
axes for the more powerful

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.990
aspects within his body--

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.600
shoulder shrugs and
waist movements.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.630
There's even pneumatics
in his wrists.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.730
We found as a big
marionette puppet

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.730
where, I described before,
he needed lovely loose joints

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.921
for them to be manipulated when
Kong would go up and do a chest

00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:55.420
beating.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.010
In one of the
prototypes, his wrists

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.210
would flop around,
because they're out

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.501
of the reach of the performers.

00:19:59.501 --> 00:20:01.160
It wasn't exactly powerful.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.030
So it gets all quite anatomical.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.790
We have these things
called air muscles, which

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.600
are a bit like tendons
in your forearm,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.512
go around the wrist of Kong.

00:20:12.512 --> 00:20:14.720
And they can be tightened
to make the wrist powerful,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.595
or loosened so that
performers can manipulate them

00:20:17.595 --> 00:20:20.262
and can flex and do a
range of things like that.

00:20:20.262 --> 00:20:22.530
So there's a whole raft
of different technologies.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.890
So we needed to find
a way of controlling

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.407
that sort of technology.

00:20:26.407 --> 00:20:30.710
And so we took a leaf out of
the "Walking With Dinosaurs"

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.920
project that we worked on where
we had these voodoo operators.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.860
And the name suggests whatever
you do with a voodoo doll,

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.220
the real thing does.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.470
So that's where it leaps from.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.990
We've used it in
film quite a bit.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.230
We didn't coin the name.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.770
But so there's three people
who have these voodoo rigs,

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.195
and Jon's one of them.

00:20:47.195 --> 00:20:51.090
And Jon specifically
controls the neck of Kong.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.780
So the eyeline of Kong,
where Kong's looking.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.920
Danny controls the face, which
is this mix of expressions.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.670
And Jacob--

00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.850
AMY SCHULZ: Control
it with a joystick?

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.850
SONNY TILDERS: Yeah,
they're custom controllers.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.076
So we try and make it is
intuitive as possible.

00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:06.950
But we actually found
it quite hard with Kong

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.150
to make them match
some sort of anatomy.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:14.000
So yeah, to get on
Danny's rig, which is--

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.150
they all look a bit like--

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.230
well, Danny's rig looks
a bit like a machine gun.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.580
AMY SCHULZ: He does the face?

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.650
SONNY TILDERS: And
he does the face.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.275
And so none of those things seem
to line up, so you get on them

00:21:24.275 --> 00:21:26.660
and you're completely lost as
to what you're controlling.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.850
So part of the challenge
I'm sure Jon will attest to

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.060
is breaking down all
these complex moves

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.770
and doing this
isolation training

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.230
so that you know that whatever
you're doing with the wrist

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.870
here, which is controlling
about five different functions,

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.539
that you understand
what you're doing.

00:21:40.539 --> 00:21:42.080
AMY SCHULZ: I had
a question for Jon.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.640
So there's three
of you doing that.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.000
How do you work together?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.480
Or do you work together?

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.360
Or do you just know that
you control the neck,

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.370
so Kong has to move
his neck, and then

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.370
Danny knows how
to move the face?

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.680
Or how does it work?

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.490
JON HOCHE: Well, we all have to
definitely work together to--

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:03.650
Kong in himself is
an ensemble piece.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.335
No one person can
stand out, really.

00:22:05.335 --> 00:22:06.710
You really have
to work together.

00:22:09.714 --> 00:22:12.380
For example, like with doing the
voice, there is about an eighth

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.690
of a second delay
from what I'm doing,

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.810
so then Danny, who
is to my right,

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:22.231
can hear and anticipate what
I'm about to do onstage,

00:22:22.231 --> 00:22:22.730
in essence.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.620
So then he can create that.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.840
AMY SCHULZ: I assumed you
did the facial expressions

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.755
because you're doing the voice.

00:22:27.755 --> 00:22:29.838
So that's very interesting
to me that someone else

00:22:29.838 --> 00:22:32.400
is going the voice, and
so when you do the scream,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.980
he then manipulates--

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.810
JON HOCHE: Correct, yeah.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.540
The face, with so many
servos and everything,

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.380
I think, is such a complex thing
that needs to be focused on--

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.820
SONNY TILDERS: Also, Jon,
the voice and the head

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.840
really lead the
intention of the puppet.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.970
So it's really important that
Jon has those two things.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:57.680
So where the puppet looks
and how it vocalizes

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.420
is the lead for the
other puppeteers,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.950
and really for
the whole ensemble

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.370
to understand what the
brain of Kong is thinking.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.560
So those things seem a
bit odd to bunch together.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.880
Then again, the face
really is so complex

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.090
that to think about all
those nuances in the face

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.130
and do the voice, I
think, was probably

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.890
going to be an overloading
element for the puppeteers.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.100
AMY SCHULZ: And how
choreographed or scripted

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.090
is the breathing and the
roaring and the grunting

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.460
that Kong does?

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.350
Do you know at certain cues that
you breathe or when you grunt,

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:34.400
or is it a new
performance every night?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.470
JON HOCHE: There are
moments of improv

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.434
that happen every night, because
every night is different.

00:23:39.434 --> 00:23:40.850
That's the beauty
of live theater.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:45.500
But a lot of the grunts and
the growls, snarls, and roars

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.090
are all scripted.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:51.050
He has lines, just like any
other actor has in the script.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:56.270
And it's a mixture of almost
having not only a script,

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.065
but also a score,
too, because you

00:23:59.065 --> 00:24:04.000
have to hit certain inflections
and things like that.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.740
So it's half improv,
half have scripted.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.090
AMY SCHULZ: And so Lauren, you
are part of the King's company

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.862
that control the
movements of the arms.

00:24:14.862 --> 00:24:17.897
So can you talk a little
about your role specifically?

00:24:17.897 --> 00:24:19.730
LAUREN YALANGO GRANT:
I bounce around a bit.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.420
I'm on his elbow, I'm
on his right back foot,

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.625
and I'm also a person that does
some launching off of his back.

00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:28.250
GAVIN ROBINS: She
does heroic launches.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.951
Dun dun dun!

00:24:28.951 --> 00:24:30.950
LAUREN YALANGO GRANT: For
us, as King's company,

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.491
it's really important
to-- obviously,

00:24:32.491 --> 00:24:34.190
it's quite an ensemble piece.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.620
No one is more important
than anyone else.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.770
It's very much a group effort.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.510
And also, what we do is
very much choreographed.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.350
But Kong feels alive.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.220
He's alive.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.050
Like alive on Broadway-- he
really is alive on Broadway.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.220
And so it's choreographed,
but there's also

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.890
moments where maybe automation
is delayed a little bit.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.880
So we always have to be
really on high alert and ready

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:08.230
to be flowing and to adapt to
what's actually happening live

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.130
on stage, because it's
not always the same.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.784
So we have to have our
antenna on high alert.

00:25:13.784 --> 00:25:15.200
AMY SCHULZ: And
there's 10 of you.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.450
LAUREN YALANGO GRANT: There
is 10 of us on stage, yeah.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.533
AMY SCHULZ: And so do each
of you-- like you said,

00:25:18.533 --> 00:25:19.960
you do wrist and the elbow.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.200
Is everyone split up amongst
the different body parts?

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.160
Can you switch roles, or does
everyone know every part,

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.200
or do you only know
how to do the wrist?

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.130
LAUREN YALANGO GRANT:
For instance, there's

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.170
two guys that do the
paws, and they're

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.250
pretty much set in that role.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.500
Same with the wrist gentlemen.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.415
They're basically just there.

00:25:37.415 --> 00:25:40.960
The back, we have the people
on the feet and knees,

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.820
we have a little
bit more flexibility

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.520
on what we're doing.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.810
Like me and the other female
that's in King's company,

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.490
we do a few different
things, which

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.390
is kind of nice because you get
to know the creature even more.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.620
So there are some parts
that are pretty stationary,

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.480
and then a few of us
bounce around and do

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.190
a few different tasks on him.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.800
AMY SCHULZ: And then are there
understudies like if someone

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.610
injures themself?

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.235
LAUREN YALANGO GRANT:
Yeah, definitely.

00:26:05.235 --> 00:26:09.790
We have three male swings
in King's company and one

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.190
female swing.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.442
So they're amazing.

00:26:12.442 --> 00:26:14.650
And from the beginning, they
were very much included.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.200
It was a group effort.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.262
Tackling this beast is
quite an undertaking,

00:26:21.262 --> 00:26:22.720
and from the
beginning, we were all

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.680
hands on and trying
to get everyone

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.280
as knowledgeable and physical
with the puppet as much

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.770
as we can, because he's a beast.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.370
AMY SCHULZ: And that set itself
that Peter designed is also

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.380
this moving majestic
piece as well.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.180
Like in the beginning
of the story,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.490
the Empire State
Building is growing

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.590
amidst the Great Depression,
and at the same time,

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.090
we see the character
Ann Darrow, who

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.920
is also trying to
rise out of the ashes

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.620
and make something of
herself in the world.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.010
Can you talk about
how the Empire State

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.530
Building-- that building and
the city's architecture-- how

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.864
central that was to your design?

00:27:00.864 --> 00:27:02.530
PETER ENGLAND: Can I
just also point out

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.570
that the King's company
don't just operate Kong,

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.030
but they are the most
amazing collection of dancers

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.322
I've ever seen in my life.

00:27:08.322 --> 00:27:10.030
They also do all of
the ensemble dancing.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.560
So it's a big night for them.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.090
It's just-- it's amazing.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.630
As Sonny said, when we
started working together,

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.660
to do a show like this, to
be literal and naturalistic

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.910
on a stage, we
would be scuttled.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.750
So we need to use all of
the devices and, I suppose,

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.615
imagination that theater brings.

00:27:27.615 --> 00:27:30.940
And just as Kong is,
in a way, something

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.080
of a sketch of a giant
gorilla, in that it's not

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.140
completely detailed,
anatomically correct--

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.126
as real as the
experience that you

00:27:40.126 --> 00:27:41.500
feel that you've
had when you see

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.190
the show is, when you
see that creature,

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.030
he is sculptural and stylized.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.600
And I guess that's the
same language that I've

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.170
used for the show scenically.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.100
The building of the
Empire State Building--

00:27:54.100 --> 00:28:00.660
I just constantly am fascinated
that that architectural icon

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.179
was built in 13
and a half months.

00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:03.220
I just find that amazing.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:03.910
AMY SCHULZ: During
the Great Depression.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.750
PETER ENGLAND: Yeah.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.520
Can't renovate a
kitchen in that time.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:15.520
So the images of the metal
workers, the steel workers

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.650
1,000 feet up in the air
hanging off I-beams and hooks.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.190
Referred to as sky
walkers at the time.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:27.760
There's something about those
people at that height building

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.540
that building in the midst
of the Great Depression

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.180
that I found really inspiring.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.980
It sounds odd, but
that's basically

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.470
what New York City has
become in this show.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.620
It's I-beams and cables.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.020
So Kong's got a lot of
ropes and cables connected,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.600
and as does the set.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.310
The main parts of
the New York City set

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:55.680
are all, in a sense,
marionette pieces themselves.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.320
We quote directly from those
iconic images of the sky

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.140
walkers hovering up in the air.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.920
In a way, we look at
our journey for meaning.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.000
And at the beginning
to when we are,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.080
we do have a nod to the
building of the Empire State

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.430
in the opening of the show.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.240
Our journey takes
13 and 1/2 months.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.570
So at the end of the show, she
climbs that building with Kong.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.960
I suppose the other thing to be
said is the jungle part of it.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.770
And that, I suppose,
is even more stylized

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.930
and more imagined.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.960
It doesn't delve into forestry.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.620
It's much more a state
of mind, in a way.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.590
It's quite a
surreal environment.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.670
It's got a hypnotic feel to
it, but the visual language

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.500
is all about vines.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.020
So again, we're referencing
this idea of ropes,

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.287
and there are characters
who manipulate those vines.

00:29:56.287 --> 00:29:58.120
So again, we're just
having this interaction

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:02.050
between cast and
physical objects in a way

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:09.320
to puppetry the environment,
to puppeteer Kong.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.800
And there's actually
a time where

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.350
there are some performers that
are puppeteering our cast.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:19.560
So the cast are manipulated
through the jungle

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.730
by the jungle.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.660
So we've got layers and layers
and layers of that sort of rope

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.280
and cable language.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.650
With the I-beams
in New York, we're

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.020
looking at the
skeleton of a city.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.000
In a way, Kong also has some--

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.010
he's got a beautiful
climbing frame

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.160
when he's back, which
has a skeletal feel.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.430
It has a nice nod to the
idea of a silverback gorilla,

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:42.880
being silver.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.020
But I suppose the
aesthetic of this show

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.070
is to describe things
as simply as possible

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:55.740
using lines and skeletal
form to allow the audience's

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.056
imagination to do the rest.

00:30:58.056 --> 00:30:59.430
The other big part
of it is where

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.240
we do lean on a much more
recognizable visualization

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.200
is the projection content.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.210
So we have basically a
semicircle LED screen

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:13.470
that's 90 feet long by
almost 30 feet tall.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.590
So it's a big
surface, and we create

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.040
a lot of our environments
and our sense of movement--

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.500
Kong's movement through a space,
a boat going through the ocean.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.470
AMY SCHULZ: One of
my favorite visuals,

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.400
and that's including Kong in it,
but one of my favorite moments

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:34.500
was just the rocking of
the boat in the beginning.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.610
The audience gasps, and that's
even before they've seen Kong.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.640
You made us feel like
we were on this boat.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.870
PETER ENGLAND: Yeah, I feel
good about that moment.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:43.420
We've got a good boat.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.820
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: He gets a
round of applause every night.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.612
It's very good.

00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:46.320
AMY SCHULZ: Yeah.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.310
And how much of that is
the projection and your set

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.352
and then also the actors?

00:31:51.352 --> 00:31:53.060
PETER ENGLAND: Actually,
the projection's

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.580
doing all the
movement work there.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.170
AMY SCHULZ: Oh, really?

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.003
PETER ENGLAND: Yeah.

00:31:56.003 --> 00:31:58.200
The boat is designed
to automate,

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.940
and we do do it once
when we first leave

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.830
the docks in New York City.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.510
But we've found just the--

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.000
well, first of all, there's
some physical realities

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.220
that forecast dancing
around as energetically

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.130
as they are on a
rocking platform.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.000
It's a bit tough
given everything else

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.606
they've got to do in the night.

00:32:13.606 --> 00:32:16.540
But really, just the device
of having the boat profile

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.270
or silhouette shaped
skeleton and the moving

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.920
footage behind it is
enough to give you

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.160
the sensation of movement.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.720
And then there are moments
where choreographically, there's

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.036
an engagement with
that movement as well.

00:32:30.036 --> 00:32:31.410
And certainly,
Kong, we take that

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:36.330
to the extreme, where if he goes
running through an environment,

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.620
we can support that
with projection

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:43.230
and accentuate his physical
speed and dynamic using

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.470
that device.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.980
And the projection,
like the scenery,

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.560
is also, whilst
it's recognizable,

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.350
it's intentionally quite
painterly and stylized,

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.990
and also as pushed
to the background

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.850
as it can be when
it needs to be,

00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.289
rather than being some
sort of photographic tour.

00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:01.830
CARMEN PAVLOVICH:
Can I add something

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.400
about the challenge
of the jungle?

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.010
Which the question of
aesthetic really preoccupied us

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.480
for quite a long time.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:15.570
Because in 1933, telling a
story of a group of white people

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:19.890
going to an island, and in
that version of the story,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.260
Ann was captured
by natives, and how

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:28.110
you represent that idea and
that kind of location in 2018

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.410
obviously was the topic of
some thinking and debating

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:32.790
from all of us.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.520
In the end, Jack
Thorne decided he

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.750
didn't want to have natives
in this story, which

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.720
was a relief to all
of us, because he felt

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.956
he couldn't tell their story.

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:46.800
And so the question
became, how do

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.090
you represent Skull Island in
a satisfactory way in 2018?

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:55.944
So for us, it became very much
about an island that was--

00:33:55.944 --> 00:33:57.360
I think you use
the word hypnotic,

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.240
Pete-- that it vibrated
of its own energy,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.190
where it had sentient plants.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.980
And it's like the
island's alive and has

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.860
its own kinesthetic
energy, but there's

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.000
no natives in this story.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.580
And so just the
aesthetic of that.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.230
We often think of this story
being told in four chapters.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:18.480
It's the New York of the 1930s,
the boat journey at sea, Skull

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.580
Island, and then
all those elements

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.780
returning with the adventurers
to a different New York

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.830
in Chapter Four.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.800
But I thought the visual
aesthetic of Skull Island

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.362
was a very interesting challenge
of this development as well.

00:34:31.362 --> 00:34:32.070
AMY SCHULZ: Yeah.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.486
I'm glad you brought that up
because I know when I watched

00:34:34.486 --> 00:34:37.469
it and I knew the story, and
so I was wondering if there

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.960
were going to be natives.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.850
And when you first
see the vines,

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.130
that's maybe what I
thought they were.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.750
And it's really amazing
how they designed it.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.749
And I don't know if it's
the movement of if it's

00:34:48.749 --> 00:34:51.894
the choreography, but there are
actors dressed as the vines,

00:34:51.894 --> 00:34:53.310
and they're jumping
on the actors,

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.170
and they're fighting them
off like they would fight off

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:55.739
a plant.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:58.890
And it's pretty powerful.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.380
And so then I realized,
oh, this is the island.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.180
The island is the character.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.030
The island is the native.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.780
It's really great.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.946
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: Excellent.

00:35:06.946 --> 00:35:08.200
I'm glad you understood.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.142
AMY SCHULZ: Yes.

00:35:09.142 --> 00:35:11.820
PETER ENGLAND: But hopefully,
for a modern audience,

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.390
it just talks of nature.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:21.080
It talks of an idea of some
sort of heart and ecology

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.410
that is trashed.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:28.100
And that Kong sits at the
throne of that environment,

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.650
and by taking Kong
from that environment,

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.550
you intrinsically
take away its heart.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.420
And so I think we've got
to the point of thinking,

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.970
you don't need people
to talk that idea

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.770
of cultural imperialism--

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:46.430
not to flog it, but just to
sort of put it out there.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:47.930
You don't go into
these environments

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.900
and take something out without
suffering the consequences.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.691
AMY SCHULZ: Well one
thing I wanted to ask,

00:35:52.691 --> 00:35:54.380
Jon, and the rest
of you can too chime

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.630
in is, the most compelling
feature of Kong--

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:57.290
I mean.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.680
His size is one thing,
but it's really his eyes.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.070
And it's these dark eyes
and how expressive they are.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.430
And his wonderment toward
Ann, and then also his just

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:11.060
sadness later when he's
trapped back in New York.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.910
What do you feel
is the anchor that

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.820
connects the audience to Kong?

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.554
Is it his eyes or is it
your voice, your breath?

00:36:20.554 --> 00:36:22.470
JON HOCHE: I would say
it's a mixture of both.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.090
I think the beauty of
him is a lot of times,

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:28.940
people can look at him, and
whatever they're feeling

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.182
is reflected back at them,
especially in the eyes.

00:36:32.182 --> 00:36:36.780
And when the light hits
the eyes just right,

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:41.530
they kind of glisten, and you
swear that they're moving.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.830
But that's, I think, a testament
to the puppet and a testament

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.880
to the show and the script.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.950
And yeah, sure.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.460
The voice has a little
bit to do with that too.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:56.290
But I can't take
full credit for that.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:37:00.050
But yeah, I think it's just
what everyone has come together

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:05.200
to make this fully-realized
character in a musical

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.624
that Kong is really
speaks to people.

00:37:08.624 --> 00:37:10.790
GAVIN ROBINS: And one of
the things that's important

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.880
when you're working with Kong
is that he's constantly alive.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.070
I mean, the puppet can
die very quickly on stage.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:20.600
And so the breath that's
happening through the movement,

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.240
but also the facial
expressions, the movement

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.170
of the nose, the energy of
the King's company on Kong--

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.970
all of that really
contributes to the sense

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.520
that he's constantly
thinking and feeling.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.250
And that's really important.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.791
AMY SCHULZ: It's
interesting that you

00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:38.180
said that a puppet can quickly
die on stage, because you

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:42.200
see him pretty early on when
you get Kong to Skull Island.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.500
And I admittedly was like,
oh, they already showed him.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.872
But the amazement and
wonderment never goes away.

00:37:48.872 --> 00:37:50.330
and I think that's
because of that.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.209
He feels alive on the
stage, and you're just

00:37:52.209 --> 00:37:54.000
learning more about
him throughout the rest

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.740
of the show.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.390
SONNY TILDERS: Yeah,
and I think what

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:01.480
I like about it is each scene
refreshes our view of Kong

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.210
and then the way Kong
works with Peter's set.

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.717
Rarely do we repeat a
position or a move of Kong

00:38:08.717 --> 00:38:09.800
throughout the whole show.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.930
So yeah, we do expose
him relatively early,

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:15.750
earlier than originally.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.400
It's evolved into
seeing him earlier,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.200
because I think that's
what audiences wanted.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.210
But there's so many different
variations in how we see him,

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.520
and I think that's
really important.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.810
And there's of course his
emotional arc as well,

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:34.460
which, just to add to Jon's
comment about the face,

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.930
the face is
incredibly important.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.690
And we had some big decisions
to make in terms of, OK, well

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.750
if we're embracing
marionette puppetry, which

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:47.810
is quite a traditional art form,
well then marionette puppetry

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.240
usually has a jaw that might
go up and down at most.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.100
It may be a blinking
set of eyes.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.290
But we were very
keen to make sure

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.300
that Kong was more
than just a snarling

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.640
based with a set of teeth
that might flash out every now

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.420
and then.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.580
And so the expression
was something

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:05.666
that we thought was going to be
very important from the start.

00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:08.630
And it speaks to this
idea and a certain mind,

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.850
but this idea that
puppetry is an incredibly

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.170
practical or pragmatic art form.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.930
So all these choices
of whether to use

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:19.100
technology or humans
or ropes and strings

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.100
or hydraulic cylinder,
these were all

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.820
very pragmatic decisions.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.920
And I think in the end,
they do the one thing

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.680
which is to create this
breath and life in the puppet.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.680
Then audiences
that accept a grab

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.450
bag, if you like, of
different techniques,

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:39.240
as long as this one creation
is plausible at the end.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.254
And so the expression was
one that we felt-- well

00:39:42.254 --> 00:39:43.670
I certainly felt
quite comfortable

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.030
about putting this
layer of technology in.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.170
And think it's really key
to Kong's emotional story.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.530
AMY SCHULZ: He has so much
expression that I couldn't

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.290
believe what I was seeing.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.110
It truly was unbelievable,
and it felt like it was--

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.350
I'm so used to
seeing CGI on film,

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:01.130
and that's what-- it seemed like
I was seeing CGI in real life.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.580
It was just too realistic.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.540
It was really great.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.998
PETER ENGLAND: For
what it's worth,

00:40:04.998 --> 00:40:08.180
think that the
puppeteers on stage

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.000
are the one
ingredient that really

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.160
gets that creature across
the line as a stage puppet.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.590
And a lot of people
see it and say, oh,

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.930
why aren't we seeing
puppeteers moving around?

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.184
And a lot of people
may have seen

00:40:22.184 --> 00:40:24.350
war horse, which was another
great example of seeing

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.370
puppeteers on stage.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:29.360
And there's a long tradition,
bunraku and kabuki puppetry,

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.540
where you see the
puppeteers operating.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:37.730
And the magic of theater where
you forego that device and just

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.760
surrender to the
imagination, and that those

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:45.680
puppeteers actually invest
him with a spirit and a soul.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.750
Not to get religious about
it, but they really--

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.070
that contribution--

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.000
I'll tell you, if you see
the show, the curtain call

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.150
moment when they
step forward, it's

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.700
like an earthquake's
been going off.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.860
There's a great appreciation
for what that device brings

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.640
to that puppet.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.210
AMY SCHULZ: There is one
moment where Kong is gassed,

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.570
and the people controlling his
paw, they lay his paw down,

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:13.650
and then I saw that actor then
himself or herself do that.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.020
And it was all seamless.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.290
And as you said, you accept it.

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.504
Oh, so we have a question.

00:41:18.504 --> 00:41:20.420
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to say, I saw the show

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.630
and was absolutely
blown away, truly.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.440
And I did want to say that
it almost felt interactive.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.890
The audience felt-- it
was a communal feel.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:34.380
They gasped, they cried, they
applauded all at the same time.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.900
I just thought it
was phenomenal.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.480
I also saw "Walking With
Dinosaurs," which is cool.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.090
I didn't realize it
was the same team.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.500
Yeah, so great job.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.500
I don't have a question.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.541
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: Oh, it's
nice to hear from you.

00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:45.404
Thank you.

00:41:45.404 --> 00:41:47.070
AMY SCHULZ: Do you
have a question here?

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.867
So I also saw it, and
I really enjoyed it.

00:41:51.867 --> 00:41:53.450
I love the original
movie, and I think

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.540
that the show seems very
interested in like what

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.417
made that movie
powerful in a way that I

00:41:59.417 --> 00:42:03.247
don't feel like every
adaptation of "King Kong" has.

00:42:03.247 --> 00:42:05.330
And one of the things I
particularly enjoyed in it

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:09.960
was the collusion between Ann
and Kong towards the end of it.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.620
It was like these scenes
of her riding on his back

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.180
as he is rampaging
through New York City.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:23.480
And in the last song, they
paint him as less of a victim

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.420
and more as a kind of
Messiah figure of some kind

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.810
of liberation or something.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.810
And I was wondering if
you could comment on some

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.470
of those character's choices.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:40.314
Well, it was like replacing
Jack with Lenny, I think.

00:42:40.314 --> 00:42:42.230
It did some interesting
things with the story.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.435
I know none of you wrote
the book, I guess, but--

00:42:44.435 --> 00:42:46.310
PETER ENGLAND: You said
no one read the book?

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.960
I've read that book.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.850
AUDIENCE: No, wrote the--

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.580
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: No, we
didn't write the stage book.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:49.800
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.230
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: No, I
understand what you mean.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:52.750
Jack Thorne is not amongst us.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.960
Yeah.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.620
So it's a great
question, because it's

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.430
been probably the most
central part of our thinking

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:02.630
over the last 10 years.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:07.550
And it goes back a little to
my earlier point of why today?

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.210
What can this story offer
an audience in 2018?

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:15.680
And of course, if you think
about Ann Darrow in 1933,

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.350
she was a screaming blonde.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.090
Kong was just a scary monster.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.130
She was afraid of Kong.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.020
They didn't become friends.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.900
Later versions of the story
like the Peter Jackson film,

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.950
they had a friendship.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:35.060
And in that original story, it
therefore made sense for there

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.520
to be a character
called Jack Driscoll who

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.790
was gallant and strong
and a ship's first mate.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.640
And he could come and save
her from the scary monster,

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.070
and then they went off
into the sunset together,

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:49.550
and that felt like a
very satisfying story.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:52.400
When we tried to include
the character of Jack

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.520
Driscoll in earlier
iterations of the show,

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.010
and this is before Jack
Thorne-- another Jack-- joined

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:03.260
us to adapt the book, we
found that Jack Driscoll

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.150
as a character was
always irritating.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.334
Because when Ann and
Kong were together,

00:44:07.334 --> 00:44:09.500
you're interested in them
and not really interested.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.791
And it's just like, oh god, no.

00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:12.410
He's here again.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.620
And then when Kong
dies at the end,

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.500
it felt really awful
that suddenly he

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.180
walked out and embraced Dan.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.800
And again, you
thought, oh, go away.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.630
I don't want to hear
you say you love her.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.890
I mean--

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.550
AMY SCHULZ: I hope everyone
knows the story of "Kong."

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.084
We've had so many spoilers.

00:44:27.084 --> 00:44:28.860
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: Yeah.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.570
And then the bigger question
for me over time-- harder

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.380
to answer-- is
what sends victory

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.730
at the end of this story?

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.330
And what does it mean when you
make a choice again in 2018

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.060
to say that we want
this to be end story?

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.760
We don't want this to be called
dead on the filmmakers story.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.470
We want her to be
front and center,

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:46.970
and we want her to be the focus.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:53.070
Well every time you try to
make the love interest matter--

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.660
and for us to care about
that subplot of Ann and Jack

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.710
Driscoll--

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:00.470
it only took the focus off
Ann, and it made it really hard

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.040
to keep her front of the story.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.290
And I just thought
in 2018, I want

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.330
to have a female
protagonist on stage that

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.190
has a different
victory to walking off

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:10.930
in the sunset with a guy.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.990
She had to change in some
way from the whole experience

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:15.960
of knowing Kong.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.840
And so when I met
up with Jack Thorne

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.220
to ask him if he'd be
interested in writing it,

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.890
I put this to him and I said--

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.700
part of me is terrified to even
ask the question out loud--

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.410
is an audience going to want to
see a musical where there's not

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:32.950
the kind of romance or the
kind of musical opportunities

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.080
that a love interest offers you?

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.900
You can imagine some gorgeous
duet on the boat or at the end.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.980
Is it just going to be boring
if it's about Ann and Kong.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.390
And he said, absolutely not.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:44.740
Let's never talk about it again.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.400
Jack Driscoll has gone.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.300
He complicates the
story, he's superfluous,

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.490
that's why he's
struggling, and you'll

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.280
find the storytelling just opens
up and becomes really clear.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.720
AMY SCHULZ: The real love
story is between Ann and Kong,

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.560
and she does have a beautiful
ballad that she sings to him.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.518
CARMEN PAVLOVICH: Yeah.

00:46:00.518 --> 00:46:03.250
It's a real friendship of two
people who are misunderstood

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.160
and two outsiders.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:10.090
So that was a really major
moment in our development.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.620
It freed us up so much.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.070
And Jack had one
other requirement

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.530
that he was very specific
about if he were to come

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:18.970
on board as the book writer.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.450
He wanted this to be
a tale of ambition,

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:26.350
and he wanted Ann's ambition to
be a factor in Kong's capture.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:29.740
Because he wanted to
see her fail in order

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.500
for her to go on the journey
and have this sort of victory

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.690
of becoming a better person,
or a different person,

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:35.725
from the experience.

00:46:35.725 --> 00:46:37.100
Sorry, that was
very long answer.

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.170
AMY SCHULZ: That was great.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.753
AUDIENCE: Can I just
quickly follow up

00:46:39.753 --> 00:46:42.310
on a question about the
show and your casting?

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:46.060
And that if casting the
lead as a woman of color

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.030
was more about blind casting
and you're just like,

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.900
we love her voice.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.010
We want her.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:54.130
Or if it was to continue
telling that story

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.322
that you were just illustrating?

00:46:56.322 --> 00:46:58.030
CARMEN PAVLOVICH:
Another great question,

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:00.730
because of course, this has
been another very big part

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:01.480
of our discussion.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.040
And I mentioned
earlier, our thinking

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.070
about how one tells a
story about an island

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.700
with natives capturing
someone in 2018.

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.220
And the other piece
of it was Kong

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:16.360
does have a history
of alienating

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.470
some sectors of the community.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:22.000
There's been a lot of
thought, and you can easily

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.700
find a lot of thought pieces
about whether Kong represents

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.750
the other and that the
whiteness in the stories

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.880
represents goodness.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.620
And so we were interested
to subvert that.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.870
The question of
colorblind casting

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.000
is very topical in our
industry at the moment.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.160
And I find we
often talk more now

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.390
about color-conscious casting.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:53.710
And I know Drew
McOnie, the director,

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:56.500
felt very strongly when
we talked about the piece

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.930
that we wanted it to be a show
that made everybody welcome

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:03.400
and that didn't alienate
anyone in the audience.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.710
And to that end, it wasn't
about just saying, oh,

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.890
let's make sure that Ann's
just cast as a woman of color.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.730
It was about really making sure
there was a level of diversity

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:15.070
through the whole company
and that the company we

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.270
put together reflects
a contemporary audience

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:19.940
and society today.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:23.140
So that was an important
choice through the whole piece.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:28.160
We auditioned a number of
women, of course, for Ann,

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.170
and we had a number of
other women of color

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.570
do previous workshops for us.

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:38.500
But the casting choice
itself ultimately

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.940
was based on the
person we thought

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.230
was the best for the role.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:43.894
But we really did cast
our net very wide,

00:48:43.894 --> 00:48:45.310
and it was a very
conscious choice

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.220
to do so, because we
wanted to reflect something

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.410
back to a modern
audience that looks

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:52.010
more the society we live in.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.100
And we felt very strongly
about that choice.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.350
AMY SCHULZ: Thank you so much.

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.410
And thank you all
of you for coming,

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:58.750
and thank you for coming.

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.720
And I think we have
to wrap it up here.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.170
[APPLAUSE]
