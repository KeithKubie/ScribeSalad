HAOHSIANG LIAO: We conduct
the class entirely in Chinese

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.950
starting from day two,
after orientation.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.960
So if they need
orientation, we clearly

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.840
tell students about
roles and expectations.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.880
I would say there are a
few key components here

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.840
to make it happen.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.490
The first one is we tell
students that our idea here

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.250
is that we're trying
to create Chinese

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.170
as an atmosphere as possible.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.600
And if we were to refer to
English every few minutes,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.040
it's going to be
impossible to accomplish.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.470
So in order to do this, there
are a few key components.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.240
One is classroom expressions.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.910
So students, they
need to be familiar

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.770
with those instructions
you want them to do.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.410
For example, you want
them to repeat after you,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.890
or you want them to
answer questions.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.690
So the classroom expressions
are very important.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.910
Second thing is they
need to know what they

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.040
are expected to do in class.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.220
So that is about your
weekly schedules--

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.850
that detail, everything you
want them to do in class.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.580
So for example, you need
to tell students what they

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.815
need to prepare before class.

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:21.050
And in class you only
practice-- you only drill them

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.670
based on those materials.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.290
So what they do in class
is what they've prepared.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.410
And with the
classroom expressions,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.240
they're pretty
easily guided by you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.960
so that the whole interaction
can be in Chinese.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.230
And, of course, we
do understand that,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.880
because of the anxieties-- or
sometimes students cannot fully

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.230
understand what you say.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.850
In that case, we always tell
students be a little bit

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.310
patient.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.474
If you really have questions
you need to ask in English,

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:55.140
there are a couple
of things you can do.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.450
You can do it the last
five minutes of class.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.340
Or you can do it after class.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.470
Or you can communicate with
your instructor via email.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.080
But for the first 45
minutes, we really

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.100
want to create the
Chinese atmosphere

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.780
so that everybody
can feel they're

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.760
immersed in that culture.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.750
So this is what
we're trying to do.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.290
And I think after, I would say,
the two days or three days,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.920
students-- as long as you
stick to the principle

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.920
and also be
accommodating sometimes,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.160
they would know
this is expected.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.320
And I would say after
three days they usually can

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.170
follow along very, very well.
