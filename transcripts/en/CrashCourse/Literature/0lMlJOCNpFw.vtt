00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.910
Hey, I'm John Green, and this WILL be Crash
Course Literature, but not for two weeks,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.100
because I have to give you your reading list,
so you can like, you know, read the things

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.100
that we're going to talk about!

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.850
I enjoyed spinning, so I'm going to do that
again.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.880
Your first book?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.800
The Odyssey by Homer.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.710
No, Stan, come on.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.710
Homer.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.320
Yes, the one with all of the blood and misogyny.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.420
And then we've got Oedipus, by Sophocles,
everybody's favorite play about patricide

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.420
and incest.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.680
Speaking of murder, third we have Hamlet,
by William Shakespeare That was one too many

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.949
spins and I don't feel so good.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.010
Fourth on your reading list, Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein, my all-time favorite novel about

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.010
industrialization.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.510
Then we'll be reading Charlotte BrontÃ«'s
brilliant and tubercular masterpiece Jane

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.510
Eyre.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.969
Sixth, we'll be reading Chinua Achebe's Things
Fall Apart.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.079
Then we have To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper
Lee, the Boo Radley of American literature.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.260
Then comes the World War II novel Slaughterhouse
Five by Kurt Vonnegut.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.429
And lastly, we'll be reading one of my favorite
American novels, Beloved by Toni Morrison.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.210
You can find links to get all of these books,
many of which are free, in the video info

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.210
below.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.089
And we'll probably also be reading some poetry,
but I don't know what yet.

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.890
Anyway, thank you for watching, get to reading,
and we say in my hometown, do too many spins

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.600
and you will eventually vomit.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.719
[Stan talks in background]

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.719
John: Okay, okay.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.840
He barely murders anyone in that play, really.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.840
He doesn't have the courage.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020
Stan: ...straight-out, he kills Polonius straight-out.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.270
John: Doesn't he kill Polonius through a,
uh... through a curtain by accident?

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.880
Stan: He's stabbing someone.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.880
I mean...

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.280
John: He thinks he's stabbing his dad.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
Stan: Right.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.280
His stepdad.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.289
John: Yeah, he kills the wrong dude.

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.680
Stan: That's... the murder.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.210
John: Stan and I are fighting about whether
Hamlet really murders anybody in Hamlet.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.850
Stan: ...in a month or so.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.009
John: We should put that in... at the end
of the video.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.009
Stan: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.210
John: The video should end with us doing this
right now.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.210
Stan: Okay.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.340
John: This should be the end.
