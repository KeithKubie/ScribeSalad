00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.570
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: We'll get
this show on the road now.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.460
And for those of you who have
been to other events here today,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.530
you'll probably hear some
of the same verbiage.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.880
So my apologies.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480
At any rate, hello.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.780
I'm Betsy Peterson.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.460
I'm the Director of the
American Folklife Center here

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.120
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.110
And I'd like to welcome everyone
here to the latest presentation

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.290
of our Benjamin Botkin
Lecture Series.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.710
The Botkin Series allows
the American Folklife Center

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.010
to highlight the work
of leading scholars

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.510
in the disciplines of folklore.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.150
Ethnomusicology.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.450
Oral history.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.940
And cultural heritage.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.610
While also allowing us to
enhance the collections

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.390
of the American Folklife Center.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.170
For the center in the library,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.650
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.140
of our acquisition activities.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.560
And by that I mean each lecture
is videotaped and becomes part

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.450
of the permanent collections
here at the center.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.000
In addition, the lectures
are later posted as webcasts

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.820
on the library's website.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.680
Where they will be
available for viewing for,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.770
to Internet patrons
throughout the world.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.700
And also for future generations.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.520
So now, if you do
have a cell phone

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.040
that is on, please turn it off.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.190
And we will be most
appreciative.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.030
Today I have the honor

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.130
of introducing the distinguished
ethnomusicologist Deborah Wong.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.370
Dr. Wong, who is a professor
of music at the University

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.000
of California, Riverside, is
well-known for her research

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.510
on the musics of Thailand
and Asian America.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.070
She began her studies at the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.390
Where she started as a
student of anthropology

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.680
and music before continuing
on to earn an MA and Ph.D.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.410
in ethnomusicology from
the University of Michigan.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.440
She's taught at UCR since 1996.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.270
And has been deeply
involved with the Society

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.280
for Ethnomusicology for the
whole duration of that time.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.930
Which is the premiere
scholarly society

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.850
for ethnomusicology
in the United States.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.280
In addition to serving terms
on the SEM board and council,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.220
she has also served as
coeditor of the newsletter.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.420
And she was one of the
founders of the SEM committee

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.100
on the status of women.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.420
And has also served as SEM's
president from 2007 to 2009.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.930
Professor Wong is also active
in numerous other scholarly

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.760
and public sector
cultural organizations.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.250
She has served as board
chair for the Alliance

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.320
of California Traditional Arts.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.990
And is currently a member
of the advisory board

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.070
of Smithsonian Folkways
recordings.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.820
Throughout all of this,
Asian-American issues

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.320
and activities have always
been a priority for Dr. Wong.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.990
She's the author of
numerous publications.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.720
Including the influential books
"Sounding the Center, History

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.500
and Aesthetics in
Thai Buddhist Ritual."

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.630
Which address ritual
performance and its implications

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.610
for the cultural politics of
Thai court music and dance.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.480
And "Speak it Louder,
Asian-Americans making music."

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.760
Which focused on
music, race and identity

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.140
in Southeast Asian immigrant
communities in the Bay Area.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.680
Including some wonderful
research

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.020
on Asian-American hip-hop.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.800
Most recently, for
today's Botkin lecture,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.300
Professor Wong has been studying
Japanese-American taiko drumming

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.010
since 1997.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.260
And is a member of Satori
Daiko, the performing group

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.870
of the Taiko Center
of Los Angeles.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.420
So we're delighted today to
have her join us and present us

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.900
with a lecture on taiko drumming
in Asian-American Los Angeles.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.510
So please welcome Dr. Wong.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.500
[ Applause ]

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.560
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong:
Hello everybody.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.230
How does this sound?

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.530
Am I about the right?

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.830
Yeah, okay.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.180
Well, I'm looking
out at the room.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.060
I know almost but not
quite everybody who's here.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.660
I am related to many of
the people in the room.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.820
Thank you Wong cousins.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.120
Lee cousins.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.420
And Gunning [assumed
spelling] cousins for coming.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.050
And, of course, to be near my
valued friends and colleagues

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.750
from the American Folklife
Center this afternoon.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.060
It means a lot to me.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.250
Yeah, Judith, I haven't had
a chance to hug you yet.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.550
But hello.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.850
Yeah, you know, and Betsy.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.150
And Nancy.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.450
And Steve.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.750
And, and, and, and, yeah.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.050
And John. And Lisa, yeah.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.380
And so, anyway, I
am going to talk

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.700
about my taiko research today.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.430
And I did not write this out.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.980
I'm not going to read blah,
blah, blah to you the way

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.800
that academics, you
know, are expected to do.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.760
I'm instead just
going to talk to you.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.430
And I'm going to use a
PowerPoint to do it with lots

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.490
of pictures and video and stuff.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.000
Because taiko, as you
probably know, is a very loud,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.060
a very physical, yeah,
loud and physical.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.010
That pretty much sums up
taiko, I would say, yeah.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.100
And just so you know, there
is another taiko player

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.400
in the room.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.700
And that is Mark Rooney.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.000
And I'll tell you more about
him when I get to, yeah,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.300
he's looking around like this.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.980
Mark Rooney who's an
amazing taiko player.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.890
And the main taiko player
in the greater DC area.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.490
And I'll share a slide about
him at the very end, yeah.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.290
If you have seen
taiko, you've probably,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.970
I'm guessing, seen this group.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.520
Simply because they're
world famous.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.940
No exaggeration.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.940
And they spend about half of the
year on tour around the world.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.590
So you, you know, generally
end up having lots of chances

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.290
to see them if you live
anywhere near a major city.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.590
So if you've seen them,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.390
you've probably seen
them perform something

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.690
like this piece.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.510
Which is one of their most
well-known repertoire.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:07:18.040
[ Drum Music ]

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.340
Now, that's a Japanese group.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.230
I mean, and they are probably
the most famous taiko group

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.530
anywhere, any time.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.470
And that performer
is Fujimoto Sensei.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.190
He's very, very well-known
in the taiko community.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.000
And if you're watching that
just cold, if you're not like,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.410
you know, a taiko nut
the way Mark and I are.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.100
You know, you're probably
just thinking, you know, whoa,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.110
these guys are like in
really good shape; right?

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.410
They are totally.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.670
They have like zero
percent fat on their bodies.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.770
They're totally ripped,
and this is a fact.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.610
The way they play has a kind of
intensity and commitment to it

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.480
that is not to be beat; right?

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.960
Any of us who are musicians can
respect that when we see it.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.090
And we generally know
it when we see it.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.500
And these guys, and there
are a few women in the group.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.800
But they're mostly guys.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.820
These guys play taiko, you know,
like it's an extreme sport.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.130
And, in fact, there
are very closely,

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.290
a closely related taiko group
in Japan that is in fact known

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.580
for running a marathon,
and I mean like a marathon,

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.400
26-point whatever mile marathon.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.980
And then playing a taiko
concert at the finish line.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.280
You know, this kind of thing.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.140
So that does go on
in the taiko world.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.050
I would, I hasten to say that
it's a minority of groups

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.350
that do that kind of thing.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.770
But Kodo and Ondekoza,
the related group,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.240
do do that kind of thing.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.170
That's not what I'm going
to be talking about today.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.550
Even though all taiko
players know

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.960
about these groups from Japan.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.260
And what they're like.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.570
And how they think and all that.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.770
But taiko is, as I always say,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.660
it's both a very
old form of music.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.020
And a very new and contemporary
one all at the same time.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.620
And it has deep roots

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.690
in two Japanese religions,
Buddhism and Shinto.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.120
There's much more to be
said about all these points.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.560
But in coming to North America,

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.370
and by that I mean the
United States and Canada.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.290
Taiko has assumed
very different kinds

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.630
of meanings than
it has in Japan.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.070
It is still closely related
to what goes on in Japan

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.890
because taiko is huge in Japan.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.460
Nonetheless, the meanings and
the kinds of cultural things

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.970
that taiko does for
Japanese-American

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.670
and Asian-American communities
is profoundly different

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.660
than what it does for
Japanese communities in Japan.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.960
All right.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.800
What it does in the U.S. is
it serves the kinds of needs

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.640
that Asian-Americans communities
have in terms of struggling

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.110
for equality, for
access to resources.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.580
For public recognition.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.350
For the right to
speak and to be heard.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.640
And so on and so forth.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.040
Taiko has come to
be, my argument is,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.720
that taiko is central to
those kinds of struggles

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.050
for Asian-Americans
at this point.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.520
And I'm talking about
things like this.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.620
I'm not going to go
into it in great detail.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.540
But in case I need
to convince anyone

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.430
that Asian-Americans
have struggles.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.870
These are two examples.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.310
You know, the Chinese
Exclusion Act.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.060
Which took a long
time to discontinue.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.450
To close. To, you
know, to, anyway.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.580
And then the Japanese-American
internment, of course.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.490
And that has just
been in the news again

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.980
with the supposed overturning
the Korematsu decision; right?

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.960
But in a way that
really troubles a lot

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.810
of Japanese-Americans
as a matter of fact.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.990
So these are the
kinds of things.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.290
And there are many other issues

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.620
that Asian-American
communities struggle with.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.920
Have struggled with.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.210
Continue to have
to struggle with.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.560
Taiko is part of all of that.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.330
And I'm going to try
and show you some ways

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.730
in which it is as I proceed.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.580
Because not even all taiko
players want to think

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.670
of what they do as being
embedded, you know,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.250
in these long-term
struggles for place.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.590
For presence.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.890
A short story on sort of
the demographics of taiko

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.330
in the U.S. and Canada.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.940
Goes something like this.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.240
In terms of gender, it's

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.690
about 60 percent women
and 40 percent men.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.910
For a long time actually the
percentage of women was higher.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.130
Maybe like 75 percent
for a long time.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.750
And they seem to
be shifting a bit.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:15.320
And I'm basing these numbers on
a census that was done in 2016.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.570
So the numbers are
pretty current.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.880
About 60 percent

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.840
of all performers
are Asian-American

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.300
or Asian-Canadian.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.370
The others are primarily white.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.800
And the numbers of Latinx

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.720
or African-American taiko
players are really small.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.540
And I don't think that's a
coincidence or arbitrary.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.480
I think that taiko
is serving the needs

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.460
of two ethnic groups as it were.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.180
Racial and ethnic groups.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.500
And a majority of taiko players
are on the young side of things.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.580
In their 20s and 30s primarily.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.340
Most of us play as
a leisure activity.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.610
There are very, very few,
like, professional, full-time,

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.390
you know,
make-a-living-through-taiko kind

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.360
of people who are part
of the taiko community.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.860
Most of us are in
community-based groups.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.540
Some are on university campuses.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.390
But most, the vast majority
of us are in community groups.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.690
And you know what?

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.300
The vast, vast majority
of us are in California.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.200
Both Southern California and
Northern California, yeah.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.960
Now, all of this is changing

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.590
by the minute, you
know, by the day.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.190
Taiko is in a period of
rapid expansion right now.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.640
In fact, it's expanding
exponentially.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.270
There are more and more taiko
groups every time I turn around;

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.570
right?

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.230
So these numbers are
going to change again.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.430
And I wonder if at some point
California will not be the

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.780
center of the, you know, North
American taiko universe; right?

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.080
You know, I don't know.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.720
Check back in five
years, ten years.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.020
It's going to change.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.320
I don't know how though.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.000
Just to give you a sense
of what California,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.790
Southern California taiko
community groups look like,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.090
here's four.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.370

fun with PowerPoint

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.800
and show you four video
clips all at the same time.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.100
It's going to be quite a sound.

And, shoot, I can't remember
who's on the upper right there.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.410
That's terrible.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.970
This is L.A. Matsuri Taiko.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.170
And then on the lower right is
Zendeko from Zenshuiji Temple.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.470
So they're all in the
greater L.A. area.

[ Drum Music ]

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.540
So you're seeing,
these are two temples

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.940
in the greater L.A. area.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.550
This is at the finish line

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.740

Little Tokyo on First Street.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.020
Anybody from, any
Japanese-American

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.010
from L.A. would immediately
go, oh, that's First Street.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.260
So, yeah, you're seeing a
lot of young players; right?

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.320
But you're also seeing
multigenerational groups.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.460
Which is part of the magic of
taiko, in my humble opinion,

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.960
is to play with people often

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.110
from three different generations
all in the same group.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.440
It's really cool.

There we go, sorry.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:23.170
Here's an example of one,
what we call first generation,

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.300
arguably second generation
taiko player in North America.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.700
This is Kenny Endo.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.540
The most recent picture of him
is up here on the upper right.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.220
He's been playing taiko
for just over 40 years.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.090
He just celebrated his 40th
anniversary of taiko playing.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.680
He's from Los Angeles.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.780
He's Sansei, he's third
generation Japanese-American.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.190
He started playing
taiko in the 1970s.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.490
Which is, give or take,

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.250
when taiko took off
in the United States.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.510
He studied in Japan.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.840
And he's lived in Honolulu for
some decades at this point.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.880
And is the founder and director

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.870
of the Taiko Center
of the Pacific there.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.500
So you're seeing
photos of him here

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.230
from about three different
decades of his life.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.560
Here he is in his first
few years of playing taiko.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.720
And my point here, looking at
one individual for a moment,

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.460
is to say that, again,
the politics of taiko

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.680
or the political significance

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.160
of taiko may not always
be right out in front.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.230
It may not be people, you
know, wearing political buttons

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.530
on their costumes; right?

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.830
It's probably not
going to be that.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.270
The politics and meaning
of taiko are very deep,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.830
run very deep and are
not always articulated.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.300
Kenny is not going to be
the first one to tell you,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.800
and I use his name because
he's a friend of mine.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.100
His first name.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.180
He's not going to tell you, oh,
yeah, I became a taiko player

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.480
through the Asian-American
movement.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.610
That's not how he's going to
explain himself, give or take.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.960
But, in fact, that is how he
got started back in the day.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.690
Manzanar is one of the Japanese
American internment camps.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.880
It's the one closest
to Los Angeles

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.290
where a lot of LAJA's got sent.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.970
The Pilgrimage is something that
got started, in fact, in 1975.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.890
And this was politicized
Japanese-American who's said,

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.200
we need to work on
redress and reparations.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.600
And we need to mark the camps.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.420
It was not a national park
at that point in time; right?

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.620
They started going just
themselves to the sites

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.920
of these former camps.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.650
And holding, you know, meetings
and made rituals, you know,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.850
to go with cultural and
political memory for the camps.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.460
This is Kenny and my teacher
Reverend Tom Karye [assumed

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.890
spelling] at the first
Manzanar pilgrimage in 1975.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.190
There's Kenny.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.490
And look at these drums.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.270
This drum is from Reverend
Tom's father's temple.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.960
A Zen, Buddhist Japanese temple.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.660
This is a wine barrel that's
been made into a taiko.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.960
And not very well.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.060
You can kind of, I can see that,
you know, it's kind of uneven.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.020
It's very homemade looking.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.160
That's Kenny, you know, 1975.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.790
This is how he started
playing taiko.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.340
He didn't actually have
a teacher at that point.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.720
There was only kind of sort
of one or two other teachers

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.820
for taiko in the U.S.
at that point in time.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.640
Here's more evidence of where
Kenny was at that point in time.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.880
We're now up to 1978.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.180
There he is.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.910
This is an Asian-American
music group called Warriors

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.950
of the Rainbow led
by Nobuko Miyamoto.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.250
Still very active.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.480
I'm going to tell you more
about her as I go along.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.980
Here they are in an all
Asian-American band.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.760
You know, very much sort of
putting themselves out there

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.850
as radical Asian-Americans
at that point in time.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.150
And there's Kenny.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.980
With his taiko, playing
with them.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.940
So the question is
like why taiko?

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.560
Why were these young,
mostly Sansei being drawn

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.160
to taiko rather than to
other Japanese cultural

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.460
or arts forms; right?

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.760
Because there are many.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.400
And they were also
in the United States.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.250
Why not sumo?

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.890
Why not Zen archery?

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.030
Why not flower arranging; right?

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.840
There's a lot of
other cultural forms

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.480
that Japanese-Americans
could have turned towards.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.120
My argument always is
that, as a musicologist,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.750
is that it's never arbitrary
what people turn to in terms

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:20.470
of performance and culture
to speak to their needs.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.770
To address their needs.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.000
To allow them to
explore their own needs

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.500
and vision for the world; right?

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.240
It's never arbitrary.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.330
I think that folks
turn to taiko,

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.740
and it's not just my opinion.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.080
People have told me this.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.550
Because taiko is
about being heard.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.740
It's so loud, after all.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.330
It's about being heard.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.030
When taiko's going on anywhere
nearby, that's, you know,

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.330
that's all you can hear.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.990
And you can feel it
for heaven's sake.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.780
I mean, the vibrations
literally travel.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.220
It's about being seen.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.390
And Asian-American visibility
is simply one of the conditions

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.960
of being Asian-American, is

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.130
that you're often
regarded as invisible.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.430
You are not seen.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.730
You are not heard.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.030
You are not regarded.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.720
And, finally, taiko
is about being strong.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.460
Because, although you can play,
any kind of body and any kind

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.070
of ability can play taiko.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:15.570
It does posit a body that has
certain kinds of strength in it.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.650
And, in fact, to put it
the other way around.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.100
Taiko creates a strong body

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.160
in really interesting
and important ways.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.220
So my argument is that taiko
spoke to young Asian-Americans

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.550
at that the point in time.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.710
And to a great extent still
does for those reasons.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.010
For those reasons.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.540
I mean flower arranging
is lovely.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.280
But it doesn't serve
our needs, you know,

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.650
in quite the same ways; right?

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.180
That's my argument.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:47.720
Hi. This is the founder of
taiko in the United States.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.520
And I'm not going to
get all technical here.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.620
But by taiko, I am referring

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.530
to a particular performance
form known in Japanese

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.270
as kumi-daiko or group taiko.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.550
Meaning a whole bunch of
people playing a whole bunch

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.020
of different sized
taiko drums together.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.450
Okay. Seiichi Tanaka emigrated
from Japan to the U.S. in 1968.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:11.330
In 1969, he created his
own taiko school, a dojo.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.800
And created the San
Francisco Taiko Dojo.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.260
Which is still alive
and well and active.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.620
And very, very important
in our scene.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:23.070
He's regarded as the founder of
kumi-daiko in the United States.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.370
In North America really.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.670
And here he is.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.170
You know, very, very, very
early photograph of him,

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.790
famously playing at the
San Francisco Cherry

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.090
Blossom Festival.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.270
Now, this group, which you
should absolutely, you know,

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.780
go see them perform if
you ever have the chance.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.080
Because they're amazing.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.160
They have a very
particular kind of profile.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:50.330
They're known thanks to
Tanaka Sensei's values

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.170
and methods for teaching.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.870
This group is known for
being way disciplined

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.670
for supporting a certain
kind of powerful playing.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.510
Sometimes it's called power
taiko, as a matter of fact.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.870
The group itself is known for
being explicitly hierarchical

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.110
in its social arrangement.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.590
And it's also known
for having a very

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.270
"traditional" male teacher
who calls the shots.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.570
Makes the rules.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.870
You do what he says, you know.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.340
It's a sensei model in short.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.650
And it works beautifully
for this group.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.880
And Tanaka Sensei
has created many

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.600
of the second generation groups.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.860
That is, he didn't do
it himself personally.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.680
But many of his original
students from the 1970s and 80s,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.830
then eventually went off and
created their own groups.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.050
Carrying forward
some of his ideas

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.650
and playing techniques; right?

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.430
So his impact on the
North American taiko scene

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.740
is profound.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.220
Absolutely profound.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.490
And he did receive NEA
National Heritage Award

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.650
about 15 years ago.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.810
Something like that, yeah.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.270
Yeah, in recognition of that.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.220
Some recent work being done
within the taiko community

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.020
in the United States has
suggested that any taiko player

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.580
in Canada or the United States

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.700
and possibly further away
has no more than six degrees

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.580
of separation from
Tanaka Sensei.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.880
And you know what?

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.180
When you start talking
to people,

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.480
you find out almost right away

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.040
that it's usually
fewer than six degrees.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.500
You know, it's often two
or three degrees; right?

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.520
Right? Mark's nodding, yeah.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.010
Yeah. So the particular
article that I found about this,

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.140
you know, has all
these great diagrams.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.590
Like the one you're looking at.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.030
And taiko players love to
look at this kind of stuff.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.230
Because it literally maps
out our social relationships

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.530
to one another; right?

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.590
And lineages, if you will.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.070
So what I'm going to
focus on from here

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.080
on are three particular
groups and individuals.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.520
They are, you know, just the
tip of the iceberg; right?

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.940
And I didn't choose them
because they're like, you know,

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.820
famous as much as they suggest
different ways of playing taiko.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.380
And different kinds
of values that they,

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.630
different reasons
for playing taiko.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.510
So I'm going to talk
about Kinnara Taiko

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.020
and then TAIKOPROJECT.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.740
And then FandangObon at the end.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.440
So let me start with
Kinnara Taiko.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.370
They are known as
taiko pioneers.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.520
And that term "pioneer," I
can't say that I'm fond of it.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.350
Because it suggests the
kind of, you know, what?

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.880
Settler colonialism; right?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.870
But it is the term that's used

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.900
within the North American
taiko community to suggest

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.860
that we can recognize the
founding generation, as it were.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.810
And so along with Tanaka Sensei
say who is often regarded

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.730
as being like the only
first gen pioneer.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.930
I would argue that Kinnara Taiko
was the other first generation

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.230
pioneer group.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.190
They were founded like, you
know, virtually the same year

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.740
as San Francisco Taiko Dojo.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.420
But they were located

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.380
at a Jodoshinshu
temple in Los Angeles.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.840
Senshin Buddhist Temple.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.370
Where I spend a lot of time.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:01.480
And what they did
through Reverend Mas who's

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.020
in the back there.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.690
Reverend Mas Kodani has
explicitly positioned taiko

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:11.540
playing as hogaku, as a
form of Buddhist practice.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.020
Certainly a lot of fun to play,

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.490
but not being played
only for fun.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.070
You know, as a form
of Buddhist devotion.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.680
And the structure of the group,

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.900
thanks to Reverend Mas was very
explicitly nonhierarchical.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.810
Which make it's profoundly
different

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.440
from San Francisco Taiko Dojo.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.500
And, in fact, egalitarian
in how they acted stuff out.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.070
How they made decisions
together.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.370
It was consensus driven.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.240
There were apparently hours
and hours of conversation

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.990
to make any kind of
decision together; right?

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.290
You know, this kind of thing.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.010
So this is a great photograph
of a lot of those folks

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.310
from that first generation.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.170
And many of them are
still around and still

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.030
at Senshin Buddhist Temple.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.110
I want you to see
just a little slice

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.990
of them playing back in the day.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.660

that was made

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.960
in 1975 titled "Cruisin'
J-Town."

to see first Johnny Mori, who
is another noted taiko player

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.830
in L.A. You're going to
see him as a young man sort

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.580
of making his way through
the Asian-American movement.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.450
And going to Amerasia Bookstore.

And then you're going
to see him wind

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.260
up at Senshin Buddhist Temple
playing with Kinnara Taiko.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.510

traditional Japanese looking.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.240
I mean, I got slanted eyes.

The black hair; right?

So every day I look,
you know, it's Japanese.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.640
But yet, on the other hand,
I'm Japanese-American.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.700
I can relate more to a black
or a Chicano than I can

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.380
to a person from Japan.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.100

comfortable with, you know,

I think it's pretty important.

Working here in the bookstore,
it's an atmosphere where I'm

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.750
in contact with our history
here in the United States.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.390

that music was another
expression

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.970
that I could possibly
use to get into as far

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.510
as an Asian-American
identity kind of thing.

home tomorrow and land

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.720
at Ontario Airport and then
drive straight to Senshin, yeah.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.200
I love their Obon ritual.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.230
And the last thing that
happens at the Senshin Obon is

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:18.530
that Kinnara always plays.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.050
It's about nine or ten
o'clock at night at that point.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.340
And they play, as you know,

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.450
horaku or hogaku, as
Buddhists worship.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.170
I mean, it looks just
like taiko you'd anywhere.

But it's purpose is different.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.000

them are now older.

But they've brought
in younger members.

The group continues.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.820

securely in place.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.720
They're respected.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.020
They're known.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.320
They're recognized.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.620
They're pioneers.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.920
I want to turn to
the second group now.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.220
And that's TAIKOPROJECT.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.520
And that is how they call
themselves, TAIKOPROJECT.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.820
One word. All capital letters.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.570
Okay. And this is one could say
a third generation taiko group.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.040
And it's mostly,
when they started,

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.620
over 10 years 15 years
ago, they were in fact all

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.650
in their 20s at that point.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.410
And this is part of what's going

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.150
on with taiko more
broadly; right?

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:20.210
Is that taiko is
growing, is expanding.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.620
There's literally more
groups, more taiko players.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.320
More infrastructure
than there once was.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.320
And what usually happens

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.180
when you have more people
doing things, right,

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.590
is that they begin to divide
off into different scenes.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.710
Different kinds of ways
of doing things; right?

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.250
So literally the
taiko community,

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.600
if we can still call it that,
is now more and more diverse

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.910
in terms of how they do things.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.210
And who they do things with.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.430
And so like regional taiko
is now more of a thing

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.970
than it once was, for instance.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.390
But these, the scene is
still connected in very,

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.770
very interesting ways.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.980
This is all about the
rising generation.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.640
Any tradition faces this.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.710
What happens when new
generations become part

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.040
of that tradition?

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.340
It all depends; right?

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.290
Sometimes things are very
carefully kept the same,

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.740
whatever that might mean.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.950
But often it means that
things begin to change.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.500
Again, responding to the
conditions of the time,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.910
of the moment, of the place.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.850
So the rising generation
of taiko players,

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.540
and I think actually there's
two rising generations

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.840
at this point.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.110
Many of them were trained
in collegiate groups.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:32.320
Taiko clubs on university
and college campuses.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.970
Some of them also came up
through community groups.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.710
Some of them are doing both,
which is very interesting.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:42.000
A number of these folks are
very aware of taiko history.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.300
Others are not at all.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.700
If they just joined taiko as
a club on campus, you know,

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.020
it's they're having
a great time.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.320
They're learning a lot,

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.620
but history is the
least of it; right?

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.160
Many of these groups, because
these are young players,

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.780
they're in their teens and 20s.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.950
They have like these
amazing bodies; right?

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.820
And, you know, they're
brains are just like firing.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.430
And they create these
pieces that are

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.790
like incredibly complicated
with lots of different sections.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.280
And, you know, complex meters.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.110
And, you know, all kinds
of stuff like this.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.690
And some of them very much want

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.270
to become professional
taiko players at this point.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.920
Here's some lovely
photos of some

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.090
of the leaders now
actually pushing 40.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.750
Some of the first rising gen.
Michelle Fuji up on the right.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.020
Bryan Yamami, who
founded TAIKOPROJECT.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.680
And these are members
of the On Ensemble.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.730
Maz Baba. Kris Bergstrom.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.100
Shoji Kameda.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:39.770
This is TAIKOPROJECT, a photo
that's now a decade old taken

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.350
in Little Tokyo.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.960
Actually a couple blocks away.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.020
But, you know, this absolutely,
this like sums up the spirit

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.560
of TAIKOPROJECT, you know.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.750
They're all in their 20s pretty
much at that point in time

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:53.830
with all the energy
and enthusiasm; right?

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.260
A lot of their pictures are

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.130
of them leaping into
the air; right?

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:58.430
This kind of thing.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.730
It's a great photo.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.630
And I might say that Bryan's
also been very careful

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.240
to have really professional
standards brought to everything

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.540
that TAIKOPROJECT does.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.840
Including PR.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.100
So TAIKOPROJECT, it's a group
of third gen taiko players.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.660
Yeah, they're all
about energy and kind

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.030
of a playfulness as well.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.090
Which is not typical of like
Japanese type of groups,

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.820
if one can generalize.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.440
They're often, you
know, like smiling.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.740
And, you know, there's laughter

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.510
and jokes built into
their pieces.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.380
They are very aware of
their Japanese roots.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.490
But they are also
unapologetically

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.030
and openly American
in what they're up to.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.330
And the membership

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.310
of TAIKOPROJECT is almost
entirely Asian-American.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.940
Not just Japanese-American,
but also, you know, Chinese.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.360
Korean. Filipino.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.760
You know, different
Asian-Americans.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.680
There are a few non-Asian
Americans, but not many.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.800
Another photo of them.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.910
With Bryan Yamami and the
founder in the middle there.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.030
And you need to see them play.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.900
This is one of their
very well-known pieces.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.040
And, again, in sort
of counterpoint

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.430
to Japanese taiko values,
Shoji Kameda, then a member

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.240
of TAIKOPROJECT, wrote
this piece explicitly

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.540
as an open-source piece.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.480
Open to any taiko group to play.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.780
No ownership.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.430
Not tied just to TAIKOPROJECT.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.470
But a piece that he
framed as being a gift

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.680
to the taiko community.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.980
An omiyage.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.280
It means gift.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.060
Actually, it means a kind
of gift that you bring back

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.820
when you've been
traveling somewhere.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.730
And you get little souvenirs
to bring home and give

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.170
to your friends and family.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.960
That's what an omiyage is, yeah.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.510
This is part of a
much longer piece.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.570
in the center there,
that's Yuta Kato.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.060
An amazing performer.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.000
Now has risen to a real
position of leadership

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.410
in the greater North
American taiko community.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.880
And you can hear at one point
some of the other players

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.120
on stage yell out Yuta.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.440
You know, as he took
off on his solo; right?

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.670
One of the other things

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:44.960
that TAIKOPROJECT has done very
adroitly is to insert themselves

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.470
into the greater L.A.
entertainment industry.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.160
We are after all in L.A.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.870
; right? It's about La-La Land.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.960
It's about, you know,
all the opportunities

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.390
that the film industry,

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.900
the entertainment
industry generally offers.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:04.060
And Bryan Yamami, the director
and founder of TAIKOPROJECT

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.140
in very well-known ways
has made TAIKOPROJECT,

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.440
has put them out there.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.040
And you find them in a
number of commercials.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.510
You see them playing at
industry conferences.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.180
You know, and they also play

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.800
in community settings,
to be very clear.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.670
They're playing in a
lot of different places.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.990
But they're also cultivating
this kind of thing.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.360
2005, they played in this
one minute commercial

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.510
for the Mitsubishi Eclipse.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong:
You get the idea.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.970
I have very mixed feelings
about this commercial.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.850
I think it's really slick.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.010
It's really you know,
it's well done.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:40.340
But it also feeds directly into
like really tired ideas about,

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.200
you know, Orientalist
dragon lady, you know,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.510
Asian babe in a red dress
kind of stuff, you know.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.700
And, or I should, it
wouldn't even be Asian; right?

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.250
It would be Oriental
babe in a red dress.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.900
And there's more to be
said about this commercial.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.180
I mean, one is that the
folks who are looking

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.630
for taiko players were
making the commercial.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.590
And they went out into
the greater L.A. area.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.230
Lots of taiko groups; right?

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.590
And they auditioned a whole
lot of different taiko players

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.650
for this commercial
back in the day.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:08.990
They also auditioned
members of my group.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.750
And they looked at us,
and we were a bunch of at

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.900
that point sort of
middle-aged, you know,

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.990
not necessarily beautiful
looking people

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.160
who played taiko very well.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.040
But they looked at us and were
like, okay, thanks very much.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.470
And then they went onto to the
TAIKOPROJECT and said, oh, wow,

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.110
look at these young
women; right?

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.660
You know, and so you end
up with this commercial.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:33.060
Which I think shows
off the playing ability

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.830
of at least the young
women in TAIKOPROJECT.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.070
But it feeds into other
kinds of cultural tropes

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.900
that I am tired of
seeing; right?

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.170
As I said, in 2016,
a census was done.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:48.110
A voluntary census
of taiko players.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.190
And we learned at that
point that a majority

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.080
of taiko players
are, in fact, women.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.460
And Asian-American
women at that.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.900
And a number of us
had anecdotally

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.610
and just impressionistically
known that for a long time.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.480
But the numbers were confirmed
at this point in time.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.900
And we also began to realize
that our own way of thinking

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.750
and talking about
who plays taiko

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:13.090
and why was becoming
complicated.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.340
And has been actually
for a while.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.450
One is the matter,
is taiko Japanese?

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.710
Some groups always say,
well, this is Japanese taiko.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:24.440
Even if all of them are
from Chicago, you know.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.580
Is taiko really a
Japanese-American form?

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.690
Is it now more broadly
Asian-American.

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:31.170
Which would be my argument.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.700
Or is it, in fact, for
everyone, you know?

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.060
And that's where things
get dicy, in my opinion.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.860
I think any music at some
level could be argued

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.980
as being for everyone.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.490
You know, but what does it
mean when suddenly any kind

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.820
of music becomes
ownable by anyone?

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.400
Could be participated
in by anyone?

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.700
What does that mean?

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.760
You know, what happens
with global spread

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.060
of certain traditions?

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.950
What does it mean when every
jazz band has a didgeridoo

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.250
in the middle?

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.550
You know, this kind of thing.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.190
So I have questions about what
it means to be for everyone.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.230
And that might be
where taiko's going.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.530
But, for instance,

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.730
in the Midwest these are
two different taiko groups

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:11.980
in Indiana and Minneapolis.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.140
What does it mean when
this becomes the face

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.480
of taiko players?

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.010
And let me be very clear,

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.950
I'm not saying white
people shouldn't play taiko.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.250
I am not saying that.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.550
I am not saying that.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.850
I'm not thinking it either.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.140
But I am saying that
race and gender

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:32.150
and community location is
significant in any form

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.130
of performance in terms of what
are the stories being told?

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.100
What is the narrative
being served?

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.400
And by whom?

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.410
For whom? So taiko is changing.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.710
It's changing fast.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.050
And this is TAIKOPROJECT.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.210
It remains, you know, 90
percent Asian-American

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.510
in it's personnel.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:52.610
And very much connected to the
Japanese-American community.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:56.440
Let me turn to my final
example, FandangObon.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.170
And this is a form, a project.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:03.270
It's really a project that is

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:07.980
about connecting two very
specific communities in L.A.,

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.050
in the greater L.A. area.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:11.890
It's about activism.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.050
It has everything to do
with the fact that more

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:18.670
than once interethnic
violence and tension

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.050
between different
neighborhoods and communities

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:25.650
in L.A. burst open
in very violent ways.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.360
Very controversial ways.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.050
And so the L.A. uprising
or riots

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:34.520
of 1992 was not the first
time that this happened.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.040
So I'm just offering
you a little reminder

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.860
that this is part of the
landscape of Los Angeles

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.160
and has been for a long time.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:49.430
So FandangObon is primarily
these three amazing thinker,

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.980
performers, activists.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.540
I cannot get enough time
with these three people.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.170
On the left we have
Quetzal Flores.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.470
We have Martha Gonzales.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.450
And the two of them with some
other folks make up the band,

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:03.420
Quetzal, which is all
it's in Chicago a lot.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.740
And then Nobuko Miyamoto
on the right here.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.510
The three of them
are close friends.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:12.810
And they created the FandangObon
project together five years ago.

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:17.060
Fandango is central to
a very specific area

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.750
of Mexico of the Veracruz area.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.780
Fandango, it's a very
explicitly participatory form

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.490
of performance and
community gathering.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.600
Obon is the Japanese
and Japanese-American,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.330
it's now a summer festival.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:33.690
Originally a time when, part

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:37.420
of the Japanese Buddhists
recognition of ancestors.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.030
Some say a time when the souls

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.470
of the departed come
back and visit us.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:46.760
So both of these forms,
Fandango and Obon are dynamic.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.580
Alive. Well.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.270
Not endangered in their
communities; right?

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.050
These are dynamic traditions.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.650
They're flourishing even.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.130
Both of them have
these similarities

00:42:57.130 --> 00:42:58.840
in their emphasis
on participation.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.150
That you don't need to be like
a professional or trained person

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.660
to participate in them.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.880
They're meant for
anybody to be part of.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.960
They're focused on community.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.140
And both of them are deeply
informed by the politics

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.620
in the United States
of the 1960s and 70s.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.870
When like the Chicano
movement got going.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:19.130
The Asian-American
movement got going.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.990
This is part of both
scenes as well.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:30.790
So a glimpse of Obon in L.A.
This is higashi [phonetic]

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:34.280
with taiko in the middle.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.340
The dances are participated
in by hundreds

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.640
and hundreds of people.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.940
This is the time of year

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.760
where every weekend a different
temple is hosting Obon.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.220
And people go from one temple to
another over the entire summer.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.520
So hundreds of people.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.770
Some temples there's over 1,000
people dancing altogether.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.950
Fandango. This photograph is

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.350
from L.A. I think the
next one is from Seattle.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.650
But the Fandango scene,

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.750
son jarocho is very
lively right now.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.050
And you can see how
people just sort

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.610
of gather into a loose circle.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.760
And there's dancing
going on in the middle.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:14.250
And jaranas playing all around
the outside of the circle.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:20.100
Fandango. Yeah, this is Cesar
Castro, who does live this LA.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:22.450
So too much text.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.780
But the point being that
there's a lot of similarities

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.500
between these two forms.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.630
Both are all about
participation.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.190
They're not about
professional trained people.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.730
Both of them are open-ended and
can go on for quite a while.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.990
It's not like, you know, they do
say like, we're going to start

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.130
at 7:00 and end around
9:00 kind of thing.

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:43.710
But they could go on as long
as you want them to go on.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.230
They are noncompetitive
in their spirit.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.030
Doesn't matter whether
you're a good dancer

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:49.630
or a completely clueless dancer.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.440
You just get out
there, and you do it.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.740
And nobody cares.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.960
Everybody admires good
dancing when they see it.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.270
But you don't have to
be good to be part.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.860
Both of them are
transnational in the ways

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.290
that performers are
connected to people

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:03.830
in the countries of origin.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:06.760
And there's often
movement, continuous,

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.060
between the two places.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.920
The two homelands.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.220
One emerged at part

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.460
of the Chicanx movement
in the United States.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.760
Fandango is very old.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.560
But in the United States it was
part of the Chicano movement.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.660
Obon's a little different
in that it's been part

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.670
of JA community for over
a century at this point.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:27.490
And was revived after
World War Two.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:30.950
And you need to see FandangObon
before I tell you more about it.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.650
It was on the mall two years
ago as part of the festival,

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.950
the Smithsonian's
festival, Folklife Festival.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:41.820
Mark and I were part
of, for a week we were

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.720
on the mall playing this
a couple times a day.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.730
It was a great experience.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:47.890
I still, like had
such a great time.

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:49.760
And it was so meaningful
for all of us.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.010
But this video is from a
few years before we all came

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.310
to Washington.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:56.110
The first year of the project.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:48:29.690
[ Music ]

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:31.060
Sorry, that was pretty loud.

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:35.020
But what's going on here
is that the East L.A.,

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:38.940
traditionally Mexican-American,
Chicanx neighborhood

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.650
and Little Tokyo, right
across the L.A. River

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:47.030
from East L.A. This
project brought those two

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.330
neighborhoods together.

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:49.630
Very intentionally; right?

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.830
This was a result of months and
months and months of planning

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.400
and discussion and meetings.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.280
Martha and Quetzal
being deeply embedded

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.650
in the East L.A.
Chicanx community.

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:03.150
Nobuko and others and Reverend
Mas here being, you know,

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:04.930
key figures in Little Tokyo.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.630
So they took the elements of
both of those traditions, right,

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:08.980
and they put them together.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.100
Fandango and Bon Odori.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:17.020
This re-embeds taiko in the kind
of, you know, big ritual dance

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:21.220
and more tradition that it
actually is most profoundly

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.520
embedded in.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.740
It took the dance
steps from Bon Odori

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.280
and injected moves
from Fandango.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.860
Some of the foot movements.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.530
Other, you know, this is
Guacamaya is from Fandango.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.900
It's a very careful attempt

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:39.040
from culture barriers
to create a new form.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.020
Not meant to be like fusion
or anything like that.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:45.770
But meant to represent
qualities of both traditions.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.970
And meant to be carried forward.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.710
We're now in the fifth
year of FandangObon.

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.430
It is being performed
at many different Obon

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:55.680
in the greater L.A. area
this summer, as it has been

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.980
for the past four years.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.570
So this is the amazing
circle of performers

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.110
that created the
project together.

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:06.500
And as Reverend Mas says,
this shouldn't be a fusion.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.620
Because a lot of
intercultural talk is often

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.920
at that level, you know.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.220
It's fusion.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.520
It's like, you know,
fusion cuisine, you know.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.480
Like where you throw some
soy sauce and some nam pla

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.210
and some lime and some adobo.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.840
And, you know, we
put it all together.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.140
And it's great, you know.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.030
And that's kind of the extent
of the thinking; right?

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:27.750
Reverend Mas is like,
no, it's not fusion.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.380
It's not fusion.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.160
It's putting different elements
together, and it's doing it

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.270
in a very thoughtful
and intentional way.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.210
It's creating a conversation.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:38.350
A conversation, yeah.

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:40.560
This is the mission.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.350
They've had to apply
for grants to get some

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:43.650
of this off of the ground.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:46.460
You often have to have
a mission statement

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.830
when you apply for
grants, you know.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:50.560
So they had chances where
they were able to sort

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.430
or articulate what
they were up to.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:56.860
And these are the bottom lines
for the FandangObon project.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.730
Kind of musical dialogue.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.440
Open cultural borders.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.500
It's not about trying to
make those borders dissolve

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.800
or go away.

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.100
Because that's magical thinking.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.850
It's about trying
to open the borders,

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:09.720
sometimes only temporarily,

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.890
between diverse Angeleno
communities.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:13.360
Can ritual circle dance,

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.620
these are both ritual
traditions; right?

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.750
Can ritual circle dance help us

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.320
to imagine a new
vision for Los Angeles?

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.020
And I would argue yes.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.830
I believe it has been happening

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.830
through this project
among other ways.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:31.980
And here we are all on the
mall two years ago in our tent.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.910
Yeah, and there's
Mark Rooney right

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.340
in the middle, playing taiko.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:40.410
Yeah, I love this photo, yeah.

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:42.660
So let me wrap this up.

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:47.730
Yeah. Taiko in L.A. It
could not be more dynamic.

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.300
More vital.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.600
More alive.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.040
More rooted in community.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.810
I'm speaking to my
values at this point.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.350
Because I'm a certain
generation.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.400
I'm an ethnomusicologist.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.700
I'm an Asian-American.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.520
I bring certain hopes.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.570
I bring certain hopes
to all kinds

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:05.870
of different cultural forms.

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:07.890
And taiko is definitely
one of them.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:12.890
So the community base for taiko
in L.A. remains very strong.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:14.730
This is Sogenji Buddhist Temple.

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:16.030
My home temple.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.850
There's my teacher Reverend
Tom [phonetic], playing.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:20.710
This is First Street.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:26.710
Yeah, playing at the end
of the Nisei Week Festival.

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:30.700
This is Nobuko, playing
with some former members

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.000
of Warriors of the Rainbow.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.930
You saw their photo back at the
beginning of the presentation.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:38.190
With taiko right in
the middle of the mix.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:39.490
Taiko is alive.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.950
And this is a mural in Little
Tokyo right around the corner

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.690
from the, kind of
across the street

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.550
from the Japanese-American
National Museum.

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:53.930
A community mural that was
made about 20 years ago

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:57.170
about Little Tokyo, and it's
significance for JA community.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:00.350
And do you see what's over
in the corner of the mural?

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:04.240
Yeah. Those are members
of Kinnara actually.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.210
If you want to know
more about taiko,

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:11.810
I'm happy to say there's now
three books out in English,

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:13.110
in the English language.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:17.530
"Taiko Boom" is more about,
well, it is about taiko

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:20.420
in Japan, not in North America.

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.110
This book, the middle one "The
Way of Taiko" was written by one

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:24.710
of Tanaka Sensei's students.

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:28.350
So it's very much
about a view of taiko

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.940
through San Francisco
Taiko Dojo values.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.890
And this book "Drumming
Asian America" just came

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.370
out by Angie Ahlgren.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:35.670
And it's fantastic.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:39.580
And she looks mostly at taiko
in the Midwest, not California.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.010
But the Midwest, in the
greater Minneapolis area.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:47.040
And the kinds of race politics
that come into play there.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.470
So, of course, at this point
you're sitting there thinking,

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:52.190
but I'm in DC.

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:53.870
And I'm not in California.

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.170
I'm in California.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:56.470
You're not in California.

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:57.800
And where can I see taiko?

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.670
Well, I'm happy to say that
there is more than one place.

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:04.900
But the main place, to
my biassed state of mind,

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.920
is Mark Rooney, who has been
here for a few years now.

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.410
And very quickly has
established classes.

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:13.770
Performances.

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:17.750
He's based in College
Park, Tacoma Park.

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:19.720
There's his web page if
you want to take a look.

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.310
He's an amazing performer.

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:22.610
Amazing musician.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:23.910
A great teacher.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.840
I've had lots of contacts
with Mark over the years.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.370
I encourage you, he
can tell you more.

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:31.350
He said, you have to run away
at this point pretty quickly.

00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.400
But you might want to grab
him if you're at all curious.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.540
Because he's right
here, after all.

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.320
And I just want to say thank
you to all of the people

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.790
who made it possible for me
to know more about taiko.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.090
To learn more.

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:44.730
To be able to think
deeply about it with them.

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:48.360
And to allow me to be here
today to tell you about it.

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.000
And to share my obvious
passion for this topic.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.800
Thank you for listening.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:55:01.310
[ Applause ]

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:02.810
What is your tradition
at this point?

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:05.560
Do we all just sort
of part ways or?

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:11.190
&gt;&gt; Questions, anybody
has questions?

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:12.490
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong: Okay.

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:13.790
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Deb.

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:15.090
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.390
Where are the drums made?

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:18.190
Where are the drums made?

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.760
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.060
Yeah, just.

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.360
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong:
I was hoping

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.660
to come closer to you all.

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.960
But, yeah.

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.260
Where are the drums made?

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:32.530
That is a very interesting
matter, as a matter of fact.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:37.410
Originally, in the 70s there
was a whole North American new

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:40.000
tradition of making taiko
out of wine barrels.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.080
Literally buying
them from wineries.

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.830
Disassembling them.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:47.180
Extensive techniques went into
how to put them back together

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.030
into really functioning taiko.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.540
And we all knew the
different places

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:52.550
where you could buy cow hide.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.440
Cow hide. You know,
this kind of thing.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.640
And many collegiate groups,
many community groups continued

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.160
to learn how to do that.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.260
And it's not only considered to
be important cultural knowledge

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.710
to know how to make a taiko.

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:06.800
But to do it communally,

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.160
collectively together,
in short, you know.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.700
To get covered with
sawdust and all that stuff

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.300
that goes along with it; right?

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.290
This is beginning to change.

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:20.540
Lots of folks still
make their own drums.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.970
But five years ago one

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:26.310
of the major Japanese
taiko-making companies

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:30.360
and families, Asano opens their
first North American store.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.390
And it's in the greater
L.A. area.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:34.570
It's in Torrance.

00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:38.480
Yeah, and they've
created this amazing venue

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.980
where they teach classes.

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.400
They have a showroom
where you can drop a lot

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.220
of money on beautiful stuff.

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:48.280
And more and more groups are
buying their drums from Asano.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.280
I'm curious about
how this is going

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.610
to change the scene, you know.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.910
And some of those drums are made

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.890
out of literally a
single piece of wood.

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:57.850
You know, it's very different
from the wine barrel technique.

00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:02.470
You know, is this hauling us
back to a certain sort of,

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.820
you know, Japanese-centered
way of doing things?

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.140
It remains to be seen.

00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.440
Their stuff is expensive.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.730
So not everybody's going
to be able to buy them.

00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:14.220
So the drums are from
both here and there.

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.520
Great question.

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:19.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what are the difference

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:25.170
between the Chinese drums
[inaudible], Chinese drums

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:27.340
and the taiko you're
talking about?

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.720
Because I know in
China they have,

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.130
different regions
have different type

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:37.480
of drum performance sort of.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:43.790
Did you see any relationship
between the two?

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:48.200
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong: The
simplest answer is like, no.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.650
You know, but I think one
could point to, more broadly

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:55.080
to an East Asian arc of
percussion where some

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.690
of the manufactured
techniques are similar.

00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:01.360
But the context are
pretty different.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.600
I do think, for what it's worth,
that the global phenomenon

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.480
of taiko becoming popular
beyond Japan has led to, like,

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.400
some Chinese drum
groups that are drawing

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.880
from ideas about Japanese taiko.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.840
And, you know, now
they're playing, you know,

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:22.080
like Lion Dance type
Chinese drumming.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:26.460
But with a lot of kind of
taiko moves and rhythms put in.

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.320
It's very, very interesting.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.510
I mean, but the deeper
answer is that, no,

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:32.460
they're not directly related.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.870
And, two, they're part of a
broader East Asian emphasis

00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:38.280
on certain kinds of
percussion for ritual.

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.580
For ritual.

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:40.880
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.750
I think you're talking about
more from U.S. point of view.

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:46.850
But have you ever done
any research in China?

00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:48.510
Because I know it's
for thousands

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:51.620
of years they have
this drum performance.

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.920
I'm sure in.

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong:
This is true.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.010
&gt;&gt; In history is, you know, in
history there must be some kind

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:57.800
of a learning from each other.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:01.570
Or, you know, it might
be the other way around.

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.830
But I'm just throw a point here.

00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:06.890
But, you know, it's interesting
I just want to make a comment.

00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:09.880
Because yesterday I
went to Smithsonian.

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:16.110
And the new director for
the national art museum,

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:19.650
National Museum for
African Art, Gus Hayford.

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:24.420
He also mentioned something
about the African drum.

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:29.650
And the, he brought
up another perspective

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:35.690
of this drum performance in
the history that is more like,

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:40.770
expressed quantifiable pain.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:47.700
And also express hope, you know,
to manifest their sufferings.

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:51.860
And also their hope for
more equality in history.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.640
I guess to this type

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.500
of performance more
like entertainment.

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.040
I'm just making comment,
you know.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.530
He said that for African drum,
it's more like, you know,

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:08.460
almost like a code
for revolution.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:13.100
But in certain type of the
period during the history,

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:17.930
that it was not allowed
for African-American.

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:19.230
[ Multiple Speakers ]

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:20.530
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong: Oh, for
slaves in the United States.

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.200
&gt;&gt; People to perform,
to play drums.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.920
Because it's so inspiring,
I guess.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:31.820
You know, it's like a
[inaudible] for revolution.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.120
That's what he commented.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.140
I'm just trying to make some
kind of connection here.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong: Well,
you just said a whole bunch

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:44.270
of different things, and
they're all very interesting.

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:45.570
Yeah.

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:46.870
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.170
Yeah. Let me put it this way.

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:52.130
You know, if you look at sort
of music in a global context,

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:55.320
you know, every place
has its own kinds

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.790
of musical instruments.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.370
And that's like really
interesting to those of us

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.060
who look at world music.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.760
It's very striking that
drums are found everywhere.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.300
And that, by that I mean, you
know, a body with some sort

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.270
of membrane stretched
over the end.

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:10.260
Which is then struck; right?

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.820
That's what I mean by a drum.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.240
Again, in East Asia there are
very old traditions of drumming.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.200
Many of them connected
directly to Buddhism

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.270
and in Japan's case
Shinto as well.

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:27.360
And to original religions,
you know.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.950
Indigenous religions,
if you will.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:31.900
Are they directly connected?

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.280
I'm just going to doggedly
say, no, they're not.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.670
Because, in fact, there's
one way of sort of looking

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:38.970
at music around the world.

01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:41.790
Which is to say, everything
started in one place

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:43.090
and then went to
some place else.

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.720
And there's a long tradition
of saying, in east Asia,

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.010
that stuff started in China, and
it moved out from there; right?

01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:50.970
And in some cases it's true.

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:53.080
In other cases it
ends op sort of wiping

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.160
out indigenous traditions
and practices.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.860
Or at least attention to
things that do originate

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.420
in places outside China.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.870
So, I mean, these are
complicated questions.

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:09.220
And to bring it full circle back
to where you ended with slaves.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:13.220
You know, in the African slave
trade and diaspora, yeah,

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:18.640
percussion was regarded by slave
owners as inherently dangerous.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.550
Because it allowed
slaves to continue

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:23.730
to practice their own religions.

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:25.030
And points of view.

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:26.820
And ways of coming
together communally.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.110
And that was a problem
for slave owners.

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.980
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.240
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.540
Hi.

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.840
&gt;&gt; Hi, thanks so much.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.160
It was really fun to hear
about your work as usual.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.110
And it's a real treat
with all the stuff

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:42.410
with the festival going on.

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:45.160
All of these events around
world performance traditions are

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.270
happening in town.

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:49.460
I was curious, I
missed the beginning.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.660
So if there was something
you provided as context

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.160
that you've already
covered here.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.270
But I'm picking up a little
bit on the way you were talking

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:57.160
about the different groups
that you're discussing.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.750
And sort of, you know,
generations of musicians.

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.050
Things are changing over time.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:06.060
And some of the things that
I've researched in the Midwest

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:11.150
and sort of European ethnic
revivals and things you,

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:12.730
people sometimes
talk about patterns

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:14.580
between different
generations, you know.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.500
Different sort of trends
toward assimilation.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.690
Wanting to recognize sort of
cultural traditions versus not.

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.020
And it sounds like there's a lot

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.830
of different things
going on here.

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:29.090
So, you know, even
in the 60s and 70s,

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:32.400
it seems like there were
very divergent philosophies

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.350
about what this performance
could mean.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:37.500
So I'm just curious, since you
were talking about generations.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.710
If you're kind of
seeing patterns as sort

01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:44.150
of things develop over time?

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:48.980
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Wong: Just as you
can imagine, I see both patterns

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:51.500
and sustained ideas and values.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.340
But I also see a lot of
change at the same time, yeah.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.910
You know, not surprisingly;
right?

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:58.790
Both are going on, yeah.

01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:00.740
I do think we're
at a tipping point

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.740
in the greater taiko scene.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.740
I do think that the emphasis

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:09.190
on Japanese-American
community is going to begin

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:11.620
to fall away, you know.

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:17.090
And, you know, I'm trying
to be ready for that

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:19.630
and to accept it
when it happens.

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:21.720
For me personally, it still
is the most meaningful kind

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.020
of taiko.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.320
But clearly that's not
the case for many people.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.990
So that's a change.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:28.990
So, you know, what you're
saying points to the ways

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:33.010
in which heritage, culture
in general sort of plays

01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:34.310
out all of those things.

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:36.000
Often at once; right?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.480
Sometimes in contradictory ways.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.780
You know, and I know
you've seen some of that

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.770
in your own research
on the Midwest; right?

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.070
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:44.770
So those are the questions.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:47.070
Yeah.

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:53.040
