00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.730
Determine whether 394 is greater
than or less than 397.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.220
Then write the expression that
shows this using either this

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.020
symbol or that symbol,
and this is actually

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.570
the less than symbol.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.480
We'll think a little bit more
about how to remember that.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.000
That is the less than symbol
and this is the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.690
greater than symbol.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.270
So first of all, let's
just look at the two

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.290
numbers: 394 and 397.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.009
So let me write them down.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:45.820
394 and the other
number is 397.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.480
Now, they both have 3 hundreds,
so their hundreds

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.650
place is equivalent.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.880
They both have 90 with that 9
there, but this is 300 plus 90

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.200
plus 4 and this is 300
plus 90 plus 7.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.025
And we know that 4
is less than 7.

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:04.830
If you look on a number line,
4 comes before 7.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.850
If you're counting the 7, you're
going to pass up 4, so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.610
394 is less than 397.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.630
And the way that we write that,
we would just write 394

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.860
is less than 397.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.740
And the way I remember that this
means less than is that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.230
the smaller number is on the
side that has kind of a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.070
smaller side.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.870
You can imagine this side
is much smaller than

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.480
this side over here.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.800
We could also write
it the other way.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.050
We could write 397 is
greater than 394.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.390
And once again, the bigger
number is the side that this

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.630
little thing is opening onto
or the side that has the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.440
bigger side of this
symbol right here.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.520
This point is the
smaller side.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.060
This out here is the
bigger side.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.380
That's where you put
the larger number.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.050
Greater than, less than.
