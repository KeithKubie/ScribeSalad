00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.026
&gt;&gt;Jon Bergmann: Here are
some tips to overcome some

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:18.316
of the hurdles and blunders
that we've seen commonly happen

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:20.096
as teachers flip
their classrooms.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.656
&gt;&gt;Aaron Sams: Make sure your
students can access the content.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:24.426
We all know that not
all students have access

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:26.546
to the Internet at their
home, so you may have to come

00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:27.666
up with some other solutions.

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:29.996
Get some flash drives,
check them out to students;

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:33.506
burn the video content onto
DVDs; or write a grant,

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:35.896
get a class set of some
sort of digital device

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:37.056
that you can check
out to your students

00:00:37.056 --> 00:00:38.286
and they can take
home and use that way.

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:40.626
&gt;&gt;Jon Bergmann: Make sure
you teach your students how

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:41.686
to watch a video.

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:43.426
You say, "My kids know
how to watch a video."

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:45.456
Yes, they know how
to watch "Spiderman",

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:48.646
but that's not the same as
watching an educational video

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:49.826
that you've created
for them to watch.

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:52.496
Ultimately you're trying to
teach them how to interact

00:00:52.496 --> 00:00:56.156
with the video content in a
meaningful way that causes them

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:59.626
to reflect and think through
what they're being exposed to.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.046
I had a conversation with a
sixth grade teacher and he said,

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:04.946
"I spent three weeks teaching my
students how to watch a video."

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:07.276
He had, you know, little guys,
you know, twelve-year olds.

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:08.296
I had sixteen-year olds.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:11.866
It makes a huge difference based
on the maturity of the kids

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.366
and what they are ready
and prepared to learn.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:15.726
&gt;&gt;Aaron Sams: Keep in
mind that the length

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:17.376
of the video does matter.

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:19.496
Our rule of thumb is one to one

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.156
and a half minutes per grade
level that the students are in.

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:23.886
So a fourth grade student--

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:25.746
you're talking four
to six minutes max.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.666
A tenth grade student--
ten to fifteen maximum.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.866
Keep it short and if you need to
make more videos that are short,

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.266
that's better than making
fewer videos that are long.

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:37.906
Another question that a lot of
teachers ask is, "What do I do

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:39.256
if students show up to my class

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:41.036
and they haven't
viewed the content?"

00:01:41.236 --> 00:01:43.546
Well, let's be real here.

00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:46.086
I mean, there are kids who are
gonna show up to any classroom

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:46.976
who haven't done their homework.

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:49.016
That's just a reality that
we live in as educators.

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:51.976
It's really not that different
in a flipped classroom.

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:55.456
But there are ways that you can
safeguard or build in some steps

00:01:55.456 --> 00:01:57.996
to keep kids engaged while
they're viewing the content

00:01:57.996 --> 00:01:59.816
and that you can use to
check to see if they have.

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:01.276
We took the low-tech approach;

00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:02.786
we just wanted to
see some notes.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.546
Other teachers are embedding
these videos onto a webpage

00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:07.986
and embedding like a
Google form underneath it

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:09.936
to collect some data
from the students,

00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:11.456
having them answer
some questions.

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:14.076
You could just pose a question
in the video themselves

00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:15.976
and have the students bring
the answer to that question

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:17.316
as an entrance ticket
into class.

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:19.276
So there's all sorts
of different ways

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:22.476
that you can check to see if
students actually did their work

00:02:22.636 --> 00:02:24.556
and then you as a
teacher, as an educator,

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:27.746
will just hold them
accountable for that.

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:29.026
&gt;&gt;Jon Bergmann: Ultimately,
I think the key is

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:29.756
that you hold kids accountable.

00:02:29.756 --> 00:02:31.696
If they've made the poor
choice of not doing the work,

00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:33.506
then what you're gonna do is
you're gonna take that time

00:02:33.616 --> 00:02:35.476
and you're gonna say, "You
know have to watch the video

00:02:35.476 --> 00:02:37.896
in class while the other
kids are getting help

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:38.836
on the hard stuff."

00:02:39.516 --> 00:02:41.256
&gt;&gt;Aaron Sams: So some teachers
get a little intimidated

00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:43.626
by this idea of creating
their own videos.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.446
Really you don't need
a super-duper studio.

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:47.506
You don't need to worry

00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:49.736
about high-dollar cameras
and things like that.

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:52.036
But there are a few
techniques that you can do

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:54.286
to really improve the
quality of you stuff.

00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:58.486
So sit in a room with good
lights, have a nice area to work

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:00.036
and don't have a
distracting background.

00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:01.686
Have it something
nice and simple.

00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:04.596
Those are things that you can
introduce to help the quality.

00:03:04.596 --> 00:03:06.016
Another question you
should ask yourself is,

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.116
"Do I need it to be perfect?

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.066
Or do I need it on Tuesday?"

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.556
So some teachers can get
bogged down in trying

00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:14.386
to have everything just
perfect, but how many

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:17.466
of your actual live lessons in
a classroom have been perfect?

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:18.926
Probably not very many.

00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:20.356
We teach naturally.

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:22.426
We teach organically and
we speak to our students

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:23.816
in a way that's meaningful
to them.

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:25.546
Make these videos the same way;

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:29.226
just make them effective
content-delivery tools.

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:31.516
Don't worry about trying to
make a Hollywood production

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:31.796
out of it.

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:33.366
&gt;&gt;Jon Bergmann: One
of the beauties

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.156
of the flipped class
is it's very scalable.

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:35.806
You know what?

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:37.276
You don't have to flip a class.

00:03:37.876 --> 00:03:39.056
You could flip one lesson.

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:40.826
Or you could flip a unit.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:42.146
Or you could flip a whole class.

00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:44.116
It's scalable.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:47.046
So one recommendation we would
have for you is maybe you need

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:50.586
to start small and figure out
what's the best place to flip.

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.116
If I were to give
you a recommendation

00:03:52.116 --> 00:03:53.996
of what you should flip if
you're looking for a lesson,

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:56.236
find something that
your kids struggle with.

00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:58.636
I was working with a group
of fourth grade teachers

00:03:58.636 --> 00:03:59.606
and we were talking about math.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:01.766
And they said-- in
unison they said,

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.606
"My kids struggle
with long division."

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:05.336
I said, "That's your first
flipped class video is

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:06.066
long division."

00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:08.786
So what's the equivalent
of long division for you?

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:10.596
That's your first
lesson to flip.

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.616
&gt;&gt;Aaron Sams: So to
recap, make sure all

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:15.366
of your students have
access to the content.

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:16.486
&gt;&gt;Jon Bergmann: Make sure

00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:18.286
to teach them how
to watch the videos.

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:20.516
&gt;&gt;Aaron Sams: Build in some
safeguards to make sure

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:23.066
that all students are
actually watching the videos.

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:24.616
&gt;&gt;Jon Bergmann: Don't
feel the need

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:26.156
to make your videos perfect.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.466
&gt;&gt;Aaron Sams: And don't try
to do too much all at once.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:30.836
Take it step-by-step,
take it slow

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:32.976
and before long you'll
have flipped your class.

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:37.500
&gt;&gt;[applause]
