LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to Coffee with a Googler.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.360
Today I'm going to be chatting
with Shanea King-Roberson,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.040
and we're going to be taking a
look at this new course called

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.590
Firebase in a Weekend.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.894
It comes from Google and
Udacity working together.

00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:11.560
And if you're not
familiar with Udacity,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.520
they're the experts
in online training.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.380
We're going to have a whole
lot of fun chatting about it,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.504
and I hope you have a whole
lot of fun watching it.

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:23.479
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:26.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: So, Shanea,
welcome to Coffee with Googler.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.670
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.128
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I know you've

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.480
been really busy with
getting lots of courses out

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.762
and Udacity stuff, but you
have a very special course

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:33.720
to tell us about today.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.830
Could you--

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.100
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: enlighten us.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.993
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: I'm
really excited about it, yeah.

00:00:37.993 --> 00:00:39.440
We've been really busy.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.610
We're actually launching
a new Firebase course.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.140
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
You know Firebase, right?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Kind of.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.850
I've heard of it.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.266
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Oh, my gosh.

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.700
Firebase is our new mobile
backend as a service.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.300
It allows anyone to
use, create quickly,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.887
a mobile backend for an Android
or iOS app and web, as well.

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:56.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: And web.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.490
Can't forget the web.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.750
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.226
This course is going to focus
immediately on Android and iOS.

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:03.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.819
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: And so
we're really, really excited

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:05.260
about it.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.120
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.250
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, so, this course,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.920
it's called Firebase
in a Weekend?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.100
Right?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.650
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Oh, yeah.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.740
This is actually a little
bit different than any

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.740
of the other Udacity
courses that we've created.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.781
There's a lot that comes
into mobile development.

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:17.280
There's a ton of
different aspects.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160
This course is called
Firebase in a Weekend

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.460
because we want new,
intermediate, advanced

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.100
developers, anyone
to be able to get up

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.416
and running on Firebase as a
mobile backend in one weekend.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:28.790
LAURENCE MORONEY:
In one weekend.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.010
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.010
You want to take a look?

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.142
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:33.600
INSTRUCTOR: Let's dive into
the Firebase real time database

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.100
structure.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.550
All data is stored
as JSON objects.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.000
You can think of the
database as a cloud host

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.060
of [? JSONtry. ?] This means
that your entire database is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.727
stored as a single JSON object.

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:49.212
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:01.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: I was
just joking earlier.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.890
Of course I'm familiar
with Firebase.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.150
You know, it's a
suite of technologies.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.020
And some of it's really to
help you develop better apps.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.630
And some of it's
to grow your apps

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.800
and then to earn from them.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.174
And I know in this
weekend you're

00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:15.970
focusing on the
development of the app

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.110
so you get that foundation.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.490
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Right.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: And there's
a bunch of technologies.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.687
Which ones does the
course actually cover?

00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:23.770
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: So
it covers authentication.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.301
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Which is a really exciting.

00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:28.005
It covers the
real-time database.

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:28.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.790
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Security.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.240
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
And, what we're

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.190
really excited about
is, like you just

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.390
said, getting all of
the foundations set up,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.830
because Firebase, like you
said, is a suite of options.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.690
But what's really
exciting is we actually

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.130
teach you to get all
those foundations set up,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.230
ready to go, so you can really
just focus on the really fun

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.980
things in the app.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.990
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: The
UI design, the engagement,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.990
the earning, all of
those different things.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sweet.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.974
So it's a sweet suite.

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:55.140
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Right.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: So,
typically with Udacity

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.910
you do this by building an app.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.250
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.910
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I assume there's

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.560
like an app that's going
to be built in this.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.040
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Oh yeah.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.540
Absolutely.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.730
So we're really excited because
we are actually teaching people

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.200
to build one of our
favorite demo apps, which

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.410
is called Friendly Chat.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.045
LAURENCE MORONEY: Friendly Chat?

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:11.340
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Friendly Chat.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.350
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
It is a messaging app.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.759
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
So by the end of it,

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.710
we are able to see messages
coming back and forth.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.380
You're able to
authenticate users,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.090
multiple people are able
to chat with each other.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.810
And also we teach
you a new library,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.510
which is called
Firebase Auth UI which

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.000
makes authentication UI
really easy and really simple

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.260
on both Android and iOS.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.370
So you have all the
foundation to get up

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.440
and running and chatting
with your friends,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.100
learning how to use all of
the remote config messaging,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.350
all of those different things.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.400
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Right off the bat.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.170
You mentioned remote config,
and that's one of my favorites.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.670
Right?

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.090
That with remote config
it's very, very simple

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.380
for you to just change
your UI on the fly,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.135
because it's a
server-side variable.

00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:55.260
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.950
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So instead of you

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.997
needing to deploy
a new code base,

00:03:57.997 --> 00:04:00.330
if you need to make changes,
or you need to make tweaks,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.826
you can do it by reading these
variables out of the cloud.

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.450
It's mind-blowing.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.170
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
It's going to be-- It's

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.910
so much better for developers.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.590
It's much faster and simpler.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.990
And so what we really
try to do with Firebase

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.750
is teach for an end
to end, hand-holding,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.700
there's a video
instructor, so that people

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.940
feel as though they're
interacting with a real person

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.790
teaching them how
to build this app,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.140
rather than just reading
the documentation.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.348
LAURENCE MORONEY: And one
of the things that I really

00:04:26.348 --> 00:04:28.420
like about how Udacity
do it, is that it's

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.560
a very Socratic method.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.960
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Right.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's not like
your typical video training

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.284
where you sit back and watch
a screen cast for two hours.

00:04:34.284 --> 00:04:35.450
Hopefully you've got it all.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.180
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: [LAUGHING]

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.971
LAURENCE MORONEY: How
would you explain it?

00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:40.670
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yeah,
so Udacity is actually

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.210
really good for engagement.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.190
You watch short chunks of video.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.040
So two to three minutes,
maybe five tops.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.260
But then it's immediately
followed by an assessment.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.310
What we want to do is make
sure that in every node

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.850
you get a chunk of information,
you really learn that piece.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.275
You can embody that piece
before you move forward.

00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:02.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.691
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
And then you're

00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:05.530
able to move back
and forth, rather

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.560
than trying to scroll
through a two-hour video

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.860
to find that one sentence
that you're looking for.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.530
Everything is broken
up into notes,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.780
which makes it really helpful.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.571
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
I personally, for me,

00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:17.510
because I don't have
great retention,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.730
that when it's short
like that and it's

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.920
challenged with a little bit of
a quiz, it forces me to think.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.290
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Right.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I might
only spend like a half an hour

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.576
learning in a particular
day, if I'm doing something

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:30.630
like this, rather than
three or four hours,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.750
but I retain so much
more in that time.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.250
Because it's much more intense,
it's much more concentrated.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.270
And I still remember some
of these years later.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.120
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: And
you're super hands on with it

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.849
because you're
actually building.

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.390
You know, you're
using GitHub, you're

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.390
learning the different things,
you're looking at the difs,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.420
you're seeing all of
these different changes.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.960
And they're small changes, so
you really understand and see

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.017
the progression from start
to finish rather than just

00:05:54.017 --> 00:05:56.600
trying a bunch of things out and
saying, "Does this really fit

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.580
together with this?"

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.320
It takes you in a linear order.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.124
So you kind of get a round
view of what's happening.

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:04.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: So the
obvious next question

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.399
is, where do we get started?

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:06.440
How do I get this course?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.190
How do I learn it?

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.565
And how much is
going to cost me?

00:06:08.565 --> 00:06:09.939
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Absolutely.

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.410
So developers can access the
course at no cost to them.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.285
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:15.920
INSTRUCTOR: They can just go
to Udacity.com/Google and click

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.530
on Firebase in a Weekend.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: So the
entire course, no cost?

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.820
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
No cost to them.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.570
So I can learn all of
these things in a weekend?

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.310
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Absolutely.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.940
I've got to go try it out.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.500
And there's one other
thing that they will learn

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.090
and that's how not
to cook a burger.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.362
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Yes.

00:06:30.362 --> 00:06:31.029
A veggie burger.

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:32.445
LAURENCE MORONEY:
A veggie burger.

00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:33.100
Yes, of course.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.930
And you'll have to watch
the course to find out.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.660
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
Absolutely.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
thank you so much Shanea.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.250
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON: Of course.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.210
Thanks for having me.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: This
has been so much fun.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.996
I'm really looking forward to
seeing the finished product.

00:06:41.996 --> 00:06:44.190
I've seen little bits of
it and I taught some of it.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.260
And I just can't wait to
see the finished product

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.140
and developers, I think,
are going to love it.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.480
SHANEA KING-ROBERSON:
We're really proud of it.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.646
