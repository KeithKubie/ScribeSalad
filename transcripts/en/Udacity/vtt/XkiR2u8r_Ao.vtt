00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.500
To find classes,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.150
we want to return to the registration
menu, then click Look Up Classes.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.460
Then we'll select our term.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.030
This will bring us to
a list of every subject

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.540
offered across the entire university.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.230
Right now, the OMS program has classes
in two subjects, computer science and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.520
computational science and engineering.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.790
So we'll scroll down to those and
use Shift to select both.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.240
Then we'll click Course Search and
we'll get a list of

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.100
all the courses in those subjects
that are offered in the semester.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.500
You can then click View Sections to see
the status of the different sections

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.209
of that class.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.570
We'll talk about this screen in a bit.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.350
&gt;&gt; You might notice that this list
is actually pretty overwhelming.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.450
You're seeing every class
offered on campus for

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.370
the entire semester as well
as the online classes.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.360
We can make this a bit easier by
going and doing an advanced search.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.630
Like before, we're going to
select Computational Science and

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.550
Engineering and
Computer Science as our subjects.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.940
But then we're going to
scroll down to Campus and

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.270
select Online, and
then we'll do our search.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.250
Then when I scroll down I'll see only
those courses offered in the online

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.130
campus or in the OMS program for
that semester.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.080
This way you can focus
only on those classes for

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.780
which you can actually register.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.260
So now let's talk about
actually registering.
