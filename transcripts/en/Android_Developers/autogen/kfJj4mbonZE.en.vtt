those claims are but assuming they are

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
those claims are but assuming they are
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.810
those claims are but assuming they are
but that's one way to look at it the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820
but that's one way to look at it the
 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.460
but that's one way to look at it the
other way that I guess you should look

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
other way that I guess you should look
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.090
other way that I guess you should look
at it is how the developer tools are you

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100
at it is how the developer tools are you
 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.190
at it is how the developer tools are you
going to be as productive using those

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200
going to be as productive using those
 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.590

so it's more than just performance I

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
so it's more than just performance I
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.000
so it's more than just performance I
mean if we were looking purely from a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
mean if we were looking purely from a
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.640
mean if we were looking purely from a
performance point of view you know ndk

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
performance point of view you know ndk
 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.560
performance point of view you know ndk
gives tons of performance because you're

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570
gives tons of performance because you're
 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.340
gives tons of performance because you're
building your writing in c and but you

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350
building your writing in c and but you
 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.410

know the developer productivity is not

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
know the developer productivity is not
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.890
know the developer productivity is not
not as as high so it's great to see that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
not as as high so it's great to see that
 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.440
not as as high so it's great to see that
you know c sharp or mono is a is an

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
you know c sharp or mono is a is an
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.140
you know c sharp or mono is a is an
alternative for Android and I i think

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150
alternative for Android and I i think
 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.270
alternative for Android and I i think
our advice is basically pick the tool

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
our advice is basically pick the tool
 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.199
our advice is basically pick the tool
that suits you best okay cool uncle up

stood who is everyone yeah Tywin and so
 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.570
stood who is everyone yeah Tywin and so
what next question is about c2dm

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580
what next question is about c2dm
 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.970
what next question is about c2dm
messaging and a lot so I will hand it

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980
messaging and a lot so I will hand it
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.910
messaging and a lot so I will hand it
over tornado right the question is now

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920
over tornado right the question is now
 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.800
over tornado right the question is now
when the client login authentication is

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
when the client login authentication is
 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.630
when the client login authentication is
deprecated should be used over two point

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640
deprecated should be used over two point
 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.470
deprecated should be used over two point
oh four c2dm messaging would be great if

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480
oh four c2dm messaging would be great if
 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.940
oh four c2dm messaging would be great if
you have an example here to get not

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950
you have an example here to get not
 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.960
you have an example here to get not
token with or to use with c2dm messaging

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970
token with or to use with c2dm messaging
 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.110
token with or to use with c2dm messaging
so the answer to this is yes we know

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120
so the answer to this is yes we know
 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.979
so the answer to this is yes we know
c2dm is is being deprecated and

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989
c2dm is is being deprecated and
 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.510
c2dm is is being deprecated and
scrubbing out the best way to

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520
scrubbing out the best way to
 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.360
scrubbing out the best way to
authenticate but for now that's the only

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
authenticate but for now that's the only
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.460
authenticate but for now that's the only
solution we have its you see to it is to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470
solution we have its you see to it is to
 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.320
solution we have its you see to it is to
use crime log in to get the tokens

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330
use crime log in to get the tokens
 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.600
use crime log in to get the tokens

next question is again for me on this is
 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.030
next question is again for me on this is
on graphic you I editor so the question

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040
on graphic you I editor so the question
 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.640
on graphic you I editor so the question
is last week my question was announced

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650
is last week my question was announced
 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.060
is last week my question was announced
was answered advising me not to use the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070
was answered advising me not to use the
 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.740
was answered advising me not to use the
graphic you I editor because of bugs

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750
graphic you I editor because of bugs

graphic you I editor because of bugs
which made me think how is the workflow

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330
which made me think how is the workflow
 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.909
which made me think how is the workflow
like with UI designers on the team

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919
like with UI designers on the team
 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.070
like with UI designers on the team
should I just ask the designer to draw

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080
should I just ask the designer to draw
 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.000
should I just ask the designer to draw
the UI then I reproduced in on XML so

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010
the UI then I reproduced in on XML so
 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.760
the UI then I reproduced in on XML so
the first thing is probably this

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770
the first thing is probably this
 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.010
the first thing is probably this
question was not the was asking the

North America hang out ours or the MEI
 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.850
North America hang out ours or the MEI
not ask because we can have this in a

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860
not ask because we can have this in a
 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.560
not ask because we can have this in a
fact but anyway we will try to answer

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570
fact but anyway we will try to answer

with the GUI editor but if you need
 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.260
with the GUI editor but if you need
rapid prototyping me advise you to use

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270
rapid prototyping me advise you to use
 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.480
rapid prototyping me advise you to use
some special tools available this

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490
some special tools available this
 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.490
some special tools available this
there's one set of tools available with

there's one set of tools available with
 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.980
there's one set of tools available with
Android UI utils which also includes the

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990
Android UI utils which also includes the
 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.719
Android UI utils which also includes the

up with rapid prototypes for your

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700
up with rapid prototypes for your
 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.170
up with rapid prototypes for your
applications we can then convert to a

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180
applications we can then convert to a
 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.020
applications we can then convert to a
given application code let's see let's

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030
given application code let's see let's
 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.529
given application code let's see let's
see only where we can advise you right

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539
see only where we can advise you right
 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.159

okay thanks everyone yeah I will it's

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169
okay thanks everyone yeah I will it's

okay thanks everyone yeah I will it's
kind of tricky to a bit of a very nice

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220
kind of tricky to a bit of a very nice
 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.500
kind of tricky to a bit of a very nice
UI with the tools we have but again you

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510
UI with the tools we have but again you
 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.029
UI with the tools we have but again you
always have the option of going back to

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039
always have the option of going back to
 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.580
always have the option of going back to
eczema if you feel that you know you're

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590
eczema if you feel that you know you're
 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.480
eczema if you feel that you know you're
losing control by using the UI okay so

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490
losing control by using the UI okay so
 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.600
losing control by using the UI okay so
next question is on emulators support

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610
next question is on emulators support
 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.100
next question is on emulators support
for high resolution so i am going to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110
for high resolution so i am going to
 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.909
for high resolution so i am going to
take up the question does the emulator

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919
take up the question does the emulator
 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.060
take up the question does the emulator
support high resolution and density from

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070
support high resolution and density from
 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.909
support high resolution and density from
the newest devices smartphones and

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919
the newest devices smartphones and
 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.089
the newest devices smartphones and
tablets so they're not as a question

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.099
tablets so they're not as a question
 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.629
tablets so they're not as a question
there is a comment

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639
there is a comment
 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.129
there is a comment
configure the emulator with the high

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139
configure the emulator with the high
 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.529
configure the emulator with the high
resolution and ICS target emulator just

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539
resolution and ICS target emulator just
 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.839
resolution and ICS target emulator just
shows a black screen or hands up okay so

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849
shows a black screen or hands up okay so
 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.989
shows a black screen or hands up okay so
first I'll answer the first part so when

00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:52.999
first I'll answer the first part so when
 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:56.890
first I'll answer the first part so when
you create a DVD there is a default

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900
you create a DVD there is a default
 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.399
you create a DVD there is a default
abstract density which is set so for a

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:00.409
abstract density which is set so for a
 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.830
abstract density which is set so for a
VDS which are targeted for 4.0 dot 4 or

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840
VDS which are targeted for 4.0 dot 4 or
 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.670
VDS which are targeted for 4.0 dot 4 or
4.0 dot 3 the affected density is 240

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680
4.0 dot 3 the affected density is 240
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.350
4.0 dot 3 the affected density is 240
DPA and and if you are creating a VD for

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360
DPA and and if you are creating a VD for
 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.920
DPA and and if you are creating a VD for
Honeycomb which is 3.1 or 3.2 the app

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930
Honeycomb which is 3.1 or 3.2 the app
 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.649
Honeycomb which is 3.1 or 3.2 the app
circuit density is around 160 and for

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:20.659
circuit density is around 160 and for
 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:24.070
circuit density is around 160 and for
the winner a VD sits around 240 again so

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080
the winner a VD sits around 240 again so
 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.110
the winner a VD sits around 240 again so
because tablets typically have a lower

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120
because tablets typically have a lower
 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.240
because tablets typically have a lower
densities and you can also change the

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250
densities and you can also change the
 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.360
densities and you can also change the
density by editing by VD so to answer

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.370
density by editing by VD so to answer
 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.829
density by editing by VD so to answer
your question the yes you can abstract a

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:35.839
your question the yes you can abstract a
 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.679
your question the yes you can abstract a
given density or change the density when

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:38.689
given density or change the density when
 

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:41.980
given density or change the density when
you create any VD now why is this not

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990
you create any VD now why is this not
 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.570
you create any VD now why is this not
happening in your particular EVD it's

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.580
 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.320
difficult to answer that question

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.330
difficult to answer that question
 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.179
difficult to answer that question

you in terms of what did you try to
change the abstract density density or

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000
change the abstract density density or
 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.760
change the abstract density density or

what you should do is you should become

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:00.949
what you should do is you should become
 

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:04.420
what you should do is you should become
a provider on the server side and you

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:04.430
a provider on the server side and you
 

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.730
a provider on the server side and you
should store the OAuth access token on

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:06.740
should store the OAuth access token on
 

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.369
should store the OAuth access token on
the client side and and the best way to

00:12:09.369 --> 00:12:09.379
the client side and and the best way to
 

00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:11.800
the client side and and the best way to
store it is in shared preferences so

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:11.810
store it is in shared preferences so
 

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.960
store it is in shared preferences so
that even if your app is our activity is

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:15.970
that even if your app is our activity is
 

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.910
that even if your app is our activity is
destroyed and when it's created again

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920
destroyed and when it's created again
 

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.129

you can note those that access token

00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:21.139
you can note those that access token
 

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:24.009
you can note those that access token
from the sheer preferences and so that

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:24.019
from the sheer preferences and so that

from google i/o suggests that we should

00:12:45.819 --> 00:12:45.829
from google i/o suggests that we should
 

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:48.189
from google i/o suggests that we should
implement a heartbeat mechanism this is

00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199
implement a heartbeat mechanism this is
 

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:50.290
implement a heartbeat mechanism this is
the latin mean increments something to

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:50.300
the latin mean increments something to
 

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.090
the latin mean increments something to

wake up the phone and perform something
 

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.259
wake up the phone and perform something
in HTTP so I think the heartbeat

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:56.269
in HTTP so I think the heartbeat
 

00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:57.730

Developers bringing nearly six months
 

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.870
Developers bringing nearly six months
now so unfortunately we do not know if

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880
now so unfortunately we do not know if
 

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.960
now so unfortunately we do not know if
any such plans you're not aware so maybe

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:38.970
any such plans you're not aware so maybe
 

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.070
any such plans you're not aware so maybe
I think the good thing would be to

condensed but they had said something
 

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.700
condensed but they had said something
about this particular launch but i think

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:09.710
about this particular launch but i think
 

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.590
about this particular launch but i think
samsung india and their PR department

samsung india and their PR department
 

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.360
samsung india and their PR department

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:14.370
would be the right channel to ask this
 

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:23.320
would be the right channel to ask this
question next question is on one of the

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:23.330
question next question is on one of the
 

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.570
question next question is on one of the
legal matter so I mean hand it over to

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:31.760
legal matter so I mean hand it over to
Uncle ah thanks Raj zip so the question

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:31.770
Uncle ah thanks Raj zip so the question
 

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.490
Uncle ah thanks Raj zip so the question
is according to the jury and there's

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500
is according to the jury and there's
 

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.270
is according to the jury and there's
some references to the case going on

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280
some references to the case going on
 

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.750
some references to the case going on
between Oracle and Google and basically

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760
between Oracle and Google and basically
 

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.690
between Oracle and Google and basically
look none of us on this on this call our

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700
look none of us on this on this call our
 

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.029
look none of us on this on this call our
lawyers we were not supposed to talk

00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039
lawyers we were not supposed to talk
 

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:50.210
lawyers we were not supposed to talk
about litigation and so we don't have an

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220
about litigation and so we don't have an
 

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.440
about litigation and so we don't have an
answer for this it's it's certainly

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:51.450
answer for this it's it's certainly
 

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:55.730
answer for this it's it's certainly
outside of the scope of of this hang-up

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740
outside of the scope of of this hang-up
 

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.600
outside of the scope of of this hang-up
or so

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:56.610
or so
 

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.760
or so
thanks for the question but you probably

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:58.770
thanks for the question but you probably
 

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.770
thanks for the question but you probably
need to find a different audience for it

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:02.780
need to find a different audience for it
 

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.590
need to find a different audience for it
yeah thanks uncle the next person is

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600
yeah thanks uncle the next person is
 

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.210
yeah thanks uncle the next person is
again for you oh yeah so the question is

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220
again for you oh yeah so the question is
 

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.460
again for you oh yeah so the question is
how can I move all my android apps to

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:13.470
how can I move all my android apps to
 

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:20.120
how can I move all my android apps to
the SD card now um I I think that this

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.130
the SD card now um I I think that this
 

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.970
the SD card now um I I think that this
person is asking a developer question

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:21.980
person is asking a developer question
 

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.600
person is asking a developer question
but you could frame this question either

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:26.610
but you could frame this question either
 

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:32.090
but you could frame this question either
way so basically from a developer's

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.100
way so basically from a developer's
 

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.650
way so basically from a developer's
point of view you can you can specify in

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660
point of view you can you can specify in
 

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.990
point of view you can you can specify in
your manifest file that your app can be

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000
your manifest file that your app can be
 

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.270
your manifest file that your app can be
moved to the SD card and there's

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280
moved to the SD card and there's
 

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.180
moved to the SD card and there's
basically a parameter that you can add

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.190
basically a parameter that you can add
 

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.289
basically a parameter that you can add
the other parameter you can add is you

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299
the other parameter you can add is you
 

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:46.960
the other parameter you can add is you
can set the default install location

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:46.970
can set the default install location
 

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.820
can set the default install location
yeah and you can basically say hey it's

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:49.830
yeah and you can basically say hey it's
 

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.409
yeah and you can basically say hey it's
always installed to the SD card so i

00:20:53.409 --> 00:20:53.419
always installed to the SD card so i
 

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:55.789
always installed to the SD card so i
guess that's that's how you can do it

00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799
guess that's that's how you can do it
 

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:58.760
guess that's that's how you can do it
for your your your apps themselves if

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:58.770
for your your your apps themselves if
 

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.640
for your your your apps themselves if
you're looking at it from a user's point

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:01.650
you're looking at it from a user's point
 

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.970
you're looking at it from a user's point
of view look developers have to enable

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980
of view look developers have to enable
 

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:09.470
of view look developers have to enable
the option to move to SD card it's not

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480
the option to move to SD card it's not
 

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.000
the option to move to SD card it's not
something that you can blankly just go

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.010
something that you can blankly just go
 

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.620
something that you can blankly just go
and say move all my apps to the SD card

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:12.630
and say move all my apps to the SD card
 

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.130
and say move all my apps to the SD card
now you might also ask well why is that

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140
now you might also ask well why is that
 

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.950
now you might also ask well why is that
not the default and basically SD cards

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960
not the default and basically SD cards
 

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.330
not the default and basically SD cards
you can think of them as transient

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340
you can think of them as transient
 

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.520
you can think of them as transient
storage because people can eject the SD

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:25.530
storage because people can eject the SD
 

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.890
storage because people can eject the SD
card switch it out with another SD card

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900
card switch it out with another SD card
 

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.289
card switch it out with another SD card
or just not have an SD card in the

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.299
or just not have an SD card in the
 

00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:32.870
or just not have an SD card in the
device so it's not something that

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880
device so it's not something that
 

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.450
device so it's not something that
developers should be assuming will

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:35.460
developers should be assuming will
 

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.380
developers should be assuming will
always be present you can run into some

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:39.390
always be present you can run into some
 

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.180
always be present you can run into some
funny issues there as well because if

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.190
funny issues there as well because if
 

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.669
funny issues there as well because if
you've got an app that for example has a

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679
you've got an app that for example has a
 

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:47.930
you've got an app that for example has a
widget or has a service it will not work

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940
widget or has a service it will not work
 

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.720
widget or has a service it will not work
that widget basically won't work on the

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:50.730
that widget basically won't work on the
 

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.840
that widget basically won't work on the
if the user adds it to the launcher what

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:53.850
if the user adds it to the launcher what
 

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.030
if the user adds it to the launcher what
will typically happen is that the user

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:56.040
will typically happen is that the user
 

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.470
will typically happen is that the user
will be able to add that widget to the

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480
will be able to add that widget to the
 

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.270
will be able to add that widget to the
launcher and next time they reboot their

00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280
launcher and next time they reboot their
 

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.730
launcher and next time they reboot their
device that widget will probably

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740
device that widget will probably
 

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.680
device that widget will probably
disappear or you'll have some sort of

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:03.690
disappear or you'll have some sort of
 

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.980
disappear or you'll have some sort of
error shown there and and that has to do

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:06.990
error shown there and and that has to do
 

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.960
error shown there and and that has to do
with you know the boot order in

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:08.970
with you know the boot order in
 

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.669
with you know the boot order in
and how quickly the SD card can get

00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679
and how quickly the SD card can get
 

00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:13.880
and how quickly the SD card can get
mounted it on so forth so look we

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:13.890
mounted it on so forth so look we
 

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.120
mounted it on so forth so look we
understand that move to SD s SD card is

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.130
understand that move to SD s SD card is
 

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.890
understand that move to SD s SD card is
the feature that you might find

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900
the feature that you might find
 

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.370
the feature that you might find
attractive you have to be very careful

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380
attractive you have to be very careful
 

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.250
attractive you have to be very careful
how you use it though so i would suggest

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260
how you use it though so i would suggest
 

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.169
how you use it though so i would suggest
try and sort of see if you can split

00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179
try and sort of see if you can split
 

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.870
try and sort of see if you can split
your app up in some some clever ways

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880
your app up in some some clever ways
 

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.880
your app up in some some clever ways
such that you've got your your core rap

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:31.890
such that you've got your your core rap
 

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.130
such that you've got your your core rap
is nice and small and the data part of

your app is maybe using our a new
 

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.610
your app is maybe using our a new
extension apks so that we can separate
