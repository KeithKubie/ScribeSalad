00:00:01.675 --> 00:00:03.742
- [Voiceover] And now we're
down to solving this circuit.

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:06.737
What I want to do now is put
in the con pointed values

00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:09.404
and solve this specific circuit.

00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:13.142
Let me move the screen up again.

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.530
We'll leave the list of steps
up there so we can see them.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.850
Let's go to work on this equation now.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.243
We have a little bit of algebra,

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:28.215
and we can plug in
values where we need to.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.798
We can plug in 15 volts for V1.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.850
And for R1, we can plug in 4000 ohms.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.779
We can put in, for V2.

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:41.362
V2's still unknown.

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:45.508
And that's divided by 4K.

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:51.330
In this expression here we
still have V2 unknown over 2K

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:59.505
And let's put IS over on the other side.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:05.985
IS was three milliamps.

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:08.377
Let's just keep working at this now.

00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:10.377
V2 times 1/4K

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:15.872
plus 1/2K

00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:21.115
equals three milliamps.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.789
Oh, get my minus signs right.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.227
Minus sign over here.

00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:32.526
Let's bring the constant
term over to this side,

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.359
so this is 15 volts divided by 4K.

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:40.978
And continuing over here,

00:01:40.978 --> 00:01:43.137
we have minus V2.

00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:46.272
Let's combine those two resistor terms.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.355
So it's going to be 1+2 over 4K,

00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:00.728
equals three milliamps.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:05.759
And 15 volts divided by 4K is 3.75

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.560
minus 3.75 milliamps.

00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:18.635
Moving on, minus V2

00:02:21.255 --> 00:02:23.172
equals -0.75 milliamps,

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:33.951
times 4K over three.

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:42.065
Let's get rid of the two minus signs.

00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:44.248
We don't need those anymore.

00:02:44.248 --> 00:02:46.165
And V2 equals one volt.

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:56.763
That's good; we solved it.

00:02:56.763 --> 00:02:59.527
We solved our prior two voltages.

00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:03.110
We have one here and
we have one over here.

00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:07.111
And we can check off the last step.

00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:12.692
So that's our first application
of the node voltage method.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.573
I want to show you one more thing

00:03:14.573 --> 00:03:18.265
that is a powerful part of this technique.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:21.765
Let me quickly sketch the schematic again.

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:32.460
So this was our schematic,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.270
and we assigned node voltages.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.965
We assigned node voltages here.

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:40.965
V1, and V2, and we made
this our reference node.

00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:45.905
And one of the things we did not do

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:47.646
as part of the node voltage method,

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:52.546
we did not us KVL to write
equations around these loops.

00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:54.589
And one of the features
of the node voltage method

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.679
is that the KVL equations,

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:58.397
because we're using node voltages,

00:03:58.397 --> 00:04:02.739
the KVL equations are
automatically satisfied.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:03.970
And I'll show you why.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.292
I want to put one more label on here,

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:08.709
which is the element voltage.

00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:11.191
We'll call this VR1.

00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:14.326
That's the element voltage across here.

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:17.326
The element voltage here is just V2.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.733
So in this case for R2,

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:23.660
V2 is the element voltage

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.634
and the node voltage at the same time.

00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:27.801
VR1 is an element voltage.

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:31.625
And now we're going to write KVL,

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:32.948
starting from this point,

00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:36.615
and going around the
loop in this direction.

00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:42.887
And what we have is... let's
get all our labels on here.

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:47.054
The loop voltages, we
start with a rise of +VS,

00:04:48.784 --> 00:04:50.617
then we take away VR1,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.443
and then we take away V2,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.258
and that equals zero.

00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:02.298
So that would be the KVL
equation for this circuit.

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:04.806
Now I'm going to plug in,

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:06.826
using node voltages,
I'm going to write VR1.

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:08.826
So I get +VS minus,

00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:15.174
VR1 is node voltage V1
minus node voltage V2.

00:05:18.808 --> 00:05:19.808
V1 minus V2,

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:25.806
minus V2 equals zero.

00:05:26.796 --> 00:05:29.234
And we'll just do one more substitution.

00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:31.532
But I forgot VS and V1
are the same voltage.

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:34.199
So this is actually V1 minus V1,

00:05:36.594 --> 00:05:39.177
minus V2, minus V2 equals zero.

00:05:41.587 --> 00:05:44.025
And if we look at this equation,

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:45.775
that goes, that goes,

00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:48.311
plus V2, minus V2.

00:05:49.737 --> 00:05:51.780
This equation is automatically true,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.697
if we write Kirchhoff's Current Law

00:05:55.913 --> 00:05:57.933
in terms of node voltages.

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:00.279
That always turns out to be the case.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.717
That's why we don't bother to do it.

00:06:02.717 --> 00:06:04.133
We know it's going to be true.

00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:06.339
So that's a nice feature
of the node voltage method.

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.893
It's a really efficient
way to write equations.

00:06:08.893 --> 00:06:11.099
You only write KCL equations.

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.746
And this is such a good method in fact,

00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:15.511
that circuit simulators, like,

00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:19.644
you may come across a circuit
simulator called Spice.

00:06:19.644 --> 00:06:22.965
Almost every circuit simulator
uses this node voltage method

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.635
to do its computations.
