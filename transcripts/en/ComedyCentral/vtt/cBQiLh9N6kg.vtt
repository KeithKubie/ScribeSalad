00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:07.660
IT'S TIME FOR YOU

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.234
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE TIRED,

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.769
AND EXHAUSTED,
AND OVERWORKED,

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:18.204
BUT WE'RE GONNA
STILL FIND THE ENERGY

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:19.772
TO GO ANTIQUING ON THE WEEKENDS.
- OH, YEAH?

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.407
AND THEN, YOU'RE GONNA
BE ON YOUR DEATHBED,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.542
AND YOU'RE GONNA
BE SITTIN' THERE,

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.643
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE DYIN'.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:24.677
AND I'M GONNA
BE RIGHT BESIDE YOU,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.645
AND I'M GONNA BE CRYIN'.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.314
AND RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT
WHEN YOU CROSS OVER

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:29.715
FROM THIS WORLD
INTO THE NEXT,

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.285
I'M GONNA [bleep] YOU
IN THE ASS[bleep].

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.953
- OH, MAN,
I WISH YOU'D TRY.

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.288
- OH, YOU DO?
- I WISH THAT YOU WOULD TRY.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.456
- WELL,
WISH [bleep]ING GRANTED.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.692
[laughter]

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.895
NO, I LOVE THE VILLAGE
AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY,

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:44.597
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
IF WE CONTINUE

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.466
TO SELF-SEGREGATE OURSELVES,
THE ENTIRE GAY COMMUNITY'S

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.635
GONNA CONTINUE
TO BE "MARGARINE-IZED"

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.504
I WAS JUST SAYING THIS
TO CLAUDIUS THE OTHER NIGHT

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:52.905
RIGHT AFTER I [bleep] HIM
IN THE ASS.

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:54.974
- YEAH, HE DID,

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.178
- ANYWAY, ENOUGH POLITICS.
CHEERS, EVERYONE.
