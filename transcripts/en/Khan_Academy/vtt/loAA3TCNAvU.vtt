00:00:00.704 --> 00:00:02.370
We have this strange
looking shape here,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.360
and then we're given
some of its dimensions.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.240
We know that this side right
over here has a length of 3.5.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.650
This side over here is 6.5.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.745
Then we know from
here to here is 2,

00:00:13.745 --> 00:00:16.585
and then from here to here is 7.

00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:18.960
And then they're giving us
this dimension right over here

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840
is 3.5.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.580
So given that,
let's see if we can

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.460
find the area of
this entire figure.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.970
And I encourage you to pause
the video right now and try

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.900
this on your own.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.570
I assume you've
given a go at it.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.070
And there might be
a few things that

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.560
jump out at you immediately.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.510
The first thing
is that they have

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.760
these two triangles up here.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.310
And they give us all of
the dimensions for them,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.370
or at least they give us
the base and the height

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.720
for it, which is enough
to figure out the area.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.200
If I had a rectangle that was 2
units wide and 3.5 units high,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:02.010
if we know that it would
have an area of 2 times 3.5.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.907
Now a triangle is
just going to be,

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:05.990
especially a triangle like
this, a right triangle,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.590
is just going to be half
of a rectangle like this.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.660
We just care about
half of its area.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.230
So this area is going to
be 1/2 times 2 times 3.5.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.580
1/2 times 2 is equal to 1.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.180
1 times 3.5 is 3.5 square units.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.500
So the area of that part is
going to be 3.5 square units.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.530
Let's think about the area of
this triangle right over here.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.970
Well, once again we
have its height is 3.5.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.950
Its base is 7.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.680
So its area is going to
be 1/2 times 7 times 3.5.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.950
1/2 times 7 is 3.5 times 3.5.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.380
So this part is
3.5, and I'm going

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.770
to multiply that
times 3.5 again.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370
Let's figure out what
that product is equal to.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.694
3.5 times 3.5.

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:03.920
5 times 5 is 25.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.380
3 times 5 is 15, plus 2 is 17.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.870
Let's cross that out.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.830
Move one place over to the left.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.560
3 times 5 is 15.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.410
3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.630
So that gets us
to 5 plus 0 is 5.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.920
7 plus 5 is 12, carry the 1.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.260
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.780
And we have a 1.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.515
We have two digits to the
right of the decimal, one, two.

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:31.890
So we're going to
have two digits

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.160
to the right of the
decimal in the answer.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.870
The area here is
12.25 square units.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.920
Now this region may be a
little bit more difficult,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.456
because it's kind of us this
weird trapezoid looking thing.

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:49.080
But one thing that
might pop out at you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.230
is that you can
divide it very easily

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.050
into a rectangle and a triangle.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.970
And we can actually
figure out the dimensions

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.980
that we need to figure out
the areas of each of these.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.496
We know what the width
of this rectangle

00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:04.370
is, or the length of
this rectangle, whatever

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.500
you want to call it.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.000
It's going to be 2
units plus 7 units.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.270
So this is going to be 9.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.130
We know that this
distance is 3.5.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.310
If this distance right
over here is 3.5,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.780
then this distance down here
has to add up with 3.5 to 6.5,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.680
so this must be 3.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.660
Now we can actually
figure out the area.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.200
The area of this
rectangle is just

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.092
going to be its height times
its length, or 9 times 3.5.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:40.859
9 times 3.5.

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.650
And one way you could
do it-- we could even

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.983
try to do this in our head--
this is going to be 9 times

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:47.580
3 plus 9 times 0.5.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.660
9 times 3 is 27.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.630
9 times 0.5, that's just half of
nine, so it's going to be 4.5.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.070
27 plus 4 will get
us to 31, so that's

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.050
going to be equal to 31.5.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.300
Or you could multiply it
out like this, if you like.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.977
But the area of
this region is 31.5.

00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:08.060
And then the area of this
triangle right over here

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.860
is going to be 9
times 3 times 1/2.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.320
We're looking at a triangle.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.440
9 times 3 is 27.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.974
27 times 1/2 is 13.5.

00:04:19.974 --> 00:04:21.640
So to find the area
of the entire thing,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.750
we just have to
sum up these areas.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:43.030
We have 31.5 plus 13.5
plus 12.25 plus 3.5.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.930
So we just have a 5
here in the hundredths.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.080
That's the only one.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.580
5 plus 5 is 10, plus 7 is 17.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:00.920
1 plus 1 is 2, plus 3 is 5,
plus 2 is 7, plus 3 is 10.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.160
1 plus 3 is 4, plus
1 is 5, plus 1 is 6.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:14.059
So we get a total area for this
figure of 60.75 square units.
