00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.560
Many teachers have a poor work-life balance.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.400
I know, because I've had years of experience as a teacher in the classroom.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.200
I'm here to teach you how to handle your workload and restore that work-life balance.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.780
If you follow my time management methods, long days should be a thing of the past.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.380
You'll be able to go home on time, worry-free, knowing that you've done everything you need to do.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's begin.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.260
One of the biggest challenges you face as a teacher is your uncooperative coworkers, your students.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.760
Sometimes they try and do as little work as is possible and it can be tempting to let them get away with it.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.840
After all, if some of them don't do their homework, that's less homework for you to mark.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.940
Small problems like this, such as letting an individual student get away

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.460
with not doing a homework or a project can quickly grow into big problems,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.460
like the entire class not doing their homework.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.760
Ultimately, if the students aren't doing the work you're assigning them, they're going to do less well on the tests

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.760
and they're learning less.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.700
You'll also have to spend more and more time in your day dealing with classroom management issues

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.460
like trying to get them to do their work.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.320
The students don't learn just what you teach them directly. They're also learning about you as a person.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.920
If you are the kind of teacher who lets homework slide, they're going to be less and less likely to do work for you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.760
and to respect you.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.480
You have to make sure that you're keeping track of everything that's going on in your classroom.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.980
But this is quite a challenge because often times, teachers have 500 or more students

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.320
that they need to be looking after.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.200
How do you make sure that you're keeping track of what everybody owes you and what needs to be done?

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.600
The tool that I recommend that can change your life is just a small, sturdy clipboard.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.020
If you go out and you get one for yourself today, I guarantee you, it will change your life as a teacher.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.840
There are three kinds of things that you should keep on your clipboard:

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.280
Their tracking sheets, their daily must-do lists, and there's a general to-do list.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
I want to talk about the tracking sheet first.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.160
The tracking sheet starts out its life as just a plain piece of blank paper.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.040
But as the days go by, if any student misses something for you, a homework or a project,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.500
you put their name on this list, make a note of what the thing is they're missing,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.180
and the date that this happened on.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.940
You should go through this list at least once a week and cross off anybody who's gotten work back to you.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.240
Or send messages to those who haven't.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.940
If a student continues not to give something to you, you need to look into your own school's sanctions policies.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.440
As long as you never cross off anybody's name before they've given you what they owe you,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.820
you'll always be making sure that you get every piece of work from every student.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.960
When collecting in the homework from students, you should go around to the students' desk individually,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.980
collect each piece of homework and then write down the names of those who don't have it.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.580
If you do this regularly, the students will quickly learn that you're the kind of teacher

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.820
who doesn't let things slide.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.480
And they'll put you on the top of their own to-do lists.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.320
The second thing to talk about are the daily must-do lists.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.660
On your computer, you should make a Word document that has a blank page for each workday.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.820
On those pages, you're going to put down the things that must happen by the end of that day,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.540
in order to be fully prepared for the next day.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.140
So as an example, every Monday, you need to list all of the classes that you need to plan for on Tuesday.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.920
If there's anything else that needs to be done before Tuesday, also put that on that list.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.000
The thing that really makes this work is that it is a must-do list. This is not a daily to-do list.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.260
You're not putting down things that you would like to get done by the end of the day,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
but that are ultimately optional.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.320
You need to put down things that have to get done.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.720
I like to think of this as my "I must do this before I can go home list".

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.600
If you limit your list to only the things that absolutely have to get done,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.280
it's much more motivating to knock those things off, so you know you can go home at the end of the day

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.720
and not have to be worrying all night about what you need to do first thing in the morning

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.040
to be ready for the day.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.980
The last thing to keep on the clipboard is a general to-do list. This is a list for everything that doesn't fit

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.420
on your must-do list.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.380
Anything that is less time sensitive goes on here. Any general project that you need to do at some point,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.540
but not by a specific day will all be kept track of on here.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.900
After you've crossed off your must-do list, then you would turn over to your general to-do list

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.280
and start working through those items, if you have time.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.260
The next thing I want to talk about is paperwork.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.120
Teachers deal with a lot of paper and you have to have a system for keeping it all together.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.980
This is what I recommend. You should have one folder for each class that you teach.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.000
Within that folder, you're going to keep all of the papers that you currently need to teach that class.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.660
So, any worksheets that you're going to give out, any tests you're going to give out,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.920
homework that you've gotten back and need to mark, all of those kinds of things go into this folder.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.560
Any reference materials that you wouldn't need on a particular day to teach that class,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.780
such as workbooks that you use to photocopy the worksheets from,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.120
those you can keep in a separate filing cabinet.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.960
Here's an example of the kind of thing to keep inside one of the folders. This is a collection of papers

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.300
that's for a Year 10 test.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.420
There's three parts to this little packet, so let's take a look at them.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.780
First, there's the papers themselves.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.900
Secondly, there's a title sheet that clearly describes what they are. In this example, Year 10 Tests.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.400
And lastly, there's a cover slip which keeps all of these things together.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.920
If you leave a lot of blank space on your cover sheet, you can add additional information later on,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.420
such as when you've given the test to the students and received them back, you can add To Mark

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.080
on the front of that sheet, so that you know you need to take care of this.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.320
And once you've marked them, you can then cross that out.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.060
Again, to quickly review, keep one folder for each of your classes, and keep all of the things that you need to teach

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.800
that class in that folder.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.920
Once you set up this system, you know that you just need that single folder to be adequately prepared

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.540
for the class.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.500
This is also convenient, in case there's a room change. You can just grab that folder and go.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.740
If you're able to organize your files in the ways that I've just recommended,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.740
and you're able to consistently work with your daily must-do list, the advantage is that when you walk into

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.400
school on any day, you know that you're completely ready for whatever's going to happen.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.540
You don't have to spend any of your day frantically planning for that afternoon lesson,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.540
and if anything comes up unexpectedly, you don't have to worry about it, because you're all set

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.540
for every one of your lessons for that day.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.580
Once you start getting used to this ready position, you'll find that you have more time in the day than you actually

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.460
originally thought. One of the places that time has been hiding from you is in these little five minute intervals

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.540
between lessons.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.460
After the last class leaves and before the next class comes in, you can use this time in a productive way

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.780
if you're prepared adequately.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.560
I recommend that you keep a list of things that you can do in these little five minute times.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.960
For example, you can do some quick filing or, if you have an easy to mark quiz, you can mark a couple of those

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.280
pages in that quiz.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.020
After a full day of teaching, you can sometimes find that you've marked a complete class set of quizzes

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.240
without ever feeling like you had to sit down and mark the whole thing at once.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.700
I want you to realize as a teacher that your job is a lot less clear than other jobs.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.580
If you think of a factory worker, they have a clearly defined shift, which is nine to five

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.080
and they're producing a tangible product, such as a car.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.780
You know when the car is done because all of the pieces have been fit together.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.820
Being a teacher is not like this. If you're working on something like making presentations

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.280
or making a test for a class or a worksheet, this kind of work can really go on forever.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.660
You can always make a presentation a little bit snappier or you can always make a worksheet a little bit clearer.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.660
When you're making something like a worksheet, at some point, the worksheet is going to be serviceable.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.500
It's going to be completely adequate for the educational aim that you're trying to achieve.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.740
If you're going to continue working, you really need to stop and think for a moment.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.620
Would I better spend my time making this worksheet absolutely perfect?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.100
Or would my time be better spent moving on to something else?

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.100
Most of the time, the answer is the latter. You're better off having two satisfactory worksheets

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.860
for two different classes than one perfect worksheet for one class, but no worksheet for the other one.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.580
Now let's talk about sick days. Teachers have one of the lowest absentee rates of any profession.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.580
And I don't think that's because teachers are more healthy than most people.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.440
It's because, as a teacher, sometimes missing a day of work is more of a hassle than just going in,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.440
no matter how poorly you may be feeling.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.800
Because of this, teachers don't often take days off work until they're feeling really poor.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.820
Do yourself a favor as a teacher. Spend some time creating lessons to be used in your absence

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.980
ahead of time.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.200
If you make them before you need them, when you actually are sick, you can just call in the school

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.220
and tell them, "There's a file in my filing cabinet. It's called cover work. Everything you need is in there."

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.500
Then you can hang up the phone, crawl back into bed and spend your day getting better,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.980
as opposed to spending your day worrying about what your students are actually going to do.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.520
The last thing I want to talk about is how big projects get done.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.080
Something like a cathedral doesn't just pop into existence. It gets built very slowly over time,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.080
one brick by one brick.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.500
It's a good idea to try and carve out at least twenty minutes, maybe thirty minutes, everyday

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.520
to work on a long term project that's beneficial to you and your career.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.740
For example, if there's a new computer skill that you need to learn, if you just spend twenty minutes a day

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.080
on it, you can make real progress on something like that over time.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.480
If you set aside daily time to work on your long term projects, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.860
you can accomplish. When you look back in six months or a year, you'll be amazed at what you've done.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.540
And lastly, don't forget why it is you became a teacher in the first place.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.540
The summer holidays.
