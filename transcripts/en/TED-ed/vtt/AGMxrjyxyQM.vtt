If you were to give a TED Talk (or if you already have), what ideas would you present?

00:00:05.244 --> 00:00:08.481
So, my advice to the next generation

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:12.047
is find situations where you get to give a TED Talk.

00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:13.818
It may not be an official TED Talk,

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:15.334
it may be at a TEDx,

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:17.982
it may be at another conference,

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:19.894
or it mayb e just an opportunity to give a talk,

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:22.360
and you should treat it as if it is a TED Talk.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.825
And the way it's become so cheap, so easy

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.589
to do high-quality video,

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.396
not only is it easy to video,

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.501
but you can put it in this infrastructure called YouTube

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:33.909
and other people can see it

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:34.980
(the architecture of the Internet

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.180
allows for this video to move)

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.219
that when you give an awesome talk,

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.247
it's a way to put part of you out there.

00:00:44.247 --> 00:00:46.513
And the process of preparing for a TED Talk,

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.154
I mean, it's like Mary Lou Retton

00:00:48.154 --> 00:00:49.546
getting a perfect ten in the Olympics.

00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:50.518
Now I'm dating myself,

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:51.850
but when I was little,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.264
this little lady just ran as hard as she could

00:00:54.264 --> 00:00:55.642
and went over a pole vault,

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:56.926
and it was just perfect.

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:58.730
And I think someone, Nadia Comaneci,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.476
did the same thing the generation before,

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:01.481
but I don't remember that one,

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:03.870
I don't know if I was even alive.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.259
But have a few situations where you do a ten

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.562
and share that with your network

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:12.318
and ask.

00:01:12.318 --> 00:01:16.875
And in the process of preparing for your talk,

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:18.682
ask for advice.

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:19.887
Go to tons of different people.

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:21.885
Go to people who have different perspectives

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:23.552
and get their feedback.

00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:25.894
And while part of the reason you want their feedback

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:27.264
is because you want to do a great talk,

00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:29.163
another part is you're building a rapport.

00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:30.701
You're building your board of advisors.

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:32.429
You're building your community.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.700
And by telling people what your talk's about,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.598
it also helps you shape yourself

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.044
and kind of determine what's important to you.
