00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.770
The problem with our code is that user
input gets put into a database query in

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.270
an unsafe way.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.020
Some text submitted in the forum
ended up being considered as

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.890
SQL code instead of as a text value.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.320
But there's another way to
do our query that's safe.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.940
When we execute a query,
we can put a %s in the query text, and

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.460
then after it,
a tuple parameter to the execute call.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.340
The database library will
substitute this into the query in

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.830
a way that's safe so
this problem will never happen again.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.550
Using what you've just learned,
you can now update forumdb.py to

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.010
execute insert queries safely
using query parameters.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.940
Test your work by checking that
you can now make posts with single

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.950
quotes in them and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.140
that the SQL injection attack query
doesn't delete the whole forum anymore.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.660
When you're done, press Submit,
then Continue to go on.
