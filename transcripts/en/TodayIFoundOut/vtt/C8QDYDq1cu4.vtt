00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.879
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the TodayIFoundOut Youtube channel.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.269
In the video today, we’re looking at why
it is that we drive on parkways and park on

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.490
driveways.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.470
To most people the fact that we drive on parkways
and park on driveways is rarely pondered upon.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.500
This only comes to mind when pointed out by
particularly cringe-worthy comedians, who

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.610
no doubt are also likely to muse on why the
Royal Mail service delivers "post" while the

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.930
U.S. Postal Service delivers "mail".

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.750
But once pointed out, it does all make you
wonder...

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.789
As it turns out, there’s a perfectly valid
explanation for why we drive on parkways and

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.879
park on driveways- the majority of words have
been around longer than cars and many have

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.789
seen their definitions evolve over time, as
parkways and driveways have likewise evolved.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.780
For example, if you went back to the 19th
century, you'd find one of the definitions

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.019
of “park” was:
To put strips of lawn down the centre or along

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.999
the side of (a street, the main streets of
a city)

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.069
Before this, the term had originally been
applied to enclosed private game preserves,

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.899
sometimes around large estates of the aristocracy
in Europe.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.620
For instance, in the Charter of Friðuuald
of Surrey written in 1260 it says the following,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.240
which I’m not even going to attempt to pronounce
correctly: "Bitwiene ðe shrubbes and Wine⁓briȝt

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.460
goinde adun norðriȝte binuðe ða parkes
gate."

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.660
Later, it began to refer to any well-kept
grounds around an estate, then to any well

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.180
landscaped grounds, whether private or public.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.730
Shortly before automobiles became a thing,
“parking” referred to the act of planting

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.380
trees, shrubbery and other assorted foliage
while the term “parking place” could generally

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.930
be understood to mean an area designated for
these various flora and fauna- essentially

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.930
an area where plants were put not for agricultural
usage, but simply to provide a pleasant place

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.180
to soak up nature.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.290
This is why the word “park”, even today,
can refer to a designated large, potentially

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.420
wooded, area filled with greenery and sometimes
wildlife.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.600
As for when the word “park” and its various
derivatives became associated with a stationary

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.250
vehicle, this unsurprisingly occurred in the
early 20th century when automobiles were becoming

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250
more popular.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.930
You see, prior to the mass adoption of cars,
for reasons that will soon become clear when

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.030
we explain the origin of the term "parkway",
the area around and sometimes in parking places

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.930
(areas of greenery) would occasionally be
used to temporarily store horses and the carriages

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.350
they pulled, if any.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.030
When cars began to appear on the roads, the
practise of using these same type of parking

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.900
places to store them naturally continued as
well.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.030
One of the first such references to such an
area specifically designated for cars occurred

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.239
in Lion's Share by Arnold Bennett, published
in 1916: "Audrey's motor-car...was waiting

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.959
in the automobile park outside the principal
gates."

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.519
As such, the term “parking place” came
to mean a place where one would store a car

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.849
when it wasn’t in use, regardless of whether
that area was particularly well landscaped

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.139
with plants or not.

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.819
(Additionally, sometime around the mid-20th
century “park” added a new definition

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.180
to mean the act of bringing a car to a complete
stop in such a designated area.)

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.090
Going back to the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, as previously alluded to, many

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.499
cities in the States began to construct parks
filled with trees and the like to contrast

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.700
the bleak, depressing walls of concrete that
cities were quickly becoming filled with.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.139
This provided citizens with a nice area to
relax and enjoy nature and was generally thought

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.239
to improve health.

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.389
In the late 19th century, a landscape architect
called Frederick Law Olmsted (the man who

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.969
designed Central Park in New York and helped
popularize the idea that people's homes should

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.069
have grass lawns, we’ll have more on this
in an upcoming video: Why Do We Have Grass

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.290
Lawns?) suggested that these types of parks
should connect the surrounding cities and

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.279
towns (in his original proposal connecting
suburban parks with parks in the cities)-

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:25.409
what he originally referred to as “pleasure
roads”.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.150
The initial idea behind these proposed thoroughfares
was that they’d be used for the 19th century

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.090
equivalent of commuting to and from the city,
whether via walking, riding a bike, horse,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.159
or in a carriage.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.700
To make the journey as pleasant as possible,
the roads would be “parked”, or flanked

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.579
with trees and greenery, to make them more
scenic.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.620
So, in a nutshell, they were narrow, exceptionally
long parks that allowed for relatively fast

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.010
travel between the suburbs and cities.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.379
As with parking places, these “parkways”,
as they came to be known, were later repurposed

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.760
and constructed mostly for use by automobiles-
becoming more about fast travel than the scenery.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.980
So the fact that you drive, not park, on a
parkway makes complete sense in this context.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.629
So what about the fact that we park on driveways?

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.450
According to the Oxford English Dictionary,
the definition of a driveway is as follows:

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.489
A private carriageway for a motor vehicle
alongside, in front of, or leading to a house,

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.720
garage, or other building; a drive.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.549
This definition has more or less been the
same for about a century and a half, dating

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.790
back to the first known instances of the word
being used in the 1870s.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.990
What has changed, however, is the size of
driveways.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.419
Back in the 19th century, a driveway in the
context of leading to someone's home was often

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.710
a much longer road than is typical today,
at least outside of cities where people had

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.710
driveways.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.360
While houses with smaller driveways existed,
the idea of them being used to store a car

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.840
did not because cars didn’t really exist
yet (at least not for most, more on this in

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.930
another upcoming video: The Husband and Wife
Team That Gave the World the First Car and

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.720
the First Road Trip That Saved It From Obscurity).

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.330
Driveways at this time were just used for
walking or riding a horse or carriage up to

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.460
your home, with the latter two generally stored
in a barn or stable if you had one, or a field

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.460
if not.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.760
Even when cars became a thing, driveways weren’t
necessarily used to store or “park” cars

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.220
because, again, there was often space off
the road, such as a barn, ample land, and

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.139
eventually dedicated garages.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.590
It was only as driveways became shorter and
shorter due to the rise of suburbia and cars

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.620
(and home ownership) became accessible to
the masses, who didn't necessarily own large

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.630
plots of land and trappings like buildings
to store cars, that car-sized driveways began

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.660
to be commonly used as a place to “park”
ones car.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.169
The rise in popularity of manicured grass
lawns in the late 1940s also made this even

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.620
more of a necessity so as not to ruin one's
lawn if you were to pull off the dedicated

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.700
tiny driveway.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.190
Today, many who live in a country with relatively
large plots of land still primarily use their

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.830
driveways for driving, rather than parking.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.389
But for everyone else in suburbia, outside
of a potential garage, one's driveway is probably

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.740
the only place on the property to park a car.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.599
So as with most things that seem to not make
sense when one lacks data on a given subject,

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.020
the fact that we park on driveways and drive
on parkways is perfectly reasonable once the

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:22.139
context is understood.
