00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.910
You know those people that can like flip their
elbows backwards or touch their thumb to their

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.140
forearm or whatever?

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.160
Body parts shouldn’t move like that!

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.830
These people are often referred to as being
“double-jointed” but that’s actually

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.830
a misnomer.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.840
They don’t really have twice as many joints
as the rest of us.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.230
This trait is formally called joint hypermobility.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.080
And it gives people's bones an extended range
of motion without any immediate pain or discomfort.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.339
To understand how hypermobility works, we’ve
gotta start with the structure of joints.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.999
Joints themselves are the points in the body
where two bones meet.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.050
Again you can’t have two joints in the same
spot.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.789
It just doesn’t make sense.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.489
Most joints are wrapped in ligaments, which
connect bones to other bones.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.820
These ligaments contain collagen, the main
structural protein of connective tissue throughout

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.820
the body!

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.500
But, some people’s collagen has a different
structure than most.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.800
These structural variations result in weakened,
less stable (and therefore more flexible)

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.800
ligaments.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.769
I.E. - joint hypermobility.

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.920
While many see this condition as a cool party
trick or an advantage for gymnasts or dancers,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.970
it can have some pretty crappy long-term side
effects.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.500
Joint hypermobility has been linked to increased
risks for chronic joint pain, asthma, irritable

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.430
bowel syndrome, but also surprisingly things
like anxiety and exaggerated fight-or-flight

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.850
responses, which can be debilitating.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.640
It has to do with blood flow -- I can’t
get into it all now, but it’s interesting.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.070
Joint hypermobility affects about 20% of the
population and is thought to be genetic.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.990
However, people can grow out of the condition
as their connective tissues fully develop.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.490
And those who don’t grow out of it can do
exercises to improve muscle strength and stability.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.940
So if you can bend your knees backwards or
other weird things, add a bit of trivia to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.110
your party sideshow, and remind your friend
that you’re not double-jointed, you’ve

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.710
just got hyperflexible ligaments and strange
collagen.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.250
No big.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.329
Our bodies do a ton of weird things… like
get goosebumps when we’re cold or scared.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.509
But why does this happen?

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.700
Find out from Tara in this video here.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.700
Are you hyperflexible?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.430
What’s your favorite party trick?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.830
Our associate producer likes to flip her elbow
upside-down, it’s disgusting.
