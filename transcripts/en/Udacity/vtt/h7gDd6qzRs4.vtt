00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.760
Okay. This problem can be a little tricky if you're

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.470
not used to figuring questions like this out, backwards. But

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.170
this is the best way to learn. Instead of giving

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.120
you all the numbers and have you plug them into equations,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.090
it's better to have you work backwards like this. 'because

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.100
you really get to see the patterns that emerge. So

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.960
let's take the easy part first. We know that if

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.834
we have no lactase non-persistent, no lactose intolerant people, zero, 0%.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:28.980
That represents our homozygous recessive condition. So

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.480
we gotta have zero in that group. There

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.360
are no people in our population that have that genotype. Okay, so now that means

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.290
we gotta split 1000 people between these

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.930
two genotypes, homozygous dominant and heterozygous. The only

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.850
scenario I can calculate that gives me this

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.560
particular allelic frequency is 500 in each group.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.060
So remember both of these are lactase

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.354
persistent, so together that's everybody 100% are

00:00:57.354 --> 00:01:00.990
lactase persistence. But we need a number

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.740
to get our allelic frequencies to 0.75 for

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.200
the dominant allele. And 0.25 for the recessive allele, so if we go to our

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.570
equation here and set it up toward backwards. 0.75 equals, we have the total

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.110
number of alleles, so how many total

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.910
dominant alleles are we dealing with here? This

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.870
would be X equals 1500. We've got to have 1500 dominant alleles in here. We do

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.770
the same thing with the recessive allele, we gotta have 500. Well, if we have to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.440
have 500 recessive alleles. The only way I'm

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.570
going to get 500, is in this heterozygous condition.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.860
'because I don't have any homozygous recessive. So

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.070
that means, to get 500 recessive alleles, I've gotta

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.720
have 500 heterozygous individuals so that I get

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.660
500 of these. 500 heterozygous individuals then makes up

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.265
500 of my dominants, as well. I need

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:59.783
1,500 total. So subtract 500 from 1,500. I need

00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:03.960
1,000 more alleles. 500 in this box takes care

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.690
of 1,000, right? Because I get 500 of both.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.990
500 of the first dominant and 500 of the second

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.030
dominant. Easy, huh? Or hard, depending on your perspective. I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.240
really hope you understand this. If you don't, if you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.460
have trouble, it's okay. There's not a lot of this course

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.970
that's going to deal with too much allelic frequencies. But I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.850
do want to focus on it a bit more for the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.240
rest of the lesson. If you can really get a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.980
grasp of these allelic frequencies, you're going to have a whole new

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.740
appreciation for understanding gene flow, genetic

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.150
drift, and looking at huge populations of

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.010
individuals. And seeing how alleles travel

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.650
through. And can be shaped by evolution.
