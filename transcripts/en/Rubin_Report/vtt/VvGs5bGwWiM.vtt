1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.700
Well Dave and I are here today to talk about Patrion.
And so I'll start.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.350
We've been engaged in lengthy series of email exchanges with all of the people

3
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:14.970
in our network,
and no one is happy at all with what's been happening.

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.030
And so we've been determining what our options are and we looked at subscribes

5
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:24.480
to our,
but it looks like paypal decided to cut funding out from them.

6
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:29.010
And so it doesn't look like moving to an alternative provider and an alternative

7
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.040
commercial provider that's out of our bailiwick,

8
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.130
out of our control is going to be viable.
So Dave,

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.500
why don't you describe what we talked about today?

10
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.660
<v 1>Yeah.
Well first I think we should just make it very clear for everybody how</v>

11
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.690
significant what happened to Carl Benjamin Sargon of Akkad is it doesn't matter

12
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:51.390
what you think of him or whether you agree with him or any of that stuff.

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.940
The banning of him for doing something that was not on the patrion platform that

14
00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:00.570
wasn't even done on his channel because of a word he said,

15
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:04.350
where he was using the word against the,
uh,

16
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.320
the alt right or the Neo Nazis or whatever you want to call them,

17
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.910
is a massive move of that line of what's acceptable.

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.050
Now there's all sorts of debates we can have and we've had them of what lines

19
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:17.760
should be,
if there should be lines at all,

20
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.980
but the fact that this guy got booted with no chance of recourse with no
warning,

21
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.330
just just like that.

22
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.990
It's just an extension of everything else that we've all been talking.

23
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.581
<v 0>I'm also,</v>

24
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:33.410
and also given that it's also the case that he didn't break patrons,

25
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:34.490
rules of engagement,

26
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.230
the ones that they stated and that Conti had talked to you about the fact that

27
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:43.250
that wasn't going to happen and that Patrion hasn't responded well to this.

28
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.510
<v 1>Well,
look,
look,</v>

29
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.530
Jack Conti came into my studio in my home and said he,

30
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.800
he said a phrase that I had never heard before.
Maybe you had heard it before.

31
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.640
Manifest observable behaviors.
So you had never even heard that phrase before,

32
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:59.580
right?
I thought,
I thought maybe this was just something that went past me.
Okay.

33
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.340
Now of course manifest observable behavior,
mob mob,
you can,
I mean that's,

34
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.980
there's a real,
there's a real there.
But,

35
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:12.030
but so the point was that it had to be about behavior and then in their terms of

36
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.120
service,
it also had to be about what was happening on platform.

37
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:20.121
So every firewall here of what would have been acceptable patrion failed.

38
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.820
And they've put us in a position where,
look,
I told,

39
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.080
I called you last Saturday and when this was really catching fire and I said,

40
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.410
you know,
Patrion is about 65 to 70% of my red that's,
I have a company now with,

41
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.740
with employees,
you know,
full timers,
part timers.

42
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.100
I was actually considering deleting it right then and there,

43
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.970
which no one in their right mind would do.
No business person would do.
And I've,

44
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.720
I've taken big risks in the past.
You know,
before I was on Patrion,

45
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.010
we were at ROTC.
I,
me and my producer and my director,
we all quit our jobs,

46
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:52.950
lost their health insurance all day to join patriots.
So I'm not,

47
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.740
I like taking risks.
But then I realized,
all right,

48
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:58.990
we have to figure out a plan and that's exactly why we're doing this,
right?
Yep.

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.370
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
and we would've moved faster,
but we,
well,</v>

50
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.330
and I did set up a subscribes to our account,

51
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.550
although I never quite finished setting it up,

52
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.440
partly because subscribes to our seem to fall apart almost immediately under

53
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.750
attack.
And,

54
00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:16.630
and also it wasn't obvious that I also read their terms of agreement and it

55
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.810
wasn't obvious that we weren't going to be just in exactly the same situation

56
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:20.610
again.

57
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.950
And there's only so many mistakes you can make before the mistakes start to

58
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.930
become fatal.
So we want it to come up with a serious and,
and,
and,
and,
and,

59
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.970
and stable solution.
And I've been working on for months,
literally for months,

60
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.050
it's been six months.

61
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:40.051
I've been working on a system to allow authors and other people who engage

62
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:46.441
publicly on intellectual issues to interact more effectively with their readers

63
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.050
and viewers.
And listeners,

64
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.330
and it occurred to me this week that with a bit of modification that that could

65
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:58.600
serve exactly the function that we're hoping would serve.

66
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.600
So what we're going to try to do as fast as we possibly can is to set the system

67
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:06.610
up on a subscriber model that's analogous to patron.

68
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.530
It'll have a bunch of additional features,

69
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.470
which I don't want to talk about right now,
and I don't want to over promise,

70
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:15.250
but the system is,
is because the system is new,

71
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.350
but we're going to try to get that rolled out as fast as we possibly can.
So,

72
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.190
and we have a number of people who are interested in hypothetically interested

73
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:27.670
in moving their,
their subscription service over to it.

74
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:32.590
Dave and I are very seriously planning to do this as soon as we can do it in an

75
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.780
intelligent way.
And so,
yeah,

76
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.720
<v 1>you know,
by the way,
one of the interesting things here,</v>

77
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.930
we haven't talked about this,
but I'm guessing your experiences just like mine,

78
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.560
the amount of emails that I have received and of course tweets and everything

79
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:48.370
else,
but most of the emails from developers,
from investors,

80
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.170
from regular people,
from engineers,
I mean just anyone going,
this is the one,

81
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:56.800
because you know the issue with all of these free speech things is it's like you

82
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.820
don't want to swing too early before you realize that the problems got into

83
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.300
critical Matt as,
but then most likely you're going to swing too late.

84
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:07.330
The blinds will have used so far that we may be on the outside of them.

85
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:12.040
And that's why this one I think was so interesting because Carl,
you know,

86
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.903
years ago,

87
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.210
five or six years ago when I started waking up to what was going on with the

88
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.400
left obviously,
and then all of the free speech stuff,

89
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.530
everyone said you've got to talk to Sargon of Akkad.
He's the guy.

90
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.970
So this is the guy that's been ahead of all of it.

91
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.270
<v 0>Sorry,
go on to was like,
he was big.</v>

92
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.470
He was very helpful to me when I was first under attack,
you know,

93
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.320
and he's a brave guy and,
and so,

94
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:38.220
and it's a real mistake what patron has done to him.
And,
and,
and as I said,

95
00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:41.160
everybody in our network is extremely upset about it.

96
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:45.000
Like we've been sending emails back and forth while probably with 30 or 40

97
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:47.280
people.
And so as Dave said earlier,

98
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.150
we wanted to make this video today to let everybody that we're communicating

99
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:56.151
with know that we have not been sleeping on this front man.

100
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.680
People are trying to figure out what to do.
So this stops happening and,

101
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.450
and so,
and we have a good plan and we're going to try to implement it as soon as

102
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:10.130
possible.
So I would ask everybody who's listening to be,
you know,

103
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.270
reasonably patient.

104
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:14.570
Imagine that this will take somewhere between a week and a month to sort out

105
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:15.530
properly.
Oh,
we're,

106
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.850
we're going to try to get something up in the next week hopefully before

107
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:21.740
Christmas if we can't manage that,
you know,

108
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.870
cause when you implement something like this,

109
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.440
there are technical complications that might emerge that you don't foresee.

110
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.600
But I don't want people to get the impression that we're taking this lightly or

111
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.300
lying down and that we're not looking for a,
uh,

112
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.330
a permanent alternative because we are,

113
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:42.860
and I think we can come up with a better alternative.
That's the plan.

114
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.220
<v 1>Yeah,
that,
that's exactly what I would say.</v>

115
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:48.580
I would just add that it was like we were,
we were waiting for a moment.
You know,

116
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:52.690
we've watched these doors slowly closing on us.
All of us,
whether it's Twitter,

117
00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:55.300
whether it's Facebook,
who's getting banned,
who's getting shadow,

118
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:57.280
banned payment processing,
everything else.

119
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.780
And we are taking this as seriously as possible.
Of course,
you know,
Jordan,

120
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:04.240
who's working harder than anyone on the face of the planet.

121
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.130
Somehow you managed to also partly build a platform over the course of the past

122
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.450
year.
In the middle of all of that,

123
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.141
<v 0>I knew that this,</v>

124
00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:14.470
we knew that this was lurking in the background and that this was going to be a

125
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.520
problem.
Dave,

126
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:20.500
you've spent lots of time talking to investors and developers about building

127
00:07:20.501 --> 00:07:25.501
alternatives to these platforms that seem to be willing to throw their weight

128
00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:27.940
around in an increasingly arbitrary manner.

129
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:29.370
But it's not like it's a simple thing to

130
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.990
<v 1>do.
People want somebody to say enough is enough.</v>

131
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:36.080
And I mentioned this in a live stream I did the other day,
but you know,

132
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:40.190
I've watched my patrion drop.
We've lost around 600 patrons,

133
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:42.800
I think about 5,000 bucks a month.
But in a weird way,

134
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.190
I've actually been inspired by it because I'm watching.
Yeah,

135
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:47.450
great for themselves.

136
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:50.180
So it's like on one hand people are emailing me and they're saying,

137
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:53.900
I'm dropping my patronage and I'm really pissed and it's not about you and I

138
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:56.600
want to support you.
And on the other hand,
my business side is going,

139
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.260
that's not great.
But you know,
but we will,
we will solve this thing.

140
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.640
<v 0>I have nothing way.</v>

141
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.560
I've lost a thousand subscribers and I feel exactly the same way.
It's like,
well,

142
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:08.470
they're telling Patrion to go to hell.
And you know,
it's,

143
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.530
it's not so good for me on the financial front,

144
00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:14.340
although that's not too big a catastrophe at the moment.
They're,

145
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.650
they're taking the right stand and,
and encouraging us,
let's say,

146
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:21.480
or encouraging someone to do something about this.
So anyways,

147
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.520
<v 1>what I like,
I like what you said.</v>

148
00:08:23.521 --> 00:08:26.100
If we can just ask you guys to be reasonably patients,

149
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.000
we're talking to everybody that you can think of and some people that you can't

150
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:31.770
think of.
We're going to fix this.

151
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.440
<v 0>Yeah.
Well we're going to,
or at least we're going to do our best to fix it.</v>

152
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.740
There's going to be some bumps along the way,
man,
because we're now,

153
00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:40.510
we have to speed this process up to,

154
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:43.750
so you'll have to consider this a Beta version,
but at minimum,

155
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:44.910
we hope to provide,
uh,

156
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:50.190
an easy way of switching to a new subscription service within the next very

157
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:51.304
short while.

158
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.610
And so and thank you everyone for your continued patients and your continued

159
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:01.710
support and your attention and your thoughts and your reaction to all of this.

160
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:05.880
And,
and it's,
it's very much appreciate it and it does help us,

161
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.220
I would say maintain motivation to continue doing this constantly.
You know,

162
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.400
the fact that I have all these patrons subscribed certainly is one of the

163
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.750
reasons that I tried to put my youtube channel.

164
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.290
I wouldn't say first and foremost because it's had to take a backseat to this

165
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:26.790
lecture tour,
but men,
it's way the hell up there on my priority list.
Absolutely.

166
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.940
And it gives us all sorts of flexibility to do all sorts of things.

167
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:32.790
It gave me a little bit of flexibility to join you on this tour.

168
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:36.870
So I'm incredibly humbled and appreciative of everybody that does that.

169
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.130
Fjord and I will,

170
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:41.790
I will see you in a couple of days in west Palm beach eating steak.

171
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.980
I will take you out for a steak.
Good,
good,
good.

172
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:46.530
Well I found a good steak place here so we'll will,

173
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.120
I'm looking forward to seeing you,
Dave.

174
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.130
