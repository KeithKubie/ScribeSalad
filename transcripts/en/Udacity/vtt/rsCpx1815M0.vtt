00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.917
When x = 4, 7 + 3(x- 2) is 13.

00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:10.079
When we plug 4 in instead of x,

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:15.443
we are left with
the expression 7 + 3 (4- 2).

00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:21.430
We should evaluate what's in
the parentheses first, 4- 2 = 2.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.377
So our new expression becomes 7 + 3(2).

00:00:26.377 --> 00:00:30.664
Again, following the order of
operations, we should multiply 3 by 2.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.092
3 times 2 is 6.

00:00:33.092 --> 00:00:36.790
Finally, add 7 + 6 together to get 13.
