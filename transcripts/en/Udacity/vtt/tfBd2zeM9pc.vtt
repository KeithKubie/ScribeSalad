00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.530
The right choice is the third one, as

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.025
you may have guessed. The operating system is

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:11.280
multiplexing the CPU among the competing applications. You

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.090
may have multiple cores, but you don't have one

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.810
core for every application that is currently running

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.990
on the CPU. It may be that you've

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.230
only have one core. Or, exactly one CPU.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.740
In which case, it is the operating system that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.850
is multiplexing these applications to run, at

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.010
different points of time on the CPU.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.100
And that's what is giving you this

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.400
appearance as though, there are multiple programs

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.630
running concurrently on the processor. But they're

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.352
not running concurrently. It is just that

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:44.872
they're being multiplexed, so that its appearance

00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:47.160
as though, they're all running in parallel.
