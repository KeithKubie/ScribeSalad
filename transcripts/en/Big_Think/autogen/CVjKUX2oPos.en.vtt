about other Wars so I believe that this
 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.310
about other Wars so I believe that this
country has to be defended and there are

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320
country has to be defended and there are
 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.219

was such a just war but that the Vietnam
War was not and I thought that we

War was not and I thought that we
 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.550
War was not and I thought that we
shouldn't be in it and I was march in

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560
shouldn't be in it and I was march in
 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.950
shouldn't be in it and I was march in
the various demonstrations against it I

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.300
believed it was wrong and ultimately a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310

country thought it was wrong and they
 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.440
country thought it was wrong and they
stopped it with their marches
