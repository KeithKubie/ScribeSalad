00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.170
In case you haven't
noticed, I've

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.340
gotten somewhat
obsessed with doing

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.460
as many proofs of the
Pythagorean theorem

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.610
as I can do.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.220
So let's do one more.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.070
And like how all of
these proofs start,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.750
let's construct ourselves
a right triangle.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.120
So I'm going to construct it
so that its hypotenuse sits

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.600
on the bottom.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.500
So that's the hypotenuse
of my right triangle.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.940
Try to draw it as
big as possible,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.260
so that we have
space to work with.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.470
So that's going to
be my hypotenuse.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.680
And then let's say
that this is the longer

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.390
side that's not the hypotenuse.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.260
We can have two
sides that are equal.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.770
But I'll just draw it so that
it looks a little bit longer.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.010
Let's call that side length a.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.080
And then let's draw this
side right over here.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.620
It has to be a right triangle.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.110
So maybe it goes
right over there.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.960
That's side of length b.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.560
Let me extend the
length a a little bit.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.090
So it definitely looks
like a right triangle.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.020
And this is our 90-degree angle.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.850
So the first thing
that I'm going to do

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.170
is take this triangle
and then rotate

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.310
it counterclockwise
by 90 degrees.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.100
So if I rotate it
counterclockwise by 90 degrees,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.270
I'm literally just going
to rotate it like that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.840
and draw another completely
congruent version of this one.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.120
So I'm going to rotate
it by 90 degrees.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.580
And if I did that,
the hypotenuse

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.920
would then sit straight up.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
So I'm going to do my best
attempt to draw it almost

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.800
to scale as much as
I can eyeball it.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.160
This side of length a will
now look something like this.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.080
It'll actually be parallel
to this over here.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.670
So let me see how
well I can draw it.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.710
So this is the side of length a.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.870
And if we cared, this
would be 90 degrees.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.880
The rotation between
the corresponding sides

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.796
are just going to be 90
degrees in every case.

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:55.070
That's going to be 90 degrees.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.190
That's going to be 90 degrees.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.420
Now, let me draw side b.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.630
So it's going to look
something like that

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.410
or the side that's length b.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.410
And this and the right
angle is now here.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.110
So all I did is I rotated this
by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.980
Now, what I want to do is
construct a parallelogram.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.280
I'm going to construct a
parallelogram by essentially--

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.440
and let me label.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.310
So this is height
c right over here.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.820
Let me do that white color.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.480
This is height c.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.560
Now, what I want to do
is go from this point

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.210
and go up c as well.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.070
Now, so this is
height c as well.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.030
And what is this length?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.930
What is the length over here
from this point to this point

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.500
going to be?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.900
Well, a little clue is
this is a parallelogram.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.360
This line right
over here is going

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.850
to be parallel to this line.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.460
It's maintained
the same distance.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.830
And since it's traveling
the same distance

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.690
in the x direction or in
the horizontal direction

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.460
and the vertical direction, this
is going to be the same length.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.110
So this is going
to be of length a.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.880
Now, the next question
I have for you

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.410
is, what is the area of this
parallelogram that I have just

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.180
constructed?

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.320
Well, to think about that, let's
redraw this part of the diagram

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.500
so that the parallelogram
is sitting on the ground.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.240
So this is length a.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.530
This is length c.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.540
This is length c.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.010
And if you look at this
part right over here,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.980
it gives you a clue.

00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:51.350
I'll use this green color.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.570
The height of the parallelogram
is given right over here.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.920
This side is
perpendicular to the base.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.900
So the height of the
parallelogram is a as well.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.430
So what's the area?

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.230
Well, the area of
a parallelogram

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.320
is just the base
times the height.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.070
So the area of this
parallelogram right over here

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.749
is going to be a squared.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.550
Now, let's do the same thing.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.050
But let's rotate our
original right triangle.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.430
Let's rotate it the other way.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.380
So let's rotate it
90 degrees clockwise.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.850
And this time, instead of
pivoting on this point,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.530
we're going to pivot on
that point right over there.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.050
So what are we going to get?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.750
So the side of length
c if we rotate it

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.217
like that, it's going to
end up right over here.

00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:48.300
I'll try to draw it as
close to scale as possible.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.350
So that side has length c.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.760
Now, the side of
length of b is going

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.884
to pop out and look
something like this.

00:04:57.884 --> 00:04:59.300
It's going to be
parallel to that.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.130
This is going to
be a right angle.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.310
So let me draw it like that.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.980
That looks pretty good.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.920
And then the side of length
a is going to be out here.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.880
So that's a.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.460
And then this right
over here is b.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.590
And I wanted to
do that b in blue.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.790
So let me do the b in blue.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.710
And then this right
angle once we've rotated

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.770
is just sitting right over here.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.250
Now, let's do the same exercise.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.910
Let's construct a
parallelogram right over here.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.420
So this is height c.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.570
This is height c as well.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.350
So by the same logic we used
over here, if this length is b,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.830
this length is b as well.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.300
These are parallel lines.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.950
We're going the same distance
in the horizontal direction.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.080
We're rising the same in
the vertical direction.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.920
We know that because
they're parallel.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.360
So this is length b down here.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.390
This is length b up there.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.890
Now, what is the area of this
parallelogram right over there?

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.870
What is the area of that
parallelogram going to be?

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.910
Well, once again to
help us visualize it,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.840
we can draw it sitting flat.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.470
So this is that side.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.980
Then you have another
side right over here.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.770
They both have length b.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.560
And you have the
sides of length c.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.480
So that's c.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.460
That's c.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.510
What is its height?

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.400
Well, you see it
right over here.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.220
Its height is length b as well.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.220
It gives us right there.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.490
We know that this is 90 degrees.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.450
We did a 90-degree rotation.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.590
So this is how we
constructed the thing.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.960
So given that, the
area of a parallelogram

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.690
is just the base
times the height.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.670
The area of this
parallelogram is b squared.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:00.150
So now, things are starting
to get interesting.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.420
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to copy and paste

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.200
this part right over here,
because this is, in my mind,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.830
the most interesting
part of our diagram.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.530
Let me see how well
I can select it.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.360
So let me select this
part right over here.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.120
So let me copy.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.980
And then I'm going
to scroll down.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.140
And then let me paste it.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.230
So this diagram that we've
constructed right over here,

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.990
it's pretty clear what the area
of it is, the combined diagram.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.690
And let me delete
a few parts of it.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.450
I want to do that in black
so that it cleans it up.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.090
So let me clean this
thing up, so we really

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.490
get the part that
we want to focus on.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:56.070
So cleaning that up and cleaning
this up, cleaning this up right

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.760
over there.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.470
And actually, let me delete
this right down here as well,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.850
although we know that
this length was c.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.734
And actually, I'll draw
it right over here.

00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:10.400
This was from our
original construction.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.490
We know that this length is c.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.650
We know this height is c.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.600
We know this down here is c.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.780
But my question
for you is, what is

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:25.420
the area of this combined shape?

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.090
Well, it's just a
squared plus b squared.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.180
Let me write that down.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.270
The area is just a
squared plus b squared,

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.530
the area of those
two parallelograms.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:42.070
Now, how can we maybe
rearrange pieces of this shape

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.070
so that we can express
it in terms of c?

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.790
Well, it might have
jumped out at you

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.890
when I drew this
line right over here.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.900
I want to do that in white.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.230
We know that this part right
over here is of length c.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.456
This comes from our
original construction.

00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:03.955
Whoops.

00:09:03.955 --> 00:09:05.660
I lost my diagram.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.510
This is of length c.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.310
That's of length c.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.360
And then this right over
here is of length c.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.250
And so what we could do is take
this top right triangle, which

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.960
is completely congruent to
our original right triangle,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.420
and shift it down.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.820
So remember, the entire area,
including this top right

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.310
triangle, is a squared
plus b squared.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.257
But we're excluding
this part down here,

00:09:25.257 --> 00:09:26.590
which was our original triangle.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.620
But what happens
if we take that?

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.790
So let me actually cut.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.900
And then let me paste it.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.480
And all I'm doing is I'm
moving that triangle down here.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.010
So now, it looks like this.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.470
So I've just rearranged the area
that was a squared b squared.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.300
So this entire area
of this entire square

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.750
is still a squared
plus b squared.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.880
a squared is this entire
area right over here.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.350
It was before a parallelogram.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.530
I just shifted that top part
of the parallelogram down.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:04.302
b squared is this entire
area right over here.

00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:06.135
Well, what's this going
to be in terms of c?

00:10:06.135 --> 00:10:11.080
Well, we know that this entire
thing is a c by c square.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.920
So the area in terms
of c is just c squared.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.980
So a squared plus b squared
is equal to c squared.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.450
And we have, once again,
proven the Pythagorean theorem.
