00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.468
- We've spent several
videos now getting familiar

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:04.488
with the Lorentz transformations.

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:06.828
What I want to do now, instead
of thinking of what X prime

00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:09.108
and C T prime is in terms of X and C T,

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.748
I wanna think about, what
is the change in X prime

00:00:11.748 --> 00:00:14.228
and the change in C T prime
going to be in terms of

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:16.188
change in X and change in C T.

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.188
And we'll see it's just
going to involve some

00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:21.448
fairly straight-forward
algebraic manipulation.

00:00:21.448 --> 00:00:22.988
So, let's think about it.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.968
Change in X prime is going to be

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:29.118
X prime final minus

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:33.100
X prime initial.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.110
Well, X prime final,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.810
let me just pick a
suitable color for that,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.170
X prime final is going to be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.170
gamma times X final

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:49.293
minus beta times C T final.

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:51.623
All I did is use this formula up here.

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:53.743
If I want to figure out my final X prime,

00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:57.243
I'm just going to think of
my final X and my final C T.

00:00:57.243 --> 00:00:59.483
So, that's that.

00:00:59.483 --> 00:01:04.163
And from that, I'm going to
subtract the initial X prime.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:07.943
Well, X prime initial is just going to be,

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.601
let me get another color here,

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:14.301
Lorentz factor gamma times X initial

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:18.941
minus beta times C T initial.

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:22.901
So, now, let's see, we
can factor out the gamma,

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:24.861
so this is going to be equal to,

00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:26.561
and I'll do it in my color for gamma.

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:28.401
If we factor out the
gamma, we're gonna get

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:32.919
gamma times, we're gonna have X final,

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:35.059
let me do this in a,

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:38.299
so we have, do that in white actually.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.259
We're gonna have X final,
and then if we distribute

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.567
this negative sign, minus X initial,

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:49.647
and then, let's see,

00:01:49.647 --> 00:01:53.507
if we distribute this negative
sign, well, I don't want

00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:56.087
to skip too many steps
here, so that's that.

00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:58.586
And then we're going to have

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:03.076
negative beta C T final,

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:06.941
negative beta C T final,

00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:10.621
and then we have plus, we
distributed this negative,

00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:12.874
plus beta C T initial

00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:17.193
plus beta C T initial

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:19.580
and so what can we do here,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.310
well this, that's just
going to be change in X.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.159
So I can rewrite this as being equal to

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.049
gamma times change in X...

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.860
Let me factor out a negative beta.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.958
So I'l say, minus beta times,

00:02:50.698 --> 00:02:55.447
well then you're going to have C T final

00:02:57.957 --> 00:03:01.186
minus C T initial.

00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:04.092
And what's C T final minus C T initial?

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:06.952
I think I'm skipping
too many steps already.

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:09.532
Well that's just going
to be change in C T.

00:03:09.532 --> 00:03:13.053
So we get, this is all
going to be equal to

00:03:13.053 --> 00:03:16.432
gamma, our Lorentz
factor, times change in X

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:24.680
minus beta times change in C T.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.990
And since C isn't changing,
it could also be viewed

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.510
as C times change in T, either way.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.610
So, there you have it.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.750
Notice, it takes almost
the exact same form.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.590
X prime is equal to gamma
times X minus beta C T

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.910
and change in X prime is going to be gamma

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.890
times change in X minus
beta time change in C T.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.831
And, I'm not going to do it in this video,

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.558
but you can make the exact same algebraic

00:03:52.558 --> 00:03:55.239
argument for your change in C T prime,

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.519
as you'll see and I encourage
you to do this on your own,

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.498
change in C T prime, which
you could also view as,

00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:06.999
since C isn't changing,
C times delta T prime,

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.698
these are equivalent,
is going to be equal to

00:04:13.898 --> 00:04:18.898
gamma times change in C T

00:04:20.448 --> 00:04:25.004
minus beta times change in X,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.280
and I encourage you,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.100
right after this video,
actually do this one too.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.940
Delta X prime is going to be X prime final

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.000
minus X prime initial and
then do what I just did here,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.300
just a little algebraic manipulation.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.960
You can make the same
exact argument over here

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.220
to get to the result
that I just wrote down.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.960
You see, well our change
in C T prime is going to be

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.500
C T prime final minus C T
prime initial and then you can

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.200
substitute with this, do
a little bit of algebraic

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.940
manipulation and you'll
get that right over there.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.360
And the whole reason I'm doing this is,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.760
well now, we can think in terms of change

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.360
in the coordinates, which will allow us to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.920
think about what velocities would be

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.500
in the different frames of reference,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.087
which is going to be pretty neat.
