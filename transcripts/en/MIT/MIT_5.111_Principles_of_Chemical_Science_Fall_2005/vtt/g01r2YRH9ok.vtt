00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.759
All right.
We have a few more PowerPoint

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.367
things before I am going to
attempt using the board.

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:24.339
Again, we are in the transition
metal unit.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.948
And today we are going to
introduce something called

00:00:27.948 --> 00:00:31.841
crystal field theory.
And this is in Chapter 16 in

00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:34.471
your book.
Let me just tell you about two

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.168
different theories.
Again, chemistry is an

00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:39.601
experimental science.
We collect data,

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:43.678
and then we try to come up with
theories that explain the data,

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:46.046
so the theories are not sort of
100%.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.597
And some are more simple and
some are more complicated,

00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:51.767
to try to explain what we
observe.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:55.582
And some of these theories,
although they are pretty simple

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:59.659
approximations of what is really
going on, do a pretty good job

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.000
of explaining the things that we
are observing.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.560
All right.
There are two different kinds

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.434
of theories that you will hear
about with transition metals.

00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:14.111
You will hear about crystal
field theory and ligand field

00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:15.752
theory.
And so these were,

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:19.494
again, developed to explain
certain types of properties of

00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:22.318
coordination complexes of
transition metals.

00:01:22.318 --> 00:01:25.797
There is observed data.
And then people tried to think

00:01:25.797 --> 00:01:30.000
about how you could rationalize
what was observed.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.193
The basic idea behind these
theories is that if you have

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:37.701
your metal ion with its given
oxidation number,

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.361
and it is in the center of a
coordination sphere,

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:45.479
the energy levels of the
d-orbitals for that particular

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.054
metal are going to be altered
when ligands are bound compared

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:54.172
to sort of a free system.
The binding of ligands around

00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:58.671
that metal, where there are
those d-orbitals associated with

00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:02.941
that metal, is going to have an
effect and create special

00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:06.446
properties.
Crystal field theory,

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:09.614
which is what we are going to
be talking about,

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:11.818
is based on an ionic
description.

00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:15.674
Basically you are going to be
considering your ligands as

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:18.498
negative point charges,
a negative charge.

00:02:18.498 --> 00:02:22.217
And you are going to ask the
question, is that negative

00:02:22.217 --> 00:02:24.490
charge pointed toward a
d-orbital?

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.484
If so, that will be repulsive.
And that is going to have an

00:02:28.484 --> 00:02:31.916
effect.
Ligand field theory includes

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:34.584
covalent, as well as ionic
descriptions.

00:02:34.584 --> 00:02:38.417
It is a more powerful theory
and it can describe things a

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:41.633
little bit better,
but we don't have enough time

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:44.439
to cover it here.
If you are interested in

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.518
transition metals,
you will probably go on and

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:51.624
take another chemistry course
called 5.03, which is inorganic

00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:53.267
chemistry.
At this point,

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:56.825
we are just going to be doing
the more simple theory,

00:02:56.825 --> 00:03:01.000
which just considers the ionic
descriptions.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.805
But it does pretty well.
You can explain some things

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:09.283
with it, but you should be aware
that you can do a little bit

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:13.313
better with another theory.
You should just be aware of

00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:17.194
that, that this is really the
most simplistic kind of

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:21.447
representation or theory to
explain some of the properties

00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:24.134
of coordination complexes.
All right.

00:03:24.134 --> 00:03:28.686
All of these theories require
you to think in three dimensions

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:32.851
about d-orbitals.
Because they are all about the

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:35.936
interactions with ligands,
either covalent or ionic

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:38.342
interactions,
but they are all about the

00:03:38.342 --> 00:03:41.119
interactions of ligands with
those d-orbitals.

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.821
I mentioned last time that you
need to know the shapes of the

00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:48.153
d-orbitals and you need to be
able to draw them to some

00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:50.868
limited ability.
We went through the names of

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:53.953
the d-orbitals last time.
Let's just review it now,

00:03:53.953 --> 00:03:57.408
because we are going to be
talking about this more today.

00:03:57.408 --> 00:04:03.131
What is this guy up here?
That is d z squared.

00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.262
And here is our reference
frame.

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:08.888
z is up here,
y along here,

00:04:08.888 --> 00:04:14.040
and x is coming out toward you.
What about this one?

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.595
d x squared minus y squared.
Down here,

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:21.818
what is that one?
d xy.

00:04:21.818 --> 00:04:27.676
The amplitudes are 45
degrees off the axes in the

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:31.891
x,y-plane.
Over here we have d yz,

00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:34.641
so now we are along
z.

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:38.767
And the last one is...?
d xz over here.

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:42.120
All right.
Those are the five d-orbitals

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.277
that we will be talking about a
lot in the next few lectures.

00:04:47.277 --> 00:04:49.942
All right.
Let me just show you.

00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:52.693
This is really
three-dimensional,

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:57.765
so let's take a look at the
three-dimensional image of these

00:04:57.765 --> 00:05:02.342
d-orbitals.
This is d z squared.

00:05:02.342 --> 00:05:05.138
This isn't in your handout,
obviously.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.085
It is a movie,
but you can sort of get a

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:11.712
little better sense of the three
dimensions here.

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:14.508
All right.
The movie first rotates the

00:05:14.508 --> 00:05:17.229
axes.
I am not sure why it does that.

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.629
And then it is going to rotate
the d-orbitals.

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:25.163
You can see the doughnut in the
middle with the hole and that

00:05:25.163 --> 00:05:30.000
the maximum amplitudes are along
the z-axis here.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.149
This is d z squared.
And the orbitals are right

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:38.401
along the z axis,
which is important.

00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:43.732
Now let's take a look at d x
squared minus y squared.

00:05:43.732 --> 00:05:46.984
The important point here is

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:52.495
that the orbitals are directly
on axis, and the axes are the x

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:55.566
and the y.
You can see how they are

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:59.000
directly along those axes.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.367
All right.
Here is the next one.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:12.643
Here we have d xy.
And now the orbitals are not

00:06:12.643 --> 00:06:16.156
along the axes.
They are 45 degrees in between,

00:06:16.156 --> 00:06:19.363
so they are not along,
they are in between,

00:06:19.363 --> 00:06:23.945
which is the key point for this
d-orbital in terms of what we

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:27.000
are going to be talking about.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.518
Now we have some amplitude
along the z-axis.

00:06:35.518 --> 00:06:38.954
We have z and x.
Again, the orbitals are 45

00:06:38.954 --> 00:06:41.000
degrees off the axes.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.199
And we have one more.
Now we have d yz,

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:03.000
again 45 degrees off the axes.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.818
All right.
Now, you should have these sort

00:07:10.818 --> 00:07:13.843
of orbitals floating around
inside your head.

00:07:13.843 --> 00:07:18.037
And, as we talk about bringing
ligands in toward the orbitals,

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:22.093
you can think about how those
ligands are coming in and what

00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:24.431
orbitals they are going to be
near.

00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:28.281
Again, crystal field theory is
just considering the ionic

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:32.174
interactions.
And it is really considering

00:07:32.174 --> 00:07:35.048
the ligands as negative point
charges.

00:07:35.048 --> 00:07:39.631
And so negative point charges
are going to be repulsive with

00:07:39.631 --> 00:07:43.048
the d-orbitals.
d-orbitals don't like it when

00:07:43.048 --> 00:07:47.165
you have these negatively
charged ligand coming in and

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:50.271
being near.
It will be repulsive near the

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:53.145
d-orbital.
This is just another way to

00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:56.563
sort of draw that.
And we have our octahedral

00:07:56.563 --> 00:07:59.126
frame.
Here we are talking about a

00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:04.133
octahedral geometry.
And we can think about how

00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:08.647
ligands are going to be
affecting the d-orbital in these

00:08:08.647 --> 00:08:12.176
various places.
If you had ligands on all of

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:17.182
these positions in an octahedral
arrangement around the metal.

00:08:17.182 --> 00:08:21.860
And you can think of these
ligands as these negative point

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.732
charges.
And so this is just another

00:08:24.732 --> 00:08:29.000
depiction.
Here are the d-orbitals again.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.537
It is a slightly different
x,y,z frame, but not too much

00:08:32.537 --> 00:08:35.045
different.
And so here are our orbitals.

00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:38.582
And these little green dots
represent the point charges.

00:08:38.582 --> 00:08:42.441
What we will be thinking about
today is the effect of ligands

00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.271
being close to the d-orbitals.
You see, here,

00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:49.323
there is a ligand that is quite
close up here and one down here.

00:08:49.323 --> 00:08:52.153
In this picture,
these negative point charged

00:08:52.153 --> 00:08:55.047
ligands are also really close to
the orbitals.

00:08:55.047 --> 00:08:57.170
Here they are not really as
close.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:02.190
They are sort of off-axis.
And that becomes really

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.095
important.
All right.

00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:09.142
Let's now think about the
different d-orbitals and the

00:09:09.142 --> 00:09:14.190
ligands when the ligands are
arranged in an octahedral

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.285
geometry.
In this case,

00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:21.047
we have these ligands,
these negative point charges

00:09:21.047 --> 00:09:24.380
coming in on all the different
axes.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:30.000
And so, if we think about it,
these are close.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.856
And I mentioned that in the
last slide.

00:09:32.856 --> 00:09:37.592
A negative point charge along z
is going to be very close to d z

00:09:37.592 --> 00:09:40.899
squared  ,
and it will be repulsive.

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:44.507
For d x squared minus y squared
,

00:09:44.507 --> 00:09:48.567
the negative point charges
along y and along x are also

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:51.724
going to be very close to these
d-orbitals.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:54.280
And that will,
again, be repulsive.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.715
We are going to have a large
repulsive interaction for these

00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:03.000
two orbitals with an octahedral
geometry.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.282
These two d-orbitals are
destabilized,

00:10:06.282 --> 00:10:10.185
and they are destabilized by
the same amount.

00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:14.177
When they are destabilized by
the same amount,

00:10:14.177 --> 00:10:18.612
what is that called?
The energy of the orbitals are

00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:23.580
the same, what is that called?
Yeah, they are degenerate.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.637
And so these two orbitals,
then, will be more destabilized

00:10:28.637 --> 00:10:33.959
by those ligand negative point
charges than the other sets of

00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:38.121
orbitals.
Because they are off-axis and

00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:42.146
the ligands are on-axis.
The negative point charges will

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:46.536
be farther away from these guys.
Let's take a look at that as

00:10:46.536 --> 00:10:48.951
well.
Here we have our three other

00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:52.024
d-orbitals.
And if ligands are coming in as

00:10:52.024 --> 00:10:56.048
negative point charges on-axis,
they are not going to be

00:10:56.048 --> 00:11:00.000
directly pointing at any of
these orbitals.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.686
Because they are 45 degrees
off-axis.

00:11:03.686 --> 00:11:08.498
Ligands are on-axis.
It is not directly pointing

00:11:08.498 --> 00:11:12.593
toward any of them.
These three orbitals,

00:11:12.593 --> 00:11:18.839
then, are stabilized relative
to the other sets of orbitals we

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:23.242
talked about,
and they are stabilized by the

00:11:23.242 --> 00:11:26.518
same amount.
Those three are also

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:30.000
degenerate.
All right.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.969
To summarize,
then, you will have a large

00:11:32.969 --> 00:11:37.647
repulsion for d x squared minus
y squared   and d

00:11:37.647 --> 00:11:40.765
z squared.
And they will be more

00:11:40.765 --> 00:11:43.958
destabilized compared to the
other orbitals.

00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.596
There will be a smaller
repulsion for these three.

00:11:47.596 --> 00:11:51.457
And they will be stabilized
compared to these sets of

00:11:51.457 --> 00:11:53.090
orbitals.
And so, here,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.396
you are really thinking about
comparing the d-orbitals to a

00:11:57.396 --> 00:12:02.000
case where the ligands are sort
of all around.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.565
We will talk about that in a
minute.

00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:08.816
If you localize your ligands
on-axis, how is this affected?

00:12:08.816 --> 00:12:13.068
And this just reminds you and
shows you the pictures again.

00:12:13.068 --> 00:12:16.952
Over here they are pointing
much more directly toward,

00:12:16.952 --> 00:12:19.811
and here they are away.
If it helps you,

00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.963
depending on how you like to
think about it,

00:12:22.963 --> 00:12:26.921
I had these orbitals in your
handout on the first page,

00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:32.657
but just to show them again.
You can think about how close

00:12:32.657 --> 00:12:36.321
they are.
See, that ligand is very close,

00:12:36.321 --> 00:12:41.178
not nearly as close here.
It is all about the geometry

00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:45.575
around the metal,
the geometry of the d-orbitals,

00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:50.798
the geometry of the ligands.
Now I am going to try writing

00:12:50.798 --> 00:12:54.371
on the board.
Here we are going to think

00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:59.594
about how you would draw a
diagram to represent the energy

00:12:59.594 --> 00:13:05.000
levels when you consider crystal
field theory.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:16.000
You would have what's called a
crystal field splitting diagram.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.987
Here, energy would be going up.
And we have our case.

00:13:32.987 --> 00:13:41.094
We have a hypothetical case
where we have five d-orbitals.

00:13:41.094 --> 00:13:48.349
And so this is the average
energy of the d-orbitals.

00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:56.599
Average energy of d-orbitals
with the ligands bound in what

00:13:56.599 --> 00:14:03.000
is known as a spherical crystal
field.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.405
This does not exist.
It is hypothetical.

00:14:07.405 --> 00:14:14.184
If the ligands were everywhere
in a sphere around your metal,

00:14:14.184 --> 00:14:19.606
this is our hypothetical
spherical crystal field,

00:14:19.606 --> 00:14:24.012
and you imagine the metal is
the inside.

00:14:24.012 --> 00:14:30.000
And on the outside,
you have all the ligands.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.610
The ligands are everywhere.
They are equally distributed

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.842
everywhere.
And if they are equally

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:39.256
distributed everywhere,
all the d-orbitals would have

00:14:39.256 --> 00:14:41.684
the same energy.
It is pointing toward

00:14:41.684 --> 00:14:44.179
everything equally,
so it is spherical.

00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:46.673
It is completely surrounding
the metal.

00:14:46.673 --> 00:14:50.415
This is a hypothetical case,
because that does not happen.

00:14:50.415 --> 00:14:53.960
Ligands are bound in discrete
positions, but if it did,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.126
these would be of the same
energy.

00:14:56.126 --> 00:15:00.000
Let me try to get his a little
more flat.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.560
All right.
They are all the same energy.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.705
Well, what happens,
then, when you bring your

00:15:09.705 --> 00:15:16.370
ligands into their discrete
positions, when you bring your

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:21.983
ligands in in this case into
octahedral geometry,

00:15:21.983 --> 00:15:25.959
then things change.
Then you have a

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:31.410
destabilization.
You have a destabilization of

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:36.729
your d x squared minus y squared
 and d z squared

00:15:36.729 --> 00:15:40.552
 orbitals.
They are going to go up in

00:15:40.552 --> 00:15:42.713
energy.
And you will have a

00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:46.785
stabilization of your d xy,
d yz and d xz orbitals.

00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:51.439
They are going to go down in

00:15:51.439 --> 00:15:54.182
energy.
In this hypothetical case,

00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:56.841
the d-orbitals have equal
energy.

00:15:56.841 --> 00:16:01.883
Ligands are everywhere.
They are pointing at all the

00:16:01.883 --> 00:16:04.911
d-orbitals equally,
but in an octahedral case.

00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:07.199
Then two orbitals are
destabilized,

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:10.227
go up in energy,
because those ligands now are

00:16:10.227 --> 00:16:12.380
pointing right at those
orbitals.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.071
They are not pointing equally
everywhere.

00:16:15.071 --> 00:16:18.570
They are pointing at these
orbitals, so they go up in

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.993
energy.
These orbitals are in between

00:16:20.993 --> 00:16:24.290
the axes, so they are not
affected as much and get

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.846
stabilized.
These orbitals have a name,

00:16:26.846 --> 00:16:32.750
e g.
And these orbitals have a name,

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.709
t two g for the
octahedral case.

00:16:37.709 --> 00:16:44.725
And the difference in energy
between these sets of orbitals

00:16:44.725 --> 00:16:50.411
is this sign here,
sort of this delta zero sign,

00:16:50.411 --> 00:16:55.008
actually O.
And that is for octahedral.

00:16:55.008 --> 00:17:02.011
The O is for octahedral.
And it is the crystal field

00:17:02.011 --> 00:17:06.806
splitting energy.
It is how much the ligands

00:17:06.806 --> 00:17:11.936
split the field.
This theoretical case up here,

00:17:11.936 --> 00:17:17.959
there is no splitting going on.
You bring in d-ligands,

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:24.315
and they cause a splitting.
They cause some orbitals to go

00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:29.000
up in energy and some to go
down.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.501
And the distance between them,
the degree of splitting is this

00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:38.200
octahedral crystal field
splitting energy.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.799
Now, the overall energy of the
system is maintained.

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:47.850
If these go up and these go
down, to get everything to be

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.000
equal, let's see if I drew that
right.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.444
These should go up.
I am trying to draw this

00:18:03.444 --> 00:18:07.529
straight from this line.
These are going to go up in

00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:12.095
energy by plus two-fifths,
the octahedral crystal

00:18:12.095 --> 00:18:16.180
field splitting energy.
And these three orbitals are

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.865
going to go down in energy,
will be stabilized,

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:24.431
by minus two-fifths,
the octahedral crystal field

00:18:24.431 --> 00:18:27.875
splitting energy.
Two orbitals are going up,

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:33.633
so it is by three-fifths.
Three orbitals are going down,

00:18:33.633 --> 00:18:38.285
so it is by two-fifths.
Because it is going to have to

00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:41.796
equal out.
You are not sort of creating a

00:18:41.796 --> 00:18:45.921
different system here.
The energy is going to be

00:18:45.921 --> 00:18:48.642
conserved.
The overall energy is

00:18:48.642 --> 00:18:51.012
maintained.
Two orbitals up,

00:18:51.012 --> 00:18:53.733
two-thirds.
Three orbitals down,

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.137
two-fifths.
Okay.

00:18:55.137 --> 00:19:01.126
That is really a simple idea.
Instead of the theoretical

00:19:01.126 --> 00:19:05.787
where all the ligands are
everywhere, when you put them in

00:19:05.787 --> 00:19:10.039
octahedral geometry it affects
some of the d-orbitals

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:14.455
differently than others.
Some orbitals go up in energy.

00:19:14.455 --> 00:19:17.235
Some go down.
The overall energy is

00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:20.179
maintained.
Let's look at an example,

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:24.841
now, and figure out how to put
electrons into this system.

00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:28.357
Let's look at a case where we
have chromium,

00:19:28.357 --> 00:19:30.892
(N H three) three,
and Br three.

00:19:30.892 --> 00:19:35.912
First, we need to figure out

00:19:35.912 --> 00:19:38.097
the oxidation number of
chromium.

00:19:38.097 --> 00:19:41.921
Having everything in the
bracket here means that you have

00:19:41.921 --> 00:19:45.268
six ligands total,
three NH three igands,

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:47.658
three Br ligands or bromide
ligands.

00:19:47.658 --> 00:19:49.843
And those are all in one
bracket.

00:19:49.843 --> 00:19:53.053
There is no number in the
corner of the bracket,

00:19:53.053 --> 00:19:56.878
so that means the overall
charge in this system has to be

00:19:56.878 --> 00:19:59.609
equal to zero.
What will be the oxidation

00:19:59.609 --> 00:20:04.545
number of bromine?
It should be minus one.

00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:09.525
Three minus ones.
What about NH three,

00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:11.185
as a unit?
Zero.

00:20:11.185 --> 00:20:16.166
Three times zero.
And what does that leave you

00:20:16.166 --> 00:20:20.703
with for the oxidation number of
chromium?

00:20:20.703 --> 00:20:24.023
Plus three.
We have plus three.

00:20:24.023 --> 00:20:30.000
Now we can figure out the
d-electron count.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.287
We need to look up the group
number.

00:20:36.287 --> 00:20:45.808
And the group number is what?
Can you see it up there?

00:20:45.808 --> 00:20:51.736
Most people seem to be saying
six.

00:20:51.736 --> 00:21:00.000
That is right.
Six minus three is three.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.535
So this is a d three
system.

00:21:03.535 --> 00:21:08.484
That means we are going to put
in three electrons.

00:21:08.484 --> 00:21:14.040
Where would you guess I am
going to put those electrons?

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.666
Down here or up here?
Down.

00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:20.404
What if I do this?
Would that be good?

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:23.636
No.
We are coming back to some of

00:21:23.636 --> 00:21:30.000
the roles that you learned
earlier in the semester.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.241
First you want to put them in
the lowest energy orbital.

00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:39.023
You don't want to ever have one
with two parallel spins because

00:21:39.023 --> 00:21:42.802
that would give you the same
four quantum numbers,

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:46.118
so that is not good.
And you also by choice,

00:21:46.118 --> 00:21:50.514
if they are the same energy,
put them in singly before you

00:21:50.514 --> 00:21:53.830
start to pair.
Those are all things that you

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.606
talked about earlier in the
semester.

00:21:56.606 --> 00:22:02.018
We put our three electrons in.
One to each orbital,

00:22:02.018 --> 00:22:06.864
all the spins parallel.
We have Aufbau principle,

00:22:06.864 --> 00:22:11.205
Pauli exclusion,
and also Hund's rule all at

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:15.444
play here with how we put in the
electrons.

00:22:15.444 --> 00:22:21.501
Now we can talk about the d n
electron configuration.

00:22:21.501 --> 00:22:26.447
Maybe I can write over here.
That is just a way of

00:22:26.447 --> 00:22:32.000
expressing how many electrons
are down here.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.041
d n electron
configuration.

00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:39.693
That would just be equal to t
two g to the three.

00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:43.361
You list the name of these sets

00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:46.939
of orbitals.
And that is really why these

00:22:46.939 --> 00:22:51.054
have labels, because it makes
your life easier,

00:22:51.054 --> 00:22:55.079
instead of listing all the
orbitals each time.

00:22:55.079 --> 00:23:00.000
There are three in this lower
energy level.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.883
Now we can also talk about
crystal field stabilization

00:23:06.883 --> 00:23:11.298
energy.
Crystal field stabilization

00:23:11.298 --> 00:23:15.844
energy.
Don't get this confused with

00:23:15.844 --> 00:23:22.597
crystal field splitting energy.
This is crystal field

00:23:22.597 --> 00:23:30.000
stabilization energy,
and it is abbreviated CFSE.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.328
And that is really just
thinking about how much you

00:23:34.328 --> 00:23:39.176
stabilize by this splitting.
If you had this hypothetical

00:23:39.176 --> 00:23:43.504
spherical crystal field,
your electrons would be in

00:23:43.504 --> 00:23:47.226
orbitals with this energy,
but they are not.

00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:51.814
After the ligands come in,
in the octahedral geometry,

00:23:51.814 --> 00:23:56.229
the electrons are in the t two
g orbitals.

00:23:56.229 --> 00:24:00.976
They are stabilized.
This is lower in energy than

00:24:00.976 --> 00:24:03.305
where they would have been
before.

00:24:03.305 --> 00:24:07.258
And so the crystal field
stabilization energy is a way of

00:24:07.258 --> 00:24:11.423
indicating whether you have
overall stabilized the system or

00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:14.529
not by this splitting.
The way that you would

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:18.976
represent this is you would just
look at where the electrons are

00:24:18.976 --> 00:24:21.729
and how much they are
stabilized, again,

00:24:21.729 --> 00:24:24.905
three orbitals down minus
two-fifths,

00:24:24.905 --> 00:24:29.000
two orbitals up plus
three-fifths.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.743
In this case,
there are three electrons that

00:24:33.743 --> 00:24:39.370
are stabilized by minus
two-fifths of the octahedral

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:44.886
crystal field splitting energy,
or you would have a

00:24:44.886 --> 00:24:50.733
stabilization of minus
six-fifths times the octahedral

00:24:50.733 --> 00:24:57.131
crystal field splitting energy.
That would be the answer to

00:24:57.131 --> 00:25:00.000
that part.
Okay.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.699
Let's look at another example.
I will write this in between

00:25:07.699 --> 00:25:12.477
here.
Here we have manganese with six

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:19.513
water ligands in brackets and Cl
three on the outside.

00:25:19.513 --> 00:25:27.876
What is the
charge of just this coordination

00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:32.370
complex?
It has six ligands to this

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:37.021
inside the brackets?
What is the charge of just that

00:25:37.021 --> 00:25:41.762
coordination complex overall?
It would be plus three.

00:25:41.762 --> 00:25:47.142
And you know that because these
are three negatively charged

00:25:47.142 --> 00:25:51.155
counter ions.
When the whole thing is neutral

00:25:51.155 --> 00:25:55.349
with three Cl's,
it means that had to have been

00:25:55.349 --> 00:26:00.000
plus three.
What is the charge of water?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.721
Zero.
What has to be the charge on

00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:06.090
the metal?
Plus three.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:10.827
Now we can figure out the
d-electron count.

00:26:10.827 --> 00:26:16.127
What group are we in?
Seven minus three is four.

00:26:16.127 --> 00:26:20.751
We are a d four system.
All right.

00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:27.631
Now we have four electrons to
put in, and we are going to have

00:26:27.631 --> 00:26:33.129
a choice.
We are going to have a choice

00:26:33.129 --> 00:26:39.496
as to whether we put the fourth
electron up here or keep the

00:26:39.496 --> 00:26:43.165
fourth electron down here and
pair.

00:26:43.165 --> 00:26:47.266
And so both of those are
possibilities.

00:26:47.266 --> 00:26:52.769
And it depends on the strength
of the crystal field.

00:26:52.769 --> 00:27:00.000
Let's look at those diagrams.
There are two possibilities.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.418
And we have,
again, d x squared minus y

00:27:09.418 --> 00:27:16.279
squared   and d z
squared   up here,

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:21.395
we have our t two g system,
our e g.

00:27:21.395 --> 00:27:27.209
That is one drawing.
Or, we might have a case where

00:27:27.209 --> 00:27:34.186
we have something more like this
where there is a much larger

00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:40.000
separation between the sets of
orbitals.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.617
Between the e g and
the t two g.

00:27:45.617 --> 00:27:49.213
And so here is our crystal
field.

00:27:49.213 --> 00:27:54.157
It is small here.
And here is another crystal

00:27:54.157 --> 00:28:00.000
field splitting energy,
and this one is large.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.372
You have a choice.
We have to put in four

00:28:03.372 --> 00:28:06.744
electrons.
And depending on whether it is

00:28:06.744 --> 00:28:11.718
a small splitting or a large
splitting, you are going to put

00:28:11.718 --> 00:28:14.500
them in differently.
In this case,

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.883
we have a crystal field
splitting energy that is less

00:28:18.883 --> 00:28:21.918
than what we call the pairing
energy.

00:28:21.918 --> 00:28:26.976
The pairing energy is how much
energy it takes to pair up the

00:28:26.976 --> 00:28:31.392
electrons.
They prefer to have their own

00:28:31.392 --> 00:28:34.279
orbital.
They would prefer not to be

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:37.167
paired.
It takes a certain amount of

00:28:37.167 --> 00:28:39.890
energy to pair them.
In this case,

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:44.757
because the splitting is small,
this set of orbitals up here

00:28:44.757 --> 00:28:49.460
are really not that much higher
in energy than these were.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.595
It is not that hard to put one
up here.

00:28:52.595 --> 00:28:55.730
And it takes more energy,
in this case,

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:59.525
to pair them up,
than it does to put one in the

00:28:59.525 --> 00:29:04.561
higher level.
This one would have a drawing

00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:08.182
like this.
You have four electrons you put

00:29:08.182 --> 00:29:10.921
in.
One of them goes over there.

00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:13.835
In this case,
we have a really big

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:17.369
difference.
It would take a lot of energy

00:29:17.369 --> 00:29:21.255
to put an electron way up here.
In this case,

00:29:21.255 --> 00:29:26.113
the splitting energy is greater
than the pairing energy.

00:29:26.113 --> 00:29:31.770
This is really a lot higher up.
Here it is small.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:37.395
It makes not much difference.
Here the energy is large.

00:29:37.395 --> 00:29:41.979
In this case,
you would want to put your four

00:29:41.979 --> 00:29:45.833
electrons all down in the lower
level.

00:29:45.833 --> 00:29:51.770
Let's just take a look at some
of those rules and say them

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:55.208
again.
Here, when the splitting is

00:29:55.208 --> 00:30:00.000
small, this is called a weak
field.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.552
The ligands here will be weak
field ligands.

00:30:02.552 --> 00:30:04.808
And there will be strong field
ligands.

00:30:04.808 --> 00:30:07.598
And we are going to talk about
that next Monday,

00:30:07.598 --> 00:30:10.863
how you will learn certain
ligands, and whether they are

00:30:10.863 --> 00:30:13.474
weak field or strong field.
If they are weak,

00:30:13.474 --> 00:30:16.621
oh boy, they cannot really
split that energy very far.

00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:18.639
They do not have a lot of
strength.

00:30:18.639 --> 00:30:20.479
They cannot do a huge
splitting.

00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:23.210
They just do a little tiny
amount of splitting.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:27.350
They are pretty weak ligands.
And, in this case,

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:31.704
you would have a strong field,
where you would have a large

00:30:31.704 --> 00:30:34.105
splitting.
Those ligands come in.

00:30:34.105 --> 00:30:37.783
And, boy, they take those
d-orbital energy levels,

00:30:37.783 --> 00:30:40.485
and they split them really far
apart.

00:30:40.485 --> 00:30:44.838
Those are strong field ligands.
They create a strong field.

00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:46.940
And this is large.
All right.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.918
If we look at some of these
rules then, if our pairing

00:30:50.918 --> 00:30:54.295
energy is greater than that
energy difference,

00:30:54.295 --> 00:30:56.697
that means you have a weak
field.

00:30:56.697 --> 00:31:01.236
It is not much different.
It is a weak field,

00:31:01.236 --> 00:31:03.969
not much splitting.
The splitting is small.

00:31:03.969 --> 00:31:07.613
And then what you are going to
want to do is put all your

00:31:07.613 --> 00:31:10.867
electrons in singly to the
fullest extent possible.

00:31:10.867 --> 00:31:13.926
You use both t two g
and e g.

00:31:13.926 --> 00:31:16.659
You put them all singly until
you are done,

00:31:16.659 --> 00:31:18.872
before you pair.
On the other hand,

00:31:18.872 --> 00:31:22.581
if you have a strong field,
that is going to have a really

00:31:22.581 --> 00:31:25.639
large splitting.
Big energy difference between t

00:31:25.639 --> 00:31:30.000
two g and e g
sets of orbitals.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.014
Then that splitting energy is
going to be greater than the

00:31:34.014 --> 00:31:37.042
pairing energy.
It is more favorable to pair

00:31:37.042 --> 00:31:41.197
than to make that big jump up to
this higher energy level up

00:31:41.197 --> 00:31:42.464
here.
In that case,

00:31:42.464 --> 00:31:46.760
what you want to do is you want
to pair them all up in t two g.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.014
And only after this is

00:31:49.014 --> 00:31:53.309
completely full and you cannot
put any more electrons in there

00:31:53.309 --> 00:31:57.676
do you want to put an electron
way up there in the e g

00:31:57.676 --> 00:32:01.372
sets of orbitals.
What this means,

00:32:01.372 --> 00:32:06.605
then, is in this case you are
going to have the maximum amount

00:32:06.605 --> 00:32:11.152
of unpaired electrons,
because you are going to try to

00:32:11.152 --> 00:32:15.442
keep them unpaired for as long
as you possibly can.

00:32:15.442 --> 00:32:19.560
And so this is referred to as a
high spin system.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.820
In this case,
you are going to have the

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:27.710
minimum number of unpaired.
You are trying to pair them up

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:32.000
down here before you put one up
here.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.921
This is a low spin system,
minimum number of unpaired

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:42.504
electrons that are possible.
These are our two diagrams that

00:32:42.504 --> 00:32:46.668
you will see.
And one question on the problem

00:32:46.668 --> 00:32:51.684
set has you drawing these
diagrams for these different

00:32:51.684 --> 00:32:55.470
conditions.
Now, this particular one that

00:32:55.470 --> 00:33:00.391
we are talking about,
this particular complex is high

00:33:00.391 --> 00:33:04.383
spin.
And so next week we are going

00:33:04.383 --> 00:33:09.397
to talk about what that is true.
And you will learn about some

00:33:09.397 --> 00:33:14.246
of the ligands and be able to
predict whether it is going to

00:33:14.246 --> 00:33:17.123
be a high spin or a low spin
system.

00:33:17.123 --> 00:33:21.808
We can also go through now and
do electron configurations,

00:33:21.808 --> 00:33:25.342
and also the crystal field
splitting energy.

00:33:25.342 --> 00:33:28.794
In this case,
our d n configuration

00:33:28.794 --> 00:33:35.333
is going to be equal to --
There are three electrons in t

00:33:35.333 --> 00:33:41.666
two g and there is one
electron in e g.

00:33:41.666 --> 00:33:46.222
And over here,
we have d n equals,

00:33:46.222 --> 00:33:51.111
in t two g,
we have four electrons.

00:33:51.111 --> 00:33:56.777
Those are the differences in
electron configuration,

00:33:56.777 --> 00:34:01.777
and in the crystal field
stabilization energy,

00:34:01.777 --> 00:34:07.931
we calculate that.
We have three electrons down

00:34:07.931 --> 00:34:11.178
here.
We have three electrons in

00:34:11.178 --> 00:34:17.146
minus two-fifths times the
crystal field splitting energy.

00:34:17.146 --> 00:34:22.277
And we have one electron up
above, so that is plus

00:34:22.277 --> 00:34:27.734
three-fifths there.
And so minus six plus three is

00:34:27.734 --> 00:34:31.745
going to give us minus
three-fifths times the

00:34:31.745 --> 00:34:36.849
octahedral crystal field
splitting energy for this system

00:34:36.849 --> 00:34:39.675
here.
And you do need to put the

00:34:39.675 --> 00:34:44.689
symbol for the octahedral
crystal field splitting energy

00:34:44.689 --> 00:34:47.241
in this.
Not just the number.

00:34:47.241 --> 00:34:51.343
On the other side,
we only have electrons down

00:34:51.343 --> 00:34:54.260
here.
And so we are going to have

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:59.000
four that are times minus
two-fifths.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.530
And so our answer is going to
be minus eight-fifths times the

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.627
octahedral crystal field
splitting energy.

00:35:06.627 --> 00:35:10.704
And every once in a while,
some people like to indicate

00:35:10.704 --> 00:35:13.347
that there is also something
paired.

00:35:13.347 --> 00:35:17.501
Sometimes you will see this
plus PE, which indicates one

00:35:17.501 --> 00:35:20.823
paired electron.
Sometimes you might be asked

00:35:20.823 --> 00:35:25.279
for that, so just to be aware.
I think your book doesn't use

00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:28.224
this, but you will see that some
places.

00:35:28.224 --> 00:35:32.000
That is how we would do those
two.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.491
All right.
Let's quickly look at one more

00:35:36.491 --> 00:35:40.759
example.
Here, it would be excellent to

00:35:40.759 --> 00:35:46.149
have another board,
but let's quickly do a little

00:35:46.149 --> 00:35:50.978
bit of erasing and leave our
framework here.

00:35:50.978 --> 00:35:53.000
All right.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.570
Get rid of this over here and
over here.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.679
Okay.
In this case,

00:36:06.679 --> 00:36:11.953
we are looking at cobalt plus
two.

00:36:11.953 --> 00:36:17.343
The first step is to find the
oxidation number,

00:36:17.343 --> 00:36:21.796
but conveniently that was given
to you.

00:36:21.796 --> 00:36:26.601
It is plus two.
And then we need to do the

00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:32.467
d-electron count.
Group number for cobalt is

00:36:32.467 --> 00:36:35.125
nine.
We have 9 minus 2 or 7,

00:36:35.125 --> 00:36:38.447
so we have a d seven system.

00:36:38.447 --> 00:36:43.762
For this, we will have a
difference, depending on whether

00:36:43.762 --> 00:36:47.464
you have a weak field or a
strong field,

00:36:47.464 --> 00:36:52.020
on how you put in your seven
different electrons.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:58.000
Again, if we look at the two
different conditions --

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.305
If we first do this with a weak
field, then we are going to want

00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:08.357
to put in our electrons to the
fullest extend possible before

00:37:08.357 --> 00:37:11.305
pairing.
We would go in and put one,

00:37:11.305 --> 00:37:13.157
two, three, four,
five.

00:37:13.157 --> 00:37:18.210
Now we put one in all of them.
Then we are going to come back

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:23.178
and do six, seven down here.
And so this will be the maximum

00:37:23.178 --> 00:37:28.231
number of unpaired that you can
possibly have for a high spin

00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:30.968
system.
In this case,

00:37:30.968 --> 00:37:34.767
with a strong field,
it takes a lot of energy to put

00:37:34.767 --> 00:37:38.566
the electrons up there.
You are going to want to put

00:37:38.566 --> 00:37:41.620
them all in the bottom until you
are done.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.164
And you cannot put anymore down
here when you have this strong

00:37:46.164 --> 00:37:50.261
field, when you have this big
large splitting in energy.

00:37:50.261 --> 00:37:54.954
The splitting in energy is much
greater than the pairing energy.

00:37:54.954 --> 00:37:58.232
Better to pair then to put
electrons up here.

00:37:58.232 --> 00:38:00.988
Now we would do one,
two, three, four,

00:38:00.988 --> 00:38:04.517
five, six.
And, unfortunately,

00:38:04.517 --> 00:38:07.952
we have seven.
One will have to go up there,

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:11.307
but only one.
You see that the diagrams are

00:38:11.307 --> 00:38:16.420
different with a d seven
system, depending on whether you

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.136
are a weak field or a strong
field.

00:38:19.136 --> 00:38:23.529
Here you would have the minimum
number, one, of unpaired

00:38:23.529 --> 00:38:27.124
electrons, low spin.
Here you have the maximum

00:38:27.124 --> 00:38:32.715
number, which is three.
And we can do our d n

00:38:32.715 --> 00:38:36.647
count here.
Now we have five electrons in t

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:42.078
two g and we have two
electrons in e g.

00:38:42.078 --> 00:38:47.415
Over here, in t two g,

00:38:47.415 --> 00:38:51.161
we have six.
And in e g we have

00:38:51.161 --> 00:38:55.000
only one.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.129
And for the crystal field
splitting energy,

00:39:00.129 --> 00:39:07.091
on this side we would have 5
times minus two-fifths plus 2

00:39:07.091 --> 00:39:14.541
times 3/5, or a total of minus
4/5 times the splitting energy.

00:39:14.541 --> 00:39:20.526
Again, we could add two PE for
the pairing energy,

00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:27.000
if that was asked for,
so optional plus 2 PE.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.135
And on this side we are going
to have six times minus

00:39:32.135 --> 00:39:36.185
two-fifths plus,
we have one three-fifths,

00:39:36.185 --> 00:39:41.617
or an answer of nine-fifths
times the octahedral crystal

00:39:41.617 --> 00:39:45.962
field splitting energy.
And, again, optional,

00:39:45.962 --> 00:39:50.407
we could add three pairing
energies for those.

00:39:50.407 --> 00:39:53.962
Okay.
Well, we finished on time given

00:39:53.962 --> 00:39:59.000
all the technical issues.
That's great.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.738
You should be able to finish
your whole problem set and have

00:40:04.738 --> 00:40:07.404
experience doing these kinds of
diagrams.
