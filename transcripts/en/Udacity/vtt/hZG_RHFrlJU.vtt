00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.830
Since we have millions and millions of sales to process, it's

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.570
going to take a very long time for our computer to

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.670
first have to read the data off-disk and then process it

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.680
line by line. Also, the more stores we have, the longer

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.760
it takes to check if we've seen that store, add it

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.200
to the hash table, and add the running value to the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.870
total. We may even run out of memory holding the hash

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.280
table. However, it probably would work. And you would get the

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.310
right result eventually. Let's see how we could

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.870
do this more efficiently with a MapReduce job
