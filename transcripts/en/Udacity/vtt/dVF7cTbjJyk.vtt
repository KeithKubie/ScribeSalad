00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.838
&gt;&gt; Okay, Michael. So, I've drawn a little thing on the screen for you.

00:00:02.838 --> 00:00:06.210
because want to illustrate a problem. So, you see this little graph that I have?

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.850
&gt;&gt; It looks just like all the other graphs you've drawn so far.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.590
&gt;&gt; More or less. I think there are fewer

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.420
points, but I think you're right. It more or less

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.320
looks like the same one. And, we found the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.140
line that is linearly separating the two clouds of points.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.578
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:25.570
&gt;&gt; And you agree, that's a technical term. And you agree that

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.060
it linearly separates them. And you're even willing to accept, for the purposes

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.500
of this discussion, that is in fact the line that maximizes the margin.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.960
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.070
&gt;&gt; Even if it's not. Okay, cool. So, this is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850
easy right? So, what are you going to do, Michael,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.630
if I take this now and I add one more

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.000
point? And here is the point that I'm going to add.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.710
&gt;&gt; Hmm.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.170
&gt;&gt; It's another minus.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.200
&gt;&gt; I can think of two things to do. One is I can

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.070
put a vertical line through it, and that makes things nearly separable again.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.730
&gt;&gt; That's usually not allowed.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.780
&gt;&gt; And the other one is, since it's a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.250
different color I feel like I could just erase it.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.688
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:57.688 --> 00:00:58.284
&gt;&gt; No, all right.

00:00:58.284 --> 00:01:00.436
&gt;&gt; That's not acceptable. I control the pen. .

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.450
&gt;&gt; I mean in some sense the margin is now

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.030
negative, right. because this, this point, there's going to be no

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.380
way of slicing this up so that all the negatives

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.150
are on one side and all the positives on the other.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.830
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.450
&gt;&gt; It's not linearly separable.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.320
&gt;&gt; Okay. Can you think of some clever way to fix it?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.260
&gt;&gt; Well, again, I mean, I feel like, I mean I was

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.010
making a joke before. But maybe a reasonable thing to do is to have

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.640
some kind of, you know, I'm allowed to delete some number of points thing.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510
Or, or, find the line that linearly

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.820
separates the positives and the negatives, while

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.370
at the same time, minimizing the number of things that are on the wrong side.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.000
&gt;&gt; Right. So you wouldn't be linearly summarizing,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.790
separating them. But you'd be finding a line

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.850
that make sort of the minimal set of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.410
errors while also maximizing the margin, if you kind

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.460
of were allowed to flip a few points from positive to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.770
negative or negative to positive. I think that's what you said.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then you need to have kind

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.050
of new knob now to trade off those two things.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.366
&gt;&gt; Right, and it turns out you can do

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.647
that. We're not going to about it. Instead we're

00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:57.410
going to make a homework assignment about it then,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.730
and let the students think about it a little

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.060
bit. But I think even that little clever thing

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.900
that you came up with, even though it is

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.790
used, won't work in another case that I'm thinking

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.280
of. So let me draw that case for you.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.710
Okay, Michael, how does that look?

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.510
&gt;&gt; Well, the good news is it's not exactly

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.110
like all the other graphs you've drawn but it is,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.940
it is very similar to it. There's going to be

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.420
a linear separator that falls between that bottom plus and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.560
the line of minuses. And there's a maximum margin

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.350
one. So its, this seems all within the bounds of

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.450
what we've been talking about. &lt;&lt; That's true. You're very

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.200
smart. What if I add just a few more points?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.760
&gt;&gt; Okay, that doesn't

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.570
seem like just a few. [LAUGH] Wait, so I guess this is

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.640
different from the other example because where before, as before, it looked like

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.910
there was maybe like an outlier or an intruder. Now, it's like there's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.220
a ring around the whole thing. Oh, is that why they're linearly married?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.940
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.680
&gt;&gt; Ha! All right. So now, you know, you can draw lines

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.600
all day long, and it's just not going to slice things up.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.220
&gt;&gt; That's right. So now we have to come up with some clever way of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.800
managing to make this work, or we're going to have to throw away

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.670
support vector machines altogether. And I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.202
like support vector machines, so I want

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:11.270
to avoid doing that. So here's the little trick we're going to do. I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.380
am going to change the data points without changing the data points.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.410
&gt;&gt; Ouu.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.550
&gt;&gt; That's going to be a neat trick.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.670
&gt;&gt; That seems possible and impossible.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.225
&gt;&gt; Here's what I'm going to do, Michael. I am going to define a function,

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.320
okay. Here's the function. I'm going to create a

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.140
little function here. And this function's going to take

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.360
a data point, okay. And because we've been using

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.300
to many X's and I's and Y's and J's, I'm

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.130
simply going to call it Q, okay. Now, Q

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.170
is one of the points that are in, it's in

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.940
the same dimension as these other points. So in

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.760
this case, it's two dimensions in a plane, okay. And

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.090
I'm going to transform that particular point Q into another kind of point. But

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.770
I'm going to do it in another

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.130
way that doesn't require cheating, okay. You ready?

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.220
&gt;&gt; Sure, Im perplexed but okay

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.470
&gt;&gt; Okay. So what is Q? Q is in the Y, is in the plane. So that means

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.560
it has two different components, Q1 and Q2. And

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.880
I am going to produce from those two components,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.579
Q1 and Q2, a triple. So I am going to put that point

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.430
into three dimensions now. And the dimensions are going to look like this.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.400
How does that look, Michael?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.240
&gt;&gt; Strange. So you took, so q\Q is a two dimensional

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.050
point. So it's got, Q1 and Q2 are its two components.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.393
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:36.070
&gt;&gt; And you're saying, you're going to take the first component, make a new

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.530
vector where the first component of that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.800
is squared, take the second component, make a

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.200
new vector where the sec, that value is the second component squared. And now,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.660
just because apparently it wasn't weird enough,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.980
you're going to throw in a root 2

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.068
times the product of those two as the third dimension. Okay.

00:04:53.068 --> 00:04:54.316
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:04:54.316 --> 00:04:57.170
&gt;&gt; You're, you know you have an interesting sense of style.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.640
&gt;&gt; I do. I kind of like it. Now let me point out something

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.180
for you. One is I haven't actually added any new information, in the sense that

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.220
I'm still only using Q1 and Q2. Yeah, I threw a constant in there, and

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.050
I'm multiplying by one another, but at the end of the day, I haven't really

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.230
done much. It's not like I've thrown in some

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.030
boolean variable that gives you some extra information. All

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.860
I've done is taken Q1 and Q2 and multiplied

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.820
them together, or against one another just because, why not?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.070
&gt;&gt; Okay? All right. Now, Why did I do this? I did this

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.280
because it's going to turn out to provide a cute little trick. And

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.100
in order to see that cute little trick we need to return to

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.761
our quadratic programming problem. So let me remind you what that equation was.

00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:44.320
All right, Michael. So I've written up the equation for you, as

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.740
I promised I would remind you, of the quadratic program that we're

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.650
trying to solve. I didn't write down all of the constraints and

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.250
everything. I'm hoping that you remember them. And I wrote it up there

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.450
for a reason. And the reason I wrote it up, is because

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.570
you'll recall, just not too long ago, I asked you to talk about

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.510
XI and XJ, and what it looks like in this equation. And

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.900
what I think we agreed to, or at least I know I agreed

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.680
to, is that we can think about XI transpose XJ as capturing

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.670
some notion of similarity. So, it turns out then, if we sort of buy that idea of

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.080
similarity, that really what matters most in

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.520
solving this quadratic problem, and ultimately solving

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.460
our optimization problem, is being able to

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.010
constantly do these transpose operations. So, let's ask

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.840
the question that, if I have this new function, fee or

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.680
fi or whatever the right pronunciation is, what would happen if

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.500
I took two data points, and I did the transpose or

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.210
the dot product between them. What would I get? So, let

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.810
me just write that out. Or, I don't know, you can

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.850
try telling me if you want to. So let's make that,

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.920
let's make that let's make that simple, Michael. And in fact,

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.080
let's make it so simple we can make it into a quiz.
