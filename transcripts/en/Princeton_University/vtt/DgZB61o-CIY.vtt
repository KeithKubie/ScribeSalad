Five,
four, three, two, one.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.030
Andrew Houck: We're running a
rocket lab for the Freshman

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.210
Scholars Institute.


00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.320
So the purpose of the
lab is to give students

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.110
a familiarity with
physics and math,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.890
and give them a hands-on design
and engineering experience

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.680
where they can explore
these concepts.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.590
So for the past
four weeks in lab,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.390
they've been building
a number of things.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.850
They've been building
these circuit

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.580
boards, which are essentially
the equivalent of a satellite.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.080
The whole project is to launch
a rocket up into the air,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.800
and to track the
flight of the rocket.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.780
And so this, like sort
of any NASA launch,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.470
is like the satellite--
it's a bunch of electronics.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.870
And what this does
is it measures

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.030
the acceleration of the
rocket 128 times a second.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690
CURTIS MERRILL: I'm hoping to
do mechanical and aerospace

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.300
engineering.


00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.890
So this is right up my alley.


00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.640
To get into kind of a
college environment,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640
with a small group
of kids, and just

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.730
really be able to learn how to
adapt to a Princeton learning

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.570
situation in a very low-stress
environment, where there's

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.070
a lot of resources
able to help you.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.010
So it's been absolutely
perfect for me

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.070
in just learning how to adjust
to college, to Princeton

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.870
specifically.
