At Udacity we think responsive design
and optimization is really important.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.840
Otherwise we wouldn't have
made four courses on it.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.340
I've linked them all in
the instructor's notes.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.440
I'll give you a moment to
bookmark all the things.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.345
For further background on some of
the things we'll be working through with

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:21.505
images, definitely check out
the Responsive Web Images course.

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:24.755
Next, we'll chat a little bit
about how you can optimize images.
