[BACKGROUND VOICES]

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.080
BARBARA STOCKING &gt;&gt; Hi, it's Barbara Stocking
from Oxfam again for those of you who might

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.690
have seen me before. Um-and I'm just gonna
talk about what I think that's going on here

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.640
in terms of growth in the economy.
It's really worrying that there's very little

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.640
talk about what's happening in developing
countries here. And yet, they're going to

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.620
be the ones who are going to be hit-um-with
some of them slightly later in the whole-as

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.580
the-the whole economy changes. Obviously very
differently depending on the different countries

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.220
where the emerging economies are sending out
consumer goods out or people are losing on

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.900
their _____ like the Democratic Republic of
Congo. So I think we've got a long way to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.430
go with poor people and I wish it would pop
up on the agenda a bit higher here.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.780
The other thing that I am concerned about
is the-is life change-and the way actually-I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.430
do think in the debates it has not stood out
to the economy. And yet this is such an absolutely

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.450
critical year.
But I'm also worried because I've been in

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.850
on some sessions-um-on-on climate change where
people here just don't seem to get what people

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.460
in the south feel about this. Um-there is
enormous anger. Ah-not much-very few people,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.659
as they probably don't know but amongst the
elites in a number of emerging countries about

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.899
what's been done through pollution, and the
fact that the-the industrialized countries

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:18.590
really need to put some money in through the
deal for poor countries to adapt now. And

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.469
I don't think most of the people here get
that that's part of the deal. And that most

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.009
people in the south economy are talking about
this issue as an issue of justice.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.130
Um-so I think there's a long way to go and
obviously I'm spending my time going around

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.039
to the various meetings trying to make sure
that those viewpoints get put in.
