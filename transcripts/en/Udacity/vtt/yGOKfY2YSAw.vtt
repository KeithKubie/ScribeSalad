00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:04.950
When we combine like terms, we combine
the coefficients of the like terms but

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.130
leave the variables alone.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.170
Coefficients are numbers
used to multiply variables.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.125
For example in the expression
five X minus two.

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.425
Five is a coefficient.

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:19.985
The two,
which does not have a variable with it.

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.005
is a constant.

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:25.805
Constants are numbers that don't
have variables attached to them.

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:29.015
That is they aren't
multipliers of variables.

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:31.535
X is the only variable here.

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.230
In calculating the cost
of the pineapples.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.610
We saw that 7X+10X=7+10, all times X.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.950
When we add up what's in
the parentheses, we get 17X.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.575
The Coefficients 7 and

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:53.465
10 were combined and
the variable X stayed the same.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:56.015
You should be aware that
if you are told to simplify

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:59.885
an expression with like terms that means
you should combine the like terms.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:07.515
Simplify 4x squared minus 2x squared and
enter your answer in this box.
