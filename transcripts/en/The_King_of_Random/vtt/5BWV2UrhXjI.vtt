00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Today's video is sponsored
by Bill and Melinda Gates.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.400
Today, we're doing
an experiment to see

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.100
if we can make paper
that's impervious to fire.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.780
[Music]

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.900
Guys, we're currently
in the studio,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.187
which is completely covered
with thin strips of paper,

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:19.800
and we've got blowtorches.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.700
Seems like a
terrible idea, right?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.650
So this might seem
incredibly dangerous,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.300
but the paper

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.461
that were surrounded by
is actually crepe paper,

00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.700
and it's actually treated
to be fire resistant.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.360
So while it'll burn,
it's not going to catch fire.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.275
You mean if we start swinging
these blowtorches around,

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:35.130
it's not going to burn
down the whole studio?

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.200
Well, we find out.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.900
Some of you may be surprised
to know that paper

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.300
can be fireproof.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.700
And as excited as we are to
share this surprises with you,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.500
we've also partnered with Bill
and Melinda Gates to share

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.200
with you 9 of their biggest
surprises from 2018.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.900
You can read

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.636
about these surprises
in their annual letter,

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:54.900
which we'll talk about in a bit,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.000
but first, let's learn
some more about this paper.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.100
So we can see

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.100
that we've got plenty of spots
where it got singed,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.000
it got burned.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.900
But even when you got the
blowtorch concentrated on it,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.000
it doesn't go anywhere.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.200
The fire doesn't spread.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.400
This would be
a horrible fire starter.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.200
Would not work at all,
zero out of ten.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.172
As you can see,

00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:19.700
our studio is remarkably
not burned down

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.700
despite being lined with paper
and being hit with fire.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.200
So this fire resistance

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.007
to paper is
what we're trying to do today.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.300
We're going to take a look
at a few different recipes

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.500
of doing this at home,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.400
and see which one
works the best.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.600
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.200
We've got three different
recipes we're going to test

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.400
to try and make paper
more fire resistant.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.250
We'll see how they hold up
against the stove, a lighter,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.620
and a blowtorch.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.394
Alright, we've now
seen the commercially

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.020
available fire-resistant paper.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.500
Let's clean up a little bit,
and see if we can make our own.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.920
We do have another type of
pre-made heat-resistant paper,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.644
and that's called
parchment paper,

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:55.086
which is usually for baking.

00:01:55.086 --> 00:01:57.303
So parchment paper
is treated with silicone,

00:01:57.303 --> 00:01:58.153
and that makes it

00:01:58.153 --> 00:02:00.403
so that it's slightly
more moisture resistant,

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:02.100
but also fairly heat-resistant.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.300
However, heat-resistant
does not mean

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.970
that it is burn resistant.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.000
Parchment paper is designed
to go in ovens,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.098
and while it's great
for things not sticking to it,

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.450
and it not burning
up in an oven,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.500
that doesn't mean
it's actually fireproof.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.136
As Calli's just showing you,
it clearly candle lit on fire,

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:19.077
and it actually says

00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:21.100
on the box to not touch
it to an open flame.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.815
We've got three
different recipes

00:02:22.815 --> 00:02:25.757
that we want to try to make
this fire resistant paper.

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:28.700
The first is what I found
online talking about how you

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.602
can use water with some borax

00:02:30.602 --> 00:02:33.028
and some boric acid
dissolved into it,

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.800
and soak the paper in that.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.900
For our second recipe,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.200
we are going to be doing
basically the same thing,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500
except we are substituting
our water for methanol.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500
Methanol is going
to evaporate much faster

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800
than water so our dry times
going to be a lot quicker.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.445
It also won't make
our paper wrinkle.

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:47.284
As a third recipe,

00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:49.800
we're using one that's
something Grant has shown you

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.100
before quite a while ago.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.982
He showed you how to make
your own rocket wadding.

00:02:53.982 --> 00:02:54.796
This is paper

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:57.800
that goes in between the end
of the burning fuel,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.709
and the parachute
before it gets launched out.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.000
You don't want your parachute
to melt or light on fire.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.800
So you use a heat resistant
wadding in between the two

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800
so it will still pop
the parachute out,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.760
but not add too much heat to it.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.295
And what he used for that was
just water and baking soda,

00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:13.731
soak the paper in that,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.420
pull it out,
let it dry,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.900
and that created a fire
resistant paper as well.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.742
So we're going to try
all three of these,

00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:21.400
and we're going
to see the advantages

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.900
and disadvantages of each one.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.900
So for our first recipe,
we have a bowl of hot water.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.400
We've got 4 cups of hot water,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.800
and we're going to add
1/4 cup of borax

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.600
and 1/4 cup of boric acid.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.780
[Music]

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.480
Stir it all up.

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:36.321
Let it dissolve.

00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:38.000
While she's stirring
that one up,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.900
I'm going to get

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.540
our methanol version
of the same thing going.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.140
We're not going to have
as much of this.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.000
We're just going to use one
of these little containers,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.400
and we're going to do
about two tablespoons

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.190
each of the borax
in the boric acid.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.180
[Music]

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.940
All right, here we go.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.780
We've got methanol with borax
and boric acid in it.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.700
So what's fun about this
is you may have seen us

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.177
before using methanol

00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:10.000
and boric acid
with pretty fun effect.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.400
Green fire.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.280
[Music]

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.100
Now, Callie has poured her
solution into this pan already,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.300
and it doesn't mix

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.900
into the methanol quite as
well as it does into the water.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.569
So we're just gonna let
this sit, and see

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.448
if any of the powder settles
out to the bottom,

00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:28.651
and then we'll try and pour it
off the top in the pan.

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:29.926
While we're waiting for that,

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:32.300
we're going to start mixing
up our baking soda as well.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.800
The good thing
about the baking soda is

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.400
that you just keep mixing it in,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.999
and once it doesn't
dissolve anymore, any

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.300
that didn't dissolve we'll just
settle out of the bottom,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.500
and then you can pour it off.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.794
We've now got
our three pieces of paper,

00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:44.700
and they all say

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.373
what we're going
to be soaking them in.

00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:48.390
So we've got the water
and sodium bicarbonate,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.560
also known as baking soda.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.074
We've got the methanol, borax,

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:52.824
and boric acid going
with the water,

00:04:52.824 --> 00:04:54.020
borax and boric acid.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.600
We're going to take one
of these pieces of papers,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.917
and thoroughly soak them,

00:04:56.917 --> 00:04:59.500
like really let them absorb
the liquid all the way

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.900
through the fibers of the paper,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.920
and we have to take them
out and let them dry.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.400
[Music]

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.100
Now, trying to make
fire proof paper

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.900
using methanol may seem
a little counterintuitive,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.081
because as we showed,

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.989
methanol is flammable,
and with boric acid in it,

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:17.720
it burns green.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.500
While these dry,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.200
let's talk about Bill and
Melinda Gates' annual letter.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.400
Guys, some of you
may be surprised to know

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.160
that paper can be fireproof.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.300
But what you may be even
more surprised to know is

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.500
that textbooks are actually
becoming obsolete in the US.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.000
Students who are using digital
tools have actually been found

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.500
to be getting better grades,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.700
and this is just one

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.600
of the 9 surprises
the Gates found in 2018.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.120
We both had our own share
of surprises in 2018.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.900
Calli, what would you say was
your number one 2018 surprise?

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.260
I joined a YouTube channel.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.900
Where you not planning
on that ahead of time?

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.160
Setting out a New Year's
resolution for 2018?

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.600
You know, I think

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.400
the application went out
sometime in about March.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.780
At the time,
I was a sculptor,

00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:01.700
I was an illustration student.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.440
This came out
of left field,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.600
and I was honored,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.100
and just so excited to be
a part of this channel.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.982
It was amazing.

00:06:07.982 --> 00:06:10.400
The guys have been
fantastic to work with,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.900
but no, this blew me away.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.500
This has been a dream come true,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.700
but this was probably one
of the biggest surprises

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.600
of my life.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.100
Very cool.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.753
For me surprises in 2018,
especially about the channel,

00:06:22.753 --> 00:06:26.000
I have to say I was
super surprised at

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.704
what videos did really well,

00:06:27.704 --> 00:06:30.380
and what videos
seem to underperform.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.400
Some of the highest
performing videos were things

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.300
like putting food
in a vacuum chamber,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.100
and seeing what happens if you
try and melt magnets down,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.934
and they really
took off a lot more

00:06:38.934 --> 00:06:40.500
than I was expecting them to.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.800
And some of the ones

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.820
that I kind of personally
thought were really cool,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.900
I was like, oh,
this is going to be so great.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.700
They just kind of
didn't go anywhere.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.688
So it's fun to see
what other people are

00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:51.041
the most interested in,

00:06:51.041 --> 00:06:53.000
and see what
the results are from that.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.700
While we experienced
our own surprises in 2018,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.700
the Gates shared 9 of theirs
in their annual letter.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.300

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.605
read the surprises they've
encountered in their work,

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:03.549
and how those moments

00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:06.300
are prodding them to help
make the world a better place.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.700
I think they're all dry.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.880
I think so.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.000
Taste kind of like baking soda.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.900
Do you regret that?

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.600
A little bit.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
I regret it for you.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.100
Thanks.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.700
Now, we want to do some tests.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.000
We want to apply heat to these.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.100
I'm thinking a stovetop?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.000
Sounds good.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.500
A lighter.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.100
Yep.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.900
And a blowtorch.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.800
That's my favorite.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.390
All right.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.223
To start off,

00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:29.400
we've got a control
piece of paper.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.060
It's just paper.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.400
There's nothing even
printed on it,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.600
and it's not treated
with anything fireproof.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.200
We've got a pretty
hot stove going here.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.500
We're going to see what it does.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.850
Water and baking soda.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.370
Here it goes.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.445
I'm gonna set it on one corner.

00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:45.420
Whoa!

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.900
That very very
quickly turned dark.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.100
That went so much faster
than the regular paper.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.900
It did.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.519
I'm just curious.

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:55.020
What is it heat different

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.150
&gt;&gt; that the stove just heat up?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.517
Stove have already been hotter.

00:07:57.517 --> 00:07:58.400
Is that what did it?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.880
Well, it was different.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.880
Oh.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.200
&gt;&gt; Well.
&gt;&gt; It is on fire.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.600
Okay, so the stove wasn't
properly heated the first test,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600
for our second test,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.800
it was, and this lit
on fire very quickly.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.816
So initially, I thought,
oh, it's doing terrible.

00:08:15.816 --> 00:08:17.200
It just burns so fast.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.250
But then, compared to
our properly heated stove test,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.520
that actually did great.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.800
It didn't light on fire.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.960
Water, borax, boric acid.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.480
Here it goes.

00:08:31.223 --> 00:08:32.376
Already better.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.020
Charring.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.860
Shrinking weirdly.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.480
That's amazing.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.800
Really not lighting
on fire though.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.440
Not at all.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.400
So even this part
that's like the ember,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.500
that's going way slower

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.900
than the other stuff, and we do
not have any flames right here.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.200
Finally, the methanol,
borax and boric acid.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.440
Turning black.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.220
Wow.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.800
Shriveling.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.200
&gt;&gt; And it's on fire.
&gt;&gt; And it's on fire.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.400
And it's green.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.600
Let's move on to lighters.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.100
Yes.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.580
Water, borax, boric acid.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.520
1, 2...

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.540
6, 7, 8...

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.820
10, 11, 12.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.040
I don't think--

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.440
I don't think
it's gonna catch on fire.

00:09:13.443 --> 00:09:14.500
It's not catching on fire.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.088
So it's burning, obviously,

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:19.100
and it actually seemed
to burn almost the same speed,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.237
maybe a little bit slower,

00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:22.600
maybe took like an extra second
before it turned black.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.888
But it didn't catch on fire.

00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:25.341
Methanol, borax, and boric acid.

00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:27.620
Now, this one, we got to light
on fire with the stove.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.691
We did and it was green.

00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:30.298
A little bit
of green flame in there.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.460
1, 2...

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.340
6, 7, 8, 10...

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.400
I thought I saw
some flame coming off it,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.260
but it--

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.420
Oh little.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.760
Tiny tiny bits of flame.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.777
Just little bit.

00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:46.048
Just barely catches.

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:48.280
But as soon as the
heat source goes away--

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:48.980
Yep.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.800
Baking soda.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.000
&gt;&gt; That turned black much faster.
&gt;&gt; It's on fire.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.178
It was on fire for a second.

00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:55.200
It was on fire for a second,
but then I went out.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.499
So, so far, I would say
that two for two,

00:09:57.499 --> 00:09:58.500
our water, borax,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.100
and boric acid
is doing the best.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.700
Well, should we try our torches?

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.600
Yeah, we should.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.040
All right.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.200
Blowtorch.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.800
Regularly paper.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.547
This is going
to take a long time.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.480
1, 2--

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.400
That's about one second.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.600
Water, borax, and boric acid.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.360
1, 2--

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.100
Well...

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.880
But it didn't stay.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.100
About the same amount
of time to start burning,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.000
but it's not burning anymore.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.100
That's weird.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:31.800
Yeah.

00:10:35.073 --> 00:10:36.226
Goes right out.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.600
Methanol, boric acid, and borax.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.240
&gt;&gt; That one's staying as a flame.
&gt;&gt; Still on fire.

00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:47.900
Yeah.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.900
Still on fire.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.100
It's spreading a little--
Oh, and now, it's out.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.500
Baking soda and water.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.600
Here it goes.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.160
1, 2--

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.400
Still on fire.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.940
Still on fire.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.260
It's now out.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.900
I think the accelerant is gone.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.930
I don't think there's
any methanol traces left

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.200
that's making it burn better.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.100
But I think the water
is doing a better job

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.773
of dissolving the two chemicals,

00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:13.500
and really getting
them to spread,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.000
and really get into all
of the fibers of the paper.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.400
That's my guess.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400
I like it.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.800
So our water, borax,

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.171
and boric acid is definitely
more flame resistant than any

00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:24.000
of the others.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So, can you make
fire resistant paper?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.842
Yes, you can make
fire resistant paper,

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:29.200
and it's not that difficult.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.600
No, most of these supplies
you can find,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.350
the easiest one obviously
will be baking soda and water.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.566
If you really want
the best fire resistance,

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:37.696
then the water, borax,

00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:39.700
and boric acid is
your best combination.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.950
That stuff really does not like
to spread a flame.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.000
It acted quite a bit
like the crepe paper.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.572
It really did.

00:11:44.572 --> 00:11:46.228
As long as there is
direct heat on it,

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:46.900
it was burning.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.500
But as soon as you
take that off,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.700
it just kind of goes out.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.500
Thanks again to Bill and Melinda Gates
for sponsoring this video,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.281
