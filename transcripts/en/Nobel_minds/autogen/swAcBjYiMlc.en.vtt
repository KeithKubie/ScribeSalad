from Yale University so what did they

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
from Yale University so what did they
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.400
from Yale University so what did they
accomplished so their research has lots

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
accomplished so their research has lots
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.080
accomplished so their research has lots
been about you know how well do

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
been about you know how well do
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060
been about you know how well do
financial markets actually work

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
financial markets actually work
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.070
financial markets actually work
financial markets are really important

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080
financial markets are really important
 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.470
financial markets are really important
for the economy because they decide a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
for the economy because they decide a
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.390
for the economy because they decide a
lot on what people invest in how people

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400
lot on what people invest in how people
 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.760
lot on what people invest in how people
save so we really want to understand

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
save so we really want to understand
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.890
save so we really want to understand
whether these markets work well and when

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900
whether these markets work well and when
 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.260
whether these markets work well and when
they work well and or if we should do

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
they work well and or if we should do
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.910
they work well and or if we should do
something about it so that's basically

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
something about it so that's basically
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.890
something about it so that's basically
what their research has has been focused

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900
what their research has has been focused
 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.190
what their research has has been focused
on now it's been what we call empirical

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200
on now it's been what we call empirical
 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.810
on now it's been what we call empirical
which means that these all these three

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
which means that these all these three
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.730
which means that these all these three
researchers are about looking at data

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740
researchers are about looking at data
 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.800
researchers are about looking at data
and try to see patterns and financial

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810
and try to see patterns and financial
 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.990
and try to see patterns and financial
crisis and a lot of what they've been

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
crisis and a lot of what they've been
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.910
crisis and a lot of what they've been
working on is to look at whether you can

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
working on is to look at whether you can
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250
working on is to look at whether you can
predict how financial market prices

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
predict how financial market prices
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.050
predict how financial market prices
behave in the future based on

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
behave in the future based on
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.050
behave in the future based on
information we have today now this may

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
information we have today now this may
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.760
information we have today now this may
sound a little bit mundane but it turns

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
sound a little bit mundane but it turns
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.060
sound a little bit mundane but it turns
out that this is a very important test

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
out that this is a very important test
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.940
out that this is a very important test
of how well markets work if markets

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
of how well markets work if markets
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130
of how well markets work if markets
actually work well and prices are you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
actually work well and prices are you
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.640
actually work well and prices are you
know correct then we wouldn't expect to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
know correct then we wouldn't expect to
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.010
know correct then we wouldn't expect to
be able to foresee how prices are going

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
be able to foresee how prices are going
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380
be able to foresee how prices are going
to move in the future and Jean Pharma

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
to move in the future and Jean Pharma
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.660
to move in the future and Jean Pharma
who started this line of research he

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
who started this line of research he
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.220
who started this line of research he
looked at what you could predict based

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230
looked at what you could predict based
 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.080
looked at what you could predict based
basically by looking at the stock prices

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
basically by looking at the stock prices
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.080
basically by looking at the stock prices
you know in the yesterday or a couple of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
you know in the yesterday or a couple of
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460
you know in the yesterday or a couple of
days ago whether that had any

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
days ago whether that had any
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440
days ago whether that had any
information about how prices would move

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
information about how prices would move
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.270
information about how prices would move
tomorrow and he actually found that

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
tomorrow and he actually found that
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.560
tomorrow and he actually found that
there wasn't much such predictability

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
there wasn't much such predictability
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.600
there wasn't much such predictability
which actually would imply that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
which actually would imply that
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.550
which actually would imply that
financial markets worked pretty well in

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
financial markets worked pretty well in
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.800
financial markets worked pretty well in
setting prices but it's possible to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
setting prices but it's possible to
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.240
setting prices but it's possible to
predict the future in the longer run

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
predict the future in the longer run
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310
predict the future in the longer run
exactly so this is where Robert Shiller

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
exactly so this is where Robert Shiller
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.260
exactly so this is where Robert Shiller
our second laureate came in so he

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
our second laureate came in so he
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.060
our second laureate came in so he
started looking at horizons on maybe

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
started looking at horizons on maybe
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.610
started looking at horizons on maybe
years decades and actually found that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620
years decades and actually found that
 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.770
years decades and actually found that
you could predict how the stock market

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
you could predict how the stock market
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.300
you could predict how the stock market
was going to do over those types of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
was going to do over those types of
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.080
was going to do over those types of
horizons Bay

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
horizons Bay
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300
horizons Bay
some information today and in particular

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
some information today and in particular
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.220
some information today and in particular
what he found was that if you look at

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
what he found was that if you look at
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.119
what he found was that if you look at
how expensive stocks are relative to

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129
how expensive stocks are relative to
 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.850
how expensive stocks are relative to
fundamental values like the dividends

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860
fundamental values like the dividends
 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.530
fundamental values like the dividends
when stocks seemed expensive you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540
when stocks seemed expensive you
 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.750
when stocks seemed expensive you
actually saw lower returns over the next

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
actually saw lower returns over the next
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.089
actually saw lower returns over the next
three to seven year period compared to

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099
three to seven year period compared to
 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.059
three to seven year period compared to
periods when stocks in cheap where is a

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069
periods when stocks in cheap where is a
 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.190
periods when stocks in cheap where is a
slider it just this means that does this

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
slider it just this means that does this
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.979
slider it just this means that does this
mean that you should buy high dividend

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989
mean that you should buy high dividend
 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.880
mean that you should buy high dividend
stocks well so this is not lit not

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890
stocks well so this is not lit not
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.059
stocks well so this is not lit not
necessarily okay so and this is where

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069
necessarily okay so and this is where
 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.630
necessarily okay so and this is where
also Lars Hanson came in because if you

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
also Lars Hanson came in because if you
 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.580
also Lars Hanson came in because if you
see that periods where the stock market

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
see that periods where the stock market
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.080
see that periods where the stock market
seems to have a low valuation and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090
seems to have a low valuation and
 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.509
seems to have a low valuation and
returns are higher it need not be that

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519
returns are higher it need not be that
 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.400
returns are higher it need not be that
you know it's a good deal to buy stocks

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
you know it's a good deal to buy stocks
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.229
you know it's a good deal to buy stocks
it could actually just be that people

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239
it could actually just be that people
 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.180
it could actually just be that people
perceive the stock market is more risky

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190
perceive the stock market is more risky
 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.390
perceive the stock market is more risky
and investors don't like risk so they

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400
and investors don't like risk so they
 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.190
and investors don't like risk so they
don't want to buy stocks you know it's a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
don't want to buy stocks you know it's a
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.490
don't want to buy stocks you know it's a
in recessions for example and to induce

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500
in recessions for example and to induce
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.770
in recessions for example and to induce
them to actually buy stocks they need to

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
them to actually buy stocks they need to
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.330
them to actually buy stocks they need to
get be compensated for this and you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
get be compensated for this and you
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.009
get be compensated for this and you
would then see this higher return but it

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019
would then see this higher return but it
 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.960
would then see this higher return but it
would be compensation for the risk that

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970
would be compensation for the risk that
 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.240
would be compensation for the risk that
they're taking so that's sort of one

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
they're taking so that's sort of one
 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.129
they're taking so that's sort of one
explanation of this and Lars Hansen has

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139
explanation of this and Lars Hansen has
 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.960
explanation of this and Lars Hansen has
been very important in trying to test

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
been very important in trying to test
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.819
been very important in trying to test
these types of models it turned out that

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829
these types of models it turned out that
 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.069
these types of models it turned out that
the simplest models we had for this did

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079
the simplest models we had for this did
 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.990
the simplest models we had for this did
not really work and loris Hansen show

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000
not really work and loris Hansen show
 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.759
not really work and loris Hansen show
that with their methodologies so now

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769
that with their methodologies so now
 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.650
that with their methodologies so now
we've sort of trying to understand these

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660
we've sort of trying to understand these
 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.449
we've sort of trying to understand these
patterns and trying to understand what

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459
patterns and trying to understand what
 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.220
patterns and trying to understand what
we can build better models of our people

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230
we can build better models of our people
 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.410
we can build better models of our people
perceive risk and also try to understand

what extent these predictability is

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130
what extent these predictability is
 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.009
what extent these predictability is
actually because Marcus don't work well

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019
actually because Marcus don't work well

actually because Marcus don't work well
that markets overreact or on the reactor

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450
that markets overreact or on the reactor
 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.390
that markets overreact or on the reactor
to information so but we've learned that

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400
to information so but we've learned that
 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.339
to information so but we've learned that
the market is always right it's a

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349
the market is always right it's a
 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.470
the market is always right it's a
perfect market so I but then again it

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480
perfect market so I but then again it
 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.960
perfect market so I but then again it
seems like there might so I think this

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
seems like there might so I think this
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.569
seems like there might so I think this
is where the results are very different

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579
is where the results are very different
 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.339
is where the results are very different
depending on what your eyes and you look

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349
depending on what your eyes and you look
 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.650
depending on what your eyes and you look
at so what farm I showed was it if you

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
at so what farm I showed was it if you
 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.690
at so what farm I showed was it if you
look at over shorter I since days or

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700
look at over shorter I since days or
 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.059
look at over shorter I since days or
weeks you know we have no evidence or

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069
weeks you know we have no evidence or
 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.400
weeks you know we have no evidence or
very hardly any evidence that the market

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410
very hardly any evidence that the market
 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.409
very hardly any evidence that the market
wouldn't be right ok so the statement

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419
wouldn't be right ok so the statement
 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.089
wouldn't be right ok so the statement
that the market is right may be true if

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099
that the market is right may be true if
 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.190
that the market is right may be true if
you have a very short to rise now when

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200
you have a very short to rise now when
 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.390
you have a very short to rise now when
we start looking at these longer

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400
we start looking at these longer
 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.640
we start looking at these longer
horizons you know then it's not so clear

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650
horizons you know then it's not so clear
 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.470
horizons you know then it's not so clear
anymore but we always have to think

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480
anymore but we always have to think
 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.270
anymore but we always have to think
about okay is it because stocks are

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
about okay is it because stocks are
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.710
about okay is it because stocks are
risky or is there actually some

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
risky or is there actually some
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.030
risky or is there actually some
mispricing

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040
mispricing
 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.400
mispricing
so the markets are right in the short

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410
so the markets are right in the short
 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.760
so the markets are right in the short
run but less so in the long run at least

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770
run but less so in the long run at least
 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.430
run but less so in the long run at least
that seems to be what the data suggest

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440
that seems to be what the data suggest
 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.790
that seems to be what the data suggest
is we can't detect it's very hard to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800
is we can't detect it's very hard to
 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.830
is we can't detect it's very hard to
detect deviations from efficiency in the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.960
detect deviations from efficiency in the
very short run at least deviations that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970
very short run at least deviations that
 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.940

you can really profit from okay because

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950
you can really profit from okay because

you can really profit from okay because
there are transaction costs in financial

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500
there are transaction costs in financial
 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.230
there are transaction costs in financial
markets while in the longer runs we

actually see this predictability you

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310
actually see this predictability you
 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.340
actually see this predictability you

co-authors came up with these results

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140
co-authors came up with these results
 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.230
co-authors came up with these results
that showed how hard it is to predict

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240
that showed how hard it is to predict
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.050
that showed how hard it is to predict
prices in the short run that was kind of

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060
prices in the short run that was kind of
 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.000

practitioners actually spend lots of
 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.840
practitioners actually spend lots of
time trying to pick the right stocks and

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850
time trying to pick the right stocks and
 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.580

beat the markets over the next week or

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590
beat the markets over the next week or
 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.530
beat the markets over the next week or
month and this research indicated that

portfolio managers now regularly use
these types of factors to guide their

these types of factors to guide their
 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.260
these types of factors to guide their
decisions and whether they should invest

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270
decisions and whether they should invest
 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.270

background and so Eugene fama who is the
 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.280
background and so Eugene fama who is the
oldest of the three he I think his

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290
oldest of the three he I think his
 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.489
oldest of the three he I think his
background was actually in

background was actually in
 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:21.799
