was women having an inability to reach
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.300
was women having an inability to reach
orgasm and that's something that's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
orgasm and that's something that's
 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.280

generation where many women have learned
to self stimulate so that they

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
to self stimulate so that they
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.300
to self stimulate so that they
understand a little more what goes on in

that's taken place statistically and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
that's taken place statistically and
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.950
that's taken place statistically and

in the same way that most boys always
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.020
in the same way that most boys always
knew and did and they've learned about

their own bodies that allows many women
to be more naturally responsive when

to be more naturally responsive when
 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.370

things work better so in general women

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
things work better so in general women
 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.360
things work better so in general women
have caught up a lot with men where I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
have caught up a lot with men where I

think things are lacking is science

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380

focused more on helping them than

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
focused more on helping them than
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.729
focused more on helping them than
helping women and many of us are trying

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739
helping women and many of us are trying
 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.860

to change that so there's a couple areas

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
to change that so there's a couple areas
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.650
to change that so there's a couple areas
that are being looked upon on number one

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
that are being looked upon on number one

is hormonal e we know that testosterone

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
is hormonal e we know that testosterone
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.870
is hormonal e we know that testosterone
is a hormone of desire in both men and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880
is a hormone of desire in both men and
 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.449
is a hormone of desire in both men and
women women have less of it than men do

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459
women women have less of it than men do
 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.090
women women have less of it than men do
so how might we be able to provide women

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100
so how might we be able to provide women
 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.150
so how might we be able to provide women
who are low in testosterone and needing

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160
who are low in testosterone and needing
 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.670
who are low in testosterone and needing
testosterone that hormone without

which we know can come from messing

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900
which we know can come from messing
 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.660
which we know can come from messing
around with people's hormones so there's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670
around with people's hormones so there's
 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.360
around with people's hormones so there's
concern about the consequences of that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
concern about the consequences of that
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.190
concern about the consequences of that
but there's tremendous amount of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
but there's tremendous amount of
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.259
but there's tremendous amount of
research going on right now to

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269
research going on right now to
 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.630
research going on right now to
investigate it and many physicians are

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640
investigate it and many physicians are
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.430
investigate it and many physicians are
carefully using these drugs on an

off-label basis quite effectively with
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.380
off-label basis quite effectively with
their patients so that's on a hormonal

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390
their patients so that's on a hormonal
 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.229
their patients so that's on a hormonal

isn't big enough is there something you

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630
isn't big enough is there something you
 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.260
isn't big enough is there something you
can do

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270
can do
 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.410
can do
that so it's not that these drugs will

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420
that so it's not that these drugs will
 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.810
that so it's not that these drugs will
make somebody's clique so much bigger

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820
make somebody's clique so much bigger
 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.910
make somebody's clique so much bigger
and that that would be a big deal that's

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920
and that that would be a big deal that's
 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.580
and that that would be a big deal that's
not the situation but are there drugs

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590
not the situation but are there drugs
 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.890
not the situation but are there drugs
that might help overcome a woman

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900
that might help overcome a woman

of a disease process where these could
be used in conjunction with counseling

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610
be used in conjunction with counseling

for both her and her partner to help her
be able to be more responsive and that

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830
be able to be more responsive and that
 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.430
be able to be more responsive and that
would be very important and then going

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440
would be very important and then going
 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.280
would be very important and then going
back to our earlier discussion of drugs
