00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Instructor] We're told here that

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.077
f(x) is equal to this infinite series,

00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:05.044
and we need to figure out what is

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:09.943
the third derivative of f,
evaluated at x equals zero.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.026
And like always, pause this
video and see if you can

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:15.493
work it out on your own
before we do it together.

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:17.443
Alright, so there's two
ways to approach this.

00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:19.776
One is we could just take the derivative

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:22.623
of this expression while
it's in sigma notation.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:23.789
The other way you do it is we could just

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.905
expand out f(x) and take
the derivative three times,

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:29.690
and see if we get an answer
that, I guess, makes sense.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.157
Let me do it the second way first.

00:00:31.157 --> 00:00:32.505
Let me just expand it out.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.205
F(x) is equal to, let's see,
when n is equal to zero,

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:38.288
this is negative one to the
zero, which is just one,

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.871
times x, times x to the zero plus three,

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.722
so it's gonna be x to the third

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:49.987
over two times zero, so that's
zero plus one factorial,

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:51.872
so that's just going to be over one.

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:54.620
Then the next term,
when n is equal to one,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.404
well now it's gonna be
negative one to the one,

00:00:57.404 --> 00:00:59.838
so now we're just gonna
have a negative out front.

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:03.254
Negative, and it's gonna be
two times one plus three,

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:06.754
so that's gonna be x to the fifth power

00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:11.887
over two times one plus
one, so it's gonna be

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.719
two plus one is three factorial.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.153
So it's gonna be x to the fifth over six.

00:01:18.153 --> 00:01:21.056
And then when x is equal to two,

00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:23.136
this is going to be positive again,

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:26.719
and it's gonna be x to the seventh power

00:01:27.937 --> 00:01:29.604
over five factorial.

00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:32.519
Is that right? Yeah.

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:34.752
Five factorial, and five factorial...

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:36.852
Actually, let me just write
that out as five factorial.

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:40.636
Five factorial would be,
what, it would be 120.

00:01:40.636 --> 00:01:43.767
It'd be five times four
times six, so it'd be 120.

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:45.437
But we could just keep going minus plus,

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.735
and it goes on and on and on forever.

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:49.963
Well now let's just take the derivatives.

00:01:49.963 --> 00:01:52.896
F'(x) is going to be equal to,

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.712
we're still applying the power rule here,

00:01:54.712 --> 00:01:57.495
it's going to be three x squared

00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:01.412
minus 5/6x to the fourth, plus seven

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.888
over five factorial x to the sixth,

00:02:07.888 --> 00:02:09.452
I'm just applying the power rule,

00:02:09.452 --> 00:02:13.485
minus plus, we just keep going
on and on and on forever.

00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:16.752
The second derivative, f''(x) is going

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:20.335
to be equal to, apply
the power rule again.

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:24.407
It's going to be six x to the
first minus four times five

00:02:24.407 --> 00:02:28.574
over six, I'll just write
that as 20/6x to the third,

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:34.181
plus six times seven, so
it's 42 over five factorial

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.856
x to the fifth, and we're
just gonna keep on going,

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:41.956
minus plus, keep going,
or alternate between minus

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:44.606
something then plus something,
on and on and on forever.

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:46.406
Then we get to the third derivative.

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:48.540
The third derivative is equal to,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.311
let's see, the derivative of six x is six,

00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:56.294
and then we have minus
20 times three is 60/6,

00:02:56.294 --> 00:02:58.699
which of course is 10, x squared,

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.866
plus five times 42 is what,
210 over five factorial

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.232
times x to the fourth power, minus plus

00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:08.865
over and over and over again, and then

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.631
we just evaluate this at zero.

00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:15.221
F'''(0), well, when x is equal to zero,

00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.298
all of these terms with
xes are gonna go to zero,

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.714
and you're just gonna be
left with this six here.

00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:22.881
So f'', the third derivative evaluated

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:25.347
at zero is just equal to six.

00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:27.547
Now another way that we
could've tackled this

00:03:27.547 --> 00:03:30.397
is just kept it in this sigma notation.

00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:34.447
We could've said that f'(x) is equal

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:38.614
to the infinite sum, and
actually, let me line them up.

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:43.208
So this is where we
did f'(x) expanded out,

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:47.375
but we could've said
f'(x) is equal to the sum

00:03:48.372 --> 00:03:50.955
from n equals zero to infinity,

00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:53.974
and you take the derivative here,

00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:56.074
you're gonna get, and
you're taking the derivative

00:03:56.074 --> 00:03:57.891
with respect to x, so for that purpose,

00:03:57.891 --> 00:03:59.516
you assume everything else is,

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:02.840
well, the n is just gonna tell us,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.199
is gonna tell us how we
change from term to term,

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.747
so if we take the derivative
with respect to x here,

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:11.413
use the power rule, bring the
two n plus three out front,

00:04:11.413 --> 00:04:13.949
so it's gonna be negative one to the n

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.349
times two n plus three,
times x to the decrement,

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.099
the exponent, two n plus two over

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:24.387
two n plus one factorial.

00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.238
And then if you wanna take
the second derivative,

00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:30.304
and this is the same thing as this.

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:33.255
If you take the second derivative, f''(x),

00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:35.912
well now we're taking the sum from zero

00:04:35.912 --> 00:04:39.687
to infinity of negative one to the n.

00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:41.770
Let me move over to the right a little bit

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.739
so we have some space.

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:46.587
And now, we take this exponent out front,

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:50.186
so you're gonna have two n plus three

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:54.389
times two n plus two,
all of that's going to be

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.556
over two n plus one factorial,
and this is gonna be

00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:02.554
times x to the two n plus one.

00:05:05.353 --> 00:05:07.707
All I'm doing every time,
it seems really complicated,

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:09.853
I'm just taking the exponent out front,

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:12.190
multiplying it out front,
and then decrementing it.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.219
So two n plus two minus
one is two n plus one.

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.836
And then if I wanna take
the third derivative,

00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:21.819
the third derivative is
the sum where n equals zero

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.119
to infinity, negative one to the n.

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:27.536
We take this, bring it, multiply it,

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:31.151
so we're gonna have two n plus three

00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.734
times two n plus two,
times two n plus one,

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.970
all of that over two n plus one factorial,

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:45.900
and then that is going to be times

00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:51.534
x to the two n power.

00:05:54.172 --> 00:05:58.855
Now let's now evaluate this
thing when x is equal to zero.

00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:03.022
F'''(0) is gonna be the
sum from n equals zero

00:06:05.724 --> 00:06:10.027
to infinity of negative
one to the nth power.

00:06:10.027 --> 00:06:11.688
This is gonna be interesting.

00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:12.831
We're gonna have all of this business,

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.914
two n plus three times two n plus two

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.339
times two n plus one, all of that

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:22.839
over two n plus one factorial,

00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:27.412
times zero to the two n power.

00:06:29.628 --> 00:06:31.328
You might be tempted to say, well, hey,

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:34.046
if zero to these different powers,

00:06:34.046 --> 00:06:36.078
maybe everything's gonna be zero,

00:06:36.078 --> 00:06:37.811
but remember, we're
starting at n equals zero,

00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:40.961
so for any n that's not equal to zero,

00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:43.111
this zero to that power
is just gonna be zero

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.878
and that term's gonna disappear,

00:06:44.878 --> 00:06:47.011
kinda like what we saw
when we expanded it out.

00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:48.343
And so the only term that matters

00:06:48.343 --> 00:06:51.394
here is when n is equal to zero.

00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:54.094
So this is just going to be equal to,

00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:56.228
because for n equals one,
two, three, four, five,

00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:58.660
all the way to infinity,
this thing is gonna dominate.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.243
It's just gonna multiply,
it's gonna be zero.

00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:02.111
You're just gonna zero everything out.

00:07:02.111 --> 00:07:04.409
And so this is just gonna
reduce to the first term,

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.777
when n equals zero,
and when n equals zero,

00:07:06.777 --> 00:07:09.176
it's gonna be negative one to the zero.

00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:12.309
This is gonna be, which is just one.

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:14.959
Let me just write that as one.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.292
Times, this is three times two times one

00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:24.959
over one factorial, and
then times zero to the zero,

00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:29.853
which is equal to one.

00:07:29.853 --> 00:07:32.925
So this is equal to one,
and so this is equal to six.

00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:35.309
Either way, I think
the first way we did it

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:38.492
was a little bit more straightforward,

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:40.910
a little bit more
intuitive, closer to what

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.592
you might have seen
before, but it's important

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:44.742
to realize that we did
the same thing both times,

00:07:44.742 --> 00:07:46.508
we just kept it in the sigma notation

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.309
on this time to the right.

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:51.192
This technique is useful
because you'll see it a lot

00:07:51.192 --> 00:07:53.341
in math, where you might
wanna do things a little

00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:55.841
bit more of a general way,
and so it might be helpful

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.824
to take the derivatives while you stay

00:07:57.824 --> 00:07:59.741
in that sigma notation.
