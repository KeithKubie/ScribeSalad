CAT ALLMAN: Hi, my name's
Cat Allman.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.730
I manage the Google Open
Source outreach team.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.800
My colleague here, Carol Smith,
manages our Google

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.595
Summer of Code program.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:18.340
Hi, Carol.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.120
CAROL SMITH: Hi.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.690
CAT ALLMAN: So please tell
everybody, what is Google

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.100
Summer of Code anyway?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.450
CAROL SMITH: So Google Summer
of Code is an online global

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.870
university outreach program,
and it's intended to get

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.729
students involved in working
on open source software.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.750
And it was born out of the idea
that we wanted students

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.550
to be working during their
summer breaks from university

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.450
to get involved in open source
software development and work

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.270
on things related to what they
were learning in the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.230
university.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.360
And since 2005, it's been
partnering mentoring

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.000
organizations, open source
organizations from outside of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.240
Google, with students to work
on a project over the summer

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.030
time and are mentored by mentors
within their open

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.310
source organization.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.310
CAT ALLMAN: It's
the 10th year.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.210
Are we doing anything special
to celebrate?

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.120
CAROL SMITH: In fact we are.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420
We're doing 10 things to
celebrate since it's the 10th

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.970
anniversary.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.310
But we're doing a few things
that I'm really excited to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.020
talk about it and I
want to highlight.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.780
And one of them is that we're
raising the student stipend by

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.300
10% this year to $5,500 US
dollars, which is really

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.430
exciting for the students
who successfully

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.760
complete the program.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.920
And another thing that we're
doing is we're going to be

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.000
accepting 10% more students
than we ever have before.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.620
And also, we're going to be
accepting 10 more mentoring

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.310
organizations than we
ever have before.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.620
So it's going to be our biggest
year yet in terms of

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.120
more orgs, more students,
and more money.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.540
CAT ALLMAN: Fantastic.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.780
What all are we doing
as part of these 10

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.290
things, besides that?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.890
CAROL SMITH: Well, we're also
going to be doing a lot of

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.810
outreach and trips and travel
to promote the program.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
So we're going to-- our team
members are going to be

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.280
visiting different countries
throughout the year.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.820
And starting now and running
until the end of the year,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.900
we're going to be visiting the
United Kingdom and Canada and

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.120
Poland, Romania and India.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.480
CAT ALLMAN: Wow.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.790
CAROL SMITH: Which
is very exciting.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.110
CAT ALLMAN: Busy people.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
So where can students
go online to learn

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.965
more about the program?

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:12.340
CAROL SMITH: Well, they can
go to a few places.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.180
They can go to your blog
and that is at

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.430
google-opensource.blogspot.com.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.150
They can also subscribe to our
discussion list which is a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.570
Google Groups mailing list, and
they can also visit the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.770
website where we administer the
program from and that's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.762
google-melange.com.

00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:30.260
CAT ALLMAN: Fantastic.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.870
What kinds of information
can they find there?

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.080
CAROL SMITH: So on
google-melange.com they can

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.290
find our frequently asked
questions, which will give

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.260
them more information about the
program and how it runs

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.090
and answer a lot of questions
that they might have.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.880
They can also see student
projects that have happened in

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.490
the past in previous years,
and they can also see

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.500
mentoring organizations
that have

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.160
participated in the past before.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.640
And most importantly, they can
see our timeline where they

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.980
can learn where the
big milestones

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.843
for the program are.

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:58.610
CAT ALLMAN: Great.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.770
So when do applications
actually open?

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.450
CAROL SMITH: So applications
for the mentoring

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.360
organizations that are
interested in participating

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.370
next year open on February
3, 2014.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.680
And the deadline for that
is February 14, 2014.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.190
And applications for our
students open on March 10,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.810
2014, and they end on
March 21, 2014.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.310
But I want to say that I think
if students are interested in

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.770
participating, they really
should just take the time to

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.280
reach out to an open source
organization that they're

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.930
interested in working
with now, and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.030
they can make contact.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.480
The great thing about open
source is that you can

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.985
participate any time you want
outside of GSOC as well.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:36.480
CAT ALLMAN: Fantastic.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.910
Are we doing anything else?

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.210
CAROL SMITH: In fact we are.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.230
We're also going to be doing a
big event next year that's

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.830
going to be celebrating the
10th anniversary, and you

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.780
should stay tuned to our blog
if you're interested in

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.050
learning more about that,
because we're going to be

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.650
announcing things
about that soon.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.310
CAT ALLMAN: Wow.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.210
So we're going to be really
busy, and we hope that you

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.480
will join us.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.070
Please do come and check
out the site.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.750
That's google-melange.com to
learn more about the program.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.850
And if you like what you see,
if you think it would be of

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.990
interest to your friends, your
fellow students, family

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.760
members, please do let
them know about it.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.620
We want to get even more
students involved in free and

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.750
open source software.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.649
And we hope that includes you.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.899
Thanks for watching.
