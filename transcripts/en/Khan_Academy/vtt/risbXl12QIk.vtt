00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:02.568
- [Voiceover] We're talking
about the long essay section

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:05.598
on the AP US History exam.

00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:07.421
In the first video on this essay,

00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:10.335
we talked about general strategy

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.061
for how to approach the essay.

00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.023
You've got 35 minutes to write it.

00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:15.462
So, I recommend you spend

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:17.214
5-10 minutes planning,

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:19.898
and 25-30 minutes writing.

00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:22.266
The question we've decided to answer is

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.437
"Some historians have argued"

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:26.016
"that the New Deal was ultimately"

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:27.676
"conservative in nature."

00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:31.566
"Support, modify, or refute
this interpretation,"

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.563
"providing specific evidence"

00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:35.258
"to justify your answer."

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:36.789
So, we've come to the conclusion that

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.530
there are three different ways we could go

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.144
with answering this question.

00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:42.177
We could say,

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:43.744
yes we think that the New Deal

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:45.544
was ultimately conservative.

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:46.763
We could say,

00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:49.689
no, actually the New
Deal was quite radical.

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:53.086
Or, we could say it was both or neither.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.306
Somewhere in between.

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:56.582
So, we then took the opportunity to just

00:00:56.582 --> 00:01:00.366
brainstorm things that we might bring up

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.655
in an essay like that.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:04.488
What kind of facts are
related to the New Deal?

00:01:04.488 --> 00:01:07.913
We recall that the New Deal
was this series of programs

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:11.129
implemented by President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:12.336
and his administration,

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:15.088
to try to combat the Great Depression.

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:18.246
It contained a real
alphabet soup of agencies

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:20.173
which aimed at trying to

00:01:20.173 --> 00:01:22.239
get work to Americans.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.353
To help Americans who were struggling.

00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:26.315
And, also to try to make sure

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:28.419
that something like this
never happened again.

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:29.905
But, we noted that

00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:33.226
the New Deal ultimately
didn't really work.

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:35.967
Partly because the Supreme Court

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:38.349
rolled back some of its agencies

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.010
as being unconstitutional.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.832
And partly because,

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:44.001
it was actually World War II

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.044
that got the United States

00:01:45.044 --> 00:01:46.659
out of the Great Depression.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.958
Let's take a minute an just pin-point

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.827
some of the themes that have come up

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:52.708
as we've brainstormed these possible

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:53.997
pieces of evidence.

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.713
It seems like we definitely
want to talk about

00:01:56.713 --> 00:02:00.080
the system of government, in general.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.512
And, definitely the economy.

00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:11.596
The economy is really the
heart of the Great Depression.

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:13.021
What else can we think about?

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:14.790
Well, as historians,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.450
we're always interested

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.426
in questions of race and class,

00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:22.394
and gender.

00:02:25.058 --> 00:02:26.359
We're always wondering

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.620
how did things affect
people who were White

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.630
differently than people who were Black?

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.116
How did it affect rich people

00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:34.776
differently than poor people?

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:36.853
Or, women differently than men?

00:02:36.853 --> 00:02:39.524
It's just a really useful
way of thinking about

00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:41.997
how benefits in American society

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:44.900
might not necessarily accrue to everyone.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.920
Okay, so these are some possible themes

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.090
we can cover.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.634
Now, let's ask ourselves,

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:52.455
whether in each of these themes,

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:54.440
the New Deal was something that was

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.505
radical or something
that was conservative?

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:04.423
Okay, government.

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:08.485
Was government, in general, radical?

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:11.295
Or, was it conservative
in this time period?

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.338
Well, I think there's a
good argument to be made

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:15.045
that government was conservative

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:16.624
in this time period.

00:03:16.624 --> 00:03:18.876
Because the United States didn't give up

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:20.467
the democratic system.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.556
Many nations in the world did

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:23.975
in this time period.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:26.578
Think about Germany, which became Fascist

00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:28.052
in this time period.

00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:30.105
So, there's still a commitment

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:32.266
in the New Deal to keeping

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:35.146
the governmental system
of democracy alive.

00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:36.841
Even though the economy has tanked,

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:37.874
no one has said,

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:40.939
"Well, this is a clear example
that democracy doesn't work."

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.948
"So, let's try being Fascist."

00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:45.432
You could also say that
there is a radical change

00:03:45.432 --> 00:03:47.208
in government in this time period.

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:50.064
Because, the government
is now taking on roles

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:52.398
it has never taken on before.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.624
There is just a completely new level

00:03:54.624 --> 00:03:57.561
of intervention in the economy

00:03:57.561 --> 00:03:59.837
by the government that you could say

00:03:59.837 --> 00:04:02.031
is completely radical.

00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:03.691
All right. How about the economy?

00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:05.839
Well, I think there's a good
argument to be made that

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.962
the New Deal was
conservative in the economy.

00:04:08.962 --> 00:04:12.503
Because, the United States
didn't give up capitalism.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.992
Just like the United
States decided that they

00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:18.734
weren't going to give up democracy,

00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:20.288
they weren't going to give up

00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:22.983
the system of capitalism itself.

00:04:22.983 --> 00:04:25.421
The New Deal instead, with things like,

00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:28.869
the NRA, or maybe social security,

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:32.886
was instead designed
to sure up capitalism.

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:35.369
To solve the problems of capitalism.

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.691
Instead of maybe going
towards a completely

00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:39.156
government-run economy.

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:41.055
Or, a completely people-led economy

00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:42.589
like in Communism.

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:44.048
But, you could also say that the economy

00:04:44.048 --> 00:04:46.311
in this time period is really radical.

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:48.402
Because again, there's this massive

00:04:48.402 --> 00:04:50.097
government intervention.

00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:52.174
There's a complete re-write

00:04:52.174 --> 00:04:54.915
of how the United States thinks about

00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:57.806
what the role of government
in the economy is.

00:04:57.806 --> 00:04:59.884
Okay, how about race?

00:04:59.884 --> 00:05:02.843
I think it's pretty easy to argue that

00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:04.215
the New Deal was conservative

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:05.689
in terms of race.

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.500
Because very few people

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.030
think of the 1930s as
this major turning-point

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.047
for civil rights for African-Americans,

00:05:13.047 --> 00:05:14.532
or any other group.

00:05:14.532 --> 00:05:16.112
In most cases,

00:05:16.112 --> 00:05:19.442
the economic pressure
of the Great Depression

00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:22.707
meant that many people who are minorities,

00:05:22.707 --> 00:05:25.040
many women actually lost their jobs

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.490
because of a racist idea that White men

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.661
were more deserving of those jobs.

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.004
So, you might say that,

00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:34.289
the Civil Rights Movement
doesn't happen until later.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.423
You could also talk about the job loss.

00:05:43.794 --> 00:05:45.763
On the flip side, you might talk about

00:05:45.763 --> 00:05:49.304
the opportunity that the
Great Depression gave

00:05:49.304 --> 00:05:52.892
to talk about real economic disparities

00:05:52.892 --> 00:05:55.258
between Whites and other races.

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:56.398
You might even say

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:59.382
Eleanor Roosevelt in this time period

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:04.369
was an essential

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.108
advocate for civil rights.

00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:09.453
Especially, making sure
that the benefits of

00:06:09.453 --> 00:06:11.113
the New Deal trickled down

00:06:11.113 --> 00:06:13.421
in whatever way they could to minorities.

00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:15.380
And that the New Deal itself

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.293
was not intended to separate
African-Americans and Whites

00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:22.500
in jobs, in its benefits.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.764
It was mostly administrators
at the local level

00:06:25.764 --> 00:06:28.260
who might have prevented African-Americans

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.466
from reaping those benefits.

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:32.068
Okay, what about class?

00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:33.838
I think this is a really important one

00:06:33.838 --> 00:06:36.695
because the New Deal is
all about the relationship

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.332
between the rich and the poor.

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:40.460
I think one thing that the New Deal does

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.083
that is very revolutionary,

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:45.196
I know I'm flipping the order here,

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:49.028
is it really makes people
question the idea that

00:06:49.028 --> 00:06:50.966
wealth is earned

00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:55.947
completely without relationship
to one's status in life.

00:06:55.947 --> 00:06:59.314
Right. In the period of the Gilded Age,

00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:01.334
many people said things like,

00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:04.922
"Oh well, the wealthy
people, the White people,"

00:07:04.922 --> 00:07:07.581
"They are in a better position in life"

00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.461
"because they're more deserving."

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:10.588
"They've worked harder."

00:07:10.588 --> 00:07:13.208
"They've may even be racially superior."

00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:14.923
According to the logic of the time.

00:07:14.923 --> 00:07:16.572
And then, the Great Depression

00:07:16.572 --> 00:07:18.406
which affects so many people

00:07:18.406 --> 00:07:21.936
really makes people
re-think this idea that

00:07:21.936 --> 00:07:26.839
wealth and status are connected
to one's personal worth.

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:30.798
So you can say it really
up-ends this idea of

00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:33.178
social Darwinism that

00:07:33.178 --> 00:07:36.209
the fittest, the best in society

00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:38.786
are the ones who are prospering.

00:07:38.786 --> 00:07:40.422
But you can also say that

00:07:40.422 --> 00:07:41.886
in terms of class,

00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:44.661
once again, the New Deal was nothing like

00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:46.669
the revolution in Russia.

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:49.617
There was no massive
redistribution of land.

00:07:49.617 --> 00:07:52.799
There wasn't this great
sense of class consciousness

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:54.402
and workers uprising.

00:07:54.402 --> 00:07:56.175
Instead, it pretty much

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:59.321
continued the patterns of social classes

00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:01.039
that existed before.

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:09.689
In therms of women's
lives in the New Deal,

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.738
you might say that

00:08:11.738 --> 00:08:14.437
things for women might
even have been worse

00:08:14.437 --> 00:08:17.966
in this time period than in the 1920s.

00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:20.834
Because again, as jobs contracted,

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.748
those jobs were often
reserved for White men.

00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:25.583
In fact, some of these programs

00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:27.603
like the Civilian Conservation Corps

00:08:27.603 --> 00:08:29.252
were only for men.

00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:31.585
Only for people who were
considered bread-winners.

00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:33.002
On the radical side,

00:08:33.002 --> 00:08:34.035
you could say that

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.868
the New Deal opened up many new positions

00:08:36.868 --> 00:08:38.608
for women in the federal government.

00:08:38.608 --> 00:08:41.499
For example, Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:43.172
appointed Francis Perkins,

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:46.678
the first ever cabinet
secretary who was a woman.

00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:49.139
You might also even talk about

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:51.136
Eleanor Roosevelt and her own prominence.

00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:54.387
She really transformed the
position of First Lady.

00:08:54.387 --> 00:08:56.686
Which is something that
is going to be important

00:08:56.686 --> 00:08:59.054
throughout the rest of the 20th century.

00:08:59.054 --> 00:09:00.970
You may be noticing here that

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.793
there are good arguements

00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:05.289
for going either way.

00:09:05.289 --> 00:09:06.705
And the fact is,

00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:08.423
either way you argue this

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.872
or even if you choose to
go this route of modifying

00:09:11.872 --> 00:09:16.125
or saying either or both,
radical and conservative.

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:17.422
They're both right.

00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:19.095
So, at this point, you just have to decide

00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:20.685
which way you want to write about,

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.797
and then marshal your
evidence for your essay.

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:26.245
And, we'll get to that in the next video.
