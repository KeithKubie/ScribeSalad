00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:06.610
DR. JAMES GRIME: This is such an
inspiring story, because it

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.000
shows how mathematicians
can save lives.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.880
We're talking about one of
the most famous cipher

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.210
machines of all time.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.350
It's a code machine called the
Enigma machine used by Nazi

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.450
Germany in World War II to send
secret, coded messages.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.640
And we've got one over here.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.605
This is not a copy.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:27.360
This is not a replica.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.020
This is an original Enigma
machine actually used

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.020
in World War II.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.180
This was made in 1936.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.360
It's an army Enigma machine.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.480
Let's see how it works.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.880
So this belongs to a man
called Simon Singh.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.910
He's an author.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.030
He writes popular
science books.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.730
And he lends it to
the University of

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.170
Cambridge, where I work.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.160
This was found in a French
field, I was told, by an

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.490
American cryptographer
after the war.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.530
And he took it home.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.590
So I guess he took it home
as his souvenir.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.700
Yoink, that's mine.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.470
The guy who found it died
about 12 years ago.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.420
And when he died, that's
when Simon

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.480
Singh bought the machine.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.490
We're going to send a message.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.240
Now, we were talking about what
to send before, so we

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.150
send Numberphile.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.230
Let's turn this into
Enigma code.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.820
So I'm going to type
in N to begin with.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.290
And if you can see there,
the letter Y lights up.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770
So N becomes Y. Your
code lights up.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.960
Let's write that down.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.180
Let's do the next letter, U. U
becomes T. Let's do M. And

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.950
I've got H this time.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.990
B. And E is W.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.570
Notice here, we had
Y turn up twice.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.560
And they turned up for two
different letters.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.180
So N became Y, and
then later on, E

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.640
became Y. That's unusual.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.210
The other unusual thing you may
notice is that the two E's

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.590
in Numberphile have turned into
two different letters.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.040
So here, E became Y. But
the second E became W.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.120
Now, this is why the Germans
thought they had an

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.370
unbreakable code.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.060
Old-fashioned code in the past,
pen-and-paper codes that

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.160
they used to use, if you had
the same letter, it would

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.010
become the same letter
in the code.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.290
Enigma is different.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.340
Probably, each time you did it,
you would get a completely

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.870
different code.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.860
Now, if we can break this code--
and by we, I mean the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.950
Polish, the British,
and the Americans--

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.640
if we can break this code in
World War II, we'll be able to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.150
read those German
secret messages,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.360
which is what we did.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.170
So let me show you how
this machine works.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.160
Let me open up the machine.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.300
So we have three things
here at the top.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.810
These things are
called rotors.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.270
And inside those rotors, try
and imagine lots of wiring.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.660
And it's all crisscrossed
wiring as well.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.915
Now, if I press a letter, have
a look what happens.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.590
The rotors move.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.390
When this rotor does a full
turn, it'll kick the next

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.040
rotor one place.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.680
And then, the right-hand
rotor keeps going.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.340
Eventually, the middle rotor
does a full turn, and it will

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.640
kick the left-hand
rotor one place.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.130
So a fast rotor, a middle
rotor, and a slow rotor.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.396
Imagine it like it's hands on
a clock, like you've got a

00:03:12.396 --> 00:03:14.190
minute hand and an hour hand
and a second hand.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.130
That's the idea.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.570
Brilliant machine though
this is, all it is,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.040
really, is just a circuit.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.840
Here is a battery.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.610
You can see that's a modern
battery in there.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.060
We've converted this.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.750
And this battery is connected
to a bulb.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.280
And it lights up.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.620
It's the most simple thing you
can make-- a battery and a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.990
bulb, the bulb lights up.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.460
And that's all it is.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.250
The clever bit is the
wires of the circuit

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.910
are inside the rotors.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.760
So when the wires turn, the
battery will connect to a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.160
different bulb.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.380
Let's try and see that happen.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.760
So I'm going to turn the
wires, and the battery

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.750
connects to this bulb.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.860
Do it again, I'm going to turn
the wires, and the battery

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.090
connects to this bulb.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.940
It changes.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.420
Do it again, turn the wires,
and the battery

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.700
connects to this bulb.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.550
And that's why it changes each
time, because it has moving

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.090
parts inside.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.430
But otherwise, it's just
a simple circuit.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.790
I think we need to know
how to decode.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.435
This would be no good if we
can't decode our message, so

00:04:13.435 --> 00:04:14.400
let's do that.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.440
First of all, we're going to
take our code here, we need to

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.750
know what the setting was.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.870
Now, if you notice, in
the little windows,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.070
we have three numbers.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.640
It's like a combination lock,
like a bike lock.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.070
Now, I took a note of what
those three numbers were.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.770
Those three numbers, when we
started writing Numberphile,

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.500
were a 13, 9, and 21.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.090
So the idea is, you would type
in your message, and you would

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.170
get a code.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.500
The machine itself doesn't
transmit, so you would have to

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.590
write that code on
a piece of paper.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.070
So that piece of paper would be
given to the radio operator

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.930
who would then transmit
the message by

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.760
radio by Morse code.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.760
That would travel miles away.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.400
So now imagine a second German
officer, maybe on a ship

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.080
somewhere in the ocean,
now he's tuning

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.810
into that radio signal.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.950
He can hear the code.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.650
It's coming in, and
he writes it down.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.070
Now, this second officer
will have an

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.380
Enigma machine as well.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.240
And his Enigma machine
is exactly the same

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.680
as the first one.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.790
So there's something
I have to do.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.460
I now need to set these rotors
to the correct position.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.100
So we've got this code over
here, Y-T-H-M-Y and whatever.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.720
Let's type that into the
machine this time

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.210
and see what happens.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:36.800
OK, so we start with Y. Y
becomes N. T becomes U. H

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:50.350
becomes M. M, in the code, is a
B. Y. I. F. And W, finally,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.580
is E. So each rotor has
26 starting places.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.210
In fact, these rotors come
out and swap over.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.060
In fact, again, they had five
rotors to pick from.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.880
They had a box of five rotors.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.350
You would pick three
from a box of five.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.200
And already, we've got thousands
of settings.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.430
And each one will produce
a different code.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.300
So we're going to work out
those combinations.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.540
So the first thing I said was,
we pick three rotors from a

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.410
box of five.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.500
In the first slot, you would
have five rotors to pick from.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.460
Once you've picked that, in the
second place, you would

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.170
have four rotors to pick from.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.660
And in the final place, the
third place, you would have

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.410
three rotors left.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.260
And you multiply those
numbers together.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.022
So it's 5 times 4 times 3.

00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:43.420
So there are 60 ways that you
can put in three rotors from a

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.150
choice of five.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.410
We have 26 starting positions
for each rotor.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.400
So we have 26 choices for the
first one, 26 choices for the

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.920
second one, and 26 choices
for the third one.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.660
And if you do that, you get
26 cubed, which is 17,576.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.850
It gets worse, because the
military, the Army, Air Force,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.820
Navy had something extra.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.900
The commercial machines--

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.900
if you were a bank or a
business, you could buy an

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.140
Enigma machine to use yourself
to send your own secrets.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.130
But the military had
an extra bit.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.750
They had this thing at the
front of the machine.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.460
Now, this is called
a plugboard.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.720
And it's like an old-fashioned
telephone switchboard, like an

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.080
old patchboard.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.800
We have 10 of these wires.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.140
And each of these wires
connect two

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.550
letters into a pair.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.590
So in this case, you might see,
the letter Q is going to

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.990
connect with the letter E. Now
you make 10 of those pairs.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.030
Two letters in a pair
will swap over.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.170
So if Q is connected to E, then
Q and E would swap over.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.530
That's an extra level of
scrambling only available to

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.190
the military.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.840
Now, this had the most number
of combinations.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.370
Now, this calculation is going
to be the hardest calculation,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.960
but we can do it.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.650
So there are 26 letters
in the alphabet.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.310
How many ways to arrange
26 letters?

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.470
Well, it's 26 times 25 times
24 all the way down to 1.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.120
That's 26 factorial.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.550
But we don't want every
combination of 26 letters.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.990
We only want to make 10 pairs.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.550
So that means there are 6
letters left over, which we

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.970
don't care about.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.860
Because we don't care about
them, that means

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.860
we're allowed to divide.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.260
And we're going to divide
by 6 factorial.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.970
Now there are 10 pairs.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.090
We don't care what order
those 10 pairs are in.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.440
Because we don't care
about it, we can

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.220
divide by 10 factorial.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.160
And the last thing to divide
by, 2 letters in a pair.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.540
Well, if I swap them
over, that would

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.720
still be the same pair.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.040
If I had A and B, that's the
same as B and A. That's still

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.080
the same pair.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.560
So I can divide by 2.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.780
And I do that for each pair.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:03.460
There's 10 pairs, so I'm going
to divide by 2 10 times.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.350
Just 2 to power 10.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.640
And that is how many ways that
you can connect 20 letters

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.190
into 10 pairs on the front
of the machine.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.770
How big is that number?

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.824
Shall we do that?

00:09:14.824 --> 00:09:29.370
150 trillion, 738 billion,
274 million, 937,250.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:41.800
So the total, 158 quintillion,
962 quadrillion, 555 trillion,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:54.260
217 billion, 826 million,
360,000 flat.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.040
That is the total number of
ways that you can set the

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.080
Enigma machine.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.530
This would be an army Enigma
machine around about 1939.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.460
-You are telling me that the
Germans would send each other

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.300
messages like Numberphile
or send--

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.530
DR. JAMES GRIME: Yeah, they
did that all the time.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.790
-Or send the U-boat to this
position or whatever.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.480
But how were they telling each
other their plug settings and

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.670
their starting rotor numbers?

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.350
DR. JAMES GRIME: So this
is very important.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.140
So these two people, who are
miles apart, need to have the

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.150
same setting.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.420
Now, the setting was written
down for you

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.710
on a piece of paper.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.950
What they would have is a sheet
of paper like that.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.720
And it would be a big
sheet of paper for

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.450
each day of the month.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.120
So it was a monthly sheet.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.550
For each day of the month, they
told you how to set the

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.070
machine for that day.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.320
If you didn't have this sheet
of paper, you wouldn't know

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.320
what the setting was that you
had to use for that day.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.270
And nice, little story, the Navy
would write these code

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.680
books in soluble ink.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.840
So if you get sunk, if you get
caught, if you throw the code

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.535
book into water, that's how
you keep the secret.

00:10:57.535 --> 00:11:01.570
-It sounds to me that all you
need is an Enigma machine and

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.230
a copy of that book,
and you know

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.900
everything they're saying.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.680
DR. JAMES GRIME: You would do.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.810
So if you had the machine and
you had that code sheet, you

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.000
would be able to decode
all the messages.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.720
Fantastic.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.840
Great.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.520
But we had the machine.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.710
And once we've had the machine,
we can pull it apart

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:19.720
and find out how it works.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.620
Great.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.880
But it was getting those
code sheets.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.980
That was difficult.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.790
They were monthly.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.170
They would change every month.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.030
If you did capture them, which
we did occasionally, you could

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.770
use it until it runs out.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.530
But without a code sheet, you
would have to break the code.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.630
And you would have to do
that with mathematics.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.245
-What was the key?

00:11:38.245 --> 00:11:39.430
What was wrong with Enigma?

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.405
What was its weakness?

00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:43.515
DR. JAMES GRIME: Let's have a
look at what the flaw is in

00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:44.680
the Enigma machine.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.810
So the Germans thought
it was unbreakable,

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.220
but there is a flaw.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.110
If I press a letter K--
