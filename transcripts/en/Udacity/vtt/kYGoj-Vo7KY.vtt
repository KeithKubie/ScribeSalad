00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.890
Now in adapting our form DB
code to use a real database,

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.620
you might have written something
that looks a lot like this.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.860
In the get all posts function, you
connect to a database, make a cursor,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.240
execute a SELECT statement,
format the results appropriately,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.400
close the connection return the posts.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.510
But then to add a post,
connect to the database, make a cursor.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.130
Execute an INSERT that
substitutes in the post content,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.590
commit that to the database and close.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.080
Now, this looks good,
but it isn't quite.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.700
If you're writing a bunch
of different forum app.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.571
Are there any posts that don't
seem to work quite right?

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:48.250
Say what?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.440
Wait a minute.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.180
That looked like a perfectly good post.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.580
Why are we getting this
weird error from it?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.550
Let's go back to our terminal.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.230
Oh, look at this.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.220
We have a trace back from python.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.680
It says programming error.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.620
Syntax error at or near t.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.010
And there's out INSERT statement VALUES.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.020
I can't find a problem.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.930
Let's look back at the code.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.290
So, here's where the post content,
gets sent to the database.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.410
It just gets added into a SQL statement.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.730
Inside single quotes.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.870
Because, we put SQL strings
inside single quotes.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.100
But the database, sees the quote from
the post, and it thinks that's the end

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.760
of a string, and that t is
something it doesn't understand.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.270
By the way,
if your code didn't have this bug,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.240
congratulations, that's awesome.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.900
But stay tuned, because there's more
to this bug than might first appear.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.520
Despite the fact that we had a little
problem, we can still post things.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.020
As long as they don't have
single quotes in them.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.050
But here's something to try.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.280
Single quote.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.215
Close param.

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:52.490
Semi colon.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.720
Don't retype this from what I'm saying.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.800
Copy it from the instructor notes,
and put them into your forum.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.235
Delete from posts.

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:01.166
Semi colon.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.926
Double dash.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:05.090
Post this.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.270
Wait, all, all of our posts are gone.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.050
I thought we had a database here.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.170
Hey, wait a minute.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.790
I thought I saw this one
on the webcomic XKCD.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.590
What we have here is a security hole
called an SQL injection attack.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.610
Some of the post's text is being
treated as a database command,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.500
namely delete from posts.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.158
Which as it happens, means delete
every row from the posts table.

00:02:30.158 --> 00:02:33.220
Well, that stinks.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.390
All those brilliant test
posts we wrote are gone, and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.060
we have a famous security
bug in our code.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.010
How are we going to fix this?

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.710
Well, we might not be able to get
all those great posts back, but

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.850
we should be able to at least
keep it from happening again.
