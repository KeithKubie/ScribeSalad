00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.900
Where we left off after the
meiosis videos is that we had

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.960
two gametes.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.110
We had a sperm and an egg.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.350
Let me draw the sperm.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.790
So you had the sperm and
then you had an egg.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.810
Maybe I'll do the egg in
a different color.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.700
That's the egg, and we all
know how this story goes.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.390
The sperm fertilizes the egg.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.490
And a whole cascade of events
start occurring.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.060
The walls of the egg then become
impervious to other

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.190
sperm so that only one sperm can
get in, but that's not the

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.120
focus of this video.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.300
The focus of this video is how
this fertilized egg develops

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.840
once it has become a zygote.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.920
So after it's fertilized, you
remember from the meiosis

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.680
videos that each of these were
haploid, or that they had--

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.570
oh, I added an extra i there--
that they had half the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.450
contingency of the DNA.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.685
As soon as the sperm fertilizes
this egg, now, all

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.260
of a sudden, you have
a diploid zygote.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.099
Let me do that.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.160
So now let me pick
a nice color.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.620
So now you're going to have a
diploid zygote that's going to

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.570
have a 2N complement of the DNA
material or kind of the

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.320
full complement of what a normal
cell in our human body

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.320
would have. So this is diploid,
and it's a zygote,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.030
which is just a fancy way of
saying the fertilized egg.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.570
And it's now ready
to essentially

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.390
turn into an organism.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.570
So immediately after
fertilization, this zygote

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.470
starts experiencing cleavage.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.620
It's experiencing mitosis,
that's the mechanism, but it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.170
doesn't increase
a lot in size.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.860
So this one right here will then
turn into-- it'll just

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.030
split up via mitosis
into two like that.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.280
And, of course, these are each
2N, and then those are going

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.510
to split into four like that.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.920
And each of these have the same
exact genetic complement

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.750
as that first zygote, and
it keeps splitting.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.930
And this mass of cells, we can
start calling it, this right

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.455
here, this is referred
to as the morula.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910
And actually, it comes from the
word for mulberry because

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.250
it looks like a mulberry.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.930
So actually, let me just kind
of simplify things a little

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.450
bit because we don't
have to start here.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.700
So we start with a zygote.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.215
This is a fertilized egg.

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:38.080
It just starts duplicating via
mitosis, and you end up with a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.860
ball of cells.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.680
It's often going to be a power
of two, because these cells,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.890
at least in the initial stages
are all duplicating all at

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.230
once, and then you
have this morula.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.850
Now, once the morula gets to
about 16 cells or so-- and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.550
we're talking about
four or five days.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.720
This isn't an exact process--
they started differentiating a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.510
little bit, where the outer
cells-- and this kind of turns

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.450
into a sphere.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.880
Let me make it a little
bit more sphere like.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.650
So it starts differentiating
between-- let me make some

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.380
outer cells.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.200
This would be a cross-section
of it.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.150
It's really going to look
more like a sphere.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.950
That's the outer cells and then
you have your inner cells

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.980
on the inside.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.930
These outer cells are called
the trophoblasts.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.560
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:42.480
Let me scroll over.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.250
I don't want to go there.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.430
And then the inner cells, and
this is kind of the crux of

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.550
what this video is all
about-- let me scroll

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.450
down a little bit.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.530
The inner cells-- pick
a suitable color.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.590
The inner cells right there are
called the embryoblast.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.660
And then what's going to happen
is some fluid's going

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.130
to start filling in some
of this gap between the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.790
embryoblast and the trophoblast,
so you're going

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.160
to start having some fluid that
comes in there, and so

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.029
the morula will eventually
look like this, where the

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.480
trophoblast, or the outer
membrane, is kind of this huge

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.760
sphere of cells.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.680
And this is all happening as
they keep replicating.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.620
Mitosis is the mechanism, so now
my trophoblast is going to

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.680
look like that, and then
my embryoblast is going

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.620
to look like this.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:46.160
Sometimes the embryoblast-- so
this is the embryoblast.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.320
Sometimes it's also called the
inner cell mass, so let me

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.570
write that.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.950
And this is what's going to
turn into the organism.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.390
And so, just so you know a
couple of the labels that are

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.910
involved here, if we're dealing
with a mammalian

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.710
organism, and we are mammals,
we call this thing that the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.690
morula turned into is a zygote,
then a morula, then

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.720
the cells of the morula started
to differentiate into

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.190
the trophoblast, or kind of the
outside cells, and then

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.760
the embryoblast. And then you
have this space that forms

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.960
here, and this is just fluid,
and it's called the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.210
blastocoel.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.890
A very non-intuitive spelling
of the coel part of

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.430
blastocoel.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.280
But once this is formed, this is
called a blastocyst. That's

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.800
the entire thing right here.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.460
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.870
This whole thing is called the
blastocyst, and this is the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.120
case in humans.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.120
Now, it can be a very confusing
topic, because a lot

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.940
of times in a lot of books on
biology, you'll say, hey, you

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.580
go from the morula to
the blastula or the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.280
blastosphere stage.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.740
Let me write those words down.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.000
So sometimes you'll say morula,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.250
and you go to blastula.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.760
Sometimes it's called
the blastosphere.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.550
And I want to make it very
clear that these are

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.630
essentially the same stages
in development.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.860
These are just for-- you know,
in a lot of books, they'll

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.100
start talking about frogs or
tadpoles or things like that,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.440
and this applies to them.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.890
While we're talking about
mammals, especially the ones

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.330
that are closely related
to us, the stage is the

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.240
blastocyst stage, and the real
differentiator is when people

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.360
talk about just blastula
and blastospheres.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.290
There isn't necessarily this
differentiation between these

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.480
outermost cells and these
embryonic, or this

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.290
embryoblast, or this inner
cell mass here.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.350
But since the focus of this
video is humans, and really

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.620
that's where I wanted to start
from, because that's what we

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.420
are and that's what's
interesting, we're going to

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.810
focus on the blastocyst.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.310
Now, everything I've talked
about in this video, it was

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.360
really to get to this point,
because what we have here,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.270
these little green cells that
I drew right here in the

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.210
blastocysts, this inner cell
mass, this is what will turn

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.200
into the organism.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.250
And you say, OK, Sal, if that's
the organism, what's

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.980
all of these purple
cells out here?

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.210
This trophoblast out there?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.880
That is going to turn into the
placenta, and I'll do a future

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.595
video where in a human, it'll
turn into a placenta.

00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:35.970
So let me write that down.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.250
It'll turn into the placenta.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.600
And I'll do a whole future video
about I guess how babies

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.320
are born, and I actually learned
a ton about that this

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.580
past year because a baby
was born in our house.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.320
But the placenta is really
kind of what the embryo

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.880
develops inside of, and it's the
interface, especially in

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.260
humans and in mammals, between
the developing fetus and its

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.220
mother, so it kind of is the
exchange mechanism that

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.200
separates their two systems,
but allows the necessary

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.790
functions to go on
between them.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.860
But that's not the focus
of this video.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.680
The focus of this video is the
fact that these cells, which

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.870
at this point are-- they've
differentiated themselves away

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.560
from the placenta cells, but
they still haven't decided

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.540
what they're going to become.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.210
Maybe this cell and its
descendants eventually start

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.640
becoming part of the nervous
system, while these cells

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.540
right here might become muscle
tissue, while these cells

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.750
right here might become
the liver.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.740
These cells right here are
called embryonic stem cells,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.120
and probably the first time in
this video you're hearing a

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.440
term that you might recognize.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.220
So if I were to just take one of
these cells, and actually,

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.890
just to introduce you to another
term, you know, we

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.770
have this zygote.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.030
As soon as it starts dividing,
each of these cells are called

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.930
a blastomere.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.020
And you're probably wondering,
Sal, why does this word blast

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.210
keep appearing in this kind
of embryology video, these

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.130
development videos?

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.480
And that comes from the Greek
for spore: blastos.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.030
So the organism is beginning
to spore out or grow.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.610
I won't go into the word origins
of it, but that's

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.030
where it comes from and that's
why everything has

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.860
this blast in it.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.680
So these are blastomeres.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.970
So when I talk what embryonic
stem cells, I'm talking about

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:34.330
the individual blastomeres
inside of this embryoblast or

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.890
inside of this inner
cell mass.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.780
These words are actually
unusually fun to say.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.160
So each of these is an
embryonic stem cell.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.120
Let me write this down
in a vibrant color.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.190
So each of these right here are
embryonic stem cells, and

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.440
I wanted to get to this.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.530
And the reason why these are
interesting, and I think you

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.760
already know, is that there's
a huge debate around these.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.830
One, these have the potential
to turn into anything, that

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.950
they have this plasticity.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.410
That's another word that
you might hear.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.455
Let me write that down,
too: plasticity.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.920
And the word essentially comes
from, you know, like a plastic

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.130
can turn into anything else.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.630
When we say that something has
plasticity, we're talking

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.780
about its potential
to turn into a lot

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.620
of different things.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.380
So the theory is, and there's
already some trials that seem

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.390
to substantiate this, especially
in some lower

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.070
organisms, that, look, if you
have some damage at some point

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:36.460
in your body-- let me
draw a nerve cell.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.590
Let me say I have a-- I won't
go into the actual mechanics

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.790
of a nerve cell, but let's say
that we have some damage at

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.980
some point on a nerve cell right
there, and because of

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.450
that, someone is paralyzed
or there's some nerve

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.400
dysfunction.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.330
We're dealing with multiple
sclerosis or who knows what.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.280
The idea is, look, we have these
cell here that could

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.650
turn into anything, and we're
just really understanding how

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.410
it knows what to turn into.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.550
It really has to look at its
environment and say, hey, what

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.900
are the guys around me doing,
and maybe that's what helps

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.150
dictate what it does.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.500
But the idea is you take these
things that could turn to

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.740
anything and you put them where
the damage is, you layer

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.910
them where the damage is, and
then they can turn into the

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.510
cell that they need
to turn into.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.990
So in this case, they would
turn into nerve cells.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.220
They would turn to nerve cells
and repair the damage and

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.480
maybe cure the paralysis
for that individual.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.640
So it's a huge, exciting area
of research, and you could

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.700
even, in theory, grow
new organs.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.800
If someone needs a kidney
transplant or a heart

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.690
transplant, maybe in the future,
we could take a colony

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:44.980
of these embryonic stem cells.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.510
Maybe we can put them in some
type of other creature, or who

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.050
knows what, and we can turn it
into a replacement heart or a

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.660
replacement kidney.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.480
So there's a huge amount
of excitement about

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.420
what these can do.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.310
I mean, they could cure a lot of
formerly uncurable diseases

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.350
or provide hope for a
lot of patients who

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.120
might otherwise die.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.870
But obviously, there's
a debate here.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.950
And the debate all revolves
around the issue of if you

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.120
were to go in here and try to
extract one of these cells,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.560
you're going to kill
this embryo.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.160
You're going to kill this
developing embryo, and that

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.670
developing embryo had
the potential to

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.140
become a human being.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.880
It's a potential that obviously
has to be in the

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.520
right environment, and it has
to have a willing mother and

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.820
all of the rest, but it does
have the potential.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.370
And so for those, especially, I
think, in the pro-life camp,

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.280
who say, hey, anything that has
a potential to be a human

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.310
being, that is life and it
should not be killed.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:52.510
So people on that side of the
camp, they're against the

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.510
destroying of this embryo.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.880
I'm not making this video to
take either side to that

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.740
argument, but it's a potential
to turn to a human being.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.010
It's a potential, right?

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.730
So obviously, there's a huge
amount of debate, but now, now

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.310
you know in this video what
people are talking about when

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.690
they say embryonic stem cells.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.680
And obviously, the next question
is, hey, well, why

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.910
don't they just call them stem
cells as opposed to embryonic

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:17.490
stem cells?

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.875
And that's because in all of our
bodies, you do have what

00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:22.850
are called somatic stem cells.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.850
Let me write that down.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:29.000
Somatic or adults stem cells.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.100
And we all have them.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.860
They're in our bone marrow to
help produce red blood cells,

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.160
other parts of our body, but the
problem with somatic stem

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.780
cells is they're not as plastic,
which means that they

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.810
can't form any type of cell
in the human body.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.880
There's an area of research
where people are actually

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.470
maybe trying to make them more
plastic, and if they are able

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.900
to take these somatic stem
cells and make them more

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.290
plastic, it might maybe kill
the need to have these

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.660
embryonic stem cells, although
maybe if they do this too

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.690
good, maybe these will have
the potential to turn into

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.010
human beings as well,
so that could

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.770
become a debatable issue.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.130
But right now, this isn't an
area of debate because, left

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.510
to their own devices, a somatic
stem cell or an adult

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.420
stem cell won't turn into
a human being, while an

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.760
embryonic one, if it is
implanted in a willing mother,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.970
then, of course, it will turn
into a human being.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.210
And I want to make one side
note here, because I don't

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:30.410
want to take any sides on the
debate of-- well, I mean,

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.250
facts are facts.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.900
This does have the potential
to turn into a human being,

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.980
but it also has the potential
to save millions of lives.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.740
Both of those statements are
facts, and then you can decide

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.960
on your own which side of that
argument you'd like to or what

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.670
side of that balance you
would like to kind of

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.210
put your own opinion.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.020
But there's one thing I want
to talk about that in the

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.890
public debate is never
brought up.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.600
So you have this notion of when
you-- to get an embryonic

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.570
stem cell line, and when I say
a stem cell line, I mean you

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.880
take a couple of stem cells, or
let's say you take one stem

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.550
cell, and then you put it in a
Petri dish, and then you allow

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.650
it to just duplicate.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.780
So this one turns into two,
those two turn to four.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.380
Then someone could take one of
these and then put it in their

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.600
own Petri dish.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.200
These are a stem cell line.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.310
They all came from one unique
embryonic stem cell or what

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.950
initially was a blastomere.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.500
So that's what they call
a stem cell line.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.140
So the debate obviously is when
you start an embryonic

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.060
stem cell line, you are
destroying an embryo.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.900
But I want to make the point
here that embryos are being

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.140
destroyed in other processes,
and namely, in-vitro

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.390
fertilization.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.740
And maybe this'll be my next
video: fertilization.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.690
And this is just the notion that
they take a set of eggs

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:49.515
out of a mother.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.430
It's usually a couple that's
having trouble having a child,

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.280
and they take a bunch of
eggs out of the mother.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.940
So let's say they take
maybe 10 to 30

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.000
eggs out of the mother.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.460
They actually perform a surgery,
take them out of the

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.760
ovaries of the mother, and then
they fertilize them with

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.890
semen, either it might come
from the father or a sperm

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.210
donor, so then all of these
becomes zygotes once they're

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.090
fertilized with semen.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.860
So these all become zygotes,
and then they allow them to

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.870
develop, and they usually allow
them to develop to the

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.480
blastocyst stage.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.600
So eventually all of these
turn into blastocysts.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.050
They have a blastocoel in
the center, which is

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.520
this area of fluid.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.920
They have, of course, the
embryo, the inner cell mass in

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.310
them, and what they do is they
look at the ones that they

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.180
deem are healthier or maybe
the ones that are at least

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.400
just not unhealthy, and they'll
take a couple of these

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.160
and they'll implant these into
the mother, so all of this is

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.180
occurring in a Petri dish.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.270
So maybe these four look good,
so they're going to take these

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.840
four, and they're going to
implant these into a mother,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.070
and if all goes well, maybe one
of these will turn into--

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.670
will give the couple a child.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.180
So this one will develop and
maybe the other ones won't.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.520
But if you've seen John &amp; Kate
Plus 8, you know that many

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.349
times they implant a lot of
them in there, just to

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.520
increase the probability that
you get at least one child.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.310
But every now and then, they
implant seven or eight, and

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.680
then you end up with
eight kids.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.150
And that's why in-vitro
fertilization often results in

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.359
kind of these multiple
births, or reality

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.270
television shows on cable.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.330
But what do they do with all
of these other perfectly--

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.110
well, I won't say perfectly
viable, but these are embryos.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.350
They may or may not be perfectly
viable, but you have

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:41.980
these embryos that have the
potential, just like this one

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.680
right here.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.340
These all have the potential
to turn into a human being.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.730
But most fertility clinics,
roughly half of them, they

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.950
either throw these away,
they destroy them, they

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.040
allow them to die.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.690
A lot of these are frozen, but
just the process of freezing

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.370
them kills them and then bonding
them kills them again,

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:04.290
so most of these, the process of
in-vitro fertilization, for

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.740
every one child that has the
potential to develop into a

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.500
full-fledged human being, you're
actually destroying

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.730
tens of very viable embryos.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.550
So at least my take on it is
if you're against-- and I

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.750
generally don't want to take a
side on this, but if you are

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:33.320
against research that involves
embryonic stem cells because

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.580
of the destruction of embryos,
on that same, I guess,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.630
philosophical ground, you
should also be against

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:47.360
in-vitro fertilization because
both of these involve the

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.540
destruction of zygotes.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.520
I think-- well, I won't talk
more about this, because I

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.320
really don't want to take sides,
but I want to show that

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.850
there is kind of an equivalence
here that's

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.755
completely lost in this debate
on whether embryonic stem

00:19:00.755 --> 00:19:02.920
cells should be used because
they have a destruction of

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.980
embryos, because you're
destroying just as many

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.000
embryos in this-- well, I won't
say just as many, but

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.580
you are destroying embryos.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.720
There's hundreds of thousands of
embryos that get destroyed

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.210
and get frozen and obviously
destroyed in that process as

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.120
well through this in-vitro
fertilization process.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.010
So anyway, now hopefully you
have the tools to kind of

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.140
engage in the debate around stem
cells, and you see that

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.870
it all comes from what we
learned about meiosis.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.200
They produce these gametes.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.790
The male gamete fertilizes
a female gamete.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.510
The zygote happens or gets
created and starts splitting

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.490
up the morula, and then it
keeps splitting and it

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.730
differentiates into the
blastocyst, and then this is

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.230
where the stem cells are.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.320
So you already know enough
science to engage in kind of a

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.770
very heated debate.
