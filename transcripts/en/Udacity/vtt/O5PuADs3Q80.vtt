00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.709
Now there was a very early time in my career where I learned a very valuable

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:06.290
lesson. I had just finished up an internship with a great game studio called

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.770
Petroglyph Games and I was actually on an on site interview for a new company.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.794
I got into a light debate with someone during one of my interviews about what

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:17.557
things should be named. More specifically, we were describing what an object is

00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:21.463
that walks around in the world. Unfortunately, I probably got too deep on that

00:00:21.463 --> 00:00:24.518
conversation, and it turns out that I was actually arguing with the technical

00:00:24.518 --> 00:00:29.335
director of the project over a naming convention. Needless to say, I didn't get

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:32.575
the job. The point was this, as game development goes on lots of people have

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:36.221
lots of different names for things. You just spend less time worrying about

00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:40.050
what something called and more time worrying about what it does. Now pretty

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.810
much every game architecture out there is going to have some encompassing

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.570
object that has logic associated with it that may or may not have a visual

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.024
representation and may or may not actually be represented on the server. This

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:55.284
is a basic object that every game has. You can call it an actor or an entity or

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:59.031
a jabberwocky, for all it's concerned. Trust me. Worry less about the

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:02.270
nomenclature of what things are called, you'll get more jobs that way.
