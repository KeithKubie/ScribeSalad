00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050
the United States there's certain
 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.680
the United States there's certain
artists for example Joseph Kossuth who's

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690
artists for example Joseph Kossuth who's
 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.600
artists for example Joseph Kossuth who's
a very major conceptual artist who has a

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610
a very major conceptual artist who has a
 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.660
a very major conceptual artist who has a
much bigger career in Europe than he has

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670
much bigger career in Europe than he has
 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.280
much bigger career in Europe than he has
in the United States the same thing is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290
in the United States the same thing is
 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.870
in the United States the same thing is
true with Lawrence Weiner who just had

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880
true with Lawrence Weiner who just had
