00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.240
The answer is 10x cubed
y + 3xy cubed + 20xy.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.320
This one was a bit trickier.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.150
Let's see how we combine the like terms.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.200
Well first we see that 3x cubed y and
7x cubed y are like terms.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.590
And 9xy and 11xy are like terms.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.520
Let's rearrange things so that our
common terms are next to each other

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.710
remembering that we can rearrange like
this because addition is commutative.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.780
So after some rearranging we
get 3x cubed y plus 7x cubed y

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.629
plus 3xy cubed + 9xy + 11xy.

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.880
Now we can combine the coefficients of
the like terms, 3x cubed y + 7x cubed

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.930
y becomes 10x cubed y, 3xy cubed did

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.399
not have any other like terms to combine
with so we just keep it how it is.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.140
And then we combine 9xy and
11xy to get 20xy.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.720
And this is our final answer.
