00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.803
- [Voiceover] Hi, Dr. Kutz.

00:00:01.803 --> 00:00:02.879
- [Voiceover] Hello,
David. How are you doing?

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.189
- [Voiceover] I'm doing
well. I'm excited to learn

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.034
about this thing we call "the Cold War."

00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:09.797
What is a "cold war" and what makes it

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:11.067
different than a "hot war"?

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:14.142
- [Voiceover] So, a cold
war, and in this case

00:00:14.142 --> 00:00:15.983
it's really,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.087
it might be a term that we could debate.

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:23.941
is a war where the two major combatants

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:27.428
never actually fire bullets at each other

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:28.977
or drop bombs on each other.

00:00:28.977 --> 00:00:32.935
So never in the course
of the Cold War did the

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:37.753
US ever meet the ground
troops with the USSR.

00:00:37.753 --> 00:00:40.311
- [Voiceover] But people
still died in combat.

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:41.383
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:43.628
- [Voiceover] So the Cold
War is kind of fought

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:46.638
through proxy wars. And
these are wars that are

00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:49.488
taking place in other
nations, developing nations

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:53.218
of the world where the US
is supporting one side,

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:56.142
generally the pro-capitalist side,

00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:57.922
and the Soviet Union is supporting

00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:00.182
the other side, a communist side.

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:03.310
So this is the case in the Korean War

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.470
in the 1950s, and then definitely

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.450
the case in the Vietnam War in the 1960s.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.702
- [Voiceover] So the US and
the USSR aren't fighting

00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:15.055
directly but they're kind of
betting on boxing matches,

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:17.469
betting on different fighters
in the same boxing match.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.049
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but
they're not just betting,

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.113
they're also putting money and arms

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:24.422
where their mouth is.

00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:26.899
- [Voiceover] So now if
there are two different

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.508
fighters in the ring, the US is given

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:31.479
the capitalist fighter...

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.399
feeding him...

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.187
- [Voiceover] So you've
got the capitalist fighter

00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:37.162
in one corner and he's
sweaty and he's beaten,

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:39.322
but the US is behind
him with a towel and one

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:41.526
of those water buckets,
splashing water in his face,

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:42.887
like "Get in this fight! Get in there!'

00:01:42.887 --> 00:01:45.987
- [Voiceover] Right. And if necessary,

00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:47.897
tying up his boxing gloves,

00:01:47.897 --> 00:01:49.225
maybe giving him a new pair of shoes.

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:50.545
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:52.477
- [Voiceover] Doing whatever they can...
- [Voiceover] Paying his rent...

00:01:53.477 --> 00:01:56.350
- [Voiceover] Right. Doing everything
that they can... - [Voiceover]
Buying him meals, probably,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.017
like at the Marshall Plan.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:58.366
- [Voiceover] Exactly!

00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.967
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
tell me about these two

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:01.283
combatants. In this corner...

00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:02.782
- [Voiceover] Laughs.

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:05.240
- [Voiceover] Wearing a suit...

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.519
- [Voiceover] (laughs) Is Harry Truman.

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.749
And Harry Truman is the President of the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.677
United States, starting in 1945.

00:02:12.677 --> 00:02:16.141
He was Vice President
to Franklin Roosevelt,

00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.969
who had been the US's
president since 1932,

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:23.292
and who tragically died in 1945.

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:27.982
So Truman is really in charge of ending

00:02:27.992 --> 00:02:30.788
World War II for the
United States and also

00:02:30.788 --> 00:02:32.472
kind of setting up post-war plans.

00:02:32.472 --> 00:02:34.736
- [Voiceover] So he
prosecutes the end of the war.

00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:36.839
He makes the decision
to drop the atom bomb

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.147
on Nagasaki and Hiroshima,

00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:41.954
and he ends the war in both theaters.

00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:43.290
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.890
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.145
- [Voiceover] And...

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:48.670
- [Voiceover] And in the
other corner, wearing a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.110
very fine mustache...

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.159
- [Voiceover] (laughs) Is Joseph Stalin.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.130
And he's the Soviet premier.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.542
He's been in charge since the 1920s.

00:02:59.031 --> 00:03:02.613
And for him, I would
say the most important

00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:05.873
thing that Stalin wanted
after World War II

00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:07.846
was security, shall we say.

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:10.153
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:03:10.153 --> 00:03:13.401
- [Voiceover] So if you
remember your history,

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.727
in World War I

00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:18.187
Germany invaded Russia.

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:20.259
In World War II

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.259
Germany invaded Russia.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.301
- [Voiceover] Oh, I'm seeing a pattern.

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.984
- [Voiceover] And if there's
anything that Stalin wants

00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:27.724
in the post-1945 era,

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:30.457
it is not to be invaded
by Germany anymore.

00:03:30.457 --> 00:03:31.785
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:35.460
- [Voiceover] So he is
very anxious to make sure

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.676
that the world is safe for communism.

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:43.634
He thinks that

00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:46.629
the best way to make sure that

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.886
Russians can continue
the experiments and the

00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:52.183
revolution of communism

00:03:52.183 --> 00:03:56.150
is to have a buffer zone,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.960
shall we say, between Russia
and the rest of Europe.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.482
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:04.650
- [Voiceover] And if he does
that by kind of shoring up

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.965
some puppet governments,
in what we now call the

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:09.779
Eastern Block,

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.619
these nations that had been

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.792
taken over by Hitler

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:17.434
and then when the Soviet Union joined the

00:04:17.434 --> 00:04:19.444
war on the side of the Allies,

00:04:19.444 --> 00:04:21.474
then were retaken over

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.322
by Russia as they fought Hitler back.

00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:26.174
- [Voiceover] Okay. So a lot
of those central European

00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:30.477
countries like Hungary, and
Lithuania, and the former

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:33.320
Czechoslovakia, and the former Yugoslavia.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.900
- [Voiceover] And he had
the advantage of having

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.932
boots on the ground
there because he'd beaten

00:04:38.942 --> 00:04:41.777
back Hitler's invasion,
eventually White Russian

00:04:41.777 --> 00:04:45.173
troops were fighting
against Hitler, and American

00:04:45.173 --> 00:04:47.687
troops who were fighting against Hitler.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:49.581
You know, they meet in Berlin

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.781
at the fall of Hitler,

00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:54.004
and kind of shake hands in Berlin.

00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:56.234
But the advantage that Russia had was

00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:59.352
that they've got a lot more people here.

00:04:59.352 --> 00:05:03.885
They've got most of Europe now,

00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:08.835
at least east of Berlin,

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.307
has Soviet troops on the ground.

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:13.714
- [Voiceover] Sure. So
you've been telling me

00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:16.651
that the Soviet Union did yeoman's work

00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:20.581
in containing and basically
prosecuting the entire

00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:22.238
Eastern Front during World War II.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.746
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and
the Soviet Union actually

00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:28.097
lost 20 million people
during World War II.

00:05:28.107 --> 00:05:32.104
That's just a ludicrous number.

00:05:32.104 --> 00:05:34.901
They lost more than anyone except

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.235
for China and Germany.

00:05:37.235 --> 00:05:39.914
So they feel like they have a real stake

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:41.763
in the outcome of World War II.

00:05:41.763 --> 00:05:45.549
- [Voiceover] So, at the
end of this, what is the

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:47.492
situation in the USSR?

00:05:47.492 --> 00:05:49.642
Like they've conquered
all of this territory

00:05:49.642 --> 00:05:51.748
but are they strong enough

00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:54.110
economically to hold all of it

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.110
and feed everyone?

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.215
- [Voiceover] No, not really.

00:05:57.215 --> 00:06:01.432
In fact, most of Europe
is in pretty dire straits

00:06:01.432 --> 00:06:03.044
if you think about it.

00:06:03.044 --> 00:06:07.142
All of World War II was
really kind of fought,

00:06:07.142 --> 00:06:08.272
right, in Europe...

00:06:08.272 --> 00:06:09.968
- [Voiceover] Right in
the European bread basket.

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:13.925
- [Voiceover] And so
there is serious economic

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:18.716
trouble in the aftermath of World War II.

00:06:18.716 --> 00:06:21.159
People don't have enough to eat.

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.613
They certainly don't have any cash,

00:06:23.613 --> 00:06:25.437
and they don't have any fuel,

00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:28.586
which is very worrisome

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:32.115
in 1946 because of the terrible winter.

00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:35.760
So people are cold and they are hungry.

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:39.633
And when people are
cold and hungry there is

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:43.691
a lot of fuel for a
possible revolution, right?.

00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.468
Even in the 1930s, in the
United States, there's

00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:51.405
a lot of different
political ideas that come up

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:52.935
during the Great Depression.

00:06:52.935 --> 00:06:55.420
Because when your political
system isn't working well,

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.714
you consider other kinds
of political systems.

00:06:57.714 --> 00:07:00.289
- [Voiceover] So the United
States is worried that,

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.101
because of the cold winter
of 1946, and scarcity

00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:05.734
across western Europe,
this blue part of the

00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:07.378
map will turn much redder.

00:07:07.378 --> 00:07:10.307
- [Voiceover] Right. So for
the United States, they're

00:07:10.307 --> 00:07:14.048
worried that communism
is kind of the child

00:07:14.048 --> 00:07:18.315
of hunger and poverty.

00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:22.684
And they're afraid that
because Stalin has so much

00:07:22.684 --> 00:07:27.074
territory in Europe, that
he is really well poised

00:07:27.077 --> 00:07:28.773
to become "Hitler, part two."

00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:30.527
- [Voiceover] Okay. And
that is a sequel the

00:07:30.527 --> 00:07:31.854
United States does not want to see.

00:07:31.854 --> 00:07:33.342
- [Voiceover] No. Absolutely not.

00:07:33.342 --> 00:07:35.198
And if they really learned
anything from World War II,

00:07:35.198 --> 00:07:38.630
it's that appeasement doesn't work, right?

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.885
During the 1930s, many people in the West,

00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:48.719
the prime minister of
England, Neville Chamberlain,

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:52.015
kind of felt like they
didn't want to go back to war

00:07:52.015 --> 00:07:53.957
because World War I is still very much on

00:07:53.957 --> 00:07:56.472
people's minds during the 1930s.

00:07:56.472 --> 00:08:00.176
And so they figured,
let's not confront Hitler

00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:03.538
head on because we're not
up for that right now.

00:08:03.538 --> 00:08:06.945
We're also in the middle
of worldwide depression.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.745
And that helped nothing
because it just meant that

00:08:09.745 --> 00:08:12.450
Hitler could gain a whole lot of territory

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.226
and World War II was
much worse than it might

00:08:15.226 --> 00:08:18.040
have been if they hadn't
gone after Hitler earlier.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.708
- [Voiceover] And stopped the Anschluss.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:20.870
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.640
- [Voiceover] If you stop
the Anschluss, you stop

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.475
the "onschlaught."

00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:25.845
- [Voiceover] (laughs) Exactly.

00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:28.585
So they're really trying

00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:31.495
to say, all right, Stalin, if
he wants to, could probably

00:08:31.495 --> 00:08:35.270
just run his way through
the rest of Europe, right,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.659
with very little resistance,

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.899
because the only nation in the world

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:42.306
that has the military and economic

00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:45.044
power to stop the Soviet
Union is the United States.

00:08:45.044 --> 00:08:47.160
- [Voiceover] Because
their factories and fields

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.403
were not bombed to cinders during the

00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:50.500
European theater.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.640
- [Voiceover] Right. So if they wanna stop

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.854
"Hitler, part two, the Stalin years,"

00:08:55.854 --> 00:08:58.464
then they're going to have to really

00:08:58.464 --> 00:09:01.154
stand up for capitalism

00:09:01.154 --> 00:09:05.900
and also for the kind
of material comforts and

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.179
democratic, what we
call, self-determination.

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:12.901
This is one of the most
important ideas to come

00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.531
out of the alliance
between the United States

00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:20.503
and Britain, which is that
the citizens of a region

00:09:20.503 --> 00:09:22.500
should have the right to decide their own

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.674
form of government.

00:09:23.674 --> 00:09:27.662
- [Voiceover] And they think
of the Soviets as being

00:09:27.662 --> 00:09:31.136
totalitarians. And that's
not a wrong assessment

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:33.983
because there is a very
strong totalitarian control

00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:36.823
coming out of Moscow and the Soviet Union.

00:09:36.823 --> 00:09:39.815
So they say, If we're going to keep Europe

00:09:39.815 --> 00:09:42.999
from turning all red, all communist,

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:46.988
then we're going to need
to kind of shore up Europe.

00:09:46.988 --> 00:09:49.471
They think of communism
as kind of being a little

00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:51.559
bit like a flood, shall we say,

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:54.899
that you gotta, you gotta put sandbags

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:57.762
around the edges of communism.

00:09:57.772 --> 00:10:00.676
Otherwise, it's gonna leak out.

00:10:00.676 --> 00:10:03.642
- [Voiceover] So is the
United States and their allies

00:10:03.642 --> 00:10:06.022
also interested in
creating their own kind of

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:09.428
light blue buffer zone, also
next to the Eastern Block?

00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:10.838
Or are they interested in...

00:10:10.848 --> 00:10:13.265
Is this when we get into
the creation of NATO?

00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:15.355
- [Voiceover] NATO really comes out of an

00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:19.642
understanding that World
War II has not created peace

00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:23.660
and so the US is going to have to

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.871
forego their more than a century-long

00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:30.733
commitment to being isolationist

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:33.893
and take a stronger role in the world.

00:10:33.893 --> 00:10:35.899
- [Voiceover] So, okay,
for the folks at home, what

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:38.652
does NATO stand for? North
Atlantic Treaty Organization?

00:10:38.652 --> 00:10:41.540
- [Voiceover] North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.011
And this is a defensive alliance

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.047
between, at first, 12 nations,

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:55.197
which say that an attack on one

00:10:55.197 --> 00:10:57.100
will be treated as an attack on all.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.832
- [Voiceover] Gotcha! Well,
that sounds like they're

00:10:59.832 --> 00:11:02.142
maneuvering their boxers into position

00:11:02.142 --> 00:11:05.064
and rubbing the shoulders
and getting them ready.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.478
- [Voiceover] Yes. Very much so.

00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:08.660
And I think one of the tragedies

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.660
of the post-war era

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.100
is that maybe things didn't
have to be like this?

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.990
Right after the US and the USSR had worked

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.169
together to defeat Hitler,

00:11:21.169 --> 00:11:23.699
it might have possible for them

00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:25.488
to coexist peacefully?

00:11:25.488 --> 00:11:30.151
But I think they both had
the idea that the other

00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:32.503
economic system, and we're talking about

00:11:32.503 --> 00:11:35.203
communism and capitalism,
were just kind of

00:11:35.203 --> 00:11:38.402
riddled with internal
inconsistencies and that

00:11:38.402 --> 00:11:41.676
eventually the world
would be all capitalist

00:11:41.676 --> 00:11:43.880
or all communist.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.159
And they were going to have to really

00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:49.188
marshal all of their resources behind

00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:52.677
their chosen boxer or
they were gonna lose.

00:11:52.677 --> 00:11:53.971
- [Voiceover] Sounds
like a fight that's gonna

00:11:53.971 --> 00:11:55.124
take a long time.

00:11:55.124 --> 00:11:56.340
- [Voiceover] And it did.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.450
- [Voiceover] End round one!
