00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.630
 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.050
My name is Patience Thomson,
born Bragg.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.280
I was the youngest child of
William Lawrence Bragg and the

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.870
granddaughter of WH Bragg, whom
I just dimly remember.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.350
We have this bust of
my father, which

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.570
I absolutely love.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.880
It's a very, very
good likeness.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.190
It moves and stirs me
every time I see it.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.220
William Henry and William
Lawrence Bragg were the first

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.000
father and son team to win a
Nobel Prize for a discovery

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.550
that shone a new light on the
structure of our world.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.750
And it all started
with an x-ray.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.540
Most people know what an x-ray
is, or they think of the

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.000
shadowy photograph that they've
seen of a broken leg

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.220
or a broken arm.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.410
So they know that x-rays is a
powerful special type of light

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.500
and that it can pass through
most forms of matter and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.310
certainly can pass through
biological tissue.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.209
But it's absorbed by
bone, which is

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.240
why it leaves a shadow.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.340
In 1912, Max von Laue was
firing x-rays at crystal

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.660
samples and becoming
intrigued by the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.420
patterns that were formed.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.580
But he couldn't make complete
sense of what they meant.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.810
WH Bragg showed his
son Lawrence

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.605
these diffraction patterns.

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.680
Well, like everybody else, he
saw a pattern of spots.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.300
But I think he also saw a
puzzle, and a puzzle that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.980
needed to be solved.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.720
He loved detective stories.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.430
That was his great thing.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.140
One of his great mortifications
is that he once

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.320
sat next to Agatha Christie at
dinner and was introduced by

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.330
her married name and didn't
realise who she was.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.450
My mother said afterwards, you
must have had a marvellous

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.710
time sitting next to
Agatha Christie.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.260
And he said, what?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.910
OK.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.840
So maybe Lawrence wouldn't have
made a great detective.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.800
But when it came to piecing
together scientific clues, it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.220
was a different matter.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.870
He just looked at the problem in
a completely different way

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.860
to Laue, and he saw what
the solution was.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.240
He noticed things that other
people didn't notice.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.540
Everybody was looking at those
Laue x-rays and trying to get

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.930
an interpretation.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.030
Typical of my father to
see that, in fact, a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.300
two-dimensional sheet could
be transformed into a

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.760
three-dimensional model.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.520
Ping pong balls and rods.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.670
This is one of the very first
diffraction patterns that the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.710
Braggs themselves would
have taken.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.210
And it's taken from
a crystal of salt.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.430
You can see the very
particular pattern.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.880
Each of these spots represents
the end of a diffracted ray.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.190
And it was their particular
insight that showed us how to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.810
interpret this pattern in terms
of the atomic structure

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.380
within the crystal.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.820
William Henry had been thinking

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.840
of x-rays as particles.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.840
However, Lawrence suddenly had
an insight about the nature of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.940
crystals themselves.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.720
So what is it really that
makes a thing a crystal?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.010
It's its inside arrangement.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.581
It's the fact that the molecules
or atoms in it are

00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.830
in an absolutely regular
pattern, like soldiers on

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.120
parade or like the pattern
of a wallpaper.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.670
The atoms are arranged in layers
or in two-dimensional

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.440
planes that go all the way
through the crystal.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.110
And so he realised that each
one of these acts like a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.160
semi-transparent mirror.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.310
What's happening is that the
x-ray is reflecting off the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.340
top layer but also off the next
layer underneath and off

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.350
the layer underneath that, and
the x-rays bounce off those

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.460
planes in all sorts
of directions.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.650
By thinking of the problem
simply as reflection, he was

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.810
able to figure out how the atoms
were arranged exactly

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.880
and produce this model in fact,
which is the very first

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.390
atomic structure of a
crystalline sample that was

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.990
ever solved.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.110
He liked to make connections.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.210
He liked always to
be building up a

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.930
picture increasing insight.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.640
Scientists finally had the
ability to look at the atomic

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.620
structure of matter.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.080
And they could start to
understand some of the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.140
physical properties of matter,
in terms of the underlying

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.310
atomic structure.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.080
And that was an enormous
breakthrough.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.329
He didn't realise probably at
that stage how massive the

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.360
breakthrough he'd just
made had been.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.220
His solution was almost
always the simplest.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.360
The same in his watercolours,
with the almost professional

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.140
ability to bring out the
important things.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.760
And the same in his articles.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.590
He would give visual
illustrations.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.125
It wasn't tell me.

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:39.000
It was show me.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.100
And it helped to explain why it
is that these two forms of

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.770
carbon have such different
properties.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.780
Diamond is one of the hardest
substances that we know of.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.870
And the atomic structure shows
that that strength arises

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.290
because the atoms are bonded to
each other very closely and

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.290
in all three directions.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.770
Whereas in graphite,
you've got these

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.070
close hexagonal nets.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.290
But the whole structure is
layered, and they can slide

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.820
easy past one another.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.410
Graphite is also a pure
form of carbon,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.440
but it's much softer.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.630
That very softness arises from
the fact that these layers are

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.640
not tightly bonded
to one another.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.431
And that was first revealed
by x-ray crystallography.

00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:19.520
Well, the great, great
breakthrough on

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.240
crystallography came when he was
walking along The Backs in

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.670
Cambridge and suddenly had
a blinding insight.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.200
But it could be when he was
doing the washing up.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.230
He didn't have to be in a
rarefied atmosphere to have

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.530
these ideas.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.090
You felt that his brain was
working all the time and that

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.700
he liked to have some problem
to crunch on.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.140
The Braggs' work on
crystallography was disrupted

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.970
during World War I, with Henry
moving into submarine

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.440
detection and Lawrence being
sent to the front line.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.480
But their insights led to a
shared Nobel Prize in 1915,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.900
with Lawrence becoming the
youngest Nobel winner in

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.280
history at just 25.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.470
My father heard that he had won
the Nobel Prize when he

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.480
was in the trenches.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.690
He was obviously extremely
chuffed and pleased, but I

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.550
think the world was in such
total disarray around him that

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.020
it all must have seemed
rather remote.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.770
He now turned to using science
to fight against the German

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.840
Army's superior weaponry.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.730
The German Army had the upper
hand very often, because they

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.210
had much more powerful guns.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.040
And my father was asked to
establish a system of working

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.000
out, by listening to the sounds
and comparing how long

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.460
it took them to get to various
different points, exactly

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.040
where the location
of the guns were.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.490
In the obituaries on my father,
it did say that his

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.260
team shortened the war, because
they, could put the

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.720
enemy guns out of action.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.720
Back in peace time, the field of
x-ray crystallography went

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.700
from strength to strength.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.300
The discoveries by the Braggs
and their successors kept

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.030
coming, and the technique was
used to solve increasingly

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.880
complex structures, such as
graphite, penicillin, DNA,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.450
and, more recently,
whole viruses.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.400
To date, crystallography
has been a

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.990
feature of 29 Nobel Prizes.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.010
The application of this
technique transformed our

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.290
understanding of matter in so
many different fields, not

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.990
just in geology, understanding
minerals, but in chemistry

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.540
understanding how different
chemicals are built up, and

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.160
then, finally, brought us into
the realm of biology, where we

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.360
could figure out how it is that
the molecules that exist

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.670
within us are coordinated and
work together in order to

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.020
sustain life.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.610
And these days, it's kind of a
shame he's not with us now,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.750
because I think he would just be
enormously impressed to see

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.390
how the technique has developed
even since 1971,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.730
just the size and the scale and
ambition of the types of

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.320
problems that people
are tackling now.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.660
Whole virus particles have been
crystallised and solved.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.350
We are simply getting better
and better at doing

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.260
crystallography.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.300
The Curiosity Rover that NASA
sent to Mars last year has got

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.520
an x-ray diffraction instrument
on the Rover that's

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.220
trundling over the surface.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.060
And so it can pick up samples
of soil, and it can analyse

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.200
the minerals that are
in the soil on Mars.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.470
He liked Agatha Christie, I
think, because in the last

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.550
chapter everything
falls into place.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.680
He liked neat endings.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.100
They're still winning Nobel
Prizes, and I don't see that

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.350
slowing down.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:55.936
