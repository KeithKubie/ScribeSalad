00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.080
Everything we've done with
polynomials so far has been

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.410
either adding or multiplying
them.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.920
But what if we wanted
to go the other way?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.960
What if we actually wanted
to factor a polynomial?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.430
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.670
So let's have the polynomial
3x to the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.470
third power minus 21x.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.770
When I say factor it, I
essentially want to break it

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.670
up into the product of, maybe
polynomials, it could be a

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.290
mononomial, which is
just one term.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.980
And to do that over here, we
could factor out a 3x here.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.230
So if you factor out a 3x this
is equal to 3x times-- what's

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.460
3x to the third divided by 3x?

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.490
Let me write this
way actually.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:53.030
This is the same thing as 3x
times 1/3 x times 3x to the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.160
third minus 21x.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.440
Notice, 3x times 1/3x, I'm
not changing the number.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.830
This is 3x/3x, this is 1.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.190
But the reason why I picked 3x
is because I saw that both of

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.070
these terms are divisible
by 3x.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.340
And you're going to see
that when I divide

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.340
both of them by 3x.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.280
So this is going to be the same
thing as 3x times 3x to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.700
the third over 3x
minus 21x/3x.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.160
And now this is going
to be equal to 3x.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.570
What's this first
term equal to?

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.200
The 3's cancel out.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.910
x to the third divided by x.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.175
We learned in our exponent
rules, you could just subtract

00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:34.200
the exponents there.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.540
That's x times x times x divided
by x, just going to be

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.880
x times x, or just x squared.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.390
So it's going to be, this first
term here is just going

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.580
to be an x squared.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.910
And then the x's cancel
out here.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.630
21 divided by 3 is 7.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.390
x squared minus 7.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.360
And if you multiply them out,
you're going to see you're

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.810
going to get 3x to the
third minus 21x.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.740
Now I went through all of these
steps really, just to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.400
show you exactly
what I'm doing.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.810
But as we progress, you're going
to see that your brain

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.710
will just automatically say,
hey, both of these are

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.440
divisible by 3x, let me factor
out a 3x, and then divide both

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.320
of these terms by 3x to
get x squared minus 7.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.920
Let's do another one.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.830
Let's say we had 4x to
the third plus 10x

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.950
squared minus 2x.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.500
So when I look at this,
immediately what pops out is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.040
that all of these terms are
divisible by 2, and all of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.170
them are divisible by x.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.130
So let me factor out a 2x.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.110
So this is equal to 2x times--
and when we factor out a 2x

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.480
let's divide each of
these terms by 2x.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.990
4x third divided by 2x.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.010
4 divided by 2 is 2.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.390
And then x third divided
by x is x squared.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.070
And then we have plus 10x
squared divided by 2x.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.190
10 divided by 2 is 5.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.850
x squared divided by x is x.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.490
And then finally, negative
2x divided by 2x is

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.170
just negative 1.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.080
And you know, if you don't
believe me, just

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.980
multiply this out.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.480
Distribute the 2x and you
will get exactly this.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.510
So all we see, we try to look
for something that's divisible

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.590
into every term.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.940
We factor it out, factoring it
out, we put it outside of a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.610
parentheses, so to speak.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.250
And then we divide each of those
terms by that factor.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.020
We did that explicitly
up here.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.020
Now you're probably saying,
hey Sal, why are we even

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.390
worried about doing this?

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.170
And the answer is, is it really
helps us solve a lot of

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.790
certain types of polynomial
equations.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.760
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.350
Let's say we have the polynomial
equation 9x squared

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.140
is equal to 27x.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.630
And we want to make sure that
we get all of the x's that

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.400
satisfy this equation.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.485
So let me subtract 27x
from both sides.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.280
So I get something
that equals 0.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.600
And this will be a general trend
whenever you're doing

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.510
polynomial equations, very
oftentimes you will.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.430
The left-hand side becomes
9x squared minus 27x.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.380
The right-hand side becomes 0.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.930
And now over here, we can see
that both of these terms are

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.090
divisible by 9x, right?

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.100
27 is divisible by 9, so is 9.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.370
And they're both
divisible by x.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.140
So let's factor out a 9x.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.140
So 9x squared divided
by 9x is just an x.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.920
And then 27x divided by 9x.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.760
That's negative 27/9
is negative 3.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.530
And then the x divided
by x is just a 1.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.390
So this is 9x times x minus 3--
you can multiply it out to

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.880
verify that these are the
same thing-- is going

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.310
to be equal to 0.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.680
Now this part is interesting.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.750
When I take the product of two
numbers, and I say they're

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.810
equal 0-- let me do a
little aside here.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.400
If I were tell you that a times
b is equal to 0, what

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.630
does that tell us?

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:26.140
That tells us that either
a or b or both are 0.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.190
At least one of these
two have to be 0.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.750
Maybe both of them are going
to be equal to 0.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.340
So we're doing the exact
same thing here.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.940
We're taking the product-- you
can view that as a, you could

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.580
view that as b-- we're taking
the product of two numbers and

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.330
saying that that product
is equal to 0.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.790
So that tells us that either 9x
is going to be equal to 0,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.030
or x minus 3 is going
to be equal to 0.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.320
Either of these, or both of
these, are going to equal 0.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.600
This we know how to solve.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.780
Divide both sides by 9.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.260
You get x is equal to 0.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.510
This we know how to solve.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.760
Add 3 to both sides.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.660
And you're left with x-- because
these cancel out-- is

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.080
equal to 3.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.390
So this equation here actually
had two solutions. x could be

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.930
0, and you can verify that.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.730
0 is equal to 0.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.110
Or x could be equal to 3.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.160
9 times 9 is the same
thing as 27 times 3.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.570
And you might have been able
to figure that out in your

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.280
head, but when you do it this
way you make sure that you get

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.460
all of the solutions
to the problem.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.420
Let's do one more like this.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:38.440
Let's say I had 4a squared
plus a is equal to 0.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.500
Once again, we can
factor an a out.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.590
Both of these terms are
divisible by a, so this is the

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.800
same thing as a times
4a plus 1, right?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.490
When I factor an a out, I took
the a out of the parentheses,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.130
and then I divide each
of these terms by a.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.840
And that's going to
be equal to 0.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.190
So that means either a is equal
to 0, or 4a plus 1 is

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.280
equal to 0.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.690
Well, that's one solution
right from the get go.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.910
And this one right
here, we could

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.490
subtract 1 from both sides.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.090
We get 4a is equal
to negative 1.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.080
And then you could divide
both sides by 4.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.470
And we get a is equal
to negative 1/4.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.190
Now I said that was the last
one, let me do one more.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.870
Because I want to show you,
here, I'm factoring and then

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.020
solving, but I want to show
you how useful a factored

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.540
polynomial is.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.810
So I'm going to start with one
that's already factored.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:40.800
So say I had x minus 5 times 2x
plus 7 times 3x minus 4, is

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.790
equal to 0.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.200
And if you're bored, you can
actually multiply these out

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.830
and you'll find that you get
a third degree polynomial.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.040
But if you want to solve
that being equal to 0,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.190
it'd be very difficult.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.120
But this, we're going to
see, is not too bad.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.980
As we said, if we have three
numbers, if we have a times b

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.970
times c equal to 0, that means
that at least one of these are

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.170
0, maybe more than one.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.260
Either a or b or c, or some
combination of them,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.450
are equal to 0.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.170
So once again, I have
three numbers.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.480
This could be viewed as an a.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.310
This could be viewed as a b.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.070
This could be viewed as a c.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.730
I'm multiplying them and
they're equal to 0.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.500
So that means that either
x minus 5 is equal to 0.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.170
Or 2x plus 7 is equal to 0.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.010
Or 3x minus 4 is equal to 0.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.309
And we can solve each of
these independently.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.020
Add 5 to both sides of this
equation, and you get x is

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.360
equal to 5.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.580
So that's one solution
to this equation.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.799
Over here, subtract
7 from both sides.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.560
You get 2x is equal
to negative 7.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.030
Divide both sides by 2.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.780
You get x is equal to
negative 7 over 2.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.570
That's another solution.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.870
And then finally, add 4 to both
sides of this equation.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.170
You get 3x is equal to 4.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.930
Divide both sides by 3.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.330
You get x is equal to 4/3.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.690
So this third degree polynomial,
if you were to

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.760
multiply it out, actually had
three solutions to that

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.320
polynomial equalling 0.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.530
And we're going to see, these
are actually called roots of

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.260
the polynomial, the x values
that make that polynomial

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:18.900
equal to 0.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.860
But hopefully, you've just
gotten an appreciation for

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.040
one, how to factor a polynomial
in this video, and

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.100
also, why it's useful for
solving polynomial equations.
