00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:31.600
The t-shirt 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.350
is arguably the most popular outer garment
in the entire world.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.030
Coming in a range of styles, colors and sizes
there is quite literally a t-shirt for everyone.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.739
But where did this iconic garment come from
and how did it become so popular?

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.899
Relatively speaking, the t-shirt is a fairly
new addition to our collective wardrobes and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.950
it has only been an acceptable piece of clothing
in its own right for around half a century.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.260
While the garment itself has existed in a
recognisable form (albeit with wider necks

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.940
and shorter sleeves) since the early 20th
century, it was almost universally considered

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
to be underwear and it was rarely, if ever
worn in public.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359
So where did the t-shirt come from?

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.679
It’s thought that it evolved from a kind
of all-in-one underwear made from red flannel

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.049
known as the “union suit” which was popular
with workers in the 19th century.

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.920
The union suit was patented in 1868 in New
York and was based on a similar kind of underwear

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.679
that had been popular with Victorian women.

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.159
While the Union Suit excelled at keeping men
warm, it was all but useless at keeping them

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.140
cool in hot weather, unless that is, it was
cut in half, which many workers did.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.299
In so doing, they inadvertently created the
top half of what many would recognise today

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.140
as “Long Johns”, a similar garment which
consisted of two pieces of long underwear.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.979
Men's-Union-SuitAlthough Long Johns themselves
have existed since the 17th century where

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.810
they were similarly popular with workers and
the poor, they were most popular during the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.090
Victorian Era, along with Union Suits, where
they were advertised to women as a way to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.869
keep their waists trim, via having to wear
fewer layers around the waist, while still

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:02.999
keeping warm.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.299
Unlike Union Suits which have since become
the literal butt of many a comedy gag (thanks

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.700
to the fact they often feature a built-in
flap on the butt), Long Johns have never really

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.530
waned in popularity since and have been keeping
people warm right up until the modern day.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.340
Sometime in the 19th century, the people making
these type of toasty undergarments began experimenting

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.790
with fabrics that could stretch back into
shape to make the product more comfortable.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.620
This resulted in the creation of buttonless
undershirts made from wool and cotton that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.459
you could pull over your head without ruining
the collar.

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.719
Though the exact date these so-called pullovers
were invented, by whom and when workers began

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.989
wearing them isn’t known, we do know that
they absolutely weren’t considered something

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.530
you could wear in your day-to-day life without
something over them.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.269
There were even laws on the books as early
as 1890 in places like Havana stating that

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.989
it was illegal to wear these pullover tops
exposed in public.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.140
The fate of what would become the t-shirt
began to change in 1904, when the Cooper Underwear

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.700
Company began marketing them to single men
as “bachelor undershirts” with a tagline

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.530
that simply read: “No safety pins — no
buttons — no needle — no thread”

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.549
The advertisement played up to the fact that
the “undershirt”, as it was then known,

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.969
consisted of a single piece of fabric that
had no buttons, meaning it would be more durable

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.819
than its buttoned counterpart, with less maintenance.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.560
Why is this important to the history of the
t-shirt?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.389
Because very shortly after this advertisement
ran (about a year), the US Navy, who employed

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.920
many a young bachelor with limited sewing
skills, officially incorporated the button-less

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.499
white undershirt into its uniform.

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:36.030
According to the (1905) Uniform Regulations
of the United States Navy, a full transcript

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.219
of which you can read here, the cotton undershirt
was exactly that- a shirt that had to be worn

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.349
underneath the rest of the sailor’s uniform.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.770
That’s not to say there weren’t exceptions
though; according to the regulations, sailors

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.200
were allowed to wear a light cotton undershirt
“of identical pattern” in warm weather

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.360
at the discretion of their commanding officer
whilst sailors working the engine room were

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.749
allowed to fashion themselves a makeshift
undershirt to make themselves more comfortable

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.079
if they so desired.

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.340
The undershirt came to the attention of the
US Army a few years later during WWI with

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.310
the undershirts soon worn by tens of thousands
of army soldiers, many of whom took the fashion

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.370
home with them.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.590
Shortly after WWI ended in 1920, the author
F.Scott Fitzgerald became the first known

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.000
person to use the word “t-shirt” in print
when he included it in his novel, This Side

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.080
of Paradise as one of the items the main character
takes with him to university.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.870
And, in fact, a very slight tweak on the design
of early t-shirts came about at university,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.069
the invention of the “crew-neck t-shirt”.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:36.729
These were made in 1932 by Jockey International
Inc at the bequest of the University of South

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.560
California, who wanted a lightweight, absorbent
garment its football players could wear underneath

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.810
their jerseys to prevent their pads from rubbing
and chafing.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.639
The resulting style t-shirt was a huge hit
with the team and it wasn’t long before

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.020
students began popularly wearing them.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.889
By the time WWII started, the “modern”
t-shirt had become commonplace in high schools

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.180
and universities across the states, though
it wasn’t yet ubiquitous and was still commonly

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.220
worn by adults, at least, as an undershirt.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.710
(There were many exceptions, of course, particular
among laborers in hot environments, such as

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.710
farmers.)

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.210
The final push for mainstream acceptance of
the t-shirt as an outer garment started at

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.979
the end of WWII, when soldiers returning home
began incorporating them into their casual

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.479
wardrobe, much in the same way they’d done
during the war.

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.580
The popularity of a t-shirt as an outer garment
further surged thanks to Marlon Brando and

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.250
his role as Stanley Kowalski in A Street Car
Named Desire which featured Brando wearing

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.449
a tight fitting (as most were at this point),
bicep caressing t-shirt.

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.210
Brando’s smouldering performance in both
the play and 1951 movie caused a nationwide

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.960
spike in sales of t-shirts, proving to the
world that the t-shirt could be a “sexy,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.770
stand-alone, outer-wear garment“.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.240
It didn’t take that long after for businesses
to realise the marketing potential of these

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.730
mostly blank outer garments, with the likes
of Roy Rogers and Walt Disney among many others

00:05:50.730 --> 00:06:29.690
soon using them for this purpose, popularizing
the now ubiquitous practice of putting designs

00:06:29.690 --> 00:07:15.419
on t-shirts.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:41.509
And 

00:07:41.509 --> 00:08:16.739
the rest, as they say, is history.
