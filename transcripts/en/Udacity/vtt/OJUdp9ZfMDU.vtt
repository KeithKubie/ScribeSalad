00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.995
&gt;&gt; We see from this lesson that there are a variety of different treatment options

00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:05.082
for psychological disorders.

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:08.808
&gt;&gt; Psychologists from a biological perspective may use drugs or psychosurgeries as

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.645
a treatment option.

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:13.895
&gt;&gt; Whereas, some psychologists may favor psychotherapies, such as behavioral

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:18.580
therapy, cognitive therapy, or even humanistic therapy for treatment.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.716
&gt;&gt; And given that so many of these treatments are effective and have evidence to

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:26.566
support them. Many psychologists favor combining them. So for instance, we can

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.294
combine cognitive behavioral therapy, with drug therapy to treat a lot of

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:31.365
different kinds of disorders.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:35.023
&gt;&gt; And we also see that mind and space meditation is rising in popularity for a

00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:38.445
treatment option of disorders such as depression, anxiety, and even

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:44.345
schizophrenia. In addition, if you remember our lesson on consciousness, you'll

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:47.383
recall that there are other positive benefits to mindfulness meditation

00:00:47.383 --> 00:00:52.565
including decreased overall stress levels as well as improved mood. So it'll be

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:55.400
interesting to see in the years to come what further research tells us about

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.200
mindfulness based meditation.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.400
&gt;&gt; And finally, we see that by using a variety of these techniques, a person with

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.450
a mental disorder can live a completely full, happy, productive and very

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.350
enjoyable life, which is great news for all of us.
