The Thirteenth Year. I guess Disney really had a thing about turning kids into mer-people

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.389
Didn't they. Well kind of like Little Mermaid 2 - this one is kind of as least

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.500
Interesting as that one was. Not to say it's awful. It's just not really anything, which is a shame because again

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.639
I don't think this is that bad of premise A mermaid is swimming with her young, baby

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.420
But a man sees her in a boat

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.019
Afraid for her son's safety she drops him off and tries to distract the man in the boat only to have a couple one of them

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.259
Played by Dave Coulier pick him up take him to the police and when nobody claims him they decide to adopt him. The Mermaid mother

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:56.939
Surprisingly, just kind of stays away for 13 years until suddenly the boy named Cody starts to notice certain changes

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.940
He's swimming faster. He's growing gills. He has

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.239
Electricity? Oh and he can stick to walls um yeah

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.850
And vampires sparkle. His parents don't know what to make of it. The doctor just says it's puberty

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.900
Yeah, second opinion much? Only his nerdy best friend can figure out what it is. He's turning into a merman

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.310
How does he know? Because his father is the one that saw his mother years ago!

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.910
Oh small world

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.419
The rest of the story is just him coming to grips with his

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.589
powers trying to find his real mother while also keeping his girlfriend while not embarrassing himself while also trying to make the swim team and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.040
the championships

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.520
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, it's about as generic as it gets

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.480
There's a ton of things that don't make sense in this movie like I said before the mother staying away for 13 years come on

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.230
She couldn't flop on to the beach and get someone's attention or something just

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.629
Destroy the mystery. It's your freaking kid

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.370
Hell she distracts the man in the boat by showing off what she is and he's like oh my god

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.989
I gotta prove mermaids are real and everything what she showed off to that guy why couldn't she show off to other people?

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.409
Keep it a secret. Why is it even a secret? Why don't you use your?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.470
Electric powers that you suddenly have yeah, I guess they kind of make a connection to electric eels

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.749
But that doesn't explain why they can stick to walls

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.929
Everyone is just a little off too. Like the swim team makes fun of him because he always comes in second.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.490
Comes in second that's impressive Even the girlfriend for his birthday. Just gives a picture of herself

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.180
that's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.709
Strangely narcissistic, and then she just closes her eyes waiting for a kiss everything this movie is just a little off

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.070
There's another scene where his hands are sticky, and he's shaking him off, and then the mother just starts doing it, too

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.080
And then the father comes in and starts doing it, but what's even going on here? This isn't quirky strange

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.040
This is just strange strange even Cody's performance is a little strange. I mean it's not laughably bad

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.850
I mean he's not over-the-top or too goofy, but maybe that's kind of the problem, too. He doesn't really stand out

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.659
He's just kind of boring. He's the every kid to a fault

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.769
You can't really imagine yourself in his shoes because he doesn't have much of a reaction

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.500
I don't know if he was written that way or directed that way

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.800
But it just doesn't come across as anything the only thing

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.969
I really took out of this movie strangely enough is the guy that sees the mermaid?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.779
Originally you may recognize him from a few Sam Raimi movies like a simple plan

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.619
And he always kind of plays this southern redneck bumpkin

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.160
He always does this part really well to a point where it's actually

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.920
Legitimately dramatic the part where he's talking to his son about what he believes and he can help it

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.399
And is he crazy looking for other people crazier than him. It's actually kind of touching. I always got a perk up every time

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.220
He's in a movie. It's always interesting but aside from that when Dave Coulier is your next most credible actor

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.649
You kind of know you're not in a good spot like I said, I can't say this movie is terrible

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.630
It wasn't awful watching it. It's just kind of like watching nothing. It's really a shame

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.669
Not only is this an interesting idea. I mean the ocean underwater fish life

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.380
I mean, it's interesting, but it's also unique that took an idea. That's usually meant for girls

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.489
You know mermaids are usually girls and gave it a little bit of a spin by making it a boy

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.989
You think these little touches would help it stand out, but it just kind of gets lost in the mix

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.418
I don't know if it was just an uninteresting script

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.649
Or if there wasn't time to direct it in an interesting way or shoot it in an interesting way

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:30.060
But it's mostly just forgettable aside from a few dedicated fans. It's unlikely this one's gonna stay afloat for very long

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.620
