JIM LECINSKI: Well, good
afternoon, Googlers.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.520
I'm Jim Lecinski, Vice President
of US Sales,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.200
actually based out of
the Chicago office.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.160
My pleasure to be your host or
co-host for the fireside chat

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.620
Talks at Google with our guest
today, Mr. Ed Whitacre.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.610
Ed is one of the icons of
American business, and will be

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.820
sharing with us his thoughts on
his new book, The American

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
Turnaround, which is a
tremendous read, and I highly

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.650
recommend it for both personal
development as well as

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.960
insights into business.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.970
And one thing that we try to
do here at Google is always

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.840
try to develop ourselves into
better managers, and there's a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.100
lot of good insights that
we'll be getting

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.100
into here in a minute.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.775
But before we officially welcome
Ed, I just maybe want

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:47.280
to set a little bit of context
here from a Google standpoint.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.640
We've been spending a lot of
time here at Google talking

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.410
about this notion of 10X
transformation, moon shots,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.620
aiming high, asking big,
certainly since Larry has set

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.220
that watermark out for
us earlier this year.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.610
And often it's like, what does
that look like to achieve 10X?

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.210
And we're actually very pleased
to have with us

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.770
someone who has done that on
more than one occasion.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.040
We'll talk later, but when Ed
was running AT&amp;T, if I have

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.850
the numbers right, Ed, the
revenues there went from

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.570
somewhere in the range of $9
billion to $120 billion.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.390
So by my count, not being an
engineer or a math major, I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.660
think you've managed
to deliver 13.334X.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.950
ED WHITACRE: Thank you.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.858
JIM LECINSKI: So with that,
please welcome Ed Whitacre.

00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:37.495
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:38.980
JIM LECINSKI: So, Ed, it's a
great pleasure to have you

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.890
with us on campus.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.580
ED WHITACRE: Thank you, Jim.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.400
It's my pleasure to
be here, and good

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.800
afternoon to all of you.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.020
Thank you for coming.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.320
JIM LECINSKI: Good.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.990
And so we've got our audience
here live, and we're

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.810
webcasting out to Googlers all
over the world, and I thought

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.530
a great way to get started is
for those folks to get to know

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.950
a little bit about you.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.840
You spend a little bit of time
in the book talking about your

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.090
background and where you got
started, in a small town in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880
Texas in a railroad family.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.510
I wonder if you could just tell
us a little bit about

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.639
yourself and where
you came from.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.050
ED WHITACRE: Sure.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.310
I grew up in a town
of almost 5,000

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.090
people in Central Texas--

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.540
Ennis, Texas.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.280
My dad worked for
the railroad.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.680
He was a union member--

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.850
really, an official of the
union for a while.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.960
It was a railroad town.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.490
If you didn't work for
the railroad, you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.070
didn't live in Ennis.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.450
And it was Southern Pacific
Railroad at the time.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.490
I went to grade school, junior
high, and high school in

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.380
Ennis, Texas.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.290
Didn't think I'd
go to college.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.720
My mother convinced, as you'll
see in the book,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.690
convinced me to go.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.140
I went to Texas Tech.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.330
I have a bachelor's degree
in engineering.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
From there, I went off into the
telephone industry, where

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.800
I spent 44 years, and then a
couple of years at General

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.290
Motors, and I look a little
worse for the wear, I'm sure

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.190
you can tell.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.340
But I'm here, and I feel
good, and it's a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.680
pleasure to be here.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.180
JIM LECINSKI: I wonder if you'd
just maybe talk a little

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.280
bit about--

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.400
even though you spent some time
as an actual practicing

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.020
engineer, if that's the right
phrase, I wonder if there's

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.730
lessons in life that that
engineering or technical

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.090
background has carried with
you through all the other

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.850
executive positions
that you've had.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.680
ED WHITACRE: I've always
thought the engineering

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.410
degree, just looking at that,
I think, taught you to maybe

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.500
be a little more analytical,
Jim, to look at things with a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.070
little different eye.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.410
And I guess that's the big
lesson I got out of

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.420
engineering.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.890
JIM LECINSKI: So we have a
phrase here that the Googlers

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.300
are familiar with called
data beats opinion.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.280
I wonder if you would subscribe
to that, or what

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.130
that matches with your
engineering background and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.070
experience.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.510
ED WHITACRE: I don't know.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.040
Opinions are pretty
fun, aren't they?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.900
Do I have to be worried
about the data?

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.710
But certainly, data beats
opinions, and I

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.950
would agree with that.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.950
That's true.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.210
JIM LECINSKI: You tell, I
thought, a terrific story in

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.710
the book, in your early days
in the telephone business,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.150
where, if I remember it
correctly, there was an issue

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.395
out on site, and you had a
repair crew out there, and you

00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:15.480
were sort of monitoring
the situation.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.860
And your manager had
a suggestion on

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.550
how to handle that.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.850
I wonder if you'd tell that
story to our audience.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.095
ED WHITACRE: I was what was
known as a repair foreman at

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:28.270
the telephone company early in
my career, and we had a cable

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.740
cut, which puts people
out of service.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.400
So I was in the work center, and
my crew was out repairing

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.800
this cable.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.520
So my boss, my manager,
came by and said,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.760
let's go take a look.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.730
So we drove out to the site,
which was probably five or six

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.460
miles from where I had been
sitting, waiting for these

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.410
guys to finish.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.250
And we got out of the car and
walked over to the ditch.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.280
It was a buried cable,
so they were putting

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.350
this cable back together.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.390
And I looked for a little while,
turned around, and my

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.100
boss, my manager,
had vanished.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.690
He went back to the work center
and left me out there

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.420
with my crew.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.050
And the message was, you should
be with your people.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.520
You should know what's
going on.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.390
It wasn't even very
subtle, you know?

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.200
He just went off and left me.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.590
JIM LECINSKI: And took the
car and drove back.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.820
ED WHITACRE: Took the car and
drove back, but the message

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.840
was pretty clear.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.120
You should stay with your
people and know

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.280
what's going on.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.400
JIM LECINSKI: And we'll talk
about GM later in our

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.190
conversation today, but even
through in GM, that seems like

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.770
a lesson that you've practiced,
being face to face

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.920
and with your folks.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.070
ED WHITACRE: Well, I think
that's right, and I think that

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.720
comes pretty easy for
me, pretty natural.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.290
I like to be around people.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.840
I like to interface
with people.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.460
And that particular instance was
just a matter of learning,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.770
but I certainly learned over the
years if you stay close to

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.480
your people, involved, know
what's going on-- and I don't

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.560
mean micromanage them or manage
them, but just stay

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.160
close and be aware.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.740
In the final analysis, you and
your coworkers, you're all in

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.090
it together, aren't you?

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.050
I mean, they want the same thing
you want as a manager.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.420
They don't want anything
different.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.270
They want to be successful, they
want to participate, they

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.470
want to have something to do
with the success or failure,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.820
in some cases.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.750
They want to be involved.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.665
And so it's just good
to be with them.

00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:33.170
It's just the right
thing to do.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.470
JIM LECINSKI: And that lesson
stuck through 44 years in the

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.750
phone business.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.620
ED WHITACRE: And some more
years at General Motors.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.560
It did.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.600
It's a good lesson to learn.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.420
JIM LECINSKI: Absolutely.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.710
So thinking about some of the
other experiences while you

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.030
were in the phone business,
that industry, I guess,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.540
experienced, putting it
moderately, transformational

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.535
tectonic changes.

00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:53.840
ED WHITACRE: Yes.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.870
JIM LECINSKI: I mean, we all can
think back to when MCI was

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.340
on top of the world,
and we all carried

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.960
calling cards around.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.250
I wonder if you'd talk a little
bit about how that

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.400
landscape changed, and how you
managed to have the foresight

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.730
to stay out ahead of that.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.950
ED WHITACRE: Well,
it's interesting.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.680
In 1984, the Bell system,
old AT&amp;T--

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.590
this was many years ago-- was
split into seven companies.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.295
JIM LECINSKI: That was
Judge Green's ruling.

00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:19.090
ED WHITACRE: Judge
Green's ruling.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.210
And I was at Southwestern Bell,
which was the smallest

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.540
of those entities and
took care of a few

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.350
states in the Midwest--

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.640
Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri,
Arkansas, and Texas.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.310
And after that, it wasn't only
me, but I think several people

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.310
saw that the telephone business
is sort of like your

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.240
scope and scale matter, and the
more you have, the more

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.820
efficient you can operate.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.170
And so I had the feeling if we
didn't get bigger, we probably

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:00.915
wouldn't exist long, because
somebody would come in and buy

00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:04.910
us out or take care of
us in another way.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.200
And so we set out early on in
my career as chairman to get

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.270
bigger, and get a lot bigger.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.030
And through a number of
acquisitions over several

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.710
years, we went from the smallest
baby Bell to the

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.570
largest, and some accused
me of putting AT&amp;T

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.640
back together again.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.290
Along that way came the
wireless revolution.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.410
In 1990, there were a million
wireless subscribers.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.850
Now there's hundreds of
millions of wireless

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.179
subscribers.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.559
So along the way, in so-called
putting AT&amp;T back together, we

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.610
added a great deal
of wireless.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.440
And of course, everybody here
certainly understands what

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.370
that means, and the data, but
it was an interesting trip,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.540
and we made many large
acquisitions, and AT&amp;T today

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.620
is the largest telecom
company in the world.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.700
JIM LECINSKI: And you made,
among many big decisions, one

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.960
you made there was to change the
name of the company, which

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.335
you just alluded to.

00:09:01.335 --> 00:09:04.050
At Google, we think a lot
about branding, brand

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.290
architecture, brand
nomenclature.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.840
Should it be called Earth by
Google or Google Earth?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.340
Those kinds of things.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.360
YouTube by Google, or YouTube
as a standalone brand?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.510
I wonder if you could maybe take
us inside some of those

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.210
conversations and meetings where
you and your executive

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.080
team were debating about
the name change.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.130
ED WHITACRE: I absolutely can.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.780
We started out as Southwestern
Bell Telephone Company, which

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.850
was pretty accurate.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.320
And then we acquired
Pacific Bell.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.270
Well, then Southwestern didn't
exactly fit, because Pacific

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.940
Bell, which is California,
is not Southwest.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.080
It's due west, right?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.610
So we got to thinking, well,
Southwestern Bell doesn't

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.750
work, so we changed
the name to SBC.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.660
And people assumed that stood
for Southwestern Bell

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.620
Corporation, but in reality,
it didn't stand

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.750
for anything, Jim.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.240
It was just SBC.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.060
And we just picked that
because it was easy.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.060
And then we made other
acquisitions.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.750
We bought Ameritech, we bought
Bell South, we bought

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.550
Cingular, and we bought AT&amp;T
Wireless, and we bought the

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.820
AT&amp;T mother company.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.450
We were known as SBC.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.990
And then we acquired AT&amp;T. And
the question was, should we

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:23.790
keep AT&amp;T's name or
stick with SBC?

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.580
And as you can imagine, we'd
grown, so a lot of our

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.470
managers, a lot of our
people thought we

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.490
should stay with SBC.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.440
And the AT&amp;T name was damaged
in the US to some extent,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.060
because it was known
as not giving very

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.550
good service, et cetera.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.540
But worldwide, AT&amp;T's name
was good as gold.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.190
It was like Hershey, and it was
like other names that have

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.690
been around for hundreds
of years.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.810
So we debated that for not
too long, actually.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.960
Everybody, we took a little
poll, and it was almost

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.980
unanimous we should
stick with SBC.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.570
But I had this brilliant flash
of light that said, this is

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.840
not a democracy.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.265
We're going to call it AT&amp;T.

00:11:10.265 --> 00:11:11.770
JIM LECINSKI: So you
overruled it.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.040
ED WHITACRE: So I overruled
everybody, and we called it

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.710
AT&amp;T, and I think we
subsequently were glad we did.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.830
JIM LECINSKI: Yeah.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.020
I'd never heard that story.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.440
ED WHITACRE: Yeah, that's
a true story.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.820
JIM LECINSKI: Now, speaking of
your team, and maybe those in

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.030
the room, you talk a lot in the
book about the importance

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.180
of assembling a great team,
your HR folks, your deal

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.130
makers, people who've been
with you a long time

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:35.830
throughout your career.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.950
I wonder if you would maybe just
talk about some of your

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.650
learnings on assembling
a team.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.660
ED WHITACRE: Well, I have
several things I could talk

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.920
about there, and I'd like to
say first of all is that

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.280
people are the most important
part of any business, and

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.120
they're the best asset
any business has.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.290
And if you don't know that, and
if you don't work at that,

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.630
you're not going to make it.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.340
If you don't realize that people
are your biggest asset,

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.790
and treat them like you want
to be treated, you're not

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.420
going to make it.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.680
And I've had that proven to
me time and time again.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.770
Secondly is most people
are good and feel

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.300
like you and I feel.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.170
And we all want to be
part of a company.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.620
We want to be involved.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.250
We want to be responsible
for something.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.940
We want to have the authority
to do something.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.630
We don't want to be
micromanaged.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.730
We want to make a good wage.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.110
And all of us have those
same feelings.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.510
And I think when you realize
from the lowest level to the

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.520
highest level, those are the
same, I think you're way ahead

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.230
of the game.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.120
So I think it's most important,
because I believe

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.140
management's responsible
for everything.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.330
I'm not a Six Sigma
guy, where you put

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.910
the onus on the employees.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.510
I believe management's
responsible, really, for

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.260
everything.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.140
With that comes the fact that
you have to have the very best

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.610
team, and that means managers
that are people-oriented, that

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.800
are ambitious, that
are willing to

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.600
learn, that are flexible.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.030
You can put a lot of adjectives
on that, or

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.170
adverbs, I guess.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.220
And so you do set
out to do that.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.580
And I encountered that in spades
in General Motors at

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.390
the upper levels of management,
where they're nice

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.780
people, and they're good people,
but they'd been there

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.130
so long they had no
adaptability.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.750
They couldn't adapt to change,
or wouldn't change.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.620
And when you encounter that
situation, you have to make

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.030
changes and make them quick.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.960
You have to get everybody on
the same wavelength as you.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.100
JIM LECINSKI: Because it
doesn't get better by

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.660
postponing the decision.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.460
ED WHITACRE: It doesn't
get better.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.030
And you can kid yourself a long
time and say, well, we

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.993
can work around this
or that person, or

00:13:51.993 --> 00:13:54.350
it's really not important.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.510
But it really is, because a bad
manager hurts everybody in

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.350
the organization.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.340
They hurt the other thousands
of people that are there.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.000
And so we're all kindhearted,
and we want to be nice, but

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.760
you just have to get rid of
bad managers quickly.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.440
And some people can adapt in
a different situation.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.020
Maybe they're in
the wrong role.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.480
I think you owe it to
examine all that.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.920
But you can't just sit around
with a bad manager.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.150
You have to get them out, and
get them out quick, because

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.090
really, it's affecting hundreds
of other people.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:28.530
Thousands.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.440
It's affecting everybody
in your company.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.010
JIM LECINSKI: And we'll talk
about some of that at GM, how

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.570
that all went down.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.640
But I don't want to pass
by-- you mentioned

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.320
wireless and Cingular.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.650
I think, arguably, that you were
responsible for one of

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.570
the most transformational
decisions in recent business

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.890
history, where AT&amp;T decided to
do the deal with Steve Jobs to

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.920
be the exclusive distributor
of the iPhone.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.280
And the fact that we're working
on Android here and

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.130
that there's a smartphone in
everybody's pocket, and the

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.910
penetration, and how it's really
transformed the world

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.400
arguably could be traced back
to that specific decision.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.600
I wonder if you could tell us
about how that came about, the

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.290
discussions and decisions
with Steve and

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.380
your team to do that.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.550
ED WHITACRE: Sure.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.090
I had a guy named Stan Sigman
that ran the mobile business

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.920
for AT&amp;T, and a very
good manager.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.720
And he and Steve Jobs were
friends, and I met Steve a

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.680
couple of times.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.780
But Steve had this new product
that he wouldn't show us, but

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.130
we had a private meeting in a
hotel room in New York, and it

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.860
was the first iPhone.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.060
And he came into the
room, Stan said--

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.000
I've got one somewhere--

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.660
and he had one of these, a
mock-up, and this is my guy,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.890
and Steve Jobs, and he had it in
his coat pocket, and it was

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.580
like he had the atomic secret.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.280
He wouldn't pull it out,
wouldn't show it to us.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.790
But they talked for a while,
and he pulled this out and

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:04.840
showed it to Stan--

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.870
the earlier one-- and
said, this can be a

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.700
revolutionary device.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.550
Well, I guess just looking
at it, it's not

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.570
that impressive, right?

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.400
It's just a phone.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.900
But as Steve talked, we got
pretty engaged in terms of

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.690
applications that could
be put on this.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.920
And this was before any
applications existed.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.540
I mean, this was just
a phone phone.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.440
And he wanted a lot
of money for it.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.490
And he was a very secretive,
and he wouldn't

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.790
even let us hold it.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.200
He wouldn't let us
take it back and

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.170
look at it or anything.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.800
He put it back in his coat
pocket and left.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.970
Well, to make a long story
short, we had the network, he

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:51.070
had the phone, and we debated
this not very long that this

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.310
could revolutionize the
way things are done.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.160
And he wanted a lot of money for
it, and AT&amp;T pushed a lot

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.250
of chips out on the table,
if you would.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.740
We paid a lot of
money for this.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.050
You have to pay for it up front,
and then you get it

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.380
back monthly from
your customers.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.250
We did that.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.470
We pushed a lot of money.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.560
We got an exclusive,
as you said.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.950
And I think the rest
is history.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.859
It was a huge gamble on AT&amp;T's
part, because it

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.130
cost us a lot of money.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.650
But I think we had the vision
that this could really be

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.560
something big with all the
applications, et cetera.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.070
Nobody else would
step up to it.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.340
We did the deal with Steve.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.200
We got the iPhone exclusive.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.550
I think the rest is history.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.080
There's tens of millions of them
out there now, and it was

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.710
a very good decision for AT&amp;T.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.350
JIM LECINSKI: So sometimes, big
decisions like this are

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.260
made based on trusting of
the business partner.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.630
Sometimes decisions like this
are made based on the

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.730
financials.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.260
Sometimes it's based on frankly
having no other choice

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.270
and needing a home run.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.090
How would you characterize
this decision?

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.560
ED WHITACRE: Well, I think we
were always aggressive and had

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.090
the ability to move pretty quick
at AT&amp;T. I mean, it was

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.220
a big company, but we could
make a decision.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.970
There wasn't a whole lot of
bureaucracy at the top levels.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.580
We could move.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.390
And I think Stan and I looked
at each other, and he said,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.690
what do you think, Ed?

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.260
And I said, I think we ought
to give this a shot, Stan.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.700
It was a big gamble to push
all that money out on the

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.730
table, but it had
great potential.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.220
It could have failed.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.800
It wasn't going to wreck the
company if it did, but it

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.190
would be a severe blow.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:40.550
On the other hand, it was, I
thought, a calculated risk,

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.170
but well worth taking.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.940
It certainly was
not a financial

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.280
decision at the time.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.030
It was, I guess, a common sense
or gut instinct feeling

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.200
that this could be really
big, and if it hit,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.130
let's give it a shot.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.470
And you don't make it
in business without

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.930
some risk, you know?

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.470
JIM LECINSKI: Was the board
involved, with a 200-page

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.700
PowerPoint presentation?

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.150
ED WHITACRE: No.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.450
No, Stan Sigman and I made the
decision to do the iPhone

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.450
deal, and we made it in my
office in San Antonio, and we

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.340
made it in about five minutes.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.460
JIM LECINSKI: And was there any,
at that time, talk about

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.580
or concern about possible
cannibalization of your other

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.030
lines of business?

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.340
ED WHITACRE: Absolutely.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.960
Absolutely.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.560
And that's one of the fears you
have, and that's one of

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.010
the reluctant things that
comes up is new products

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:35.230
sometime cannibalize your other
profitable products.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.530
But if you go down that road,
you're in big trouble, because

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.240
you'll cannibalize yourself
right out of business.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.390
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.780
ED WHITACRE: We always try to
take the approach, well, this

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.440
is a good product, and it makes
a lot of money, but this

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.360
has the potential
to be better.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.250
Let's put our resources on this,
our money, our people,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.650
and go for some new product and
stay out ahead of the game

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.280
rather than just dying.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.550
History's full of
stuff like that.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.940
JIM LECINSKI: And over time, did
Steve become a little less

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.410
secretive with you and Stan and
actually let you touch the

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.070
phones in future meetings?

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.300
ED WHITACRE: Yeah, we finally
got to touch the phone.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.270
That was a good thing.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.830
Felt pretty good, I guess,
touching it.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.050
Can't really remember.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.990
But we developed a good working
relationship, and we

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.695
actually needed each other.

00:20:23.695 --> 00:20:26.610
I think people sometimes forget
that you have to have a

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.990
network to make these
things work, as you

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.450
know better than anybody.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.450
It doesn't just magically
happen.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.950
You have to have a network.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.600
And we had a great network.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.150
We had the ability to make it
bigger, along with some of the

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:45.930
things that have come along,
like 4G and LTE.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.200
But we had that network.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.420
So he needed us,
we needed him.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.340
Because the applications
could be big.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.780
We felt we could get
the frequencies.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.120
We thought the technology would
move so that the service

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.870
would improve, and we could
supply many more customers.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.920
And that's all come to
pass, pretty much.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.290
JIM LECINSKI: Absolutely.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.800
ED WHITACRE: So it was
a case of he needed

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.920
us, we needed him.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.380
We got to be good friends, and
it worked for both of us.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.210
JIM LECINSKI: Great story.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.750
Great story.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.420
And the world benefits from that
decision and that meeting

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.500
in the New York hotel
room ever since.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.040
ED WHITACRE: It does.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.760
JIM LECINSKI: So then at this
point, we're getting close to

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.450
the $120 billion mark.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:32.980
AT&amp;T is a big success, and
you decide, Texas, ranch?

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.870
ED WHITACRE: Well, I
was 66 years old.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.450
I'd been at AT&amp;T 44 years.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.680
JIM LECINSKI: Highly
successful.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.480
ED WHITACRE: Which is--

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.710
I was there more than
you are old, most of

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.730
you, by quite a bit.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.260
And I just thought it was
time for new leadership.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.580
And I saw some signs in myself
that said, well, maybe you

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.370
don't quite have what
you used to have.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.490
So I decided to step aside,
and I did, and I

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.875
have a little ranch.

00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:03.270
And I know nothing about
cows, incidentally,

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.780
but I have a ranch.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.151
It has a cow on it, but that's
about it, you know?

00:22:08.151 --> 00:22:11.750
And I was retired a couple
years, and then I get this

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.660
call from the Treasury
Department.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.200
JIM LECINSKI: Tell us
about that day.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.870
ED WHITACRE: I got a call from
the Treasury Department that

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:22.750
said, Ed, we would like for you
to consider becoming the

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.640
chairman of General Motors.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.790
And I couldn't believe
what I was hearing.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.010
JIM LECINSKI: And this
was a cold call.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.280
ED WHITACRE: It was
a cold call.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.200
You must have misdialed.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.880
You must have the
wrong number.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.720
And I talked to the car czar for
a while, and he said, we'd

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.270
like for you to become chairman
of General Motors.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.940
And I said, I know nothing
about cars.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.160
I'm retired.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.630
The answer is no.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.910
And so that was that, and I
went home, told Linda, my

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.860
wife, who's here, and just
kind of dismissed it.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.950
Well, the next day he called
again, and said, have you

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.580
thought it over?

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.740
And I said, not really,
you know?

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.700
I thought it was a joke.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.630
I thought you had the
wrong number.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.120
And I knew the person calling.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.650
I'd met him in a
previous life--

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.660
Steve Rattner.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.150
And I said, well, you know, I'm
just retired, and I just

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.570
don't think I'd like
to do that.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.510
And he said, but you've got
the qualifications.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.920
You've run these big companies,
they're unionized,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.060
you've been through a lot of
acquisitions, et cetera.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.560
And I said, but Steve, I don't
know anything about cars.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.700
He said, that's even better.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.220
That's probably a great
qualification is you don't

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.495
know anything about
the car industry.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:42.290
We hung up.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.750
Next day, he called again
and said, this is

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.880
really a public service.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.510
This is a great American company
that's been here

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.130
through World War II,
that's helped this

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.760
country a great deal.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.850
It means a lot to
a lot of people.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.130
It's the largest manufacturer.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.400
It needs to be saved.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.530
And would you please come do
this as a public service?

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.120
JIM LECINSKI: Ed, your
country needs you.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.140
ED WHITACRE: Your country
needs you.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.980
And that got to me.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.970
And so I said yes, I'll come.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.880
JIM LECINSKI: Now, paint the
picture of GM at this point.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.780
What kind of shape was it in?

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.560
Where were they at?

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.210
ED WHITACRE: Well, it
had gone bankrupt.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.620
It had been declared bankrupt.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.540
JIM LECINSKI: Which generally
means that their expenses are

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.740
exceeding their revenues.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.490
ED WHITACRE: Yes, exactly.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.980
It's a basic rule of
business, you know?

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.250
When your expenses are greater,
you go bankrupt.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.380
JIM LECINSKI: Not
a good thing.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.050
ED WHITACRE: And so I went up,
and GM was emerging from

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.230
bankruptcy the day I
became chairman.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.720
Went through a short,
abbreviated bankruptcy.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.680
The government bailed it out.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.370
The taxpayer bailed it out.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.570
You bailed it out.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.590
Thank you very much.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:49.410
I bailed it out.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.620
We're all taxpayers.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.740
It was our money that
bailed out GM.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.520
But I can tell you that there
was not one dollar of private

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.260
money anywhere in the world that
would have put a nickel

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.220
into General Motors.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.080
JIM LECINSKI: Because that's
the question that

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.180
often comes up, right?

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.180
Why couldn't they raise it
in the private market?

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.550
ED WHITACRE: There was nobody
that would step forth anywhere

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.340
in the world to put one nickel
in General Motors.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.100
JIM LECINSKI: Because at this
point, Lehman Brothers had

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.210
collapsed, people
were nervous.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.180
ED WHITACRE: People were
nervous, the economy of the US

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.320
was headed down, there was no
money to do a conventional

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.290
bankruptcy for GM.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.450
And if the government hadn't
stepped in, if you hadn't

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:33.060
donated your money to do it,
it wasn't the jobs at GM so

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.910
much as it was the millions of
jobs that surrounded GM.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.040
If you think about it, it has
7,000 or 8,000 parts in a new

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.350
car, or in a car.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.030
A lot of those are made
by outside suppliers.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.830
All those suppliers
have employees.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.810
The job impact in this country
would have been well over a

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.700
million jobs had we
not saved GM.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.030
It was a huge economic impact,
way beyond maybe what you read

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.240
in the paper, or what
you thought.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.470
It was just an incredible
impact.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.860
JIM LECINSKI: So how close
was it to not surviving?

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.290
ED WHITACRE: Well, it didn't
survive, but the government

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.860
put the money back in.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.830
We went through a quick
bankruptcy and came back out,

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.870
and away we went.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.730
JIM LECINSKI: So now you took
over as chairman and got on a

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.330
plane in San Antonio and
flew to Detroit.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.277
ED WHITACRE: I did.

00:26:28.277 --> 00:26:29.590
JIM LECINSKI: What happened?

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:34.210
ED WHITACRE: Well, the board of
directors was pretty new.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.830
We had to form a new
board of directors.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.630
We kept a couple of directors
from old GM, bankrupt GM.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.240
They hadn't been on
there very long.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.100
And we put our heads together
and came up with a new board

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:52.180
of directors from all sectors,
seven or eight people.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:57.810
I started spending quite a bit
of time at GM, deciding,

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.330
sizing the place up.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.900
But at our first board meeting,
which was in August,

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:06.890
right after emerging from
bankruptcy, we decided that

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.860
things had to change at
GM big time, and they

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.060
had to do it quick.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.290
The previous chairman had
left the company.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:21.240
The number two guy at GM
was appointed the CEO.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.280
And we decided that we
give him 90 days

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.520
to make some changes--

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.190
the board did.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.680
I was chairman.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.460
The board decided we'd give
this individual 90 days to

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.900
make big changes in GM.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.700
And let me tell you, it needed
lots of changes.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.920
JIM LECINSKI: So what were some
of the things that you

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.690
saw on that list of change?

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.720
ED WHITACRE: Well, I asked
people when I first got there

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.580
at the very senior level, what
happened to this company?

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.750
What did we do wrong?

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.890
They said we did
nothing wrong.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.250
We're OK.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.030
Everything's fine.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.040
The economy got us.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:55.755
Wasn't our fault.

00:27:55.755 --> 00:27:58.170
The economy got us.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.520
Well, then you ask the question,
why didn't it get

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.460
Ford, and why didn't it get
Toyota, and why didn't it get

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.880
all the other car companies?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.980
Mercedes, et cetera.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.350
They didn't really have
any answer for that.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.150
So I found an organization
that was pretty confused,

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.990
didn't know what its vision
was, its objective.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.425
It was a very complicated
management structure at GM.

00:28:21.425 --> 00:28:26.460
It was matrix managed, which
meant everybody had more than

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.900
one boss, and therefore
had no bosses.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.310
And matrix management is
supposed to be collaborative,

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.820
but you don't get much done
with matrix management,

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.360
because you've got
too many bosses.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.240
You've got to check
with everybody.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.270
You can't pull the trigger
on anything.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.760
And the bureaucracy was
just incredible.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.500
JIM LECINSKI: And you had a
pretty simple acid test where

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.780
you used to just ask, what
does this guy do?

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.360
ED WHITACRE: Yes.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.641
And nobody could tell
me what they did.

00:28:54.641 --> 00:28:58.350
You could ask very highest
levels, and I'd say, give me

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.560
your job description.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.240
What do you do?

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.010
And that puzzled
a lot of them.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:07.620
That was a confusing question
I was asking.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.750
So it was really just a mess.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.760
And these were good people,
don't get me wrong.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.270
These are great people, very
well educated, but they'd been

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.070
in that culture so long, Jim,
and been associated with that

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:23.040
so long where you could do
nothing wrong, really.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.050
And GM had gone from 50% of the
market share to less than

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.880
20%, but nothing had changed
over the years.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.560
It was still the same mindset,
if you would.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.040
And so right away, we
had some work to do.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.950
JIM LECINSKI: So you asked for
a 90-day plan from the CEO.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:44.590
ED WHITACRE: Right.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:49.670
I asked for a 90-day plan to
make some changes, and

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.990
directed him to make
some changes, and

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.890
he didn't make them.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.670
And therefore, he
didn't survive.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.600
He didn't make it, nor
did a lot of the

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.430
other senior managers.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.010
And again, they're good people,
but they couldn't step

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.350
out of the previous life
and change the

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.290
way they did things.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:13.920
And so we had to put the right
people in the right jobs,

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.252
simplify the organization.

00:30:17.252 --> 00:30:19.840
And if I don't say anything
else, remember this.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:27.020
You have to give people
responsibility to do a job,

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.820
you have to give them the
authority to do the job, and

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.300
you have to hold them
accountable.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.310
And I think people
respond to that.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.610
We tried to do that.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.290
We did do that.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:41.240
And shortly thereafter,
good things started

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.590
to happen to GM.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.630
JIM LECINSKI: So we'll
come to that.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.320
I wonder if you might share--

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:45.880
I thought there were some

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.310
fascinating lessons for Googlers.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.710
For anybody, in fact.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.630
During that 90 day period, you
had some observations about

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.680
clarity of thinking, being
succinct, the use of

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.550
PowerPoint, a role for details
versus being able to

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.470
communicate at high level.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.510
Talk a little bit about what
you saw, and as a senior

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.550
executive, what you expect in
those kinds of situations.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:14.000
ED WHITACRE: Well, I'm a simple
person, so I've always

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.930
believed that simpler
is better.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.510
And GM was just the
reverse of that.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.600
It was not simple.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.110
If you asked somebody a
question, you'd get a

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:29.880
PowerPoint presentation that
would probably last an hour,

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.550
hour and a half, 50 slides, 100
slides, most of which I

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.900
couldn't understand anyway.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.990
And it was really just an
incredible bureaucracy.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:44.270
This is what happens when people
don't have authority to

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.390
do something, when they don't
feel good about their job.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:51.210
When they're not part of it,
when they're not involved,

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:55.020
they'll set out to make
themselves important.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.860
And that's the way bureaucracies
grow.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.800
So if you have somebody that
doesn't feel like they're

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.880
part, not involved, they'll make
up something so that they

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.030
do feel involved.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.530
And so all of a sudden, you get
another test, or you get

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:15.100
another criteria you have to
meet that anybody can put in a

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.400
system-- a middle level manager,
a lower middle.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.270
And I think that's partly in
response to I want to feel

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:25.300
important, I don't feel that
way, therefore, I'm going to

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.310
insert myself in the process.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.270
And the bureaucracy
starts to build.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.900
JIM LECINSKI: And the result
is, it gets worse.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:30.330
ED WHITACRE: Right.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.360
It just gets worse.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.750
And so that had built to,
I think, an extremely

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.670
high level at GM.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:44.590
Again, good people, but it was
really a confused place from a

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.580
standpoint.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.270
Had no organization chart.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.200
I asked for an organization
chart early on to see who

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.410
reported to who and what
functions, and they didn't

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.880
have an organization chart.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:01.910
They had discontinued all that
HR activity in the name of

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.160
saving money, less cost.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.930
And I asked people, well,
who reports to you?

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.740
And we got into this matrix
management stuff again.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.830
Well, I have three bosses.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.860
Well, which one counts?

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.570
That's a hard question
to answer, which

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.130
boss is my real boss?

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.810
And some of them would say,
well, it's the one that rates

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.880
me every year and I get
my paycheck from.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.050
That would've been
my answer, too.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.140
But there were other bosses you
had to collaborate with,

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.360
and as a result, no decisions
could be made.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.770
JIM LECINSKI: So meanwhile,
during that 90-day period when

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:41.760
the CEO was putting a plan
together that ultimately

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.600
didn't pan out, you were doing
some management by wandering

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.040
around, some investigation,
table talk, if you will,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.090
yourself to try and
sleuth a little.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.850
ED WHITACRE: I spent a lot of
time from the very bottom to

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.760
the top of GM during
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.780
I went to a lot of assembly
plants, met with assembly line

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.680
workers, met with union members,
just got to know the

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.900
company and its people.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:12.699
And that was most helpful to
me when I became the CEO 90

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:13.530
days later.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.449
JIM LECINSKI: And what did you
hear about how they felt?

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:21.250
ED WHITACRE: Well, most of them
were very embarrassed,

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:26.350
Jim, because the company had
gone bankrupt, and they felt

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.489
really bad about that,
as you can imagine.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.070
Some of them said their
neighbors wouldn't speak to

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:35.429
them because they had
gone bankrupt.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.120
Their kids were sort of
shunned at school.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:43.600
So the assembly line workforce
was most anxious to prove

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.080
they're as good as anybody in
the world, and great workers.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.110
But they didn't see any way
to make that happen.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.770
But that's the feeling they
had inside is, we're good.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.170
Give us another chance.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:00.130
We want another chance.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.920
You just learn a lot of things
by walking around.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.720
Goes back to that story of when
I was left with my crew,

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.970
my boss left me out there.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:13.310
You can learn a great deal by
getting to know people in the

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:14.970
organization.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:15.930
JIM LECINSKI: So then
fast forward.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:20.050
It's now, I guess, December,
and the decision is made to

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:24.540
excuse the existing CEO
and appoint a new CEO.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.860
ED WHITACRE: Right.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:30.290
And so at the board meeting,
this was late November, 90

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:31.565
days later.

00:35:31.565 --> 00:35:34.650
I said, well, OK, we've
agreed that the

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:36.670
previous CEO got 90 days.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.020
90 days is up.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.890
What do we do next?

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:42.100
And we had two or three
names on the list.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.660
But the problem was, we couldn't
pay anybody, because

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.570
we were under TARP, the Troubled
Asset Plan, where the

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:54.150
Treasury Department said the
most anybody could make was

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:56.270
half a million dollars.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:01.790
Well, you don't go get a top
notch CEO for $500,000.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:05.850
Secondly is maybe the last thing
we needed was somebody

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.060
from outside the business
that didn't know it.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:13.180
Maybe we need somebody they
identified a little bit with.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.800
Well, I'd been around for 90
days and met a lot of people,

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.970
so maybe I could be a little
more identified with.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.350
So we beat that back and forth
and pitched out a few names,

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:27.960
and then the board pretty much
in unison turned at me and

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.250
said, will you do it, Ed?

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.910
And this was pretty much
a public service, now.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.500
There's no money
with this, OK?

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.830
And I live in San Antonio,
and I'm in Detroit.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:44.350
And so what are you
going to say?

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:47.710
I mean, you could beat that
around for a long time, and

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:51.460
there weren't any internal
candidates from GM with any

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.980
credibility at that point.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.280
I mean, they'd gone bankrupt.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.990
There were some good people
there, but not stepped up.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:02.010
So I really didn't want
to go get an outsider.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:06.610
So sheepishly, I said, OK,
I'll do it for a while.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.410
I'll do it through the IPO--

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:10.100
Initial Public Offering.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.950
So I became the CEO that day.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.840
JIM LECINSKI: So now the task or
the ultimate responsibility

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.460
of the plan rests with you.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.560
So how do you proceed?

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:26.060
ED WHITACRE: Well, I had seen
early on that nobody at GM

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.520
knew what we really did.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.550
You could ask anybody,
what do we do?

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.330
And nobody could answer you.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.910
So I assembled all the senior
managers, and we'd made a

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.770
couple of changes by then.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.490
Now, what do we do
at this company?

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:43.070
And 30 minutes later,
ended the meeting.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.650
We decided Tom Stephens, the
chief engineer at GM--

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.010
then chief engineer--

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.330
said, well, we really design,
build, and sell the world's

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.360
best vehicles.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.250
I liked that.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.180
We could design, build,
and sell the

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.210
world's best vehicles.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.290
That's pretty simple.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.275
That's a message you could
communicate to a couple of

00:38:03.275 --> 00:38:04.540
hundred thousand employees.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.960
Everybody would feel good
about that, I thought.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.960
And so we set out to tell
everybody, inform everybody,

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.340
this is a new day
at this company.

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.390
We design, build, and sell the
world's best vehicles.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.900
If you're doing anything
that doesn't contribute

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.770
to that, stop it.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.560
We don't want you here.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.000
That's our new mission.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.540
Let's go do it.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.980
Some people couldn't
make that change.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.400
We had to make a lot of
high level management

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.990
changes, Jim, early on.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.450
But everybody got on
the bandwagon.

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.680
We communicated that to every
person at GM, from the lowest

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.770
level person to the highest
level person, to all the

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:49.850
assembly lines, to everybody
in the company.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.850
And we started making
decisions.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.840
We simplified the organization
chart.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.810
No more matrix management.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.020
We threw that out.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.010
We had direct lines
of reporting.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.370
We simplified the
business a great

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.420
deal in terms of structure.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.990
We tried to put right people
in right jobs.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:12.240
And away we went.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.090
Everybody responded to that.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.040
JIM LECINSKI: Now, one of those
vehicles in particular

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.940
is what ultimately came to
market as the Chevy Volt,

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.860
which arguably, for everyone who
woke up this morning with

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.640
a smartphone and a hybrid car,
you were responsible for both

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.210
of those kinds of decisions.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:33.020
Tell us what went into the Volt,
and how that came to be.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.470
ED WHITACRE: Well, there's
concerns about climate,

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.310
environment.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.260
Certainly we all should
be concerned.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:44.156
And when I got to GM, there was
development work going on

00:39:44.156 --> 00:39:46.670
on an electric car.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.800
And I drove the first
Chevy Volt.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.450
It was very impressive, it had
a lot of power, it was

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.350
big, it rode good.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:59.510
And it had one thing in its
favor, no range anxiety.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:02.790
If you have an electric vehicle,
one of your big

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:08.770
concerns is, how far can I go
before I'm not sure I can get

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.440
back, right?

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.240
Distribution's a problem.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.650
You can't run out and plug
them in everywhere yet.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:21.080
And so the Chevy Volt
eliminates that.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.730
The Chevy Volt can go electric
for the same length of time as

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:29.410
the Leaf or the rest of them,
but just in case you don't

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.410
want range anxiety, it has a
small gasoline engine which

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:36.670
comes on automatically and
recharges the battery.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:40.840
So instead of worried can I go
40 miles or 50 miles or 60

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.200
miles, you can sort of
go unlimited miles.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.140
So I thought that was great.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.660
Corporately, I think
corporations have a

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.015
responsibility to try
new technologies for

00:40:52.015 --> 00:40:54.000
mankind, if you would.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.110
I think there's no reason not
to try new technologies.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.020
I think you have that
responsibility.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:00.890
So we did.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.170
The Chevy Volt came out.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.960
It cost $40,000.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.230
We caught a lot of
flak for that.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.750
Only cost $30,000 after
all the tax credits.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:10.975
It's a terrific vehicle.

00:41:10.975 --> 00:41:15.020
It didn't sell as many as we
wanted, but I think last year,

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.210
it sold more than
any other car.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:22.930
I think it does away with range
anxieties, and I think

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.615
there'll be improvements.

00:41:23.615 --> 00:41:25.300
It'll get better and better.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.850
And now the Cadillac's out in
an electric version, so.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.490
JIM LECINSKI: So was the
decision to greenlight the

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.290
Volt similar to the decision
how it was made for the

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:38.220
greenlight of the iPhone, or
was the decision process

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.760
somewhat different to
greenlight the Volt?

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.470
ED WHITACRE: No, it was
about the same.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:42.250
Let's give it a shot.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.320
JIM LECINSKI: At least you
got to touch the Volt.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:44.610
ED WHITACRE: Right.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.390
I could touch the Volt.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.590
It's, let's give this
thing a shot.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.580
We'll never know if we don't.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.020
You can't be afraid of risk, or
you'll never do anything.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.320
Because you can never
be certain that

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.490
something's going to work.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:00.630
And a lot of things I did didn't
work, but some of them

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.670
did, like the iPhone and
the Chevy Volt worked.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.500
JIM LECINSKI: But in both cases,
risks that if they

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.440
didn't pan out, wouldn't
take the company down.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:07.840
ED WHITACRE: Right.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.560
JIM LECINSKI: Measured risks.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:08.930
ED WHITACRE: Right.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:10.440
Measured risks.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.030
But you've got to take risks.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.950
JIM LECINSKI: So I have a few
more questions here, but I'd

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.760
like to at least invite folks in
the audience, if you have a

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.800
question for Ed about any
of the topics we've been

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.480
discussing or anything else on
your mind, please raise your

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.770
hand, shout it out,
I'll repeat it.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.140
Or there's a handheld mic
here up in the front.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.290
You can go ahead and
come forward.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.030
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could talk a little bit

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:33.600
about how you found the approach
at GM of just the

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.560
different lines of businesses,
and figuring out, do you need

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.840
to keep all the different brands
or shut them down?

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.520
And how you value, like,
Pontiac-- why are they

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.290
competing with Chevy?

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.860
Why do you have them both,
and that sort of thing.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.700
ED WHITACRE: Well, that was the
history of General Motors,

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.070
had been put together
that way.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:55.040
I can't tell you the thought
processes for doing all that.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:00.690
But it had, and evolved into
a lot of different

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.460
brands, as you say.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.980
The decision, of course, to
eliminate some of them were

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:10.120
based on profitability, their
closeness to another design.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.320
And so Pontiac went away,
Oldsmobile went away.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.960
But I really can't tell you the
inception of that, except

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:22.250
over a period of many years,
all those brands developed.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.130
But I don't know
the reason why.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:27.750
AUDIENCE: I was more wondering
if you came in and said, it

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.580
doesn't make sense that we
have all these different

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.060
brands, and we need to
simplify things.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.510
Because some people have talked
about GM and said, you

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.970
want to have internal
competition between the

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:39.970
brands, and maybe that's the
way to run a business.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.470
And I wonder if you came in and
said, that's not the way

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:43.240
to run this.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.100
We need to simplify and have
more clear responsibility, or

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.350
what you were thinking there.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.300
ED WHITACRE: There's some of
that element in there to have

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.770
some competition.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.490
On the other hand, there's
a lot of similarities in

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:03.140
vehicles, and so you could do
things in one with the same

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.460
parts from another and have
global platforms.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.770
I guess it's just a mishmash,
an amalgamation of all that.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:14.300
We had so many things to do, we
really couldn't concentrate

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.930
on deep thoughts like you're
thinking about, because we had

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.330
to start making quality
vehicles that

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:23.240
people would buy.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.370
That was the number
one priority.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.590
I really didn't stay long enough
to get into all that.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.850
But you raise some
good points.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.650
JIM LECINSKI: And you guys had
a sense of urgency, right?

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.200
You couldn't overthink
these decisions,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.390
because of the clock.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.560
ED WHITACRE: We could
not overthink.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.470
We had to act, and we
had to act quickly.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:43.320
GM had to be made profitable
again quickly, and it was.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.560
In the first quarter after
November, we made $1 billion,

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.380
and they hadn't made any
money in five years.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:55.080
So the quality overnight was
almost fixed by the assembly

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.650
line workers.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:00.150
People's attitudes were
terrific, which shows you the

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:03.020
power of people in
any organization.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.520
I mean, you empower them, great

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.420
things will happen quickly.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.180
JIM LECINSKI: They'll rise
to the occasion.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.630
ED WHITACRE: They'll rise
to the occasion.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.140
And all of a sudden, we started

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.790
selling vehicles again--

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.960
good quality vehicles.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.820
AUDIENCE: Since this is an
informal chat, I'll just ask

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.260
you this question.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.610
If you were the president of
this country, what are some

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:20.655
things you would do?

00:45:20.655 --> 00:45:22.580
I think there are very few
people who can lead this

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.180
country, and you probably
are one of them.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:27.040
If you were the president of
this country, what are a few

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.274
things that you would do?

00:45:28.274 --> 00:45:29.240
JIM LECINSKI: There you go.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.750
ED WHITACRE: The President
of the United States?

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.870
Oh my god, I hadn't thought
about that.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.550
Well, I think you'd have
to use your own style

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.760
and do what you want.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.260
I certainly would try to
eliminate some of the

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:50.390
bureaucracy upfront and some of
the I guess fighting or bad

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.180
feelings between various
factions.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.130
I would certainly move to
empower a lot of people, and I

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:01.110
would make some decisions to
either start or discontinue a

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.547
lot of things, and I'd go find
the very best people I could

00:46:04.547 --> 00:46:10.290
find to run the different
Cabinet positions, et cetera.

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:15.360
You know, this is a little off
that subject, but we have a

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.210
lot of managers that won't
promote or push their best

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.820
people, because they're afraid
if they do that, and their

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.960
best person moves, then their
results will fall, and they

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.140
won't look so good.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.350
And that's a fallacy.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:33.260
I mean, one of the measures
should be, how many people get

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.170
promoted out of my
organization?

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:39.530
Because then you're approaching
it the right way.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.060
That's a big question you asked
me, but I'd make some

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.460
changes, and I'd make
them real quick.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.550
And it would involve
people up front.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:48.740
Lots of people.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.120
JIM LECINSKI: I bet you'd do one
of the things that was my

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.930
favorite quote from the
book if you were

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.250
president or in any role.

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:56.430
In the book, you wrote, "If
you don't have the right

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.160
organization and the right
people, you're not going to

00:46:59.160 --> 00:46:59.800
make it."

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.270
ED WHITACRE: That's true.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.470
You're not going to make it.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.720
AUDIENCE: I worry sometimes
about the companies in the

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.030
United States and even the
world that are too big to

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:10.240
fail, and GM was listed
as one of those.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.730
And I wonder, sometimes, if it
wouldn't be better if we could

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:18.450
make them smaller and break
them up, and to have more

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:21.110
responsibility for different
pieces-- the company that

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:24.550
makes the motors, the company
that makes the seats.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.690
And I think that's something
that a lot of companies face,

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.020
and I'm just interested in what
your take on that is.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.690
ED WHITACRE: Well, I've been
asked that question before,

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:35.930
and I'm not sure I have
a good answer for it.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.550
In fact, I don't have a good
answer for it, but I know a

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.240
company like GM is very
vital to this country.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.630
And we made our own motors,

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.630
incidentally, and lots of pieces.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:48.290
A lot of pieces we didn't make,
but we've made a lot of

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.400
them, like motors.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.510
And there are a lot of other
instances in other industries

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:57.180
or other parts of the business
where you're too big to fail.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.450
In my judgment, GM is
a lot smaller now.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:03.480
It's substantially smaller.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.140
GM should pay back the taxpayer
all the money.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.540
I don't know about the concept
of too big to fail, because

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.590
most of them were in the
banking finance arena.

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.690
But I think we did the right
thing to save GM.

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:18.730
I don't know whether it was too
big to fail or not, but

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:22.460
I'm glad we saved it, because
we need a big, successful

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:26.430
manufacturer in the car
business, and we had one in

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:30.410
Ford, and I guess Chrysler's
clawing its way back.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.770
But I don't know the question.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.020
I've never really pondered the
question of too big to fail.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.230
Doesn't sound right,
but I'm not sure.

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.500
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.100
So I really liked your comments
about managers

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.730
empowering people and giving
people clear responsibility

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.640
and then holding them
accountable.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:51.900
What's your advice, having gone
through 44 years at AT&amp;T

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.830
before you were at the
senior levels--

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.960
what's your advice for people
more junior to help their

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.520
managers be like that?

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.890
ED WHITACRE: Well, you know what
the secret to success is

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:03.140
in business?

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:06.950
Just hang in there.

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:08.900
Just keep going.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:12.240
There were many times in my
career, probably in yours,

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.920
where you get frustrated, where
you don't move, where

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.710
you think your chances
are not good.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:25.240
I was on some jobs several years
without promotion, or

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.440
looking at something
different.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.490
But I think there are
several things.

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:33.280
The secret to success is be
persistent, hang in there, and

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.790
keep trying.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:37.430
Another key is some of
it's in your hands.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:43.280
If you feel the need, go talk
to your boss and ask to do

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.540
something different.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.040
I think it's good to do things
different in your career, do

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.580
different things, and I assume
you have the possibility of

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.210
doing that here.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:57.400
And if you get tired of
engineering, go do something

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.440
else, or go try something
else.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.740
That worked for me.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.380
And I did some crazy things.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.640
One time I was in New York
early in my career.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.920
I asked to go there because I
had been in a certain job in

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.060
Texas for almost five years.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.500
And while it was a good job, and
paid well, and had a lot

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:22.180
of people reporting to me,
sometimes you feel stale.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.660
You need to do something else.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.820
You need to step out.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.970
So I asked to go to
New York City.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:27.680
Big change.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.670
Linda went with me.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.940
And if you go to New York,
I know you'd hang

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.590
in there with me.

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:37.410
And then I was in New York for
a couple of years, and I got

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:38.610
this call--

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.880
this is not the way
to handle people--

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.720
got this call from a guy in the
engineering department at

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.660
headquarters that says, Ed,
we'd like for you to go to

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.820
Arkansas as the division
engineer.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.100
He said, I want you to know
you're second choice.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.780
Our first choice
turned us down.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.280
Well, that's not exactly
the way you

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.530
handle human relations.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:03.155
But I said, you bet I'll go.

00:51:03.155 --> 00:51:04.780
I'll be there tomorrow
morning.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:09.220
So there's a lot of factors at
play, but I think overriding

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:13.850
all that is never lose faith, be
persistent, hang in there,

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.590
and do the best you
can every day.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.490
It may sound old fashioned,
but I think that works.

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:20.990
And don't be afraid to
try something new.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:24.660
I mean, risk is a good
thing sometimes.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.970
AUDIENCE: People say that the
road to hell is paved with

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:29.050
good intentions, and you want
to think that a lot of the

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:32.270
people on the front lines are
making decisions that they

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.920
think is right from
their world view.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.980
And so as a manager, when you
were brought in to fix GM, how

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.710
do you take that long view and
see how far the train is about

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:44.550
to fall off the tracks?

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:48.970
And how do you keep it going
from a high level?

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:51.800
ED WHITACRE: Well, I think,
again, it's a people question.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.540
I think you empower people,
you ask them to take the

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:59.320
long-term look, you give them
the authority to do something.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.680
If they can't do it, you
get somebody else.

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.920
You don't play around
with that very long.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.370
You keep moving.

00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:08.810
You take a risk.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:11.840
I don't think we ever did a deal
at AT&amp;T, and we made many

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.230
acquisitions, where the
numbers worked.

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:17.500
It's about what you envision
you can make out of it.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.000
It's not about what
you're buying,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.800
it's what it can become.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.270
I think that's true
of any company.

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:28.350
If top management has that
vision and can communicate it

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.700
and make that happen,
I think that's good.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.880
Stay focused on that.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.050
And sometimes it's hard
to stay focused, but

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.490
you have to do it.

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:38.670
JIM LECINSKI: Well, Ed, I'd like
to, on behalf of Google,

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.280

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.850

Congratulations on the book.

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:44.670

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:48.710
