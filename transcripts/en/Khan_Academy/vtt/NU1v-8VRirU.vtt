00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:02.195
-(Voice over) So we left off in part one

00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:04.728
getting pretty close to finding our N of T

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:07.825
that satisfies the logistic
differential equation

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:12.276
where it's initial condition
is between zero and K,

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:13.844
and now we just have to really just

00:00:13.844 --> 00:00:16.361
do some algebra to finish things up.

00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:18.146
So we left with this.

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:19.209
For our N of T this must be true.

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:22.511
Now, we could use a
little bit of logarithm

00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:24.764
properties to rewrite this left hand side

00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:27.772
as the logarithm of.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.397
The logarithm of something minus

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.762
the logarithm of something else,

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:32.633
that's going to be the first something,

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:34.034
The logarithm of the first something

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:36.977
divided by the second something.

00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:40.139
One minus N over K,

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.214
and this is of course going to be equal to

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:43.587
all this business that we have,

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:45.768
is going to be equal to,

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:47.115
actually let me just write it.

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:50.943
It's going to be equal to, equal to,

00:00:50.943 --> 00:00:55.943
R times T plus C, plus C,

00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:58.679
and now what we could do,

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.062
this is the same thing as saying that

00:01:00.062 --> 00:01:03.619
E to the R T plus C is going to be

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.263
equal to this thing right over here.

00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:08.479
This, the natural log of this,

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.527
is equal to the exponent
that I have to raise

00:01:10.527 --> 00:01:12.592
E to to get to this right over here,

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:14.676
so I could just write that.

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:15.844
We could just write,

00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:16.861
or another way of thinking about it,

00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.293
we could take E, if this is equal to that,

00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:21.340
we could take E to this
power on this left hand side,

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:23.781
and E to this power on
this right hand side,

00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:25.294
and they should be equal.

00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:27.724
So E to this power is just going

00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:29.292
to be what's inside the parenthesis.

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:31.598
It's just going to be N.

00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:35.261
It's just going to be N over one minus,

00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:38.497
one minus, N over K.

00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:39.485
I'll do that in a green color,

00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:41.372
so you can keep track of
where things came from.

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:45.222
Is equal to E to this business.

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:50.546
Is equal to E to the R T.

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:53.978
R, I'll do the T in white.

00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:58.594
R T plus C, plus C.

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.827
Now this I could rewrite if I want to.

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:05.194
If I have E to something
plus something else,

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:08.221
I could rewrite this as to the R T times

00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:13.464
E times E to the C, and
just to simplify things,

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:15.899
this is just going to be
another constant here,

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:17.526
and I could, if this is C,

00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:18.677
I could call it C one,

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:20.561
but I'm just going to
call that a constant.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.834
So I could just say
that that's going to be

00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:26.433
equal to some constant times E to the R T,

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:29.727
and now we just need to solve for N.

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:31.103
And once again, at any point while we're

00:02:31.103 --> 00:02:32.927
working on this you get inspired,

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:34.930
feel free to solve for N.

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:36.562
So let's see.

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:38.027
One way to solve for N.

00:02:38.027 --> 00:02:38.675
Let's see.

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.177
If we could take the reciprocal of both

00:02:40.177 --> 00:02:41.644
sides of this, we're going to get.

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:44.777
Let me draw a line here
just so you know we're.

00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:47.376
Let me draw a line.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:49.927
So, if we take the reciprocal
of both sides of this,

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:52.223
we're going to get one over N,

00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:57.007
one minus N over K over
light green N is equal to,

00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:00.126
is equal to, and so let's,

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:02.674
we could say it's equal to,

00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:06.227
it's equal to one over C
time E to the negative R T.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.728
But one over C, that's just
going to be another constant.

00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:10.129
So I could write one over C here,

00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:11.827
and I take the reciprocal.

00:03:11.827 --> 00:03:12.595
And once again, this is just

00:03:12.595 --> 00:03:13.296
going to be another constant,

00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:15.144
so I'm going to be a
little bit of hand waving,

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:16.262
and say well O.K we're going to

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.278
get another constant here.

00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:20.161
I could have called
this C one, this C two.

00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:22.594
I could call this C three if I want

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:24.012
to make it clear that these are not

00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:25.561
going to be the same number.

00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:27.944
This is E to the this power.

00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:30.720
This is the reciprocal of that.

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:31.237
Actually, maybe I'll do that just to

00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:33.700
make it a little bit clearer.

00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:36.284
That would have been C
one right over there,

00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:39.178
and so this is going to be, sorry,

00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:41.126
the reciprocal of this C three

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:42.343
and E to the negative,

00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:44.407
the reciprocal of E to the R
T is E to the negative R T.

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:49.983
E to the negative, E to the negative R,

00:03:51.943 --> 00:03:54.461
E to the negative R T.

00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:56.511
And let's see, if we divide the numerator

00:03:56.511 --> 00:03:59.977
and the denominator by N,

00:03:59.977 --> 00:04:00.960
or if we divide E.

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:01.329
I want to think, if we divide this

00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:04.094
term by in we're going to get.

00:04:04.094 --> 00:04:08.172
So this term by N is
going to be one over N,

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:09.318
and then this term by N is just going

00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:12.062
to be minus one over K.

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:13.654
So this is just going to be minus

00:04:14.428 --> 00:04:16.517
one over K is equal to this.

00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:21.130
This is equal to this business.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.357
So copy and paste.

00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.168
It's going to be equal to that.

00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:27.448
This is good algebra practice here.

00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:28.175
Now let's see.

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:29.477
We could take this one over K,

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.568
add it to both sides, so let's do that.

00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:36.960
So let me just cut, so
let me cut and paste it.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.748
I'm going to add it to both sides,

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.794
so that should be a plus one over K.

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:44.277
So, plus one over K.

00:04:44.277 --> 00:04:46.144
And now to solve for N,

00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:48.222
I just take the reciprocal of both sides.

00:04:48.561 --> 00:04:51.808
So I'm going to get, I'm going to get N.

00:04:52.178 --> 00:04:54.344
And I'll write it in kind
of the function notation.

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:57.379
N of T, actually let me make my T in white

00:04:57.694 --> 00:04:58.978
since I've been taking the trouble all

00:04:58.978 --> 00:05:00.776
this time of rewriting this in white,

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:02.527
is equal to one over.

00:05:02.527 --> 00:05:07.527
Is going to be equal to one
over all of this business.

00:05:08.511 --> 00:05:12.926
Is going to be equal to one
over all of this business.

00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:16.577
So copy and paste.

00:05:16.093 --> 00:05:18.691
Is going to be equal to that.

00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:21.235
And that by itself.

00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:24.530
That's by itself is already interesting.

00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:27.710
That by itself is already interesting.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:29.943
So I could write it like this.

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:33.543
And if I want, if I don't like, let's see,

00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:34.910
well yeah I could just,

00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:36.143
if I don't like having this K kind

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:37.895
of a fraction in a fraction,

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:39.957
I could rewrite it as.

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.563
Actually, maybe I'll do it over here.

00:05:43.048 --> 00:05:48.048
N of, N of T is equal to.

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.613
I'll just multiply the numerator
and the denominator by.

00:05:51.096 --> 00:05:53.097
I'll just multiply it,

00:05:53.961 --> 00:05:56.694
actually let me just leave
it like that for now.

00:05:57.127 --> 00:06:00.478
And what I'm going do, what
I'm now going to do, is say,

00:06:00.478 --> 00:06:01.345
"Well look.

00:06:01.345 --> 00:06:04.611
"We're assuming that N
of zero is N sub knot."

00:06:04.728 --> 00:06:09.012
So we're assuming that N of zero,

00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:12.776
N of zero, is equal to N sub knot.

00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:14.228
So let's write this thing.

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:15.253
Let's solve for the constant.

00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:17.144
Let's figure out what this could be

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:19.362
if we know what our initial condition is.

00:06:19.677 --> 00:06:23.644
So N of zero, N of zero,

00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:26.593
is going to be equal to,

00:06:27.228 --> 00:06:31.111
is going to be equal to one, one over.

00:06:31.243 --> 00:06:32.194
When T is zero,

00:06:32.194 --> 00:06:33.978
this is just going to be equal to one,

00:06:33.978 --> 00:06:36.427
so it's just going to be our constant C

00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:41.427
three plus one over K plus one over the

00:06:41.844 --> 00:06:44.249
maximum population that our population,

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:46.512
that our environment, can handle,

00:06:46.512 --> 00:06:49.876
and that's going to be equal to N knot,

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.710
and now we can solve for our constant.

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:53.912
So we get, let's see I'm probably going to

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:55.326
need a lot of real estate for this,

00:06:55.326 --> 00:06:57.561
so I can take the reciprocal
of both sides again,

00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:59.889
so this is something that
we're doing a lot of.

00:07:00.162 --> 00:07:05.162
C three plus one over K is
equal to one over N knot.

00:07:06.562 --> 00:07:08.083
Is equal to one over N knot.

00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:09.894
Just took the reciprocal of both sides,

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:12.813
and so we get our
constant C three is equal

00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:17.813
to one over N knot minus one over K.

00:07:18.262 --> 00:07:20.661
Minus one over K.

00:07:21.062 --> 00:07:23.293
So we can rewrite our solution,

00:07:23.293 --> 00:07:27.106
which we'll call the logistic
function, we get, we get,

00:07:27.106 --> 00:07:29.877
this is fun now, N of T.

00:07:30.793 --> 00:07:35.793
N of T is equal to one
over, our constant is this,

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:41.161
so it's going to be, let
me copy and paste this.

00:07:42.076 --> 00:07:44.861
So copy and paste.

00:07:45.002 --> 00:07:47.379
It's going to be that,
that's our constant.

00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:51.499
So it's going to be that times

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:55.127
E to the negative R T,

00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:59.228
to the negative R times T,

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:04.228
plus one over K, plus one over K.

00:08:07.744 --> 00:08:10.428
And if we don't like having
all of these denominators in,

00:08:10.428 --> 00:08:13.144
all of these fractions in the denominator,

00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:15.477
why don't we multiply everything times the

00:08:15.477 --> 00:08:18.145
numerator and the denominator by N knot K.

00:08:18.145 --> 00:08:19.470
So I'm going to multiply the

00:08:19.047 --> 00:08:22.221
numerator times N knot K,

00:08:22.644 --> 00:08:26.378
and I'm going to multiply
the denominator by N knot K.

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:28.745
N knot K.

00:08:28.745 --> 00:08:29.811
And so what do we get?

00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:31.972
This is all going to be equal to.

00:08:32.205 --> 00:08:37.205
In the numerator I have N
knot times K, N knot times K.

00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:42.089
And in the denominator I am going to have,

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.360
let's see if I multiply this term right

00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:46.738
over here times N knot
K I'm going to have K.

00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:51.011
If I multiply this term times N knot K,

00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:53.833
I'm going to have N knot,

00:08:54.293 --> 00:08:56.277
so it's going to be minus N knot,

00:08:57.512 --> 00:09:02.512
minus N not, times E to the negative R T,

00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:08.595
Times E to the negative R T, negative R T,

00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:13.346
and then if I multiply this times N not K,

00:09:13.346 --> 00:09:15.362
I'm going to get N knot.

00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:18.026
So plus N knot.

00:09:18.146 --> 00:09:19.395
And there you have it.

00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:21.277
We have found a solution for the

00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:22.894
logistic differential equation.

00:09:22.894 --> 00:09:24.789
We will call this logistic function,

00:09:24.789 --> 00:09:26.808
and in future videos we
will explore it more,

00:09:26.979 --> 00:09:28.844
and we will see what it actually does.

00:09:28.844 --> 00:09:29.820
If you were to plot this,

00:09:29.082 --> 00:09:29.911
and I encourage you to do so,

00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:31.457
either on the internet,

00:09:31.457 --> 00:09:31.530
you could try Wolfram Alpha,

00:09:32.187 --> 00:09:33.468
or if you're on your graphing calculator,

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:36.044
you will see that it has the exact

00:09:36.044 --> 00:09:38.110
properties that we want it to have.

00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.195
It starts at N knot.

00:09:39.294 --> 00:09:40.369
It starts to increase
at an increasing rate,

00:09:41.044 --> 00:09:42.395
but then it starts to slow down as

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:44.512
we reach our maximum population.

00:09:44.512 --> 00:09:46.761
And so that is actually
a very neat function.

00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:48.777
If you model a population with this,

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:50.679
you can kind of start to make predictions

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:54.261
about what might the
population be at time whatever.

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.542
And so, hopefully, you
found that satisfying.
