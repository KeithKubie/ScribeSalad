00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:11.670
The Fascinating Saga of the Chicken War or
Why There are So Few Truck Models in the US

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.970
Ever wonder why if you want to buy a truck
in the United States you have drastically

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.460
fewer selections than many other countries
tend to enjoy and why U.S.-made trucks dominate

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.880
the market in the country, while the same
ratios aren’t seen at all in cars?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.750
It’s all because of chickens.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.999
No, really.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.850
Before the twentieth century, chicken wasn’t
nearly as common of an item on people’s

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.350
dinner plates as today and was very much a
luxury item mostly restricted to the wealthy

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.350
in Europe.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.960
(In fact, chickens were actually originally
domesticated for cock-fighting, not food.)

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.320
Improvements in food storage via refrigeration
(see: Why Chicken Goes Bad So Quickly), refinements

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.100
in chicken breeding, and the development of
the so called “factory chicken” helped

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.269
change chicken consumption in the United States
and then the world.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.030
So what does this have to do with the truck
market in the United States?

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.689
The U.S. began producing so much chicken that
businesses started exporting it to Europe

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.940
in massive quantities by the early 1960s,
peaking at the United States owning half the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.280
chicken import market in Europe.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.460
European farmers simply could not keep up
with the much lower prices of imported American

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.460
poultry.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.100
For instance, in West Germany, only 1.1% of
imported chicken came from the United States

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.320
in 1956; six years later, despite the cost
and effort of shipping the chickens all the

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.780
way from America, American poultry made up
nearly a quarter of all West German chicken

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.840
imports and was sold for much less than the
local varieties.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.170
Accusations against the American poultry industry
soon began to fly, with claims from the Dutch

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.860
that the American chickens were being purposely
priced below cost to drive the Dutch poultry

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.259
farmers out of business; the West Germans
accused American chicken farmers of using

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.280
arsenic to cause the chickens to gain extra
weight, while the French poultry farmers claimed

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.000
eating American chickens would have a negative
effect on one’s virility.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.410
In response to the United States’ poultry
rapidly taking over the market in many European

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.400
countries, the European Economic Community
(EEC) in 1962 instituted a tariff on imported

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400
chicken.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.120
Officially, the goal of the EEC was to help
the European economy continue to recover from

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.430
World War II.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.620
The tariff drastically raised the price of
imported U.S. poultry and some countries even

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.900
banned U.S. chicken all together.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.129
The U.S. government spent eighteen months
trying to negotiate a repeal of the tariff

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.370
and bans, but without success.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.629
The then Chancellor of Germany, Konrad Adenauer,
even later reported that, despite the Cold

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.989
War threatening to get very hot, “about
half” of his many conversations with Kennedy

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.599
were about chickens.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.970
Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas even
once interrupted a NATO meeting on nuclear

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.240
armament to threaten to remove U.S. troops
from NATO if the chicken sanctions weren’t

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240
removed.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.580
The whole thing, waged between allies in the
Cold War, ultimately became dubbed “The

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.580
Chicken War.”

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.019
After diplomacy failed, in retaliation, President
Lyndon B. Johnson signed the so-called Chicken

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.659
Tax into law on December 4, 1963.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.879
Not at all directly about chickens, it targeted
potato starch, brandy, dextrin, and light

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.220
trucks, and it forced companies importing
those items to the United States to pay a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.849
whopping 25% tax on said imports.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.290
Each of the four products taxed under the
Chicken Tax were strategically targeted.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.939
For instance, the reason for choosing to include
light trucks had to do with a specific manufacturer:

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:43.939
Volkswagen.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.739
The Volkswagen vans were immensely popular
in the United States during the early 1960s,

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.569
and the U.S. government claimed the import
cost of those from West Germany was about

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.200
equal to the loss of revenue for the poultry
industry at not being able to export chicken

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.510
to West Germany.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.390
Practically overnight, the once popular VW
van, which fell under the classification of

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.019
“light truck,” disappeared from car dealerships
around the United States as consumers weren’t

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.220
willing to pay the increased prices directly
resulting from the 25% tariff.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.600
Of course, there were other industries Johnson
could have picked to balance things out.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.420
As to why specifically the light-truck industry
was one selection, there was a political benefit

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.970
to him at home.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.970
Recordings from his time in the White House
later revealed an arrangement between Johnson

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.160
and Walter Reuther, the president of the United
Auto Workers.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.180
In exchange for Johnson targeting Volkswagen,
Reuther agreed not to call a strike of auto

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.500
workers ahead of the 1964 presidential election
and to agree to support Johnson’s work in

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.500
civil rights.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.170
However, it should also be noted that the
Chicken Tax was not so specifically worded

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.360
to be levied just against Europeans manufactures,
but against any automaker who imports light

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.500
trucks into the United States.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
While most manufacturers chose simply not
to sell their trucks in the U.S. anymore,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.070
or decided to build plants in the U.S. to
produce at least some of their light truck

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.810
lines, like Honda and Toyota, others discovered
clever loopholes to import their trucks and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.960
cargo vans without paying the exorbitant tax.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.770
For instance, certain Japanese companies started
exporting pickup trucks without the bed or

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.570
box attached to the U.S. rather than the fully
assembled pickup truck.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.800
This ultimately made them only subject to
a 4% tax, and the manufacturers simply attached

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.800
the bed or box once the truck arrived in the
U.S.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.070
However, this loophole was removed in 1980
at the request of U.S. automakers and unions,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.880
making these imports subject to the 25% tax.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.080
Another loophole truck manufacturers still
take advantage of is the difference between

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.680
a passenger vehicle and a truck- one, of course,
is designed to haul passengers and the other

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.250
cargo, but the passenger vehicle is only subject
to a 2.5% tax.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.870
So, for instance, as recently as 2012, Ford
(ironically enough an American company this

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.350
tariff normally helps) built its Transit Connect
vans in Turkey and outfitted them with seats,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.590
glass windows, and seatbelts in the back.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.670
They were then shipped to the U.S. and passed
through customs as passenger vehicles.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.450
The vans then went to a warehouse where local
contractors removed the seats and windows

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.340
from the back, replacing them with a floor
piece and steel respectively to transform

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.140
the Transit Connect into a commercial van
for hauling cargo.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.190
This loophole was also closed up when U.S.
Customs ultimately forced the company to start

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.210
paying the 25% tax on these vehicles as of
March 2013.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.680
Ford lobbyists then began pushing for removing
the tax for American-based companies, even

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.810
on their imports, but keeping it for everyone
else.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.690
The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van goes a different
route before arriving in the United States.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.840
While passenger versions of the van are immune
to the Chicken Tax, the cargo versions cannot

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.160
normally be imported to the U.S. without the
tax.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.190
So Mercedes-Benz ships the cargo version in
a sort of kit form, only partially built,

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.430
making sure to leave the kit incomplete enough
so that when it’s assembled in the U.S.,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.360
just enough parts are purchased and added
in America to not have the authorities getting

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.920
too upset about it.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.310
The process costs Mercedes-Benz quite a bit,
resulting in an increase in the cost of the

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.800
van of about 9%.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.780
Of course, 9% is better than 25%.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.040
In the years since the chicken tax was made
into law, the taxes on three of the four items

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.250
have been repealed, but, as you might have
guessed from those relatively recent examples,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.450
the tax on light trucks remains.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.290
Proponents claim the tax helps protect American
companies and keeps jobs in America.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.740
Opponents note that before the Chicken Tax,
the “Big Three” American automakers featured

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.010
numerous types of light trucks and cargo vans
in their product lines, but since then the

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.700
Chicken Tax has “insulated U.S. truck manufacturers
from competition for five long decades.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.550
That’s kept prices high and created huge
profit centers at Chrysler, Ford, and General

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.750
Motors — so much so… that the Big Three
have slacked off in developing innovative

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.750
cars…”

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.560
It has also been suggested that not only would
U.S. consumers get a greater variety of trucks

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.520
to pick from if the tariff was removed, but
the prices would also likely fall with increased

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.830
competition, bringing profit margins on trucks
and cargo vans more in line with car sale

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:28.130
profit margins for U.S. automakers, providing
a net benefit to U.S. consumers.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.080
Whatever side of the argument one’s on,
it is, at the least, a fascinating piece of

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:52.020
history that is still unfolding today.
