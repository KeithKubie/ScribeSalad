00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.171
You're so lucky
your dad's dead.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.506
You're telling me.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.441
You guys, I didn't know
my food came with fries.

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:08.575
I am not eating them.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.310
I have had fries
like three times this week.

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:11.678
I'm so bad.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.146
You can afford it.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.381
No.
Who cares?

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.717
I ate like, three cans
of Pringles yesterday.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.452
Once you pop,
they're not joking.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.953
I'm so bad.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.021
Those are like air.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.322
They're literally air.

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:23.657
You don't look fat at all.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.360
No, I was cyberbullying my niece
on Instagram the other day,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.795
and I literally
ate 15 mini muffins.

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:29.863
I'm so bad.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.565
They're like pellets,
that's nothing.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:32.633
Are they big muffins?

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.867
No.
No, they're mini.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.235
Do you know what
"mini" means?

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.937
It means smaller than big.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.572
Yesterday,
after I knelt on my gerbil

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.873
to hear what sound
it would make,

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.175
I like, wasn't thinking.

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.076
I ate a ball of mozzarella
like it was a peach.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:44.511
I'm so bad.

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:45.712
You always look great.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.581
No, I think that's, like,
negative calories.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:48.916
I'm seriously bad.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.684
I can't get out of bed
without having a calzone.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:51.852
The other morning,

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:53.353
when that woman walked off
the GW bridge,

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.855
I didn't do
anything to help her.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.623
It's because I was
chewing my calzone.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:57.791
I'm so bad.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:58.825
Are you serious?

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:59.927
You're a (bleep) saint.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.061
I'm the bad one.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.596
Two weeks ago
when I was having--

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:03.664
Well, there's no term

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.265
for how late term
of an abortion this was.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.969
Anyhoo, I literally ate
an entire bucket of wings

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.104
and chased it with
a 16-ounce lobster.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.973
I'm like, why am I
still eating for two?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.208
I'm so bad.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.576
Wait, I'm really ashamed

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.344
I just told you guys
that I ate like that.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.712
Do you think I'm a monster?

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.080
No!
No!

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.315
Seafood, it's good for you.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.449
Yeah.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.784
I'm sorry about
your abortion.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.686
I took that guy that
I'm dating to the restaurant

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.487
where he was molested
and he left crying

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:28.655
and guess who stayed

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.123
and ate the entire rest
of his birthday cake?

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.124
Me.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.093
I was like, that'll do, pig.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.895
Oink, oink.
I'm so bad.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:35.929
You're not bad.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.197
You're stick thin.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.100
Your thigh gap is, like,
the envy of every thigh gap.

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:42.569
Last Saturday, after I took
a smoke machine to the burn unit

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:43.837
to see how they'd react,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.774
I ate so much General Tso's
they gave me his hat.

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.309
It looks insane on me.

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:50.744
I'm so bad.

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:52.145
Shut your dick off.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.848
You look amazing in hats
and you know this.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.517
My dad says I don't
look good in anything.

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.886
Can I offer anyone dessert?

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.054
Oh.

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:01.955
If I--

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.056
Like, just one bite?

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.057
Would you--

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.259
Share something?

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:07.227
Four forks?

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.905
(all screaming)

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.907
(cries out)

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.775
My face!

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.844
I'm so bad!
I'm so bad!

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.213
I'm so--
I'm so bad.

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.649
I'll have the flan.
