Welcome to Film Tonight.

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:05.806
This episode, I'm joined by two
of the funniest folks alive,

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:08.175
the stars of Night School,
Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.443
-Hey.
-Hey, Josh.

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:10.677
-What's up, Josh?
-Hey.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.079
-Thanks so much for stopping by.
-Yeah.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.248
Since your new film is about
going back to school,

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:15.883
Tiffany, I'm wondering
what do you think

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.651
you'd say to your
18 year old self?

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:21.088
Always be true to who you are,
'cause you are a unicorn.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.356
That's good.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.924
-That's inspiring.
-That's great. That's great.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.125
What about for you, Kevin,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.427
what do you think you'd say
to 18 year old Kevin Hart?

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.096
For one, I would say don't drink
too much at the

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.498
Super Bowl party.
Joking, Josh.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.735
Man, what would I say?
I don't know. I don't know.

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:37.404
There's a lot that I would say.
You know, 18 year old me.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.840
Well, we actually have
a little surprise for you.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.010
Joining us right now here
in studio, Kevin,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.612
meet your actual
18 year old self.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:47.281
What do you mean my actual 18-

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.549
Come on out.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:49.783
Damn.
What the fuck?

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.018
Who the hell?

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:52.419
Time out.
Is that a time portal.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:53.987
Do you know how
3D printers work?

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.222
-No.
-Kinda like that.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.492
What? Are you ...
Are you kidding me?

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.560
This is not Kevin, okay?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.195
Are you blind? Look at me.
Look at ...

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:03.530
I was going through
a awkward phase.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.731
I was so stupid.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.600
A awkward phase?
Are you serious?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.268
Were you sawed in half
by a magician

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:09.736
who forgot to reattach
the other half?

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.238
Talkin' about cut me in half?

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.707
This is a full beef burger,
okay.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.642
This is a big burger.
You like a slider.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:16.944
Talkin' 'bout a couple inches,
Tiffany.

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:18.278
Could be an inch or two.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.546
You know what it was?
Coffee.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.781
Really?

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.282
I was drinking back
to back cups of coffee

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.483
and that's what
stunted me a little bit.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.452
But other than that,
this is exactly what it was.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.421
Okay, I need a DNA test
'cause this is not you.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.655
I can prove it's me. Watch this.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.224
Hey, young Kev, do the tongue
thing we used to do.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:34.027
The tongue thing.
I mean, there it is.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.462
I don't know if this proves it,
but I like it.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.663
What?

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:37.864
I think we're missing
the point here.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.633
-What do you think-
-God dang.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.568
I used to do that all the time.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.970
Oh my God. I think I'm pregnant.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.738
I had a gland problem.

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:46.807
I used to sweat,
and I used to do this

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:49.343
because I would start stinking,
so I took my shirts off.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:51.845
They used to tease me.
"Look at Kev all out of shape.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.047
You need to get
in the gym, Kev."

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.849
Man, thank God I finally did.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.918
This is beautiful.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:01:59.720
That is not beautiful.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.988
I feel like we've gotten off
topic.

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:03.056
This is an amazing
opportunity, Kevin.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.592
What else do you wanna say
to your 18 year old self?

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.594
You know, look. You're gonna
go through a situation

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.496
where you find out you got IBS,

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.865
which is irritable
bowel syndrome.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.567
I didn't find out
'til I was older.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.136
There's groups that you could
talk to about it,

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.839
and when you come together
and realize that as a people,

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.841
that other people
are suffering from ...

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:23.110
Hey, man.
Hey, Tiffany.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.978
Stop talking to young me
while I'm talking to young me.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.913
Is this gon' fuck up the space
time continuum or something?

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.115
Nah, we should be fine.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.750
Okay, well then I'm gonna
have me some fun.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.218
It's all fun and games
'til you realize

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:33.120
I had unbelievable gas.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.955
Every five minutes, pap, pap,
pap, pap, pap, pap,

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:37.090
pap,
like a goddamn road of pellets,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.126
I would just leave.
Milk.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:41.228
That's all the time
we have on Film Tonight.

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.530
See you next time.
Thanks, man.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.699
Yeah. Hey, Josh,
this is a messed up show.

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:49.136
It's just not ...
it's just not good.
