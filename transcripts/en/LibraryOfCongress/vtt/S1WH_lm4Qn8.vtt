&gt;&gt; Meredith Hindley: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.280
to the 18th annual Library of
Congress national book festival.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.580
I'm Meredith Hindley.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.680
I'm with the National
Endowment for the Humanities,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.090
or you might better
know us as NEH.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.850
NEH is proud to sponsor this
year's Understanding our

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.150
World Stage.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.730
For those of you who don't
know, NEH is a small,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.830
independent federal agency.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.400
We fund programs in
preservation, research,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.830
education and public programming
-- documentaries, films.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.300
The humanities, of course, are
the reason that we're here today

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.080
because it's literature history.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.770
It's the reason that
we all love books.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.860
As a historian, I am
particularly excited

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.300
about this afternoon's panel,
which features Clarence Page,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.430
Isabel Wilkerson, and Brooks
D. Simpson and conversation

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.610
about America's first great
struggle for racial equality.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.160
Isabel Wilkerson is the author
of the Warmth of Other Suns,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.340
an epic account of the great
migration that saw millions

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.990
of African Americans
leave the south in search

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.150
of a better life elsewhere.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.960
The book appeared on more
than 30 Best of the Year lists

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.940
and won the National Book
Critic Circles Award.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.890
Wilkerson also won the
Pulitzer Prize for her work

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.810
as the Chicago bureau chief
of the New York Times,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.910
making her the first
black woman in the history

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.690
of American journalism
to win the Pulitzer Prize

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.440
and the first African American
to win for individual reporting.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.510
She is also a recipient
of a 2000 -- yeah, right?

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:44.580
[ Applause ]

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.590
She's also the recipient of a
2015 national humanities medal

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.890
which is given out by NEH

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.730
in conjunction with
the White House.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.290
Brooks D. Simpson is a
professor of Civil War studies

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.250
at Arizona State University.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.300
He has written and edited
16 books about the Civil War

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.780
and reconstruction
including Ulysses S. Grant,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.740
Triumph Over Adversity,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.500
which was named a New
York Times notable book.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.200
He has recently edited
Reconstruction Voices

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.550
from America's First Great
Struggle for Racial Equality,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.430
for the Library of America.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.890
The book is a compilation
of more

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.910
than 100 contemporaneous
letters, diary entries,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.450
interviews, petitions,
testimony and newspaper

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.780
and magazine articles by the
famous and not-so-famous.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.520
NEH helped launch the
Library of America more

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.000
than three decades ago and
this new volume continues its

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.500
tradition of documenting,
publishing,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.270
and celebrating American voices.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.280
Our moderator for
today is Clarence Page,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.400
longtime columnist for the
Chicago Tribune and one

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.150
of the country's most insightful
observers of race and identity.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.450
In 19 --

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.750
[ Laughter ]

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.050
Is that okay?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.350
You good with that?

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.650
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson:
You'll take it.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.950
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
[Inaudible] yeah.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.250
Thank you.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.550
&gt;&gt; Meredith Hindley: I can
choose some other adjective.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.850
We're good?

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.150
Okay. All right.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.450
All right.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.750
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: Very fine.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.050
&gt;&gt; Meredith Hindley: In 1989,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.350
Page won the Pulitzer
Prize for commentary.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.650
His syndicated column
currently appears

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.110
in 150 newspapers
across the country.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.420
He's also a contributor and
commentator for PBS News Hour,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.870
Hardball with Chris Matthews,
and NPR's weekend edition.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.920
And so with that, I'm going
to turn it over to Mr. Page.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.220
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
Thank you very much.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.520
Thank you.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.320
Big round of applause
for our panel.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.310
[ Applause ]

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.610
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
Thank you very much.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.300
I've really been
looking forward to this.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.260
This -- I view this
hour as an examination

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.340
of an underappreciated period.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.150
We all have -- if your
upbringing was like mine,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.430
you learned a lot
about the Civil War.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.580
You learned about the
Civil Rights Movement.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.270
I watched it on television
for that matter.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.720
And that period in between,
about a century almost,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.550
kind of gets short shrift.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.940
We can talk about
that and the fact

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.580
that we've got two
wonderful experts here today

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.140
on examining these two periods.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.940
Of course, Isabel Wilkerson,
as you have just heard,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.010
her wonderful book, Warmth of
Other Suns, and Brooks Simpson,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.880
who's done his -- well,
his latest Civil War book

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.670
and book examining created
after the Civil War,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.850
the words of reconstruction.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.600
This is -- in both cases, we're
talking about a period that kind

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.840
of explains so much of our
current political landscape,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.050
our sociological landscape,
our cultural landscape.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.280
And I can't wait to get into
it because in some ways,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.210
certainly the story of the
Great Migration and the story

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.830
of the slavery period were
stories that had deep impact

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.680
on my family and millions

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.980
of other families
across the country.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.710
And helps -- examining
those [inaudible] helps

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.130
to give us important insights
into where we are going.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.700
So I am -- would like
to first talk to Isabel

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.000
about that migration period and
then to Brooks about the period

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.840
that led up to it and the
factors that led up to it,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.500
and then get to our -- get
to your questions as well.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.690
So I have my faithful
timekeeper here

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.250
to do what I never do,
keep track of time.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.040
So it's a -- Isabel, I want
to say congratulations.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.280
I'm delighted to be on
stage with you here today.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.290
Your book in many ways
has been something

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.830
of a phenomenon among
people I know,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.250
a lot like Roots was
back in the '70s.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.380
Stories that help us to --
well, spur us to say, well,

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.680
what about my family story?

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.330
What about the community
that I live in?

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.170
This crosses racial lines.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.150
You all remember how popular
Roots was, and Isabel,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.030
you've kind of become a similar
sort of a sought after figure

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.670
for the wonderful
stories that you reveal.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.420
And your book, of
course, focuses on the --

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.650
that period that affected
so many millions of us,

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.350
and so many of our families,
and you chose to focus

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.180
on three families in particular
to exemplify the period that --

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.600
like we say, a little
[inaudible] bet you've been

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.900
asked this a million times.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.230
But I'd like you to
say, first of all,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.940
why you picked those
three families.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.970
What is so special about
them that can help the rest

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.230
of us get insight
into the period?

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.530
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson:
Well, thank you for that.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.520
I'm honored to be here
on so many levels,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.330
to be here on the
panel with you.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.530
Also, to be here
for the second time

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.680
at the National Book
Festival for the same book.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.880
I mean, this is --
I was here in 2011

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.030
and now I'm back here in 2018.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.340
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: That's got

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.640
to be a well-worn
copy you've got there.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.940
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: It is.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.240
This is my version of
the book and I often say

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.560
that if this book
were human being,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.880
it would be in high
school and dating

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.360
because it took me 15
years to write the book

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.350
and now it's taken over my
life in so many other ways.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.150
So I'm so thrilled and honored
to be back here in Washington

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.440
where I am actually from.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.140
This was the --

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.540
[ Applause ]

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.730
This was the receiving station
of the Great Migration for some

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.600
of the people who came
up from North Carolina,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.030
Georgia, and Virginia.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.420
So I am a product of the
migration to this city.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:36.890
So it's very special and very
close to my heart to be here.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.360
I chose to work on this book,
on this topic because I agree

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.170
that this is an
underappreciated,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.810
unrecognized epic in
our country's history.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.700
It is not something
that happened

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.000
in one year or two years.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.620
It actually unfolded
from the time

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.980
of World War I until the 1970s.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.230
It involved six million
African Americans

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.420
who defected the Jim
Crow south to get

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.350
to what they hoped would
be freedom in the north,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.340
the Midwest, and west.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.020
This means that the
majority of African Americans

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.970
that you might meet
in the cities from --

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.750
you know, from Washington up to
New York and over to Chicago,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.050
Detroit, the Midwest and all
the way over to the West Coast,

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.650
are -- many of these
people are actually products

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.220
of the Great Migration.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.260
I view this as a beautifully
American story because most --

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.140
many, many Americans are
the product of migration

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.000
from across the Atlantic Ocean,
from across the Pacific Ocean,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.030
from across the Rio Grande.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.150
It's part of what
-- it's often viewed

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.900
as being an American often
means for many people,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.410
other than the Natives who
were already here, was --

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.650
would be to be the descendent
of people who did part

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.250
of what these people did, who
left everything in order to set

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.000
out for what they hoped
would be a better life.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.860
The difference here is that this
Great Migration was the only

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.720
time in our country's history
that American citizens had

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.200
to leave the land of their
birth and to set out for places

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.200
within the borders of
their own country in order

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.790
to be recognized as citizens.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.780
In other words, this is the only
time in our country's history,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.060
these people are the only ones
who had to act like immigrants

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.350
in order to be recognized
as citizens.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.090
And that's what makes the
Great Migration singular in all

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.500
of the ways that we view
migration and immigration

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.400
in the current time,
people coming

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.040
from outside of the country.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.350
I also view -- when you
think of the Great Migration,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.650
you often can think of it

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.640
as this was the tremendous
advance guard that led

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.320
to the Civil Rights Movement.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.680
This was the time from the start

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.090
of the 20th century
throughout much

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.500
of the 20th century was
essentially the effort

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.930
of African Americans to
pursue freedom by voting

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.750
with their bodies to get to
what they hoped would be a freer

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.080
place outside of the place
to which they were born.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.000
And then also the goal of
this was to connect all of us

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.490
to what was the unfoldment of
what happened in the cities

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.130
as a result of their arrival.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.420
This meant redlining and
restrictive covenants.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.030
These are the measures that
were enacted as a result

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.440
of the Great Migration of
people coming to these cities.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.470
So they were fleeing one
form of repression only

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.500
to find a different kind

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.800
of hostility once they
arrived in these places.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.130
I chose to tell the story,
to answer your question,

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.130
through the lives of three
people because I wanted people

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.730
who were reading this book many,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.650
many years after the
migration concluded,

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.720
to feel that they were in the --

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.720
on the train seats
with the people.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.450
That they were actually at the
kitchen table with the people

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.750
as they were trying to figure

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.960
out should we go
or should we stay.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.260
What should we do?

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.810
This was a question that many,
many African Americans, in fact,

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.350
the majority of African
Americans would have had

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.680
to consider at some
point during that time.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.550
And that's because before
the Great Migration began,

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.160
90% of all African
Americans were in the south.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.240
By the time that the
Great Migration ended,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.080
nearly half had redistributed
themselves all

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.680
over the rest of the country.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.290
And so what this meant was that
this was an unfurling of people,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.090
this was a spreading

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.630
out of people throughout
the rest of the country.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.640
And so that's why this
affected so many people.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.040
But to have us to be able to
see and feel what they went

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.820
through meant to focus
in on three people.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.710
So the three people, Ida
Mae, Brandon Gladney,

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.210
George Swanson Starling

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.510
and Robert Joseph Pershing
Foster were the three people

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.630
who each represented the three
streams of this Great Migration,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.330
people who went up the East
Coast from Georgia, Florida,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.940
the Carolinas, and
Virginia, here to Washington,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:01.040
D.C. to Baltimore and up to
the East Coast toward New York.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.120
Then there was the Midwest
stream, which carried people

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.040
from Mississippi, Alabama,
Tennessee and Arkansas

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.220
to Chicago, to Detroit,
to Cleveland,

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.520
and the entire Midwest.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.020
And then there was a West Coast
stream which carried people

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.640
from Louisiana and
Texas out to California

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.660
and when they really wanted to
get away, they went to Seattle.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.960
And when they really,
really wanted

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.600
to get away, they
went to Alaska.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.050
That's how far they went.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.020
And so each of them
represents those three streams.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.730
Each of them represents
a different socioeconomic

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.600
experience from which they
were all leaving from.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.760
They each were in --

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.650
were leaving for different
precipitating reasons

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:48.460
and they also were beautifully
imperfect and they were clear

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.440
to me about their -- willing to
talk about their imperfections

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.740
in their decision making.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.320
And that's how I
settled on the three

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.750
to make this come
alive for people.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.300
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: Well,
you're a terrific storyteller

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:03.440
and you also -- I just heard
a little applause over there.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.270
And also certainly -- well,
yourself and your family were,

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.210
in many ways, products
of the migration.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.510
Am I right?

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.810
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: Yes.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.610
Yes. My mother was
from Rome, Georgia.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:21.050
[ Laughter ]

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.750
And my father was from
Petersburg, Virginia

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.460
and they migrated
during different years --

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.050
actually, different decades
searching for something better

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.520
and they met here,
married, and here I am.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.290
This is a universal story
for most Americans anyway,

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.600
but particularly for
African Americans.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.160
It's beautifully
predictable when you go

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.400
to a particular city,
such as Detroit,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.870
and you see that Aretha
Franklin, for example,

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.730
her family was a product
of the Great Migration,

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.380
as were pretty much
everybody who were part --

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.890
who was part of Motown.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.560
And her father was from -- was
a sharecropper in Mississippi.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.950
He migrated to Memphis,
the on to Detroit.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.640
And so this is just the
universal experience

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.310
of what we view as urban African
Americans in the north, Midwest,

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.770
and west, was the story
of the Great Migration.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.480
That's how people got there.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.010
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: Now,
how much did the pattern

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.790
of the railroad lines
and the black press have

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.300
to do with the migration?

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.420
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: The
railroads were the --

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.520
were the route that --

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.340
the means, the mechanism
by which they escaped.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.740
And so because of the railroads,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.640
wherever the railroads
were going, you know,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.580
the city of New Orleans, the
Illinois Central Railroad that's

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.150
of legend was what people
in Mississippi were able

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.950
to take to get to the north.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.490
And that route, the
tracks that were set

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.060
by the Illinois Central
Railroad, determined that people

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.320
in Mississippi were going
to end up in Chicago.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.250
And that's how that happened.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.180
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: That's how
Chicago got so many Mississippi.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.480
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: And a lot

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.780
of people say it's
Mississippi North.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.080
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: Right.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.720
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: And so
then there also became Harriett

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.600
Tubmans in so many
people's family.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.750
I mean, I'm sure that there
are people who are descendants

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.580
of many, many migration streams
who will speak about someone

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.780
in their family who
was the first to leave

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.140
and then they brought
others behind

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.000
and that's how families got out.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.300
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: Well,

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.600
mine come up on the
Baltimore in Ohio.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.980
The BNO line, which --

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.820
from Alabama and just dropped
folks off along [inaudible]

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.580
so I got [inaudible] from
Tennessee and right through Ohio

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.360
where I grew up and went all the
way to Detroit and where I used

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.300
to listen to Aretha
Franklin like everybody else.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.600
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: Yeah.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.070
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: But that
-- the [inaudible] line,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.120
you spend enough time in
Chicago to be familiar

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.110
with Chicago Defender and some

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.740
of the other black press
around the country.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.960
What role did they have in
supporting the migration?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.330
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: I view
the newspapers in the north,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.650
which we should always remember
were considered contraband

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.950
in the south.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:57.280
They were not always --
you know, they're not --

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.180
they were not something that
you could just go around --

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.100
you just couldn't go
into a store and buy one.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.970
That's where the Pullman Porters
became essential in helping

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.270
to make them possible.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.570
They would drop them off

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.750
at a particularly designated
spot along the rail line.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.070
And that's where people knew --

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.200
African Americans who were in
the south would know that's

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.000
where to pick them up and
then they would be, you know,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.340
handed -- spread to
people in the south,

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.240
read at the kitchen tables.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.060
Could not be seen out with them.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:30.360
But this is what set in
motion or gave people an idea

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.960
of how they might be able
to make it in the north.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.220
I would consider the black
press at that time to be similar

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.950
to Twitter or Facebook or way
-- and also Craigslist in terms

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.420
of ways of letting people
know, this is the information.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.720
This is what you can do.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.940
And many -- there were many,
many letters that were written

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.650
to the Chicago Defender,
you know, saying I am --

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.540
this is where I am
now in Alabama.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.000
I'm in Mississippi.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.300
Things are very hard for us.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.430
They're heartbreaking
stories that are told

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.730
through those letters.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.030
And they're seeking information.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.330
How can I make a go of it?

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.610
And those articles
about what was happening

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.910
in the north were
inspirational for them

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.510
and gave them a sense
of what was possible.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.070
So they were newspapers but
they also were mechanisms

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.380
that would give people an idea

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.530
of how they could
make it happen.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:21.830
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
And there was a --

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.190
well, what happened when
they got to the north?

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.750
It wasn't all land
of milk and honey.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.050
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson:
It was similar

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.450
to what happens in
any migration.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.900
I mean, we see that today
throughout the world

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.440
where people are often --

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.760
people who are already

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.510
in a particular place
may be resistant

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.390
to those coming from
the outside.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:50.180
We see that they may be cordoned
off in places that are reserved

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.570
for those who are
recent arrivals.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.090
These people who were
leaving were not just --

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.730
they were not migrants, per say.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.210
They were actually refugees.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.630
They were political refugees
seeking political asylum

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.470
within the borders
of their own country.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.220
And what occurred is we see
refugee camps in other parts

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.390
of the world, and that is
essentially what happened

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.940
in most of the cities in the
north, Midwest and west is

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.510
that they -- they were cordoned
off into segregated areas,

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.620
which were then enforced
by redlining

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.650
and restrictive covenants
which meant that these --

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.280
the people were essentially met

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.560
with resistance and
often hostility.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.590
When they sought to leave those
spaces that had been reserved

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.990
for them, then they often
met with tremendous hostility

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.510
and resistance and
often violence.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.810
One of the people

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.900
who experienced this
was Lorraine Hansberry

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.930
who was a product of
the Great Migration,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.040
father from Tennessee --
father from Mississippi,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.340
mother from Tennessee.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.890
And they arrived -- they were
on the south side as you know

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.040
so well, and when they
sought to buy a house outside

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.230
of the designated precincts
that had been reserved

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.600
for African Americans from
the south, they were met

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.800
with a tremendous
resistance and hostility

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.100
that they actually couldn't --

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.860
were not permitted to
move into the house

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.160
that they had purchased.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.030
And they -- a brick
that was thrown

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.990
at the family narrowly missed
Lorraine Hansberry's head.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.160
She was seven or eight
years old at the time.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.930
And her father had to go all
the way to the Supreme Court

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.360
to win the right to live in the
house that they had purchased.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.880
So that was one example of
the resistance that they met.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.260
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
You mentioned how --

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.700
what newspapers were
treated as contraband

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.290
that encouraged black
folks to move to the north.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.520
And, Brooks, you can
respond to this too.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.110
One irony that I know
that was that of all --

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.860
that people were trying
to escape in the south.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.760
But after enough
of them escaped,

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.610
there became a shortage
of black folks.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.960
And so it became
virtually criminal

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.680
to try to leave the south.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.760
And I said, Julie, they
can't live with us,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.170
they can't live without
us, you know?

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.240
But it seemed kind of like that.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.900
And there was also, as I
mentioned, the reception

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.930
in the north, the 1919
Race Riots there in Chicago

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.580
and others around the
country, St. Louis others.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.260
And they were in the time of
World War I, really that's just

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.080
after World War I we're
talking about there.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.360
So this is a -- so how would
you rate the amount of --

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.950
well, the bad news of
the migration as far

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.320
as some families were concerned?

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.620
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: Meaning?

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.720
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: Well, like,
for example, the hostility

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.300
in the north as well as the --
what oppression in the south

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.070
for those who wanted to leave.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.370
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: Well, yeah.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.200
There are lots of people who
will look at the Great Migration

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:43.930
and see the response to the
Great Migration as a kind

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.230
of commentary on whether
it was worth it or not.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.910
And I think that
that should be left

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.540
to the people themselves
to determine.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.550
Those who took -- had the
courage to leave a place

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.680
that was so repressive that
actually there were efforts

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.040
to keep them from going.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.950
There are people who would
actually be arrested at --

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.730
on the -- at the
railroad platforms.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.950
These were [inaudible]
free American citizens.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.820
There were people who were
arrested in their train seats

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.150
and when there were too many
people to arrest at that --

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.230
at the time that they might
have been trying to leave,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.680
they would actually wave
the train on through

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.050
so that the train would not
stop and then they would have

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.090
to figure out how, now,
will we get to freedom.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.770
So there were tremendous
obstacles that they had to face.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.880
There -- while the Chicago
Defender and the Amsterdam --

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.980
the newspapers in
New York and also

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.660
in Pittsburgh were
an inspiration,

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.580
it was up to the people to
actually make that decision.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.260
They were the ones
that were going to have

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.930
to leave the planter that they
were said to owe money to.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.540
They were the ones that were
going to have to figure out how

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:55.480
to get a ticket when the
prevailing repressive Jim Crow

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.860
regime would not allow them to
buy a ticket, make it difficult

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.000
for them to buy a ticket, make
it difficult for them to find

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.300
out what the schedule was.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.580
I mean, there's so
many incredibly sad,

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.440
unbelievable stories of people
trying to get from one state

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.420
to another within our --

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.400
the borders of our country
within the lifespan of people

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.320
who may be alive today
that this happened.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.840
And that for them to
make that great journey,

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.290
that great sacrifice
to show that kind

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.610
of courage and perseverance.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.220
Remember, there was no Twitter.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.670
I'm saying that it was like
Twitter, but there were no --

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.460
there was nobody that
they could ask for,

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.010
there was no relocation.com to
check and see exactly, you know,

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.430
where would they be able
to get a home beforehand.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.600
So this was a tremendous
leap of faith on their part.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.600
And the people that I had
the pleasure and honor

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.920
of speaking to, while life had
been difficult for them, they --

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.260
and experience many challenges
in the north, they also felt

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.810
that they had made
the right decision

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.590
because they themselves
made the decision.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.180
I think that we often forget
that a lot of this had to do

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.100
with agency, which is what we're
going to be getting to in terms

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.860
of reconstruction and the
aftermath of reconstruction.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.710
Is that this was the first time
in 246 years of enslavement,

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:14.590
12 generations of enslavement,
followed by 100 years or so

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.960
of a Jim Crow cast system
meant that for the --

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.710
during the Great Migration,
this was really the first time

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.020
in the country's history

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.320
that the lowest cast
people had the chance

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.390
to choose what they would do
with their God-given talents

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.650
and with their choices of
what they were going to do,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:31.950
where they would live.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.240
It was the first -- it was
the first chance that they had

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.640
to actually act upon
their agency.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.250
And I think that that in itself
means that whatever was to come

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.560
of this, as the defender once
said, whatever was to come

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.910
of this great leap of
faith, it was the leaving

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.380
that was so important.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.120
It was the leaving that made
this the epic that it was.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.720
It was taking the risk
and leaving the place

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.290
that had been designated to
them, both in geographically

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.790
and in terms of the
hierarchy of the south.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.180
People who could not vote were
now making the decision to leave

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.060
with their bodies and that was a
tremendous thing that they did.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.420
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: I want
to give Brooks the chance

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.410
to respond here in a
little different way

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.710
in that your book is a --

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:23.350
your latest book is a wonderful
collection of documents,

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.000
letters, essays,
editorials, news reports,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.990
speeches from different
people to really kind

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.000
of capture what the
foundation of the great debate

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.690
that followed the Civil War.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.800
And I -- well, you lead with
one of my favorite people,

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.030
Frederick Douglass,
who according

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.700
to the president is getting
more recognized every day.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.710
Delighted to see that.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.120
And the essay is ironic.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.900
I want to know why you chose
this one and also what it's

00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.080
about is -- and it's not
the first time I read it.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:07.090
But it is an essay to white
folks who are questioning what

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.750
to do, what we used to call the
negro question when I was a kid.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.050
Yeah. What is to be
done with the Negro?

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.030
And Frederick Douglass says,

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.570
"The best thing you can
do is leave us alone."

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.160
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson: Leave us
alone and give us a fair chance.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.460
That's all we ask for.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.560
We don't ask for
special privileges,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.260
we don't ask for
great advantages.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.850
We just want to be left alone.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.150
And what -- you know,

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.930
when African Americans migrated
north, they actually knew

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.580
that the north was not a
land of milk and honey.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.120
That, in fact, the attitudes

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.050
of many white northerners
had been very hostile

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.110
to African American aspirations

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.070
and the right to
vote, for example.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.540
And that in fact it was the
decline, a war weariness,

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.830
if you will, among many white
northerners in the 1870s,

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.540
that contributed to the
collapse of reconstruction.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.910
All Douglass wanted was, say,

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:02.180
let us see what we
can do on our own.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.640
You don't need to help us,
but don't get in our way.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.590
And, unfortunately, for African
Americans, there were lots

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.870
of people who wanted to get in
the way of defining the question

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.810
of what did freedom mean
after the American civil war?

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.900
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
And we've got some --

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.030
a marble of understatement
to say --

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.900
there was some obstructions.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.860
How much did terrorism play
a role in reconstruction?

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.810
And I'm talking about in the
lives and the great debate.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.620
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson:
I think terrorism,

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.220
white supremacist terrorism

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.890
in the American south is
fundamental to the collapse

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.860
of reconstruction and
that it was overthrown.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.850
It didn't so much fail as it
was resisted from the beginning.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.590
And when people talk about what
happened in the United States

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.600
on September 11th, 2001,

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.470
and I began to hear terrorism
comes from the outside.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.300
Anyone who looks at
reconstruction sees

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.420
that terrorism, in this sense,
against African Americans,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.920
was as American as apple pie.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.020
Something that's starting long
before Republicans had outlined

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.480
a point of reconstruction.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.570
There's already terrorist
activity

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:12.670
against African Americans
immediately after the Civil War.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:18.360
And continuing on, city
of Memphis in 1866,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.180
African American veterans
just discharged are attacked

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.060
by city officials.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.070
In 1873, in Colfax, Louisiana,

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.850
upwards about 100 African
Americans slaughtered

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.780
in cold blood.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.750
These are things that today's
Americans sometimes don't want

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:39.850
to look at because
reconstruction had both a face

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.750
of hope and opportunity
and a face of --

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:47.190
a very ugly face of resistance
to that hope and opportunity.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:48.600
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
I've been amazed

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.990
over the years whenever
I've written

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:55.160
about the period I call
the lynching period really,

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.470
reconstruction period leading up
to the Great Migration and all.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.140
How many letters I've gotten
-- well, these days, emails --

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.760
from white readers mostly
who are not angry or upset.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.720
They are amazed and surprised
that they didn't know about this

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.400
or that they hear about lynching

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.280
but they didn't realize
how extensive it was.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.580
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson: No.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.880
I think that's one
thing that we tend

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.410
to have underplayed the degree
to which racial violence,

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.110
anti-black violence was
prevalent in the United States

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.010
in the mid-19th century,
including reconstruction.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.660
That we also overlook the
fact that the 17th president

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.180
of the United States,
usually ranked as one

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.480
of the worst presidents,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.510
although these things
may change over time --

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.510
[ Laughter ]

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.650
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: It's kind of
an ongoing contest in the --

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.950
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson: Yes.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.030
It is. But that --
that he was, in fact,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.260
hostile towards African
American aspirations,

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.600
including Frederick Douglass.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.900
Two men had an encounter

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.860
in which Johnson treated
Douglass rather badly.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:08.230
And we have to remember
that between 1865 and 1869,

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.610
a staunch opponent of black
equality happened to be

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.400
in the White House and it
wouldn't be until 1869 that,

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.810
in fact, there would
be a president

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.550
who at least had
some glimmer of hope

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.820
for African American
aspirations.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.120
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
And that was Grant.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.420
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson:
That was Grant.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.340
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: And how
would you contrast for us folks

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.780
who aren't that old, how would
you contrast Johnson and Grant?

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.690
As far -- not just
their approaches,

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.780
but also how were they perceived

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.380
by African Americans
in particular?

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.000
I mean, you have an
interesting piece

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.550
that Douglass wrote about Grant.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.360
But, anyway, I'll
let you answer.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.660
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson:
But the two men --

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.670
it's interesting because the two
men did share certain things.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.970
Ulysses S. Grant, in fact,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.900
is the last slaveholder elected
president of the United States.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.350
That Grant actually
owned a slave

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.050
in the 1850s [inaudible]
slaveholding family

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:56.430
of William Jones.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.730
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: Okay.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.030
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson:
And but married

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.330
into a slaveholding
family when he lived

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.940
in St. Louis with his in-laws.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.220
And so therefore he had --

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.570
he's the last slaveholder to be
president of the United States.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:09.300
So you can always win a Jeopardy
contest by pointing that out.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.580
But the fact of the
matter is that Grant grew

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.190
when it came to issues of race.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.740
He said, well, African
Americans fight

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.880
for their freedom during
the American Civil War.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.330
Became an advocate of
African Americans in uniform.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.540
Then he began to become an
advocate of black voting.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.030
After he began to see that
African Americans needed

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.670
to be armed with a vote in
order to protect themselves.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.650
So, in fact, in 1868, that's
the first presidential election

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.150
in which a large number of
African Americans participate

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:42.820
and their popular vote gave
Grant a popular majority.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.120
Grant would have still won

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.180
in the electoral college
had only white people voted,

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.860
but it's the 10s and hundreds of
thousands of African Americans

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.230
who vote for Grant that give
him that popular majority.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:57.880
And Grant, as president,
then fights for black rights,

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.550
supervises the ratification
of the 15th amendment,

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.960
sees that as the capstone
of the repudiation

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.000
of the Dred Scott decision.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.180
But by the mid-1870s, begins
to understand that many whites

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.860
in the United States,
north as well as south,

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.960
no longer have the heart to
fight for black freedom the way

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.570
that African Americans did.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.040
And he talks about this.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.660
That in this -- there's
a document in this book.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.780
On January 13th, 1875,
Grant talks about how we

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.310
in this boasted land
of Christianity

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:35.750
and civilization can allow this
to happen while the miscreants

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.000
of the Colfax Massacre,
the people who committed

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.400
that massacre, go
unwhipped of justice.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.510
And if an American president
ever put it squarely in front

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:49.990
of the American people
about the importance of race

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.250
and the failure to live
up to the nation's ideals,

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.260
it would be that message to
the United States Senate.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.560
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
I was intrigued

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.890
by the parallels I began to
pick up with the politics

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.800
of those days and the
politics of today.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.390
And the issues we mentioned.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.500
Violence. Racial violence.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.880
Also, voter suppression,
registration.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.180
Who is a citizen?

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.480
Who isn't?

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.910
Who's got rights
and who doesn't?

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.890
To -- time is short,
so let me just put

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.680
to you my number one question

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.420
that I've been burning
to ask you.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.230
Who won the Civil War?

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.440
[ Laughter ]

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.740
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson:
Let's put it this way.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:35.320
Reconstruction defines for
Americans, white and black,

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.840
what the Civil War accomplished
for that generation.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.440
That while people will talk

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.970
about how the reconstruction
amendments, 13th, 14th,

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:46.760
15th amendment, Civil Rights
Act of 1866, Civil Rights Act

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.170
of 1875, would set
up the foundation

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.470
of the second Civil
Rights Movement,

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.730
the 1940s, '50s and '60s.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:57.200
The fact is that
between 1865 and 1877,

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.660
I would argue what
happens is that in order

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.110
to welcome back white
southerners,

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:07.680
the former Confederates into
the union, white northerners

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.640
and white southerners alike
agreed that that would come

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.000
at the expense of black freedom,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.240
despite black assertions
to the contrary.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.280
Blacks would not
take this passively.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.880
They fought against this
as much as possible.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:25.510
But by the 1870s, reunion
trumps racial justice.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:31.420
And that's something that many,
many Americans were complicit

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.590
in that result among American
whites, both north and south.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.010
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
It's -- yes, Isabel?

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.990
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: I
believe that the experience

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.780
with Charlottesville
and all that's happened

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.050
in recent years have
been an indication

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:50.240
that clearly the
north won the war.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.060
But the south won the peace.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.590
And --

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.890
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
[Inaudible] that.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.900
North won the war, the
south won the peace.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.420
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: And
I think that the people

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.890
of the Great Migration
essentially were African

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.940
Americans in the south who
decided to leave knew that.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.620
They could see that
things were not going

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.920
to change in their lifetime.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.260
Things were not going
to change anytime soon.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:16.790
In fact, during that time in the
years after reconstruction ended

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.100
and there was a reclaiming
of it,

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.910
which you would be
more expert than I.

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:23.860
But in those -- the time

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.930
where there was no longer
a financial investment

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.610
in black bodies, that's
when lynchings began to rise

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:33.890
to such a level at a
certain period of time.

00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:36.040
The first three decades
of the 20th century,

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.910
there was a lynching
every four days somewhere

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:40.210
on the American south.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.510
And a lot of people, I think,

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.300
don't realize what a
lynching actually is.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.380
It's not just someone's
been killed.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:51.860
It's -- it is a ritualistic
public execution that's there

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.310
to -- that's performative
in order to send a message

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.990
to everyone in that
cast system as to

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.120
who could do what in that world.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.510
And I think the people
in the Great Migration,

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:07.260
African Americans in the
south at that time recognized

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.630
that things were not going to
change and this is where they --

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.740
that's where they made
their great leap of faith

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.300
into what they hope
would be better.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.160
I believe that they knew that
they were not looking to become,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.770
you know, builders
of skyscrapers

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.670
and captains of industry
per say.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.480
They were looking to be
able to live out their lives

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.410
without the repressive violence
and terror and to be able

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.620
to be whoever they were in
their mind and in their heart.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.920
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: Right.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.330
Well, one question that comes
up is, when we're talking about,

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.100
well, Civil War in 1865, the
Great Migration, as you --

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.350
by your account, begin
around World War I.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.130
There's -- people have
different ideas as to

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.550
when it actually began.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:53.830
But I'm curious to ask you the
question of, why did it take us,

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.240
our families, the migrants,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.660
so long to begin the Great
Migration if you will.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.530
And you also mentioned
in the book,

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.240
you make a passing mention
too, for the first generation

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.830
to be -- not to be born in
slavery, which reminds me

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.600
of South Africa where
I've also worked very --

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.170
they refer to the
Born Free Generation,

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:17.080
the born frees being those born
after [inaudible] so but I'd

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.380
like to ask you, why
do you think it took

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.680
so long for the migration?

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.980
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: Yeah.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.420
So these were the children
and grandchildren of people

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.290
who had -- who were enslaved
at the time of the Civil War,

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:30.130
and so they were also --
there was a greater disconnect

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:32.870
between them and the world
of enslavement and all

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:37.290
of the protocols
and expectations

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:38.970
of deference and all of that.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.810
It was a totally new generation.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.270
Also, of course, the
biggest issue was World War I

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.620
and the fact that the
north had been relying

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.490
on labor from Europe.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.650
And with World War I on,

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.400
that meant that that labor was
no longer available to the north

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.910
and the north needed workers.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.220
And so the Great
Migration began actually --

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.450
this is something that when you
see how African Americans are

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.240
often viewed, seen, and have
been treated in the times

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.570
that they've been in the north,

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:08.190
it doesn't make sense
when you hear this.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.390
But the first arrivals
were actually invited here.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.090
It was a northern industry
that went north and began

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:17.620
to recruit African
Americans as workers in --

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.630
to come and work in the
factories and the steel mills

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.900
and the railroads and
all of that in the north.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.780
And so that meant that the first
arrivals were actually invited

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.340
here in spite of the
resistance, hostility

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.420
and actually the
mechanisms that were used

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.660
to restrict them upon arrival.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.210
But that meant that they were --

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.800
they came because
they came to work.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.870
They came -- they
had an opportunity.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.240
They could see that there was
a way that they could take care

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.070
of their families, and that's
what began this great wave

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.370
of people.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:51.670
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson: And at
the same time, what you got

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.640
at that moment is the rise
in American historiography,

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.940
the so-called Dunning School
which condemned reconstructions

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.660
of failure of the election
of the first southerner

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.440
since the Civil War to the
presidency, Woodrow Wilson,

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:10.140
and the 50th anniversary of the
end of the American Civil War.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:15.320
Wilson speaking Gettysburg
at 1913 and the like,

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.280
that this became we then
[inaudible] this point

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.970
to call this the Brothers War,

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.270
the [inaudible] between
brothers.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:26.420
And African Americans were
getting taken out of the picture

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.480
of what happened during
the American Civil War.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.480
Later on, people would
be very surprised to hear

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.960
that nearly 200,000 African
Americans served in the armies

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.370
of the United States
during the war.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.920
And, in fact, when we
talk about the union

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.610
versus the confederacy,
we were freaked out.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.120
The confederacy fights war

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.310
against the United
States of America.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.140
The man responsible
for the death

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.460
of more United States
military personnel

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.360
than any other is Robert E. Lee.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.910
And we ought to remember
that's one of the reasons

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.510
that Arlington is established.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.230
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
You're a brave man to say

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.530
that so close to Virginia here.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.890
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson: I
just walk across the bridge.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.780
I'm a UVA boy so I [inaudible]
before from Charlottesville.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.080
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
You're okay then.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.380
When I came here from
the land of Lincoln,

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.260
I had to cover Doug
Wilder's campaign.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:21.980
In fact, I was greeted by a
couple of Virginians who said,

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.510
you know how many people it
takes to change a flat tire?

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.280
How many UVA students it
takes to change the flat tire?

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.220
And the answer was one
to get the new tire,

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.290
one to get the beer,
and three to reminisce

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.790
about how beautiful
the old tire was.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.350
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson:
Absolutely.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.760
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: So since
[inaudible] but I was --

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.700
oh, by the way, is that
two minutes to questions

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.040
or two minutes to the end?

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.430
&gt;&gt; Two minutes to the end.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.730
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: To the end.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.030
Oh my Lord.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:52.550
It's -- this is slipping
ahead too ahead.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:53.850
I was -- well, let me ask --

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:58.040
I just forgot the next
question I was going to ask.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.310
It was a real doozy too.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.610
[Inaudible] now.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:05.850
Let me just jump to Martin
Luther King's question

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.890
which he raised in the
last year of his life.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.230
Where do we go from here?

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.610
And I'll let -- since you
spoke last here, Brooks,

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.250
let me ask you Isabel, we
talk about the parallels

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:20.770
with the politics today
of what was going on back

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.610
in reconstruction time
and debate being similar.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.780
What do you see in our
knowledge of reconstruction

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.240
and Great Migration
that could help

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.130
to inform our decisions
about the future?

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.430
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson:
What a question.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:35.730
And we've got, what?

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.030
30 seconds.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.330
I've just used up 10 of them.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.830
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page: You never
worked in television, did you?

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.250
&gt;&gt; Isabel Wilkerson: In
the short time that I have

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.630
to say anything, I would
just say that the --

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.000
when people do read the book
that I've written, and it's been

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.070
out a while now, the thing
that I hear over and over

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:54.130
and over again from all
backgrounds is I had no idea.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.030
And I think it's time for
people to get an idea.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:59.510
I think it's time for
people to get an idea.

Yeah. Reacquaint
ourselves with our country.

If we didn't know it before,
we need to know it now.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.720
&gt;&gt; Brooks D. Simpson: Well,
I've always thought watching,

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.460
the very interesting thing is
to go to the Jefferson Memorial.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.770
We were told that all men are
created equal, and then you walk

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:27.390
out in front of the memorial,
and you look at Dr. King

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.020
or [inaudible] saying,
"Show me."

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.320
&gt;&gt; Clarence Page:
Well put [inaudible].

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.060
Boy, it's hard to -- yes, the
little sign says wrap it up,

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:42.800
and it's hard to -- my wife
wants to borrow that from you.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.100
But [inaudible] right
down the road here.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.550
But let me say, this
is indeed --

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.700
you've [inaudible] our appetites
today I hope because there is

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.120
so much that we don't know.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.900
You -- one of my
questions to you was going

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.280
to be what do we get wrong,

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.600
but you mentioned how most
people get the Civil War history

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.830
and reconstruction
history wrong.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.020
And we really need
to know a lot.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.230
And I think if we wonder why,

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.700
just look at the great
decisions being made right here

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.190
in Washington these
days about our future.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.680
Look to the leaders
who know something

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.510
about history and
those who don't.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.160
I'm not going to name any names

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.530
but I'm sure Frederick Douglass
would be happy to advise them.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:23.790
With that in mind, I want to
thank the Library of Congress,

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:26.560
the National Humanities,
the National Endowment

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:32.240

available for autographs
