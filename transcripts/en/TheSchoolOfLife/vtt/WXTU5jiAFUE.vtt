00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:05.135
Hey!

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:09.215
How's it going?

00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:12.235
Hey! What's up?

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:15.675
I've had the worst day...

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:19.185
I'm just so SICK of everything going wrong

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.315
all the time!

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:23.305
And now it looks like I'm going to lose my job.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
[Music]

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.895
Well...just talk to Janet. Talk to Janet...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.300
see if you can move into her department.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.985
[Music]

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:49.575
Just talk to Janet?! What's Janet got to do with it?!

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:53.495
Why would I wanna work in her department? I don't even like Janet!

00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:55.325
[Solitary note of music]

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.025
This is good! This is really good

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.945
because we've been talking about this for ages. You don't, you don't want to be there!

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:04.015
And the only reason you would be is because of the guilt...

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:06.985
and now they've taken the guilt away...you're free!

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:09.425
This is... If you think about it, this is the best thing that could have happened.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:13.035
How on earth is staring down the barrel of unemployment

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:15.865
SUDDENLY the best thing that could have happened?!

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:17.055
[music]

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:21.285
It's not good! It's not a good situation

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:22.800
but that's how life is and that sucks.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.235
Great! Just...just accept this. This...this is what's happening.

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.135
That is NOT what I need you to say!

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.135
[music]

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.995
What we can do is make you feel better

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:35.925
run you a nice bath,

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:37.715
order in some pizza,

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:40.545
sit and watch a film or something...

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:43.545
Right! Is that literally your solution to every single problem in the world?!

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:44.045
Have a bath and a pizza?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.500
I DON'T WANNA HAVE A BATH AND A PIZZA!

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.400
Just shove the pizza in your mouth and STOP speaking for a second!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.000
[Sighs]

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.000
[Music]

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:08.495
I'm gonna stop trying to solve everything and...just

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.595
listen to you.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:14.125
So...

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:17.815
I got up really early for the meeting, and they cancelled both trains...

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:20.700
Oh! My train was delayed as well, it was a bit of a...

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.840
Yeah! ...I had to get on a bus, it was raining. I didn't have my umbrella,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.180
so I turned up 45 minutes late looking like a drowned rat

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.580
to find Malcolm

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:32.100
doing my presentation to the entire team. Didn't give me any credit for it...

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.500
Come here...

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.000
[sighs heavily]

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.000
Thank you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.280
