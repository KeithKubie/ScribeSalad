00:00:00.065 --> 00:00:02.373
- [Instructor] What I'd
like to do in this video

00:00:02.373 --> 00:00:05.563
is talk about the major
schools of Buddhism

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:07.542
as it is practiced today.

00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:09.026
And it can be broadly divided

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:11.630
into Theravada Buddhism,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.797
which means school of the elder monks,

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.793
and Mahayana Buddhism,
which means great vehicle.

00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:20.043
Maha for great.

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.223
So first on the commonalities.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:27.591
Now both of these schools
of Buddhist thought

00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:28.649
or Buddhist tradition

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.180
believe in this notion of the
cycle of birth and rebirth

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.367
from one life or one reality to the next,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.403
that we call samsara which is also shared

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:41.015
with the core of Hindu philosophy.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:45.310
And this idea that your
goal should be to realize

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.977
that all is thought,

00:00:47.876 --> 00:00:52.043
to escape from the dukkha and
eventually obtain nirvana.

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:57.532
Now the difference between
the two schools of thought,

00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:00.865
in Theravada buddhism, it is much closer

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:04.672
to some of the original
practices or teachings

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:08.084
that we see with
Siddhartha Gautama Buddha.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:09.954
It is a very personal journey

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:13.194
that is all about the
individual though meditation,

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:16.710
perhaps with some help from some teacher

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.533
recognizing the non-self,

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.249
recognizing that we are all one,

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.445
and eventually,

00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:25.787
either in this life or in future lives,

00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:27.287
achieving nirvana.

00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:31.698
Now Mahayana Buddhism actually encompasses

00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:34.781
a very large set of various practices

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:39.524
but the general idea is
that you might have help

00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:42.497
as you try to achieve nirvana.

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:47.420
Someone who achieves nirvana
is known as an arhat,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.749
so you could Therevada Buddhism as,

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:54.339
hey try to go on this personal
journey to become an arhat,

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:56.499
to achieve nirvana.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.249
But in Mahayana Buddhism,

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.125
the pursuit is not
necessarily to get to nirvana

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.325
as quickly as possible.

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:05.960
It's to get close to nirvana
but then to help others

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.460
try to achieve that same state

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:13.901
So the real goal is to be
a bodhisattva, bodhisattva.

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:19.718
Now the word bodhisattva
is used in both traditions.

00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:22.099
In Theravada Buddhism,
it refers to someone

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.756
who is trying to become an arhat.

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:26.947
Someone who is on the
path to achieving nirvana.

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:29.107
In Mahayana Buddhism,

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.863
it is someone who has
almost achieved nirvana

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:34.974
but holds that off in order to help

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:36.774
the rest of the sentient reality.

00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:40.532
The rest of sentient beings
eventually achieve nirvana

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:42.161
and if you aren't one of the bodhisattvas,

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.931
you have that help not
only from bodhisattvas

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.848
but there's a fairly large grouping

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.817
of celestial beings

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:53.162
that are there to help.

00:02:53.162 --> 00:02:54.664
That are there to help
focus your meditation

00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:55.997
and your energy.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:00.400
And what you see here is a
depiction that's not atypical

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.521
from a Mahayana Buddhist shrine.

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:06.019
In the middle here, you
have Amitabha Buddha

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.186
and a significant chunk of
Mahayana Buddhists believe

00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:15.635
in Amitabha Buddha and you could view him

00:03:16.777 --> 00:03:21.205
as someone who's revered or
is almost a deity-like figure.

00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:24.787
And this idea that by visualizing,
by focusing, by invoking

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:28.954
Amitabha Buddha, that you can
get to his pure land of bliss

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:31.842
known as Sukhavati.

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:38.214
And so it's this idea of
almost a kind of salvation.

00:03:38.214 --> 00:03:40.387
That by focusing on Amitabha,

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.596
you get to this pure land of bliss

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:45.326
which is a place where it
is easier to achieve nirvana

00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:49.028
from and you can almost view
it as something of a heaven.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:52.594
Now what's interesting is
Amitabha Buddha isn't exactly

00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:56.495
the same figure as
Siddhartha Gautama Buddha.

00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:58.051
in some traditions,

00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:01.406
Siddhartha Gautama Buddha
is a projection of Amitabha

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:02.939
into our reality.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.214
And in some Mahayana belief systems

00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:07.699
there are multiple realities,
each with their own Buddha

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.485
and you can be born and reborn

00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:11.286
into these different
realities and the pure land,

00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:13.203
the pure land of bliss,

00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:16.949
the Sukhavati is where
you might want to go

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.542
if you are following,

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:22.838
if you are practicing this
belief in Amitabha Buddha.

00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:24.254
So at a very high level,

00:04:24.254 --> 00:04:27.013
Theravada buddhism is all
about this personal journey.

00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:31.180
Trying to follow the practice
of Siddhartha Gautama Buddha

00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:35.377
through meditation, through recognizing

00:04:35.377 --> 00:04:38.100
the four noble truths, by
following the middle way,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.724
getting eventually in this life

00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:42.644
and in future lives to nirvana,

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:44.381
becoming an arhat.

00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:48.658
Mahayana buddhism has
a more complex pantheon

00:04:48.658 --> 00:04:51.453
of celestial beings and deities

00:04:51.453 --> 00:04:54.381
and can be diverse form one
part of the world to another.

00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:56.425
Eventually the goal is
for all sentient beings

00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:57.792
to achieve nirvana.

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:00.206
But your individual goal
can be better described

00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:02.996
as delaying nirvana, become a bodhisattva,

00:05:02.996 --> 00:05:05.167
and assisting all other sentient beings

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:07.325
in achieving that nirvana.

00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:09.231
These are actually the
attendant bodhisattvas

00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:12.412
on the left and the
right of Amitabha Buddha.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.664
But you don't have just the
help of the bodhisattvas,

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:16.603
there's also celestial beings,

00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:18.447
things that you can focus on,

00:05:18.447 --> 00:05:19.770
things that you can invoke

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.206
to eventually help you
get you to that nirvana.

00:05:24.206 --> 00:05:26.088
Now in order to see where it is practiced,

00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:28.643
we have this map right over here.

00:05:28.643 --> 00:05:31.357
First of all, most of
buddhism is practiced

00:05:31.357 --> 00:05:33.437
in the far east of asia or southeast asia.

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:37.104
And you see the various
schools of buddhism.

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:41.077
So in red here, you have the Therevada,

00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:43.120
the school of the elder monks.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.028
In yellow here, you have
Mahayana, the great vehicle.

00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:49.854
And in orange, you have Vajrayana.

00:05:49.854 --> 00:05:51.642
A significant chunk of Vajrayana Buddhists

00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:53.987
are often referred to as Tibetan Buddhists

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:56.551
and they're sometimes
grouped with the Mahayana,

00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:58.083
it's closer to Mahayana.

00:05:58.083 --> 00:05:59.672
There's this notion of boddhisatvas.

00:05:59.672 --> 00:06:01.287
There are celestial beings.

00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:03.223
There are more rituals.

00:06:03.223 --> 00:06:05.237
Now in terms of population,

00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:08.825
the country with the largest
Buddhist population is China,

00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:12.714
roughly 250 million Buddhists
of the 500 million Buddhists

00:06:12.714 --> 00:06:14.328
that there are in the world.

00:06:14.328 --> 00:06:16.406
But despite the fact that
there are so many Buddhists

00:06:16.406 --> 00:06:18.679
in China, it is still only 18%

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:20.793
of the entire Chinese population.

00:06:20.793 --> 00:06:24.312
In places like Burma and Thailand,

00:06:24.312 --> 00:06:26.889
you have a much higher
percentage of the population

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.585
that is actually Buddhist

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:30.291
and these regions of southeast asia,

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.040
most of the population is Buddhist.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.904
Now one other really
interesting thing about this map

00:06:36.904 --> 00:06:41.071
is we talk about buddhism
starting in northeast India,

00:06:42.476 --> 00:06:43.711
in southern Nepal.

00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:46.856
That's where Siddhartha
Gautama Buddha lived.

00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:48.658
That's where he spread his teachings.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.189
And not only is that where it originated,

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.754
you have Ashoka who really
catalyzed the spread of buddhism

00:06:54.754 --> 00:06:57.013
and once again that was out of India.

00:06:57.013 --> 00:07:00.116
But when you look at this demographic map

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:02.173
of where you have significant
Buddhist groupings,

00:07:02.173 --> 00:07:03.716
you don't see a lot in India.

00:07:03.716 --> 00:07:05.198
You see a lot in Sri Lanka.

00:07:05.198 --> 00:07:06.887
And that's actually where
the Theravada tradition

00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:08.348
comes primarily from.

00:07:08.348 --> 00:07:10.102
And there's a couple of
interesting explanations

00:07:10.102 --> 00:07:11.912
as to why you don't see it in India.

00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:14.062
One possible explanation is

00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:17.297
that it was so close to many
versions on Hindu practices

00:07:17.297 --> 00:07:19.669
and we talk about Hinduism
being this very diverse

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:20.679
and open religion.

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:24.183
And it really just got
reabsorbed, reassimilated

00:07:24.183 --> 00:07:26.612
as part of the diverse Hindu tradition.

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:29.027
In fact, many Hindus view Buddha

00:07:29.027 --> 00:07:31.777
as another incarnation of Vishnu.
