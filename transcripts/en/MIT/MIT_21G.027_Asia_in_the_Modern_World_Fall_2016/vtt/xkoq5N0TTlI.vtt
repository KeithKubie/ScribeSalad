SHIGERU MIYAGAWA: I was
asked to serve on a faculty

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.230
committee back in year 2000
by then president Chuck Vest.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.230
And the charge to
our committee was

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.830
to come up with a new strategy
for e-learning for MIT.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.940
Everyone else was doing
e-learning, MIT wasn't.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.950
And so the president
felt that we

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.140
should come up with a new
and bold idea for MIT.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.560
Of course, year 2000 was still
the era of the .com days,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.930
and so the assumption going
in was that we would create

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.630
an MIT.com and enter into
some kind of venture.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.200
Maybe take up the materials that
faculty created and sell them.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.350
That was one idea.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.970
But as we got into
the discussion,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.269
there were maybe
seven or eight us,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.690
it got smaller as
the months went by.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.906
It became apparent us
that the idea of MIT.com

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:15.040
was not the right idea.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.380
There are a number
of reasons for it.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.310
We interviewed about
60 organizations

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.240
that were doing e-learning,
and from those interviews

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.270
the one thing that we learned
was that this is really

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.130
a tough area to do business in.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.950
That was one
question that we had.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.320
We did try to build
business models.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.180
We had Booz Allen Hamilton
people helping us.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.060
And we worked very
hard at creating

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.320
a number of business models.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.170
We did lots of surveys
to get credible data.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.450
And the business
models that we were

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.030
able to create, the
most credible one had

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.660
us starting year one, and about
year five we'd break even.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.270
Which is not unusual
for a venture,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.320
but the problem with
that business model

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.690
was that after year five,
it was sort of flattened.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.720
There's not this sort of
hockey stick uptick in revenue.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.200
And we thought if we're
going to do something,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.960
we wanted to see at least
the potential of having

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.510
a major source of revenue
that could help MIT.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.850
It didn't seem to be there.

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:39.500
The most important
reason though,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.600
was that we interviewed about 60
faculty members who had already

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.380
put up their materials
on the web on their own.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.490
And we wanted to see what
their motivation was.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.470
If we're going to
do MIT.com we need

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.370
to understand the
faculty's motivation.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.670
And so we interviewed
every one of them.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.820
And without exception,
they told us one,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.560
they were doing this to try
to improve their classroom

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.290
teaching.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.130
Two, they were not
getting compensated.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.410
And three, that they
were sacrificing

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.140
their own time,
research time, time

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.400
with their family to do this.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.970
So this is where you find MIT
faculty's real commitment,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.230
real commitment to teaching.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.840
And that's what we found.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.525
And when we discussed
this in the committee,

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:36.710
it was October of
the year 2000, this

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.750
was the last meeting
before we had

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.140
to start writing a
report to President Vest.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.330
We said, you know,
it doesn't seem

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.810
right we would take teaching
materials from these faculty

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.110
members who are committed
to teaching, and taking that

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.250
and turning it into business.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.700
And so that was pretty much
the final thing we needed here

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.840
to say no MIT.com.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.810
But we had to report
to the president

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.630
and give him some bold idea for
MIT in the e-learning space.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.050
And particularly based on what
the 60 faculty members told us

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.300
about the MIT faculty's very
deep, very deep commitment

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.500
to teaching.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.380
We said, why don't we
create a system that's

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.800
exactly the opposite?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.850
Exactly the opposite of
what we started with,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.910
and what the rest of
the world was doing,

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.180
and say we're going
to just give it away.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.590
Just give it away so that
anyone, anywhere in the world

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.250
can take advantage of
MIT faculty's commitment

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.360
to education.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.870
That's how we started
with OpenCourseWare.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.360
If you look at
OpenCourseWare and see

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.720
why it's been so
successful, and why it has

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.970
resonated with the faculty.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.560
I remember just a few days after
MIT announced OpenCourseWare

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.950
it was front page article
in New York Times,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.840
a young faculty
member came up to me

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.690
and said that the
day MIT announced

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.000
OpenCourseWare was the proudest
day of his career at MIT.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.030
Why did he say that?

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.600
Why did it resonate so
much with the faculty?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.810
The reason, I believe, is
because OpenCourseWare is not

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.810
just OpenCourseWare
separate from MIT.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.330
OpenCourseWare is
very much a mission

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.730
that MIT has as an institution.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.140
If you look at the MIT mission,
not the OCW mission, MIT

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.480
mission on the web,
it says that MIT

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.110
is committed to
generating, disseminating,

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.150
and preserving knowledge.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.580
And to bring this
knowledge to bear

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.140
on all of the great
challenges of the world.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.840
MIT has traditionally fulfilled
that requirement, that mission,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.520
with basic research.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.210
But now with OpenCourseWare, we
can also fulfill that mission

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.350
with our teaching, by
disseminating and preserving

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.650
our teaching materials.
