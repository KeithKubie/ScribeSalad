[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.650
JOHNNY LEE: Hello, everyone.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.150
Let's see.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.770
Where's my slides?

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.059
Welcome to the afternoon,
the second day of I/O.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.530
I hope everyone is
enjoying their time here.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.930
My name is Johnny
Lee, and I'm here

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.600
to give you a little bit
more information about where

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.170
we are with Tango.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.424
If you saw the keynote, which
probably most of you did,

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:29.590
you got to see a little bit.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.940
But in this session, we
get to see a lot more

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.940
and go into a lot more depth
than we could otherwise.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.680
So I wanted to start
with this quote

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.290
from Beau Lotto,
who's a neuroscientist

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.150
from the University
College London.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.600
And he said that, "The best
technologies are ones that

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.060
make the invisible visible."

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.870
And an example of
that is a microscope.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.430
It's a tool that
allowed us to see

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.290
more things about our
environment-- things

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.360
that may have always
been there, but they

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.490
let us see things in
a new way and give us

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.220
a better understanding
about how the world works,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.240
and also changes the way about
how we view ourselves as well.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:18.220
And most of our
devices today view

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.860
the world as a flat screen.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.890
But we're physical beings
in a physical world,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.810
and we wanted to add
to the capabilities

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.040
to understand 3D with Tango,
adding ability to sense motion

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.030
as well as a depth of
objects and services.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.270
So if I place this bottle here--

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.210
oh, this doesn't
have a flat surface.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.750
Well, if I place
the bottle here,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.660
its mere physical presence here
is meaningful to all of us.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.810
I can refer to it and talk
about it in a way that all of us

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.540
understand simply because
of its physical presence.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.270
And it's because of the
way our minds have evolved.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.180
And if our tools understood the
fact that this bottle was here

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.540
before, we would have a shared
understanding with, not just

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.009
the people in this room,
but also with our tools.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.280
As a quick refresher, Tango
has three new capabilities

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.480
for mobile devices.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.894
We add motion tracking, depth
perception, and area learning.

00:02:16.894 --> 00:02:18.310
And you'll learn
a little bit more

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.837
about the large scale
area learning from Justin

00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:22.670
that we call the visual
positioning service.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.789
First let's take a quick
recap of the hardware.

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.330
So as you may know, the first
device that came out with Tango

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.435
enabled device capabilities
was a Lenovo Phab 2 Pro.

00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:37.430
This came back last
fall, and it had

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.790
all the hardware we needed
to do these capabilities.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.630
And our second generation
phone is the Asus Zenfone AR,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.130
which is a 5.7-inch phone that's
both Tango enabled and Daydream

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.940
ready, with a Quad HD
Amoled display and a sleek,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.990
thin design.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.320
It's a really,
really nice phone.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.890
We're also pleased to mention
that, in light of the summer

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.810
and Verizon stores
across the store,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.060
customers will be to
play with a Zenfone AR

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.340
across the United
States, with 11

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.010
international other countries
coming in the summer as well.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.320
In addition to the phones,
as you saw in the keynote,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.490
we now support standalone
headsets for VR,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.520
and we've been working on a
specialized version of Tango

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.640
that does tracking in 3D.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.820
So we used two fish eye cameras
and all of this LAN technology

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.950
built into Tango
to allow six degree

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.750
freedom positional
movement in a VR headset.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.600
Now, we all know that
hardware is merely

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.240
the vehicle that carries
new experience to users,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.060
and it's the software that
brings those experiences

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.960
and value to our users.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.260
So let me show you a really
short video just showing

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.870
some of the great work that's
running on the platform today.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.640
So that's just a
really short glimpse

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.820
into some of the 100 apps
that have now been available

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.340
on the Play Store since
these phones came out

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.830
just a few months ago.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.050
I'd like to highlight
just a few of these

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.730
in three different categories--
games, shopping, and tools.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.940
In games, Electronic
Arts recently

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.130
released an update for
their Sims FreePlay, which

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.554
allowed you to use Tango to
walk through the environment

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:20.095
of the houses that
your Sims live in,

00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:23.840
in a first-person perspective.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.137
Lego BrickHeadz Builder AR
is a character building game

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:29.720
where you can see
your characters come

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.140
to life in front of you.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.200
You can build your
own custom models

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.820
or work with some
of the free models

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.070
that they provide in the game.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.040
Hologrid Monster Battle,
from Tippett Studios,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.300
creates a turn-based chess
game right on your living room

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.610
table, where you can use
combinations of monsters

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.324
to try to defeat your opponents.

00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:51.990
Now, one area we've
seen a lot of value,

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.030
in particular for 3D
visualization, is shopping.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.670
Pottery Barn released an
app called 3D Room View that

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.930
uses Tango sensors to place
products from the catalog

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.610
right in your room so you can
see how it will fit and look

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.770
with your existing
furniture, and you can also

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.020
clear out the furniture and
start from an empty room

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.930
from scratch.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.120
BMW iExplore lets you verify if
you're interested in a BMW i3,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.370
if it's going to be a
good fit in your garage.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.320
You can also check out
the much higher end i8,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.630
if you're curious about that.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.880
You can check out all the
interiors, configure it.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.970
You can look at the
dashboard and chair details

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:30.886
just by moving around.

00:06:34.072 --> 00:06:35.780
One of the areas that's
particularly hard

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.140
is shopping for clothing
online and having a good fit.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.020
So, Gap has been working with
a company called Avametric,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.630
which does physically
accurate simulation of 3D

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.980
models and clothes.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.950
So you simply pick the mannequin
that best fits your body type

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.750
and you can see
exactly how different

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.000
sized clothes will fit and
stretch when you wear them.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.280
In addition to
these partners, we

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.280
have several other partners
interested in making

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.790
applications they can help
you make better decisions when

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.620
you're shopping
online with your phone

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.550
or helping you
shop in the store.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.920
Now, tools is also a really
interesting category,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.670
and it helps create
a new class that

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.420
gives you the ability
to make measurements

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.740
about your environment.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.620
And it's great for people who
are trying to get work done.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.601
Just to give you a
few examples of these,

00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:22.100
we also have a clip
of what partners

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.058
are doing in this area.

00:07:26.726 --> 00:07:27.790
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.370
- Our goal was to
develop an app that

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.350
lets you create a floor without
actively drawing on Magic.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.410
And Magic Plan is the first
app that lets you do that.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.910
Before Tango, we were using
the RGB camera and a broader,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.470
noisy IMU to capture a room.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.510
But we had to prevent the user
from moving during the capture

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.490
process.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.010
The odometry, depth
sensing, and RGB camera

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.220
allow us to semantically
classify and locate

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.320
everything you see
through your device,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.165
and all of that in
a matter of minutes.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.260
- Trimble has combined
Google's Tango technology

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.560
with a lightweight, centimeter
accurate GNSS receiver

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.250
to create a high accuracy
outdoor mixed reality system.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.490
Using paper plans on site
to providing a real world

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.801
understanding of future space,
relative to today's space.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.510
- Just [INAUDIBLE] stage series
investigation and installation

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.240
stage in the pavement
construction.

00:08:23.555 --> 00:08:24.930
- Recently, we
were in the middle

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.750
of mechanical coordination at
the General Motors Technical

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.260
Center Research and
Science Building.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.010
We had modeling of the
facility, but there

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.450
were gaps that
needed to be filled

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.000
to ensure the systems
would work in compressor.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.890
We were able to
use a Tango enabled

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.770
device to capture
missing information,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.393
verify clearances, and keep
coordination expedited.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.000
- Cat Liveshare is a live
TelePresence application

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.840
that gives us live audio, live
video, and also introduces

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.280
augmented reality annotation.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.030
The difference with
a Google Tango device

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.710
is that it's mapping
the world at real time,

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.210
and we can actually annotate
on this side of the machine,

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.000
spin around it and annotate
behind us, and come right back

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.662
and those annotations
are still there.

00:09:04.662 --> 00:09:06.870
So there's a huge benefit
for us going from one place

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.210
to another, but also keeping
that history of where

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.656
you've been around a machine.

00:09:11.156 --> 00:09:13.425
- My name is Matt Whelan,
and I'm a VFX supervisor

00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:15.320
in Toronto, Canada.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.810
I use Google Tango
and an amazing program

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.090
by matterport called Scenes
for on-set data acquisition.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.010
You get that basic
texture information, lots

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.810
of volume metric information.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.440
Most importantly, you
get it at world scale.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.910
Meaning, your actor's 5'4",
now you have that on record,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.460
but you also get the
wrinkles in your costume,

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.460
or the certain way
the actor stands.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.320
How big is that your
doorway or that prop?

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.375
Google Tango and
matterport Scenes

00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:41.150
make that kind of on-set
data acquisition easy, quick,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.588
and efficient.

00:09:44.588 --> 00:09:46.580
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.591
JOHNNY LEE: Thanks.

00:09:53.247 --> 00:09:55.580
So those just give you a
glimpse into the kind of things

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.890
that genuinely save
people time or money

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.770
to get their jobs done, and
we see the value of Tango

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.860
being able to provide more
of that to more people.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.530
In terms of demos, one of the
things I wanted to highlight

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.120
was one of the Sandbox demos.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.911
How many of you have actually
been to the Tango Sandbox?

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:12.410
OK.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.792
That looks about a
third to a half of you.

00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:16.250
One of the demos
there that I like,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.350
that I think is really
great, is this one

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.504
called "Somewhere,"
or "Welcome to Oz."

00:10:20.504 --> 00:10:21.920
And when you walk
into that space,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.680
all you see is these
empty floor and two walls.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.710
But with the work of a
team up in San Francisco,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.580
trying to better estimate
lighting and shadows

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.370
and reflections to make
AR content blend better

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.434
with the environment, when you
look through the Zenfone AR--

00:10:38.434 --> 00:10:39.520
oh, there's a video.

00:10:42.222 --> 00:10:42.930
Is there a video?

00:10:45.858 --> 00:10:47.322
Back one more.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:50.890
That one.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.390
Yes.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.040
That's a really fun experience,
and if you go to the Sandbox,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.860
you can get a selfie taken
with one of the characters just

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.880
like this.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.670
But with the right work
and focus on lighting

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.310
and shadows and
reflections on the floor,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.870
the compositing
of the characters

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.368
can look very realistic.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.820
So let me give you a demo
of some of these live.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.070
And switch to the phone.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.590
So the first one I'm going
to show you is an app

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.330
called Holo, which is done by
a company called [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.620
based in Los Angeles.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.140
So in addition to
animated characters,

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.220
we can actually also do real
world characters, or real life

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.450
people.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.580
So what they have
is a capture system

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.620
with a large array
of cameras that

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.350
allow you to do a live
performances of people,

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.660
and capture them in full 3D.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.250
So let's add someone that you
guys may be familiar with.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.120
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.090
- Well, hey, it's
great to be here.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.980
Sorry I couldn't
be here in person,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.190
but I did the next best thing,
which was sending my hologram,

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.700
because holograms are cool.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.727
Well, hey it's great--

00:12:39.727 --> 00:12:40.310
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.851
JOHNNY LEE: So I can walk around
and look at him from a bunch

00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:44.266
of different angles.

00:12:44.266 --> 00:12:47.090
And so you can bring any live
actor, or any live performance

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.460
in their studio, and
capture them in 3D

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.310
and place them in a
space just like this.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.930
Because they are
virtual and 3D, we

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.840
can do something a little
bit more fun, like this.

00:13:00.291 --> 00:13:01.032
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:01.032 --> 00:13:03.008
- Well, hey, it's great to be--

00:13:03.008 --> 00:13:03.591
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:03.591 --> 00:13:10.860
JOHNNY LEE: We'll do this one,
and we'll shrink him like this.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:16.575
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:17.330
- Whoa!

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.620
OK.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:23.150
Now that is a big water bottle.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.917
Huh.

00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:25.500
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.999
JOHNNY LEE: So this
is a lot of fun,

00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:28.830
and it just shows
you what's possible

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.260
when there's more and
more content out there,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.050
and people building these
type of 3D experiences.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.460
We also have made a bunch
of SDK improvements,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.310
and one of the ones
I want to show you

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.100
is something that we've been
calling Com, internally.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.370
But it's basically online drift
correction and map building.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.170
So if you have this app, which
is our built-in measurement

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.530
app, the measurements
are only useful if they

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.180
stay attached to the world.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.770
And drift correction
is something

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.590
that we've had turned on as an
experimental mode for a while,

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.500
but we've been making
some optimizations

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.530
in the performance of it so that
we can run it real time, all

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.960
the time, with minimal
impact on the applications.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.520
So if I shake the phone and
basically lose tracking,

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.640
it locks back on and brings
back the measurements

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.000
to the same space.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.777
So if you update your SDK--

00:14:22.777 --> 00:14:24.110
yeah, I think that's a cool one.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.980
So this keeps contact
registered to the environment

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.260
even if the user walks away
or puts it in their pocket

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.270
and brings it back
out, as long as it's

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.710
within the same session.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.260
So if you update
the app and you work

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.970
in one of the
current SDKs, you'll

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.400
have this online drift
correction for you

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.247
automatically.

00:14:44.247 --> 00:14:45.580
So can we go back to the slides?

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.140
We also have a few other SDK
improvements I'd like to share.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.600
This one is our
constructor developer tool,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.020
which we also have being
done out in our Sandbox area.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.960
And it's our first
party 3D scanning app,

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.630
and I just wanted to
show you a video showing

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.370
some of the updated results.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.390
So this is all data that's been
captured with the Lenovo Phab 2

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.210
Pro, and also processed
on the Phab 2 Pro.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.760
And you can see that the
quality of the reconstruction

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.480
is actually pretty good.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.590
It's not fully photorealistic,
but you get a pretty good sense

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.290
of the environment and being
able to walk around and see

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.080
some of the details and
get a sense of the space.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.170
Now, one of the cool things
is that, with the Asus phone,

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.470
it's both Tango enabled
and Daydream ready,

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.350
so not only can you
scan a room in full 3D

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.232
and get these kind of captures,
but we added a VR viewing mode.

00:15:43.232 --> 00:15:44.690
So with the press
of the button you

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.580
can then put it in
a Daydream headset,

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.150
and actually through
the apartment

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.480
you just scanned, using the
Daydream controller to teleport

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.080
through this apartment.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.687
So it's pretty amazing
that you can do all of this

00:15:57.687 --> 00:15:59.270
with a phone that
fits in your pocket.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.030
We've talked to some
developers, and not

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.220
everyone knows what
to do with a 3D model.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.980
A lot of real estate developers
and facilities management

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.510
simply want a floor plan.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.030
So we took some of our
algorithms for 3D meshing

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.660
and just export a 2D plan,
so that you can walk around

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.900
and get an estimate of
the walls and the doors

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.269
and the furniture.

00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:26.560
One really interesting thing
is that the developer that

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.840
worked on this
realized his apartment

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.610
was actually 50
square feet smaller

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.860
than it's supposed to be.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.750
So you genuinely
could use this to try

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.960
to renegotiate your rent
if you felt like you

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.450
were getting charged too much.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.660
We also have gotten feedback
that better occlusion tools

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.260
and sample code was desired.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.360
So we now have,
coming soon, examples

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.900
of real time shaders that
combine data from both the RGB

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.600
camera and the depth camera
so that you can do effects

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.582
like this really very easily
and without a lot of hassle

00:17:01.582 --> 00:17:04.040
of writing your own code to
figure out how to do this well.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.079
Also, some sample code on
using data from the RGB camera

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.270
to improve environmental
elimination.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.160
Those shadows and lighting
and changes in the environment

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.869
add a lot to the
realism or the effect of

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.160
whether or not something
looked like it's really there.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.579
So you can see the reflection
of the notebook and the mug

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.694
in this pool ball.

00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:28.319
There are still some ways to go
before we are Hollywood quality

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.320
special effects, but this
isn't bad for a real time

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.280
capability on phones.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.840
We're also happy to
say that, if you're

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.900
one of the developers that
worked on one of the 40,000

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.580
vuforia apps currently
in the Play Store,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.130
vuforia now has native
Tango integration.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.410
So your vuforia
apps will continue

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.330
to work on a broad
range of phones,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.950
but if they're run
on a Tango phone,

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.790
they'll benefit from
an additional features,

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.080
such as the smart terrain system
that processes their point

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.290
cloud, and better tracking
from our fish eye camera.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.086
So we're really happy to
welcome augmented reality

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.960
community that's been
around for a few years.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.860
Another exciting
thing that we wanted

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.960
to give a little bit of detail
on was WebAR and Chromium.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.800
So today, if you want to take
advantage of the benefits of AR

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.184
and be able to place objects
in the person's room,

00:18:24.184 --> 00:18:25.850
you'd actually have
to convince the user

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.340
to find your application,
download it from the Play

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.530
Store, and install the app.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.040
But just like with
Web VR, wouldn't it

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.380
be great to just go to
a URL and suddenly you

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.600
would be able to download and
pull all the assets right away.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.440
So if we could view
AR content as easily

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.945
as we could view images
or video on the web,

00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:46.070
that would be really great.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.820
So this is actually a early
prototype of Chromium web

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.240
browser at a Wayfair
web site, and you

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.880
can see that the motion
tracking data, the depth data,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.315
are all actually piped
directly into the web page.

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:02.690
And what the person
has done here

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.420
is actually drawn out a
box in their living room,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.570
and says, well, what tables
will actually fit in this space.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.356
And Wayfair responds
with the tables

00:19:11.356 --> 00:19:12.980
that will actually
fit the constraints,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.520
and is able to place and render
that object all inside the web

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.530
browser.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.620
So as you think about being
able to discover content

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.340
very easily, we view this
as a really interesting way

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.790
to make it much easier for
people who own 3D assets

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.460
and want to get more
viewers on those 3D assets

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.370
to get users much more
quickly without having

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.710
to pre-install a specific app.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.970
Now, to tell you
a little bit more

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.382
about location in AR and our
visual positioning service,

00:19:46.382 --> 00:19:47.590
let me hand it off to Justin.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.840
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Thanks, Johnny.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.407
Hi, everyone.

00:19:55.407 --> 00:19:57.240
My is Justin Quimby and
I'm a senior product

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.130
manager on the Tango team.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.830
And we've made a lot of
progress in the last year

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.040
on location based AR, and
I'm thrilled at the chance

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.240
to show off what the
team's been working on.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.470
So Clay mentioned the
visual positioning service

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.840
at the keynote, and I'm proud
to say that the service already

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.310
has apps running on it today.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.500
The first app which
launched on VPS

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.880
was an app entitled
Lumin, built by GuidiGO

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.400
and running at the
Detroit Institute of Arts.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:37.650
Lumin enables both navigation
to exhibits and digital content

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.720
when you arrive
at those exhibits.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.370
So here you can see, in the app,
a visitor getting navigation

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.470
to a specific exhibit.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:52.800
Now, this is using no Bluetooth
beacons, no Wi-Fi maps, or GPS.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.310
This is entirely
visual navigation.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:05.170
And then, once you
get to the exhibit,

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.340
you can then see
digital content overlaid

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.090
on top of the real world.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:14.500
So here you see a CAT scan of a
mummy in the real environment.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.280
So this allows visitors,
through the Phab 2 Pro,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.080
to see through
the outer wrapping

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.990
and revealing the
skeleton underneath.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.570
And as a result of this
overlay of digital information

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.580
in the real world,
visitors can actually

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.110
see the really large crack
on the skull of the mummy.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.600
And this blending of
the real and the digital

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.390
means that visitors are actively
engaging with and learning

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.880
from the mummy, rather
than walking into the room

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.020
and saying, hey, it's
a mummy, and leaving.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.590
And in part because
of this, Lumin

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.800
won the American Alliance of
Museums annual competition

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.440
for the Games in Augmented
Reality App category

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.725
in part because the app delivers
meaningful visitor outcomes.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.220
And we've also launched
an AR experience

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.630
at the Art Science
Museum in Singapore,

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.020
which you saw at Johnny's
keynote this morning.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.920
This app transforms over 1,000
square meters of the museum

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.290
into a virtual rain forest,
which you can explore

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.910
using your Tango device.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.230
And "Into the Wild,"
which is the app,

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.010
is made by the Art Science
Museum, Google, Lenovo,

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.160
and the World Wildlife Fund,
in association with Panasonic,

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.820
Qualcomm, and working with Media
Monks and a Singaporean artist,

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.540
Brian Tan.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.620
And in April, the
Singapore National Museum

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.130
also launched a Tango
based experience using VPS.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.530
So this app lets visitors
explore the museum

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.100
and see how it's evolved
over the past 130 years.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:46.540
And so, this floating
whale skeleton

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.780
used to be in the museum, but
was transferred to Malaysia

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.100
in the 1970s.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.710
And so now you have
parents taking their kids

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.450
and explaining to
them what they used

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.180
to see when they were
kids visiting museum.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.660
And since it's a digital
object placed in the world,

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.020
it can actually show not just
the skeleton, but a full whale.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.480
And not just a static whale, but
also a whale and how it eats.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.862
And it's not just museums that
have launched apps using VPS.

00:23:17.862 --> 00:23:20.320
Earlier this year, we launched
the treasure hunt experience

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.370
in conjunction with an
MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.310
And this app allows players
to go on a digital treasure

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.730
hunt for coins
within the Casino,

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.280
and they can use those to then
try to win real world prizes.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.682
And Google succeeds when
our partners succeed.

00:23:38.682 --> 00:23:40.640
And we're fortunate to
have one of our partners

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.010
here today with us, Kyle
from Lowe's, to talk

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.680
about how they built on
top of the Tango platform

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.620
to solve real problems
for their users.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.340
KYLE NEL: Cool.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:49.910
Thanks.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:50.535
Thanks, Justin.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.070
So when you think of Lowe's,
you don't necessarily

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.590
think of emerging
tech like Tango.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.930
Every organization
on the planet says

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.540
they want to create the
new disruptive tools,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.277
but that's harder than it seems.

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:07.110
There are two things
you have to figure out.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:11.700
What you want to work on, and
what you don't want to work on.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.200
So to figure that
out, we get people

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.300
together inside and
outside of the company

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.080
to work on those things.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.870
You need an intuitive
way, though,

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.910
to be able to help people
understand the future.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.410
That's a hard thing.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.610
We do that through stories.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.220
So we create actual
narratives about the future

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.720
we want to build,
and then we work

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.640
backwards to bring it to life.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.160
This is a scene, actually,
from our first story

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.932
that we turned
into a comic book,

00:24:33.932 --> 00:24:36.390
and it turned out to be the
most disruptive tool we've ever

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.390
built. One of the hardest
things about home improvement

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.890
is that it's really, really hard
to envision how your project is

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.770
going to turn out, and
even harder to communicate

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.580
that to the person
you have to convince;

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.390
to communicate that
to somebody else.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:56.670
So it's estimated that about $70
billion in projects every year

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.610
go unfulfilled, just because
of this visualization problem.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.730
So we knew that we could
use visualization tech

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.890
to build new tools that could
help solve this problem.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.150
And we used the comic book to
show our executive team what

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.350
the future would look like.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.720
And it's all about bringing
those intuitive solutions

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.850
to life in order to
influence human behavior.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.810
It's not about building
tech for Tech's sake,

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.060
and our executives'
reaction to the comic book,

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.580
after seeing what we could
do, was to go build it.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.570
So we did it, and
four years ago, we

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:32.130
brought the first iteration of
that augmented reality design

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.470
solution that we call
the Holoroom, into two

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:35.820
of our Canadian stores.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.430
So it was really
early-- four years ago--

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:39.820
and the tech was rough.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.105
But we use our stores as
living labs that would show us,

00:25:44.105 --> 00:25:46.230
so we could get real feedback
from actual customers

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.740
and employees, not just to
create solutions that work,

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.380
but solutions that actually
work for real people

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.240
and our customers.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.960
And we talked about what we
were doing really loudly,

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.880
and the intention of
that is to attract

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.010
more what we call uncommon
partners, the kinds of people

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.760
and organizations that
you wouldn't expect

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.930
a Lowe's to work
with, that could

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.230
help us achieve this narrative.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.380
So Google was one of
our earliest partners

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.590
to respond to that call.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.520
And from the earliest days
of exploring AR and VR,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.510
we worked with Google to push
the future further, faster.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.130
And in fact, in the
second generation,

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.671
as you can see here,
of the Holoroom,

00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:25.040
we created a Google Cardboard
vending machine, that I love,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.540
to give customers a
take-away VR experience.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.580
Once again, not
about creating stuff,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.290
but creating stuff that works.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.400
But really, it's
not about VR and AR.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.470
This kitchen vignette
is what you typically

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.480
see when you come into
one of our stores.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.290
Our benchmark is not "what's
the best AR and VR experience."

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.200
It's the way customers
visualize today

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.470
that is decidedly low tech.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.980
So when we are building
experiences that are so far

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.020
from moved from where
customers know today--

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.550
this kitchen vignette--

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.830
how do we measure
what's working?

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.050
So we quickly found that
the right tools didn't

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.572
exist to evaluate if
people like something

00:27:00.572 --> 00:27:03.030
that they've never experienced
before, something truly new,

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.140
like Tango.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.360
And my background is actually
in behavioral science,

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.026
and I teamed up with
some of my partners

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:09.810
from academia to take
the latest research

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.260
and turn it into an
implied neuroscience tool.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.040
So this worked.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.998
This turned into a company
called Neurons Inc.,

00:27:15.998 --> 00:27:16.890
that anyone can use.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.250
And the real reason is you can't
trust people's stated reactions

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.430
to tech that's so new.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.610
One of the things I
always hear is, I love it,

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.040
and they take it off and
never put it back on again.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.350
So neuroscience allows
us to tap into customers

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.320
unstated reactions through
a variety of measures.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.960
We've completed thousands of
hours of neuroscience testing

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.900
on different AR and
VR technologies,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.860
and our studies showed that
the busy kitchen vignettes were

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.450
causing cognitive overload,
as you can see here

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.800
in this bar, and low emotional
engagement and motivation.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.790
And then, next, we tested
all other VR and AR tools,

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.460
and they did better, but they
were still too overwhelming.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.485
But when we tested Tango,
even early on, with customers

00:27:59.485 --> 00:28:01.860
we saw for the first time that
they had the optimal level

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.330
of cognitive interest.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.410
They were more engaged.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.050
They were also more
motivated in a positive way.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.880
And all of this
meant we had finally

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.110
hit upon a truly
intuitive experience.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.510
So last fall, we celebrated
our first ever global launch

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.116
of the Lowe's Vision
Tango app, which

00:28:18.116 --> 00:28:19.740
allows customers to
measure their space

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.680
and select virtual Lowe's
products to fit it.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.380
At the same time, we launched
the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.660
at Lowe's, introducing the
next generation of what

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.750
we call digital power
tools, and the phones

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.390
sold out in just a
few days after launch.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.064
Think about that--
Lowe's selling phones.

00:28:36.064 --> 00:28:37.480
And since launching
Lowe's Vision,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.210
we've had a really
positive response

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.700
from customers who are excited
about how comfortable it

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.220
is to design and personalize
their homes using

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.140
this platform.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.360
Now we're excited to be
an early partner bringing

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.290
the visual positioning
service to our stores.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.880
We've launched in-store
mapping in two stores

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.950
to help customers
find products faster.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.479
And based on a positive
response so far,

00:28:58.479 --> 00:29:00.270
we are excited to
announce that Google will

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.192
be mapping 400 more stores.

00:29:03.192 --> 00:29:04.650
Just to give you
an example of what

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.590
it's like to use this app in
our store, check out this video.

00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.655
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:13.155 --> 00:29:16.964
- Well, here we are inside,
and if you're anything like me,

00:29:16.964 --> 00:29:19.130
you get to these places and
you're like, oh, my god.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.200
Where do I even start?

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.654
But fortunately, I happen
to have a Tango phone

00:29:23.654 --> 00:29:25.070
right here, which
is going to help

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.480
me get from product to
product and buy exactly what I

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.260
need way faster than I normally
would be able to get there.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.350
So let's have a look here.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.540
So I'm just going to open
up the Lowe's app here

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.970
and then pull up
my shopping list.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.990
Now, this stuff is
all over the store,

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.680
and normally you'd be
like, where is any of it?

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.910
With this, what I could
do is just navigate,

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.610
and my phone is going to tell
me, OK, we're over this way.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.880
75-foot outdoor extension cord.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.380
OK.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.010
We've got that.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.974
Next.

00:30:02.974 --> 00:30:04.456
OK.

00:30:04.456 --> 00:30:07.420
And a number nine-- pretty good.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.307
Number nine.

00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:08.807
Got it.

00:30:11.729 --> 00:30:13.190
- Oh, hey, what's up?

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:14.584
- What are you doing here?

00:30:14.584 --> 00:30:15.625
- Shopping for the boxes.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.142
- Four-inch hex bolts.

00:30:26.142 --> 00:30:27.564
Check.

00:30:27.564 --> 00:30:29.934
We got some hex bolts.

00:30:29.934 --> 00:30:31.356
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.830
KYLE NEL: Great.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:36.730
Thank you so much.

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:40.420
Justin, thank you.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.600
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Thanks, Kyle.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.970
Partners are a critical
component of the Tango

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.150
ecosystem, and we're thrilled
to be working with Lowe's.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.160
And a common thread
of all these location

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.079
based AR experiences
you've just seen

00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:56.120
is they're built on top
of the visual positioning

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.100
service, a service
for developers

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.230
to map indoor environments,
and then create

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.850
location based AR experiences.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.925
So let's get into the
details of how it works.

00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:08.300
The visual
positioning service is

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.060
comprised of three components--
mapping, cloud processing,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.390
and client localization.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.870
The first step is that
of creating a map.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.420
So, in a venue
which has given us

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.400
permission, such as
this Lowe's store,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.130
collection involves
walking through the store

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.830
through the main pathways
with a Tango device.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.420
With a wide angle
camera, combined

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.740
with the motion tracking
capabilities of the Tango

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.350
Stack, it creates a data
set of the environment,

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.230
which you can see on the right.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.000
When this collection
pass is completed,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.360
the data gets uploaded
into the cloud, which

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.980
brings us to our second step--

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.680
the cloud processing pipeline.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.950
So here's a visualization
of an aggregation

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.060
of all the different mapping
runs for a given Lowe's store.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.070
In every frame, we're detecting
hundreds of visual features

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.290
to compute the 3D location
of corresponding points

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.310
in the scene.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.920
These collected data sets
are then processed, aligned,

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.040
and compressed, using
middle-out, into a cloud map.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.910
This mapping is based on
purely visual feature tracking.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.100
It doesn't need Bluetooth.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.050
It doesn't need Wi-Fi.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.440
It doesn't need GPS
to create this map.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.930
And every capture and
recapture of a venue

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.265
is incorporated to the
map and improves it.

00:32:18.265 --> 00:32:20.940
An important note here on size.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.460
One of our larger venues
that's currently running on VPS

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.660
is a shopping mall, over
900,000 square feet.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.120
And in that shopping
mall, we use

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.270
over 1.3 million key frames, 37
million landmarks, and over 300

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.210
million key points to provide
localization of anywhere

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.310
from a centimeter
to five centimeters.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.300
So this is a scalable system
to tackle not only your living

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.810
room, but massive,
massive indoor facilities.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.260
Now, once VCS has completed
its cloud processing step,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.980
we now have a map
of the environment

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.720
which any Tango enabled
device can localize against.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.926
So let's return to
that same Lowe's store.

00:33:01.926 --> 00:33:03.800
And so this is a video
of a device localizing

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.240
in a Lowe's store.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.270
Now, just as you can control
the permissions for GPS

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.570
on your phone, so, too, do you
have control over apps that

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.880
have access to VPS permissions.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.890
To be able to
localize in a space,

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.750
the user needs to give
the app permission

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.290
to use both the camera
and location permissions.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.420
Once the user has granted
those permissions,

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.920
as it moves through
the environment,

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.920
it's looking for visual
features and matching those

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.510
against the stored cloud map.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.360
This provides continuous
adjustment and alignment

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.510
between the device's position
and all the AR content which

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.995
has been placed in that space.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:56.090
So VPS provides you, the
developer, a coordinate system

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.990
to overlay digital content
into the real world.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.800
The CAT scan of the mummy, all
the products in a Lowe's store,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.990
and the treasure
hunt in the MGM Grand

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.080
all use the same
back end service.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.810
And today, we have
over 150 buildings

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:15.960
mapped and running on VPS.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.010
So, great.

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.710
You've got a little bit more
information about how VPS works

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.949
and its capabilities.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.850
How do you build for it?

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.120
So today, VPS is
in private beta.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.940
If you're interested
in developing for VCS,

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.940
please go to
developers.google.com/tango

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.610
and sign up to get more
information as we bring more

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.900
and more developers onto
the platform over the course

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.070
of the coming months.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.949
But what you can do
today is build an AR app

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:47.460
based on Tango's core
capabilities-- motion tracking,

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.500
depth sensing, and
area learning-- which

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.310
are foundational for creating
great AR experiences.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.770
And the final step is
to start thinking about,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.330
what would you build if
you had a persistent AR

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:04.090
layer over the world?

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.320
And as you saw at the
keynote with Expeditions,

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.440
when you create experiences that
allow multiple people to have

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.550
a shared experience
across multiple devices,

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:18.300
not only are you adding digital
content to the real world,

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.990
but you're also adding shared
meaning to these interactions

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:23.160
among people.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.111
And we believe that's one of
the most powerful aspects of AR.

00:35:28.111 --> 00:35:31.920
And VPS allows for the creation
of persistent and transient

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:37.830
maps of space on which people
can experience the same AR

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.820
content together.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.240
And VPS is a tool.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.770
We're building to enable
you to create amazing,

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.260
location based AR experiences.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.390
We can't wait to see what you
build on top of this service.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.690
Let's all aim to build
experiences which

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.410
bring our users joy like this.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.210
So with that, I'd like
to hand it back to Johnny

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:03.251
to talk about the future.

00:36:10.176 --> 00:36:11.300
JOHNNY LEE: Thanks, Justin.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.740
It's really great to see
the past year of progress

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.730
we've made with content partners
and our location service

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.530
over the past year.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.900
But I'd like to leave
you with a glimpse

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.310
ahead, just a sample of
what we've been working on

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:29.220
as research projects, either
internally or externally,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.040
to paint a little bit
of the road ahead.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.320
And some of these are
done with partners.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.960
And it's important to say
that these aren't necessarily

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.360
things that will
be in the roadmap

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.045
or no deterministic ship date.

00:36:40.045 --> 00:36:41.420
But it gives you
a sense of where

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.109
things are going over time.

00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:44.150
So we can play the video.

00:36:45.644 --> 00:36:47.138
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:50.624
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:04.592 --> 00:39:06.300
I think that drone
video is pretty sweet.

00:39:08.976 --> 00:39:10.350
So, that's some
of the work we've

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.590
been doing with partners in
experimental and research work.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.920
But over time, we hope to start
to bring more and more of these

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.610
into the platform so that
people like you can use them.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.380
Over the next 12
months, the team

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.990
is working hard to
bring Tango capabilities

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.970
to more and more
devices, be they

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:30.390
phones or standalone headsets,
and we do expect that number

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.680
to grow rapidly.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.230
And we do believe that, one
day, all our phones will

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.080
have some form of this
capability built in.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.640
As you saw in the
video, the ability

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.190
to have indoor, precise
positioning and tracking

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.860
capabilities, like
VPS, will enable

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.430
new types of spatially
aware computing,

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.760
and enable new devices in
the wearable space and even,

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.530
in the future,
robotic platforms.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.160
There's a lot of
exciting work to come,

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.100
in working with more
of you, the developers,

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.090
create new experiences that
enhance the way we play,

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.790
the way we shop, or
find our way in stores,

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.560
or new ways of learning.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.500
And Tango allows us to
interact with digital content

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:13.330
in a physical way, bringing new
forms of immersive computing.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.300
So for more information, please
see our developer web site

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.480
or consider joining the
Google Tango developer Google+

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.395
community.

00:40:20.395 --> 00:40:23.830
It has over 12,000 developers
posting videos and links

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.960
to new apps on a regular basis.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.030
Thank you for joining us,
and enjoy the rest of I/O.
