00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.400
There is perhaps nothing scarier than slowly
losing all your memories, except maybe that

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.559
the process might start at a much younger
age than you might think[a][b].

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.480
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.200
Scientists don’t totally understand what
causes Alzheimer's disease, but ongoing research

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.960
has uncovered that its onset is rooted in
a complex series of events that take place

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.480
in the brain over a long period of time.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
Contributing factors include genetic, environmental,
and lifestyle factors, but because everyone

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.180
is genetically different and lives a different
life, preventing the onset of Alzheimer’s

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.110
varies from person to person.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.710
One hallmark of Alzheimer’s is Amyloid.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.510
Amyloid is an abnormal protein usually produced
in the bone marrow and can sometimes be deposited

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.829
in other tissues and organs and it has been
found to accumulate in clumps outside neurons

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.550
in older adults as well as in Alzheimer’s
patients.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.680
These clumps typically damage and eventually
kill memory-related neurons because when neurons

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.870
are exposed to these kind of clumps, it triggers
an excess leakage of calcium into the cells

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.870
that kills them.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.900
The clumps can also secrete amyloid outside
the cell, leading to the plaque buildup that’s

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.990
commonly associated with Alzheimer’s.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.990
It turns out that that Amyloid buildup starts
far earlier in life than scientists thought.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.970
This finding comes from a new study led by
Changiz Geula, a research professor at Northwestern

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.990
University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.460
For the study, the team was interested in
the neurons in the basal forebrain closely

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.500
involved in memory and attention, to try to
understand why they can be damaged early and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.220
why they tend to be the first to die.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.950
They examined these neurons in the brains
of three groups of deceased individuals: cognitively

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.060
normal young people between 20 to 66; non-demented
older people between 70 to 99; and individuals

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.340
affected by Alzheimer's between 60 to 95.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.990
They found that the amyloid molecules weren’t
present exclusively in Alzheimer’s patients,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.780
they were present in normal young adults as
well.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.020
Once present, the amyloid molecules can continue
to grow over the course of an individual’s

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.990
lifetime, ultimately growing to be quite large
in older individuals and those with Alzheimer’s.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.970
It explains why these neurons die early; the
lifelong accumulation of toxic amyloid likely

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.940
contributes to their vulnerability in both
natural aging and loss in Alzheimer’s.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.259
Geula and his team plan to investigate how
internal amyloid damages the neurons as the

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.670
next stage of their research.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.979
So it’s a small step, but hopefully their
research can someday lead to other science

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.280
that brings us closer to prevention or a cure.[c][d]

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.020
So does this new discovery make you more or
less concerned about developing Alzheimer’s?[g][h]
