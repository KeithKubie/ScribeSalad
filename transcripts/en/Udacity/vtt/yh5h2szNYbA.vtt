00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is, yes, but it doesn't provide much advantage,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
since now an attacker who learns the hash of p doesn't need to learn p.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first statement is not true.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If there was some dictionary attack using the password,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it'd work just as well using the hash of the password.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The third one is also not true.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The server doesn't need to invert the hash, and a shared key can be established

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
just like before.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The fourth is not true.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If there was a serious security vulnerability in this protocol,

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It would exist in the original protocol as well.
