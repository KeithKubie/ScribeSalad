00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.320
What I want to do
now is simplify

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.560
the exact same
expression but do it

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.360
with traditional
algebraic long division.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.820
And hopefully we'll see why
synthetic division actually

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.260
gives us the exact same result.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.760
We'll be able to
see the connections

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.370
between synthetic division
and algebraic long division.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.770
So let's get started.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.550
So if we're doing
algebraic long division

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.466
and set it up right over
here, the first thing

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.300
we want to think about
is how many times

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.310
does the highest degree
term here, which is our x,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.220
go into the highest
degree term here,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.800
which is our 3x to
the third power.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.640
Well x goes into 3x to the
third power 3x squared times.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.710
So we'll write it in
the x squared place,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.230
3x squared times.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.450
Now you might already
see your parallel.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.230
When we did the
synthetic division,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.510
we dropped this 3
straight down, and this 3

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.780
represented 3x squared.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.730
So this 3 and this
3x squared are really

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.630
representing the same thing.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.284
But you might be
saying, well here

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:00.450
we have to do some thinking.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.360
We had to say x goes into 3x
to the third 3x squared times.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.630
Here, we just mindlessly
dropped this 3 straight down.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.450
How did that work?

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.410
The reason why we were able to
mindlessly drop this 3 straight

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.790
down is because
we assumed, to do

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.930
this basic type of
synthetic division,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.380
that we had just an
x right over here.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.550
We didn't have a 3x.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.540
We didn't have a 4x.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.840
We didn't have an x squared.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.680
We just had an x.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.170
And if you divide an x into
whatever this highest degree

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.280
term is, your
coefficient is going

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.130
to be the exact same thing.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370
It's just going to
be one degree lower.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.900
So you go from a 3x
to the third to 3x

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.360
squared-- so the exact
same coefficient.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.000
And now, in our little synthetic
division right over here,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.650
that right over there
is the x squared term.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.370
So you went from 3x to
the third to 3x squared.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.750
We essentially divided it by x.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.550
And we could blindly do it
because we knew, we assumed,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.590
that we were dealing
with just a 1x

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.520
to the first right over here.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.950
But let's keep on going
and see the parallels

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.260
and see why we're essentially
doing the exact same thing.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.620
Now let's take this 3x
squared and multiply

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.380
that times x plus 4.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.105
So 3x squared times
x-- I'll do it

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:19.060
in that white color-- it's
going to be 3x to the third.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.690
And 3x squared times 4 is
going to be 12x squared.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.200
And now we'll want
to subtract this.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.540
So now we subtract.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.850
We subtract this out.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.200
These guys cancel
out, and you have 4x

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.920
squared minus 12x squared.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.070
And so that will give
you negative 8x squared.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.640
So once again, you're probably
seeing some parallels.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.760
You had the 4x
squared over here.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.770
You have the 4x
squared over there.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.530
We just wrote the coefficient,
but that's what it represented.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.870
4x squared, we
wrote the 4 there.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.240
Then we essentially
subtracted 12x squared.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.620
And the way we got that 12,
we multiplied 3 times 4,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.100
and then we subtracted.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.360
Here we're multiplying
3 times negative 4.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.027
We're essentially multiplying
3 times 4 and then subtracting.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.610
That's why we put
that negative there,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.109
so we don't have
to keep remembering

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.000
to subtract this row.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.540
So we could just
keep adding them.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.998
But that's essentially
what we did.

00:03:20.998 --> 00:03:22.930
We multiplied 3 times this 4.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.060
And now we subtract it.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.700
We get that negative
12x squared.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.447
And then we subtracted, and
you got negative 8x squared.

00:03:30.447 --> 00:03:32.530
And you might say, oh, is
this the same negative 8

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.980
as this right over here?

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.240
Not quite yet,
because over here,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.630
this negative 8 literally
represents negative 8x.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.810
This is actually part
of our simplification.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.510
When we divide
this into that, we

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.880
got 3x squared minus 8x plus 30.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.660
So over here in the
algebraic long division,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.010
we then say, how many
times does x plus 4

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.820
go into negative 8x squared?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.360
Well x goes into negative 8x
squared negative 8x times.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.090
So this is the key
right over here. x

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.877
goes into it negative 8x times.

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:12.710
And once again, the
reason why we could just

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.920
put this negative
8 here is we know

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.740
that we are dividing
just by a 1x.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.519
So you're going to have
the exact same coefficient,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.170
just one degree lower.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.600
So this right over
here is our x term,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.280
and you see it right over
there, just like that.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.820
So a lot of the simplification
just comes from the idea

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.280
that we are assuming with
the synthetic division

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.020
that this is a 1x.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.460
But let's just keep going.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.590
So you have a negative 8x times
this business right over here

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.840
gives you negative 8x times
x is negative 8x squared.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:57.080
And then you have negative 8x
times 4, which is negative 32x.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080
And we can bring down all
of this business right

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.205
over here, just so it
becomes a little bit simpler.

00:05:01.205 --> 00:05:03.380
So you have a negative 2x.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.855
And then over here,
you have a minus 1.

00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:09.230
And once again,
when you're doing

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.010
traditional algebraic
long division,

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.349
you're going to subtract
this from that up there.

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:14.890
So if we're going
to subtract, that's

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.150
like adding the negative.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.820
These characters cancel out.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.080
You have a negative 2x plus 32x.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.480
That gives us a positive 30x.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.711
And then we can bring down
that negative 1 if we want.

00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:34.210
I'll do that yellow
color, actually.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.120
We'll bring down
that negative 1.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.660
So this 30 has the
same coefficient here.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.480
But this 30 should be up here.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.760
This is going to be part
of our final answer.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.880
And to get that, once again,
it all comes from the fact

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.550
that we know that
we had an x here

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.190
when we did the
synthetic division.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.740
30x divided by x is
just going to be 30.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.856
That 30 and this 30 is
the exact same thing.

00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:00.730
And then we multiply.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.000
30 times x is 30x.

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:07.500
Actually, let me write the
30x in that white color

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.780
because that's the convention
I've been using-- 30x.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.260
30 times 4 is 120.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.140
And then we are going to
subtract this from that.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:28.700
So we get negative 1
minus 120 is negative 121,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.590
which, right over there,
is our remainder-- which

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.760
is exactly what
we got over there.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.420
So hopefully you
see the connection.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.480
Because we are assuming
that we are dividing

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.690
by x plus or minus
something, we were

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.710
able to make some
simplifying assumptions.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.654
Whenever you divide
this by an x,

00:06:46.654 --> 00:06:49.070
you know it's going to have
the same coefficient, just one

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.740
degree lower.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.325
And we kept doing that.

00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:55.450
And so it allowed us to do
it a little bit simpler,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.665
a little bit faster,
and using less space.
