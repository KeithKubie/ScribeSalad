00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.693
We've looked closely at circles, so now let's examine ellipses. Ellipses are

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:10.709
very much like circles. There's just one exception. The distance we go in the x

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.277
direction will be different from the distance we go in the y direction. So,

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:19.876
sometimes we might move further from the center in the x direction than we

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:25.700
would vertically in the y direction. And other times we might go further in the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.970
y direction from the center, than we would in the x direction from the center.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.691
We'll see a lot of similarities between circles and ellipses, so let's try

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:39.428
looking at a circle first. There's this amazing online graphing calculator

00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:43.560
called Desmos. If you've never heard of it, I highly recommend that you check

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.700
it out. It allows us to easily enter in equations. And we can instantly see

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.720
what the graph looks like. For now we're going to look at the equation of a

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.960
circle, but if you ever want to play around with this on your own, go to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.268
www.decimals.com. You can create your own account and then start to draw and

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:05.410
save your own graphs. For circles we know they have equal amounts of x squared

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.620
and y squared. And if we take the square root of this number, we'll get six.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.492
That's the radius of our circle. The distance to any point from the center to

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:21.320
another point on the circle. But what if we wanted to graph this equation?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.298
Notice that we have different amounts of x squared and y squared now. Now, I'm

00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:29.850
going to go ahead and let you know that this will be the graph of an ellipse.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.094
So, let's see how we can graph it ourselves. First we'll take the equation and

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:38.838
we'll divide through by the number 36. When we divide each term by 36, we'll

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:44.492
get one fourth x squared here. one ninth y squared here and 1 on the other side

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:49.550
of the equal sign. So, we're going to ignore our first equation of the circle

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.480
for now. We've taken this equation and rearranged it into this. Now, can you

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.646
tell me what are the two x-intercepts?
