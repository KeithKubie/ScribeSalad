00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.630
I'm a huge fan of Udacity.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.880
At a point in my career,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.950
I was doing a lot of business development.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.520
I've always been super excited about technology,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.399
I've always been super technically inclined,

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:22.620
but I always felt a little bit like I was sitting on the sidelines.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.690
I felt Udacity really gave me quickiest access for me to understand it.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.940
I became fascinated and I fell in love with

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.195
coding and I said I'm going to just do these nanodegrees,

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:36.650
I'm going to understand,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.015
I'm going to teach myself.

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:43.735
It was during my time that I was doing my full sack and data analysis.

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:49.505
Nanodegrees that I went online and started picking up solidity,

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:54.965
and doing my own self-directed solidity blockchain nanodegree on the side,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:01:00.530
which is now a formalized program here which I'm so excited about.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.200
I found out shortly after joining Kadena that all of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.430
the management team and the founders didn't go through a traditional computer science.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.620
None of them have computer science degrees,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.135
they were all self taught.

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:21.380
It was a very interesting realization that you don't

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.380
have to have a traditional university college degree to invent stuff.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.215
Udacity gave me this skill set to learn

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:34.460
about the first principles of what computer science is.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.900
I still go to Udacity to brush up on certain concepts.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.945
I check out all of the courses coming out on a regular basis.

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:47.690
Udacity played such a formative role in shaping my understanding of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.549
how to learn about technical issues and learn about new concepts

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.960
coming out that I really wanted to pull from a pool of people that have entered into

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.770
a program that self-selects for

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.820
self starters and people who are curious and are lifelong learners.
