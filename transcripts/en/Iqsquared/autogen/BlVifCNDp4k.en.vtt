talked about industrialized agriculture

00:54:27.279 --> 00:54:27.289
talked about industrialized agriculture
 

00:54:27.289 --> 00:54:29.140
talked about industrialized agriculture
yeah the point was made against that

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:29.150
yeah the point was made against that
 

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:30.819
yeah the point was made against that
that there's very little industrialized

00:54:30.819 --> 00:54:30.829
that there's very little industrialized
 

00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:33.069
that there's very little industrialized
agriculture in the uplands as opposed to

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.079

your argument not attach more to the

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:39.019
your argument not attach more to the
 

00:54:39.019 --> 00:54:40.809
your argument not attach more to the
lowlands that does to the uplands the

00:54:40.809 --> 00:54:40.819
lowlands that does to the uplands the
 

00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:44.200
lowlands that does to the uplands the
classic part of that is that when

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:44.210
classic part of that is that when
 

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:46.569
classic part of that is that when
subsidies were ply to the head of sheep

00:54:46.569 --> 00:54:46.579
subsidies were ply to the head of sheep
 

00:54:46.579 --> 00:54:49.539
subsidies were ply to the head of sheep
in Cumbria and Derbyshire the numbers of

00:54:49.539 --> 00:54:49.549
in Cumbria and Derbyshire the numbers of
 

00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:51.789
in Cumbria and Derbyshire the numbers of
sheep stopped on individual farms

00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799
sheep stopped on individual farms
 

00:54:51.799 --> 00:54:56.019
sheep stopped on individual farms
rocketed and that was because the the

00:54:56.019 --> 00:54:56.029
rocketed and that was because the the
 

00:54:56.029 --> 00:54:58.420
rocketed and that was because the the
the subsidy paid per sheep just

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:58.430
the subsidy paid per sheep just
 

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:00.400
the subsidy paid per sheep just
increased the coffers of the sheep

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:00.410
increased the coffers of the sheep
 

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:02.680
increased the coffers of the sheep
farmer and so and so it was just

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:02.690
farmer and so and so it was just
 

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:06.789
farmer and so and so it was just
subsidy driven profiting regardless of

00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799
subsidy driven profiting regardless of
 

00:55:06.799 --> 00:55:08.650
subsidy driven profiting regardless of
the quality and the impact on the land

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:08.660
the quality and the impact on the land
 

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.809
the quality and the impact on the land
so I think it was subsidy driven if it

00:55:10.809 --> 00:55:10.819
so I think it was subsidy driven if it
 

00:55:10.819 --> 00:55:13.029
so I think it was subsidy driven if it
wasn't industrialization okay to Eva's

fever I mean one of the interesting
 

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:16.059
fever I mean one of the interesting
thing is that beavers we have been

00:55:16.059 --> 00:55:16.069
thing is that beavers we have been
 

00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:19.150
thing is that beavers we have been
trying cautiously to reintroduce beavers

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160
trying cautiously to reintroduce beavers
 

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.400
trying cautiously to reintroduce beavers
I think it's a fantastic way in which we

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:21.410
I think it's a fantastic way in which we
 

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:23.410
I think it's a fantastic way in which we
could manage more sustainably our

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:23.420
could manage more sustainably our
 

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.329
could manage more sustainably our
riverine environments one of the

00:55:25.329 --> 00:55:25.339
riverine environments one of the
 

00:55:25.339 --> 00:55:27.460
riverine environments one of the
interesting things is that the

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:27.470
interesting things is that the
 

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:30.760
interesting things is that the
a major drag on beaver reintroduction

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:30.770
a major drag on beaver reintroduction
 

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:34.170
a major drag on beaver reintroduction
has been the deep caution of farmers and

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:34.180
has been the deep caution of farmers and
 

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.250
has been the deep caution of farmers and
understandably there are conservative

understandably there are conservative
 

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.500
understandably there are conservative
people but you know we need to awaken

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:38.510
people but you know we need to awaken
