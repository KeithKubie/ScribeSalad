00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.589
So, I have a script to work off of, to tell
you about directing.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.630
But what do you think we should do in this
video?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.670
Should I show you what a director does?

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.780
Should I explain everything a director does?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.030
Should I try to get you to guess what a director
does?

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.460
People often assume that the director has
all the answers, but directors ask a lot of questions.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.960
According to American Playwright and Filmmaker
David Mamet, directors only have two main

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.590
questions to ask themselves: What do I tell
the actors?

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.770
And where do I put the camera?

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.410
And that’s a cheeky way of encompassing
a lot of what the director should do.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.340
But maybe a better way of looking at it is
that the director has a strong sense of where

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.829
the answers are buried, and their job is to
steer their team to where they can uncover

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:37.829
those answers.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.710
That might sound a little foofy, but it’s
the clearest way I can describe what the job

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.710
of a director is.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.940
A director must use everything at their disposal
to clearly communicate to their actors, their

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.100
crew, and ultimately to us, the audience.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:01.059
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.679
A director’s job is to bring their vision
to life in the film.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.960
So, a common misunderstanding is that the
actors are just like puppets, illustrating

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.960
the director’s ideas.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.870
An actor’s job is to bring a character to
life.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.750
And we need actors to think real thoughts
and feel real feelings to make the film relatable.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.930
A good actor gives a director options, by
making informed choices about how a character

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.420
would act in the various situations that the
script puts them in.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.190
We’ve talked about the language of the camera,
and how the way in which shots are framed

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.360
can help convey a story.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.410
But the camera’s most important job is to
read the characters’ thoughts.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.860
For that to happen, actors have to be vulnerable,
and think as the character.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.030
This is incredibly demanding work, so it’s
up to the director to ensure that the actors

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.250
have a safe space to explore their characters
and take risks.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.890
And the actor relies on the director to steer
them in the right direction.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.150
I joked earlier about having you guess what
I would say in this video.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.250
That’s because forcing an actor into a position
where they’re unsure about how to act in

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.680
a scene is one way to ruin their performance.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.980
If an actor feels like they need to direct
themselves in a scene, they won’t risk

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.800
losing themselves in the world of the film,
and it’ll feel fake.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.850
To give an actor the confidence they need
to inhabit a character, a director must give

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.320
clear, actionable directions.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.320
What do I mean by that?

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.730
Well, let’s say we’re working on a scene
about a breakup.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.330
A clear, actionable direction could be, "Since
your character has been blind-sighted by this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.700
breakup, you want to keep the other person
from leaving the room so you can get answers."

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.351
The actor receiving this direction now knows
that their character has just learned that

00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:22.360
they were wrong about the other character,
and they have a goal of keeping the other

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.360
person there.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.850
They know where they’re coming from and
where they’re trying to go.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.390
Now, no matter what happens in the scene,
this actor can feel confident in their decisions

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.670
if they’re working toward keeping the other
person in the room.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.440
On the flip side of that, an unclear or non-actionable
direction in that breakup scene could be,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.980
“You wish this wasn’t happening and it
reminds you of when your parents got divorced.”

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.420
How do you act “wishing” or “being reminded”
of something?

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.620
That’s way too vague.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.060
But if the director knew what they wanted,
they could tell the actor something like,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.140
“You see this person as the father who left
you when you were 10 and, just like then,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.700
you’ll do anything to keep them here.”

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.150
So now this is a more actable note, because
our actor understands the power dynamic of

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.790
this relationship and knows that they’re
using the same tools a 10-year-old would.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.040
And, most importantly, the actor now has a
goal: “Keep the other person from leaving.”

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.401
So the director has a plan for how they’d
like the scene to go, and the actors will

00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.240
add their own interpretations to that, and
the hope is that they uncover the best possible scene.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.060
It is possible for a director to get the scene
they envision without allowing the actors

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.880
to do their work, but this doesn’t build
trust or create the conditions for a better

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.209
film than the director is capable of imagining.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.150
This is something author, and directing instructor
Judith Weston calls result-oriented directing,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.520
and it’s a common mistake of new directors
who are focused on the surface-level aspects

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.270
of acting instead of the true work that goes
into it.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.760
Instead of working with the actors to unpack
what the line means and what the purpose of

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.560
the scene is, a director will focus on outward
emoting and try to control how an actor does things.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.180
You may have heard directions like, “On
that line, laugh.”

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.599
or “When you see her, you start to cry.”

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.849
This tells the actor nothing about what their
character is actually thinking and feeling.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.870
A director might think they’re helping the
actor by telling them how they should say

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.240
the line or where they should put emphasis
in the line, but this is called a line reading,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.680
and it limits the actor to just mimicking
the director rather than communicating what

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.000
the character is feeling.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.310
A result-oriented direction will usually give
the director what they think they want in

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.410
that moment, but at a pretty high cost.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.770
These directors are only paying attention
to what the characters look like outwardly

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.840
instead of what’s going on in their minds.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.561
And when you’re working with a good actor
who’s thinking real thoughts, the camera

00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.130
-- and therefore the audience -- can pick
up on those thoughts.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.710
The result will be a deeper, more nuanced
performance than when the actor is just pantomiming

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.199
what the director tells them to do.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.900
It’s important to remember that filmmaking
is collaborative by design, and while the

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.100
director is the creative leader, insisting
the film turn out exactly like the director

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.000
imagines it will severely limit the film.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.410
Result-oriented directing can also break trust
that’s been built between director and actor.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.180
After all, if a director can’t trust an
actor to experiment and discover what’s

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.840
needed from a scene, then why should the actor
trust the director?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.850
The detrimental short-cut of line readings
can be avoided by making time for rehearsal.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.030
And rehearsal is a great way for the director
and actors to build trust.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.280
Some directors, like Sydney Lumet, are subtle
about it.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.810
Lumet would tell each person where to sit
at the first read through of a script.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.690
This made it clear to the actors that he had
a plan and was confident in his choices.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.590
Directors like Mike Leigh, are more overt
about building trust in rehearsal.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.300
Leigh purposely works with actors who are
willing to explore themes and ideas before

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.320
they even have a script.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.010
They work through proposed scenes together,
and then Leigh develops a script around what

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.889
they’ve uncovered together in the rehearsal
process.

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.740
By the time the cameras are rolling, the actors
have been living and growing as these characters,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.930
that they know how to approach every scene.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.850
From rehearsal to the final cut, a director’s
job always includes guiding the actors in

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.919
their roles and shaping those performances,
but the director also works with every creative

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:33.949
department on a film.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.820
That’s what Mamet calls “where to put
the camera,” but it involves much more than that.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.540
Just like with the actors, the director has
to deeply understand the other departments

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.919
so they can communicate clearly with everyone.

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.360
During pre-production, the director coaches
the location scouts on what the film needs

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360
in its setting.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.620
They work with the Production Designer, set
decorators, and props department to build

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.100
the world and orchestrate everything in the
mise en scene.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.960
And before the actors even get to set, the
director needs to understand the film’s

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.040
characters to communicate their personalities
and struggles to the costume designer.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.890
Both before and during filming, the director
works with the Hair and MakeUp and special

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.800
effects departments to perfect the details
of the storytelling.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.580
And yes, the director decides where to put
the camera.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.889
There are an infinite number of ways to make
a shot look cool or beautiful, but there is

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.620
usually one best way to shoot a scene when
you remember that every shot should be motivated

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.229
by what the scene is trying to convey.

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.520
What’s motivating the camera placement and
movement can be practical -- like, if you

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.620
need to show someone driving, we need to see
who it is, and also see that they’re in

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.620
a car.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.330
But how the director decides to use the camera
can also help us understand something about

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.880
the character or the themes of the film more
deeply.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.210
Starting in pre-production, the director and
cinematographer work together to design the

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.210
shot list.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.710
They’ll usually work with a storyboard artist
to illustrate what the shots will look like

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.639
and work off of the storyboards as a reference.

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.920
They can do this before the locations are
nailed down, and it’s possible to work on

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.760
it even before the actors are cast, because
what determines how a film is shot is that

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.020
blueprint we talked about before: the script.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.480
Just like every line of dialogue, every shot
should convey new information to the audience.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.639
We should be able to watch a film with the
sound off and still be able to intuit what’s

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.639
going on in the film.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.820
We should be able to know things like who
our protagonist is, what they want, what’s

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.630
standing in their way, and how they feel.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.490
Once we know what to tell the actors and where
to set the camera, there’s still one huge

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.270
job for the director left: Post production.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.540
Just like with all the other creative leads,
the director needs to communicate the story

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.960
with the editor and composers in order to
tell the best version of the story.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.180
The editing process introduces the final layer
of discovery for the director.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.360
The director is the guiding force in uncovering
the answers right up until the final cut.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.919
What the best version of the story is, depends
on the director and the film.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:34.820
While a director leads their team in unlocking
that best version, they’re also the decision

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.820
makers.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.250
They’re holding the whole film in their
heads, and actors, cinematographers, designers,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.680
editors, and composers all give the director
options they think are the right answers for

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.789
this film.

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:46.770
Then the director chooses which are the best.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.110
Depending on the size of the production, the
director might not be the one calling action

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.199
or cut, but the director is always the one
who says, “Yes, that’s what I want.”

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.520
Today we explored the director’s role as
a leader and creative guide for everyone else

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.860
working on the film.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.860
We learned the director must have a strong
vision and be able to communicate it clearly.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.389
And we talked about how one of the director’s
most important jobs is creating the safe space

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:10.169
for the rest of their team to do their creative
work.

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:13.180
One of those people is the cinematographer,
who we’ll talk about next time.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.460
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
