00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.310
We don't always round to
the nearest whole number.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.770
Let's say we have some
number like 3.5945.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.564
If we want to round but
we want more precision,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:16.760
we may round to the first, or the
second, or even the third decimal place.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.480
If I say let's round to the first
decimal place, the first thing we do

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.930
is find the first decimal place and
then look to the right of that.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.395
So, now we're looking at
the second decimal place.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.000
.And now,
we use the same rules as before.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.600
So, if it's 5 or greater, we round up.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.411
And if it's 4 or smaller,
we just keep it how it is.

00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:44.932
So, 3.5945 rounded,
to the first decimal place is 3.6.

00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:50.940
What do you think 3.5945 is rounded
to the second decimal place?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.980
