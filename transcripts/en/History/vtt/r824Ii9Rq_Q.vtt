00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.170
NARRATOR: Throughout
the world, there

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.674
are ancient traditions that
identify the center of the head

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:12.095
as being synonymous with
the center of the earth,

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.765
the center of the universe,
and the very center

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.852
of creation itself.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:22.564
This center is often
depicted as egg-shaped

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.650
and is identified in some
cultures as the third eye.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.906
There are multiple
cultures that point

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.367
us in this same direction.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.370
The Hindus have it is as
the third eye or the bindi.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.958
The Buddhists have the third
eye on Buddha's forehead.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.836
We see symbology in
Mesoamerica, which

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.882
seems to symbolize its ability
to contact and communicate

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.301
with the higher
spiritual realms using

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.889
this secret symbol that is
consistent throughout all

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.516
the major world religions.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:03.021
When you talk about the third
eye, it's about enlightenment.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.316
It's about this connection
to the great unknown

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.026
or the force of the universe.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.531
And we think that we are
separated from the world, when

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.826
in reality we are all connected
to every single object

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.495
in the universe.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:22.248
And that inherently means
that we are directly connected

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:28.087
to every extraterrestrial being
throughout the entire universe.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.881
[music playing]

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:33.218
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
the cosmic egg isn't only

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:37.722
a symbol for the universe or
how the universe was formed,

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:41.643
but represents a connection
that exists within each

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:45.772
and every human to the
cosmos, and possibly

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.941
to extraterrestrial
beings that came

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.861
to Earth in the distant past?

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:55.281
Ancient astronaut theorists
point out that while the third

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:58.868
eye has historically been
considered a metaphor,

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.037
there is an egg-shaped
structure within

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:03.748
the brain that is
critical in defining

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.543
what it means to be human--
the thalamus.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.882
Shaped like two identical
eggs, the thalamus

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.802
lies at the center of
the brain and is the hub

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.472
responsible for relaying
information from most

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.975
of the sensory receptors.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.854
Scientists studying the
effects of thalamic stimulation

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:28.439
on comatose patients
have recently

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.943
suggested the thalamus
might be the most important

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:36.573
factor in human consciousness.

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:39.158
HEATHER BERLIN: The thalamus
is like a relay station

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:40.869
in the brain.

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.329
So you have all the primary
sensory information coming in,

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.499
like information coming in
your eyes through your retina

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.334
and through your ears.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.086
And all these sensations,
the first place

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:53.047
they go after the
primary sense organs,

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:55.550
is they get funneled
to the thalamus.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.595
And then the thalamus
sorts out this information

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.597
and relays it to
the various ports

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:07.228
in the cortex that process that
primary sensory information.

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.814
If the thalamus is
damaged, usually it

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:13.401
will knock out consciousness.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.654
It's a very critical point where
all the information comes to,

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:20.325
and then it's distributed
in the cortex.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.536
WILLIAM HENRY: The thalamus is
called the lamp, the open eye,

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.413
even the third eye.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:29.292
And when you look at this,
you wonder, was it in fact

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:34.339
a gift from extraterrestrial
beings that awakened us?

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.425
That enabled us to become
connected to the divine

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:40.219
or extraterrestrial realm?

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.639
Perhaps the
extraterrestrials that

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.433
had a hand in fashioning
the human body

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.811
and tweaking the human brain
placed the thalamus there,

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.481
in its egg shape,
as a connecting link

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:56.653
to the greater civilization out
of which we originally emerged.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.363
[music playing]

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.240
NARRATOR: Could the thalamus
be the physical representation

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.995
of what ancient cultures
referred to as the third eye?

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:10.166
And if so, might this brain
structure act as a connection

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:13.962
to greater forces
in the universe?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.798
As incredible as
this notion may seem,

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:20.635
ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that the thalamus can

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.805
also be found represented
in one of the most prominent

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.724
symbols of ancient Egypt--

00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:27.892
the Eye Of Horus.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.439
DAVID CHILDRESS:
The Eye of Horus,

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:37.443
also known as the Eye of Ra,
was a symbol of protection,

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.530
royal power, and good health.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.575
But it was also known as
the Eye of Providence,

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:47.495
the all-seeing eye of God.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:51.249
Now, what is incredible is
if you look at the thalamus

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.711
and all of the structures
surrounding that,

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.547
it looks like the Eye of Horus.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:58.548
The similarity is really
pretty astonishing.
