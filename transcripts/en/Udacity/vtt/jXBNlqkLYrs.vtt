00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.730
Thinking about our answer to the last quiz for a general way of writing the

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:07.645
midpoint between any two points, what do you think is a good way to sum up what

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:11.650
we're actually doing when we find that? To find the midpoint between two points,

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:15.570
do we find half the distance in both directions? Do we add the corresponding

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:19.665
coordinates, the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two original points

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:20.502
together?

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:24.327
Do we take the average of those corresponding coordinates, or do we just find

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.097
the distance between the two points?
