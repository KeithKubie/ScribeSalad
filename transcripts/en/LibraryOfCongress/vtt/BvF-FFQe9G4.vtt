&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.300
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: So, well,
good afternoon everybody,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.540
and welcome to the African
and Middle Eastern Division.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.430
I'm Mary Jane Deeb, Chief of
the Division and I'm delighted

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.040
to see you here, for
our 29th Conversations

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.320
with African Poets and Writers.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.720
It's really exciting.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.260
I had the honor, the
pleasure this morning

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.820
of having a podcast
conversation with our guest,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.650
the Bushra al-Fadil, who
is the Caine Prize winner.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.500
And with our other guest who
will not be interviewed today,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.920
but who was just as
fascinating and exciting,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.600
Magogodi Makhene, who was there.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.650
And who is the runner-up
to the Caine Prize.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.510
Both did a wonderful interview.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.790
And this podcast will
also be available,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.570
accessible on the web
for you to listen to.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.470
And for anyone listening, that
would be accessible, as well.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.270
So, what I wanted to
say was the usual thing.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.570
Welcome to the Division, which
is made up of three sections.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.070
The African, the Middle
Eastern, and the Hebraic.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.340
The three sections collect,
recommend, serve materials

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.770
on our region, which constitutes
78 countries of the world.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.110
And many, many languages.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:14.050
Our stacks are full of materials
in many different languages.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.200
And we also serve
them with specialists,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.280
specialists who focus on these
countries with other languages,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.180
the culture, the people.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.810
And who are able to serve the
readers, our patrons who come,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.110
again, from all over the world.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.490
We do briefings.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.440
We do one on one assistance.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.830
We do programs, such
as this one.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.130
We have conferences.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.720
We have symposia.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.220
We have exhibits.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.710
And we keep everyone
on their toes.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.610
But today, I'd like
to say a few words

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.650
about the speakers
and what we do.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.740
The Caine Prize for African
Writing is a literature prize

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.360
awarded to an African writer

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.080
of a short story
published in English.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.870
The prize was launched
in 2000 to encourage

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.650
and highlight the richness and
diversity of African writing

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.930
by bringing it to a wider
audience internationally.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.630
The focus on the short story
reflects the contemporary

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.540
development of the African
short story tradition.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.850
A few years ago, we, in the
African Middle East Division,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.480
in partnership with the
Poet and Literature Center.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.980
And you will hear its
head in a few minutes,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.690
started a new program
that we call Conversations

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.740
with African Poets and Authors.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.060
The aim of which was to capture
in their own words the thoughts

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.090
and reflections on
contemporary African literature

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.450
of both established and new
award-winning directors.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.280
Our external partner
was the Africa Society

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.750
of the National Summit
on Africa.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.190
And again, you will hear

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.640
from its Executive
Director in a moment.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.780
And the Africa Society
supported us from outside

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.380
of the library spreading the
word, bringing in people,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.200
and supporting us in,
in numerous other ways.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.240
More recently, we've
had [inaudible]

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.370
of the African Studies Program

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.890
at Howard University
joining us as a partner.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.910
And so, we have anyway, the
library, the Africa Society

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.750
and a university as partners
to support this program,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.280
which has become
really an iconic series

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.380
on new and old writers.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:01.080
In March, 2014 we interviewed a
Nigerian author, Tope Folarin,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.900
the winner of the 2013 Caine
Prize for African Writing.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.340
We were so happy with the
program that we looked

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.380
into incorporating into our
series the subsequent Caine

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.070
Prize winners.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.750
And so, we did.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.050
The following, here,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.780
we interviewed Okwiri
Oduor from Kenya.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.550
And in 2016 Namwali
Serpell from Zambia.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.620
And last year, the 2016 winner,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.500
Lidudumalingani Mqombothi
from South Africa.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.300
So, every year we now
have a new partner.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.960
And the new partner
is across the ocean.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.710
So, we are expanding our, our
scope and bringing in partners

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.530
and speakers from
all over the world.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.500
Now, let me step down and
invite Patricia, who is here.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.610
And she's the Executive
Director of the Africa Society.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.910
Patricia.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.380
[ Applause ]

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.680
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine:
Good afternoon.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.440
So, I'm Patricia, and I'm the
President of the Africa Society,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.440
a nonprofit organization that
educates Americans about African

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.060
and advocates for African growth

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.230
and positions in
the United States.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.840
We are a proud partner
of this program,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.210
as Doctor Mary Jane
Deeb mentioned,

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.770
with the Africa section
of the, the African

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.930
and Middle Eastern
Division, and the Poetry

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.000
and Literature Centers at
the Library of Congress.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.180
And our newest member,
Howard University

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.500
and it's Africa Center.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.340
Today, we're excited to be here.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.060
For once again, to
feature another African

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.040
literary ambassador.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.260
That's our new expression
this morning.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.770
And Caine Prize winner for
2017, Doctor Bushra al-Fadil.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.960
All our organizations and
the partner organizations are

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.950
committed to providing
a platform

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.720
for African literary figures
and, and provide access

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.070
for everybody in the world.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.730
Because this will also be
where passed and be accessed

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.060
by everybody, I guess,
for eternity.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.970
And so, people will able to look
back and enjoy African poetry

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.930
and literature as much as we do.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.230
So, enjoy the program.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.360
I will ask our next
speaker and partner,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.460
Doctor Casper to take the stand.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.170
[ Applause ]

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.470
&gt;&gt; Doctor Robert Casper:
Thank you, Patricia.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.610
And much thanks to the Africa
Society of the National Summit

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.100
on Africa, and African and
Middle Eastern Division here

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.510
at the Library of Congress.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:59.600
Of course, I want to say thanks,
as well, to the Lannan Center

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.360
who helped create this program
over at Georgetown University,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.420
or who helped partner with
us to create this program

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.910
and bring the Caine
Prize winners

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.340
to the Library every year.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.290
We're also really excited about
the new partnership as Mary Jane

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.980
and Patricia discussed
with Howard University.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.280
So, it's been an honor
to work with everyone

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.350
to continue this series and
to feature African poets

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.810
and writers, and especially,
feature the Caine Prize winner.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.430
Before we begin, let me ask
you to do what I'm going to do.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.840
Which is to turn off your cell
phone and any electronic devices

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.140
that you have that might
interfere with this event.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.720
Second, please note
that, of course,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.730
this program is being recorded
for webcast and by participating

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.390
in Q and A, you give
us permission

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.000
for future use of the recording.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.930
Before I get to today's
prize winner,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.920
let me tell you a little
bit about the Poetry

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.620
and Literature Center.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.860
We are home to the U.S. Poet
Laureate, and we put on 20

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.420

like this one, each year.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.260

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:26.830
and Writers series, at
www.loc.gov/rr/amed.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.220
As Mary Jane said, the Library

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.040
of Congress has been hosting the
Caine Prize winners since 2014

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.610
with 2013 winner Tope Folarin.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.630
We are thrilled to
extend this same welcome

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.080
to the current winner,
Bushra al-Fadil,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:50.400
chosen out of 148 entries
from 22 African countries.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.400
Bushra is the first
Arabic speaking winner

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.800
of the Caine Prize.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.450
At 65, he is also the
oldest prize winner.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.760
The Chair of Judges, Nii Ayikwei
Parkes, announced the winner

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.130
of the 10,000 pound prize at
an award dinner last July,

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.450
held for the first time
in Senate House, London.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:16.290
Parkes said of the prize-winning
story, quote, ''Rooted in a mix

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.080
of classical traditions, as
well as the vernacular contexts

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.690
of its location,
Bushra al-Fadil's story,

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.310
''The Girl Whose
Birds Flew Away''.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.700
Is at once a very modern
exploration of how,

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.520
assaulted from all
sides and unsupported

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.460
by those we would
turn to for solace,

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.010
we can become mentally
exiled in our own lands.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.930
Edging into a fantasy existence
where we seek to cling to a sort

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.350
of freedom until, ultimately,

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.980
we slip into physical exile.''
Bushra al-Fadil has published

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.800
four collections of
short stories in Arabic.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.420
His most recent, ''Above a
City's Sky'', was published

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:04.510
in 2012, the same year he
won the al-Tayeb Salih Short

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.500
Story Award.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.980
Bushra holds a Ph.D. in
Russian language and literature.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.580
He resides in Saudi
Arabia, Saudi Arabia

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.410
and he was a university
professor before he was expelled

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.190
from his native Sudan
in the early 1990's.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.830
Bushra wrote the story of ''The
Girl Whose Birds Flew Away''

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.350
in 1979, but it was
only translated

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.700
and published into
English in 2016.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.090
We are so grateful it was.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.510
Please, join me in
welcoming Bushra al-Fadil.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:57.420
[ Applause ]

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.570
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil:
I talk with the.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.890
Good evening.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.810
Thank you, Robert Casper.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.270
And thank you, Patricia
and Mary Deeb.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:14.540
And Marieta Harper,
and your division.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.460
Of course, it is a very
nice opportunity for me.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.010
This is maybe the second
major opportunity to after,

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:28.670
after the Caine Prize to talk
here in the Library of Congress.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.130
I write fiction in Arabic

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:36.720
and the first short story
collection I was taught here,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.200
was written in the
70's [inaudible] year,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.800
in the 70's, 1979.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.540
And I feel language Arabic,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.900
writing in Arabic is a very
[inaudible] not only from,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.330
the other world,
but in Africa, too.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.060
Because people from Ghana, from
Nigeria, from South Africa,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.130
Kenya, and Ethiopia, I
went and visited them.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:06.790
Feel that they are cut from
the different cultures.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.330
Not because of tribes.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.670
In Sudan and other, Sudan
we have no problem regarding

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.970
the tribes.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.060
We feel all as one, as
one Sudanese community.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.410
But the tribes are in the
thousand, the part of those.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.340
But the language,
because I write in Arabic.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.080
Writing in Arabic also have
another problem, that you have

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.780
to read the heritage
of the Arabic language,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.450
which is deep rooted in history.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.750
And before Islam
and after Islam.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.310
And you, you have to
read the [inaudible]

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.780
of it show the Arab countries.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.250
But as a standard,
Arabic is understood

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.100
in every country of the Arabs.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.490
And when I, I write
my famous collection,

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.280
I wrote about social
life in Sudan.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.170
Problems that face Sudanese
community and people.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.130
Especially, women.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:03.050
And this short story was
speaking about it, I think,

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.600
to speak about it
in the marketplace.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.640
But I have coined words in, in
Arabic language, which is known

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.940
to Sudanese people, now.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.240
Like the word [foreign
language].

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.530
I, I mean with it, by it the
people who has authorities

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.020
to kill, and then people laugh

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:22.870
after listening to
what happened to.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:29.020
The action, the trial
coming that happens.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.540
So, I did find a word in Arabic,
I coined [foreign language],

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.340
and then it is now famous
in Sudan for readers

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.220
that you can coin words.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.120
I coin words for in a novel
called ''The Locust Symphony''.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.140
How the locusts can sing
without voice, of course.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:52.340
And I, I wrote, I wrote in the
first period about social life.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:58.440
Then, when we have political,
political difficulties

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.690
and governments,
military governments,

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.700
I wrote about animals.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.510
Not as symbols, but you
read this, the holy story

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.220
about animal [inaudible]
my country.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.670
Now, I am trying to
write in my latest works

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.970
about science fiction.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.510
Something similar
to science fiction.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.970
I said to myself, I can't
write science fiction,

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.840
because science fiction
should be known to people

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.710
who are living in countries

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.930
where there is industries,
developed, and so on.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.140
But I write something
similar to it.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:37.760
So, as to avoid saying science
fiction and, and, and with it,

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.960
you speak about a country, too.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.240
My latest novel is
called ''2084''

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.130
and I'm imitating George
Orwell in the name.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.490
But the speaking about
what is going to happen

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.900
in my country after
60 or 80 years.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.540
I'm influenced in my
writings by so many people.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.250
In secondary school we
were influenced by writers

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:09.070
like Mark Twain, when we read
Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.330
We were influenced in England
by writers like Oscar Wilde

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.760
and so many, so many writers.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.060
Regina Wolfe.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.800
I can't, I'm not going
to mention all of them.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.850
But in the university,
I'm influenced

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.310
by Dashevsky [assumed
spelling] and [inaudible],

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.380
so that is the reason why
I started Russian language.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.350
So, I read them in, in Russian.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.010
Thank you, very much.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.510
[ Applause ]

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:43.970
[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.180
Yes, she asked to read, I
was asked to read a little

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.600
from the short story or
for many in the room.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.080
Yes. But I'm short sighted,
so it's a short story read

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.380
by a short [inaudible].

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.600
The story of the, the story

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.240
of ''The Girl Whose
Sparrows Flew Away''.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.500
I'm going to, to read the
version that is translated

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.800
by us, my friend [inaudible],

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.950
not by Shmookler,
who the story won't.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:16.060
Because there are a
little bit differences,

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.060
there are little differences
in the stories there.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.020
He said, like the
Bedouin who visited,

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.810
visited the town
for a second time.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.950
But I wrote it in Arabic like
the turban of the Bedouin

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.840
who visited the town
for the second time.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.150
Because the turban of the
Bedouin moves from left to right

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.090
or from this side to that side,
when he come to his people

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.500
to tell them what
he saw in town.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.780
The turban will make
an image of a smile.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.850
The second scene
is like a salad.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.530
I will read it, I will read
my, the version [inaudible].

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:54.680
The story of ''The Girl
Whose Sparrows Flew Away''.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.900
Like a sharp knife I was cutting
through a crowd of people,

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:05.300
a strange mixture that would
not fit together, even on a bowl

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.480
of assorted green salad.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.970
Beggars, butchers, thieves,
hoppers, religious canters,

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:21.570
rigid soldiers, comers and
goers, comers and goers, flabby,

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:27.480
emaciated, emaciated,
hookers, vagrants, and brokers.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.660
Standing passengers,
[inaudible],

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:35.650
dressy and vainglorious
in the midst of those

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:39.860
with elected representatives
who chased women

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.260
with their eyes,
hands, and bodies.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.110
And those among them
who were unable

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:51.680
to respond physically would
resort to daydreaming.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.530
I was piercing through the
crowd like a sharp knife,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:00.900
causing a sudden pain in
a soldier, in a shoulder,

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.310
followed with, ''Excuse me''.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:08.020
A wound on a foot,
preceded with, ''Sorry'',

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.690
and a punch in a face
accompanied with,

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.990
''Forgive me''.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:18.310
It was too abs, I was
too absentminded to wait

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.310
for a response on my apologies.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.110
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper:
Good afternoon.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.890
I'm Marieta Harper,
Area Specialist

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.290
in the African Section.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:25.990
Can you hear me better, now?

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:30.560
Okay. That's Marieta Harper

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.900
in the African Section,
Area Specialist here.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:46.110
I'm going to [inaudible] to
some questions [inaudible]

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.570
that I, that I read.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.580
And see how the two
mesh [inaudible]

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.370
translations [inaudible].

00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:07.160
I'm going to really begin
talking generally about your,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.390
asking about your
experiences here.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:19.830
And when you started writing
and why did you turn to novels

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.410
as a meaning of expression.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.730
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: I
started writing early

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.420
in secondary school poetry.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.510
I didn't write anything
in short stories.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:40.400
And writing poetry, writing
poetry I didn't find,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.800
I didn't find that the
political movements in Sudan,

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.780
if captured in the cities
and schools I would,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.800
rooms for to read,
to not be allowed

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.950
to each party, each place.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.810
So, I, I, my poetry was
kept, kept in my drawers.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:06.010
And then, I tried to
publish short stories.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.500
So, the, the, the, the,
the story of ''The Girls

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.720
Who Bird Flew Away'' was
the second short story

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.070
that is published in
[inaudible] in 1972.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.850
The first story was called
the [foreign language],

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.880
about a person called Abdul
Guillaume [assumed spelling]

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.670
that's raised from his grave to
make revenge on what happened

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.210
to him in life, and so on.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:33.910
Is the first story.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.210
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper:
And reading further

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:44.480
on about the descriptions
that I read in your story

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:50.190
of ''The Girl Whose Birds
Flew Away'', it, it, it,

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:55.610
I wanted to find
out you, how do you,

00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:02.210
how do you describe how you read
the various literary Sudanese

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.790
expressions from the
prehistoric Islamic poetry

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:12.690
into your own award
winning piece?

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.740
Your story of ''The Girl
Whose Birds Flew Away'',

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:21.760
which it's, it's very melodic.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.060
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yeah.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:28.260
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: As
I read it in your book.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.150
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yeah.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:36.020
In, in the short story, when
you find images like this,

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.370
the narrator says I love
her and she loves me.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.830
And her she camel
loves my camel.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:49.950
This is from a verse from
[inaudible] Islam poetry.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.630
Poetry before Islam,
[foreign language].

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:58.240
But this, I, I wrote
it in prose but it was

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.730
in a pre-Islamic poetry.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:09.280
And I can, I can derive from
all cultures, from all cultures.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.680
Even in the short story I
found a version like this

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.430
from a Russian proverb.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.910
The Russian proverb is sound
like this, [foreign language].

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:25.770
Or it's a word that is a
word, famous word in Russian,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:30.330
[foreign language], means keep
your tongue behind your teeth.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.840
So, I wrote it, I wrote
it in Arabic and Sudanese.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.250
And so many people
said, where is it from?

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.540
It is from that it came.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.020
And so many, so many phrases
from different readings,

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.430
and even from, from quantum
physics now in my work,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.740
when the particle is here

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.670
and they are the same
time like I write.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.780
I write it in a sort of way,
the findings of the physics

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.170
for a second, everywhere,
in fiction.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:04.000
Not only the heritage of
Islamic, pre-Islamic Arabic.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.300
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Yeah.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.060
Are, you do most of
your writing in Arabic.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:14.410
And can you share with us
the experience you're having

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.820
with your work being
translated in English from,

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.310
we knew of one translation?

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:24.440
But we find that you
had other translations

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.080
in the same new language,
as opposed to Arabic.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.110
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yeah,
the translation opens for me,

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.410
I said, this horizon

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.520
of contacting the main cultures
worldwide, and of course,

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.200
those African colleagues
write in English.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.910
And I will, I'm now,
I'm now working hard

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.060
to make translations
for my short story.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.770
There were five notation, I have
two novels, and have book of,

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.740
of poetry and other writings.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.090
But I should have to write.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:26:01.170
Now, we are trying
to translate a novel.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.990
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: I guess
I should really mention to,

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.920
to Bushra that most

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.560
of the audience here have
not had the opportunity to,

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.860
to read your material,
because it's so new.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.160
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yeah.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.680
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: We will
have books here, on sale,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.680
copies of the book,
so that you can see.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.790
So, they can really
understand my comments.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.090
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yes.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.390
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper:

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:37.470
And experience the actual
reading, your material.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:41.240
I had a question.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:48.640
Refer to how do you describe
contemporary lit, the literary,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.660
contemporary literary
scene in Sudan?

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:57.270
And how do you relate
to it, although we know

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.710
that [inaudible] you traveled.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.010
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yes.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.310
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: For a while.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.610
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: I have.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:04.910
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: In Sudan.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.210
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yes.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.510
I have relations with various
writers and poets in Sudan

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.810
from various generations.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.070
And I have teachers, of course.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.980
My teachers, like Dave Salis
[assumed spelling] [inaudible]

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.670
migration to the north.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.970
I know him, personally.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:20.300
And another professor who
wrote about the first story

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.600
that I wrote, [inaudible],
that [inaudible].

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.950
He wrote in [inaudible] critical
that he highlight for me.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.440
Sudan is [inaudible]
in Sudanese,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.500
dialect is Sudanese
Arabic dialect.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.900
Poetry made a breakthrough
[inaudible] our famous poets

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.200
on this regard.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.950
One of them, even,
was celebrated here

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.020
in the [inaudible]
Sharif and [inaudible].

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.520
Famous in writing in Sudanese.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.130
Sudanese colloquial Arabic.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.610
Also, there are Sudanese who
are writing in standard Arabic.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.630
And there are Sudanese who
are writing in English.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.350
And Sudanese who are
writing prose and,

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.930
and fiction short
stories and others.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:13.340
So, unfortunately, the,
the, the, the, the media

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.650
and the publishing
houses in Sudan are weak

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.760
and we publish mainly in
Lebanon or other countries.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.020
And the media is not, does
not allow chances for us.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:35.370
For instance, when I won the
[inaudible] Prize in 2012,

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.750
all the people who went
from the Arab [inaudible],

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.310
it's a famous prize in Sudan,
a famous prize in Sudan,

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.520
the [inaudible] Prize
for fiction.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.380
All the winners who
came from Morocco, from,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.160
they let them enter, enter
[inaudible] except me.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:59.090
They didn't allow me to enter, I
was deported out of my country.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:02.820
So, the people asking,
why are you not with us?

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.380
And they don't know that
the government over there,

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:13.460
people who are security, or my
name was written as blacklisted,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.610
fired from that university
and work [inaudible].

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.160
So, problems like this.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.530
When I go to the TV,
they don't allow you.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.080
There was an Egyptian writer,

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.670
they didn't allow me
to enter with him.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.120
In the university,
they didn't allow me.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.500
And things like this
happened to many writers

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.290
who have views against
governments.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.230
Let us speak our
military government.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.770
Yes, let us speak frankly.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.770
And this is why, this is
why you have such problems.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.070
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Oh, okay.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.310
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil:
But, but nevertheless,

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.330
Sudan, she is very rich.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.250
And there will come time
people will know it translated

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.550
or not translated.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.120
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Okay.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.890
I have one, this is
my last question.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.500
How has the Sudanese literary
tradition been affected

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:14.180
by western and American
literary traditions?

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.270
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil:
It is affected a lot

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.750
because we have the
English [inaudible]

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.650
from the, from, for 56 years.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:29.310
Yes. From 19, from 19,
from 1899 'till 1855.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.880
And the universities,
[inaudible] college

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.840
and the colleges are
teaching in English

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.280
and everything in English.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.510
That when we enter into
studying English the first year,

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.810
we studying English.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:43.700
Yes. I can, I can now
revise for you this version.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.180
The first year, and
second intermediate school.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.740
Where is it going,
the big British ship?

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.310
Where is it going
out down to sea?

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.780
It is going to India,
China, [foreign language].

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.830
And this should be the bus
and the train and the plane

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.130
and this is in book, too.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.430
Our British from Britain
[foreign language].

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:05.230
In a discussion like this
I revise it in my heart.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.530
If there is discussion
like this,

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.270
so they give us everything.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:14.100
The literature, the
books, the readers,

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.880
[foreign language], you know.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.000
Yes. Charles Dickens
and all this big about,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.230
about PBS and still, and this.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.180
All this [inaudible]
and everything.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:31.630
So, the heritage is huge, coming
from simplified big cities

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.880
to the books of and volumes.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.240
William Shakespeare.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.480
The lectures in Khartoum
University are from England.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.950
They taught us the ballads.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.750
They taught us the history

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.460
of their English
literature and American.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.380
I said to you, in secondary
school we studied Tom Sawyer

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.930
and Huckleberry Finn
and studied Mark Twain.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.820
And all those people.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.170
But I by, for myself, I
studied Russian literature.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.470
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Great.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.770

great, great, for many people.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.230
For many people.

For many Sudanese writers.

the best influence was

you characterize [inaudible]

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.050
Sudanese literature?

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.800
How is unique?

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.360
How is it different, let's
say, from Moroccan, or Saudi,

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.520
or Egyptian, Lebanese?

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.330
They all write in
the same language,

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:16.070
but there is always a uniqueness
about that literature.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.720
How would you describe the
literature in Sudan to be?

Though we write.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.900
Thank you, professor.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.720
Though we write in Arabic,
but we are not Arabs.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.190
I, I identify myself
a Nubian Sudanese.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.560
Not Arab. We are not Arabs.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.800
But Arabs, they say,
you are Arabs.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.490
You see. But we say,
we are Sudanese

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.710
and we write about our culture.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.010
About our heritage.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:47.470
We have a deep rooted in
history, heritage of Nubians.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.320
A book was written
by [inaudible].

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:55.600
A literature about the pharaohs
from, pharaoh from Sudan.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.650
Sudan kings who ruled Egypt

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.260
and the ancient history
7,000 years ago.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.220
We have pyramids, we have around
about 40 pyramids in Sudan.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.680
But they are small
pyramids and not known,

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.320
but not because they are small.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.640
But because even not highlighted
by the, by multimedia.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.840
And the, the Sudanese culture
is a mixture of all this

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.590
and African, African
heritage that is very deep.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:30.120
And we have from the, the, the,
the, the history of, of Arabs.

All this mixture makes
something different.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.610
It is not like in
Morocco, not like in Egypt.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.430
It is Sudanese Africa.

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:46.010
Africa was Arabic influenced.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.270
I have a question for you.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:08.440
If you could give any
advice, we're always thinking

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:19.210
about the next generation
because in African literature,

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.630
I'm sure we've lost [inaudible].

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:26.940
We could have a full original
work that we don't have,

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:34.720
that we don't have access to
those that came before us.

But we have, you know, giants
like you who are here now.

what would you say to them?

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.430
And then, out of curiosity,
why, why were you interested

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:55.380
in African, I mean,
in Russian literature?

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.460
Why Russian literature?

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.300
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: At that
time, I believe I start

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.570
to answer from this last one.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.770
At that time, I believe there
is a spear, [inaudible] the head

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:08.590
of a spear of literature,
where is it at that time.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.380
At that time, I thought
it was [inaudible].

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:16.460
They wrote something so critical
connected with the culture

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.070
of my problems of my country.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.280
You of course, we read,
we read before that,

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.240
all the heritage I thought
which we gave to schools or in

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.390
and books, in book
shops of that western.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:35.510
Yes, you can read, but
you know if you can read,

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:36.810
all these people [inaudible]

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.970
and you read them
and you follow their.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:44.900
But, but the Russian, for
me, the Russian at that time,

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.980
Anton Chekhov, he wrote things
that influenced me a lot.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.280
And Dostoyevsky.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.200
Something deeply, deeply,
deeply influenced my psychology.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.380
My psychology at
then, at that time.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.680
Now, I see the spear.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.660
The spear is that
in Latin America.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.140
Now, Latin America [inaudible].

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.760
When I read things like when
he is making his, his writings

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.240
about the, the patriarch,
you know, this, or this,

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.010
or the great Puman
[phonetic], the great,

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.150
the funeral of the
great Puman law.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.370
You feel things are
for your country,

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.670
in your country influence.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.970
This is why I think
always I have

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.270
to follow the spear,
where is it.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.570
Of course, in America, there
are, there are great writers.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.870
But we have to be
acquainted with them

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.170
to know them, also,
in our country.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.470
Now, regarding the,
regarding the first part.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:27.770
The younger, so how
to advise them.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.070
Young people, now,
are communicated

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.370
by multimedia better
than we advise by anyone.

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.670
They can do it themself,
by themself.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:32.970
They can write, and
they are writing

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.270
so it will go the second
day worldwide, if they like.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.570
So, they are, their languages
are, are better than us.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:36.870
Yeah.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker: [inaudible]
have a question.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.940
Earlier you referenced
science fiction.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.930
And I wanted to ask
you about Afrofuturism

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:48.490
and the younger writers
who are coming along.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.700
Because we get the Afrofuturism

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.490
and science fiction are
nothing new to African culture,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.440
because we've always had
the seriousness [inaudible],

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.740
etcetera.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.260
But you see some of the
younger writers, now,

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.180
delving into science fiction

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:08.300
with a particularly
African perspective.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:17.340
Do you see that as a coming
movement among African writers?

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.650
You know, the African writers
and then, African literature?

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:21.950
Thank you.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:23.250
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yes,
may be there is a influence

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:27.490
of worldwide that the shares
communication with writers all

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.860
over the world with critics.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.210
And so, I believe that
generations learn,

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.210
not from their teachers,

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.700
not from their lecturers
in the university.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.400
They learn from each other.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.010
Somebody told me that
if, if the, if the,

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:50.720
if there is a new drug
or medicine to, to,

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:56.720
to kill the rats,
the, the, the mouses,

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:02.130
mouses in Africa the mouse, the
mouses, the generation of mouses

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:06.100
in Japan will, will, will know
about it without communcations.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.610
Yes, without communication.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:13.230
So, there is something, there is
something in the, in generation

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.370
that is taught not by
lecturers, not by teachers,

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.810
not by fathers, or parents.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:21.170
But I don't know it is telepathy
or something like this.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:24.460
It like what happened to
the mice, yes, the mice.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.750
Why they [inaudible] away from
the places where they kill them.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:31.270
Yes. And I, I, I myself
witnessed something like this.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.810
For instance, I will
tell you this.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:42.130
Once I have my younger brother
when I was study in university.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:47.330
He's 12 years old, who flew
from his house, from our house,

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.760
and my mother was
in another place.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.060
Another city.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.360
Yes, my mother worried a lot.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.660
I, I, I, I came from
an [inaudible] city,

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.680
talking to a person, I said,
oh, oh, let me please go.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.090
And I went to the bus
station and waited.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.690
Looked like this.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:39:59.990
Came a bus.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:01.290
A yellow bus.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:05.250
And came out of this
bus, my younger brother.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.180
Weeping, and not knowing
any place in Khartoum.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.660
How, how, how do I know this?

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.640
I think I know it by telepathy.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.940
From my mother.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.240
She sent me a message.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.540
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Okay.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Any more questions?

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.510
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: And
this happened, really.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:27.360
[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.160
So, science fiction, so as to
answer is like this influenced

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.500
by the worldwide generation.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.220
But I don't write
science fiction.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.710
Is something similar to.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:42.110
I can give you a brief
image of what I am writing.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.180
Yes.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:49.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker: I think
maybe you said identified

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.490
this [inaudible].

00:40:50.490 --> 00:41:08.700
When you talk about what's going
on now, currently, in Sudan,

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:17.940
most writers, how,
how do they live,

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.390
how do they write
under the regime?

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.650
How do they express themselves?

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.520
How do they, how do
they communicate?

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.160
Are they successful?

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.460
Are they, really, you
know, the oppressed?

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.600
What is coming up
in Sudan, currently,

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.370
in terms of literature?

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.990
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil: Yes, about.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:41.290
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: He
wants to know the kind

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:45.130
of literature that's coming
out of Sudan, right now.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.430
&gt;&gt; Bushra al-Fadil:
[inaudible] both kind.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.970
There, there are a
lot, the majority

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:50.270
of Sudan is writers, now.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.290
Speaking about these
values, which are university.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:42:00.650
The values of democracy, yes,
of the freedom of speech.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.260
The, the quality, the, the
relation with the, the,

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:10.880
with the other women,
men and women, and so.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.420
A lot of people are influenced

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.010
by so many things
in the worldwide.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:21.770
And if we have a community
here, in, in, in the U.S.,

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:26.590
we have a community and like
I say, now, I am invited

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.430
to do lectures in Arabic
for them in two places, now.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:35.040
For, and, and I, I'm willing
to do it in two places

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.340
on the third in [inaudible].

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.480
One on the sixth
before I return home.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.020
All of them, all of them are
speaking about these values.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.260
The similar value that
everybody speaking about like,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.690
like the same as
the American values.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.950
Yes. But the problem of, of,

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:53.010
of regimes that are military
government are learning

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.310
how true.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.120
The officer is trained
how to, to fight.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.020
But when he comes
through he can,

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.130
can use his training to rule.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:06.130
And there are, would
be a lot of problems.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:09.170
For instance, the
ministry of culture

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.870
in Sudan will not allow
this book to be published

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:17.220
or that book to be
published, they interfere.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.420
We have such problems.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:25.660
The Freedom to Write Committee,
here in the U.S. made, for me,

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.470
an event, a culture
[inaudible] event.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:32.880
And that's, that event
was in 19 I think 94.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.720
And there was another poet,
his name is Mahroof Sharif.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.550
Mahroof Sharif, at that
time, was in prison.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:43.320
And I, I was fired from work.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.620
I lost my work.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.760
For that reason, they made
solidarity to fight, to,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.560
to committee in the U.S.
And they, I don't know

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.450
from where did they know my
address in Saudi, Arabia.

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:58.120
So, they found, phoned me
and said, ''We are going

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.450
to make a Sudan event.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:05.100
You are going to read your
short story and very strangely,

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.850
two of the same stories.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.910
The story of the girl
whose, whose bird flew away.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.730
And it was translated
by an American Arab,

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.040
an Arab from the region.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.340
I didn't read it.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.640
I didn't read it, why?

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.940
Because they said, we are
going to send you the tape.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.240
And they didn't send
me the tape.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.540
So, I, I, I asked them and asked

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.840
and I remember the
coordinator, now, and his name.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.140
I'm not going to say
the coordinator, now.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.440
Yes. And but, the other
poet, the other poet with me

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.740
on the night, they
sent him, not the tape.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.040
Ten thousand dollars.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.340
And I said to him, ''Mahroof,

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.640
did they send you the
tape?'' He said, ''No.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.940
They sent me $10,000 and
I will have a house.'' So,

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.240
at that time, I felt
[inaudible].

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.540

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.840

give this one to you.

Bushra. It's been a, a
wonderful conversation with you

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:48.680
about literary scene in Sudan.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.000

[inaudible] look like this.
