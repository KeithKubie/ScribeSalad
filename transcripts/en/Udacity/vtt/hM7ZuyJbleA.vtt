Hi! I'm going to be guiding you through the coding

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.560
portions of this course. You're going to start out by

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.850
deploying a very simple app, engine application that uses

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.320
Endpoint to expose its API to clients. Then you're

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.880
going to learn how to define Endpoint functions and how

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.860
to call them from the webpage, using JavaScript and

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.130
the Google JavaScript Client Library. Then you'll learn about

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.780
the Google APIs Explorer, which is a really cool tool.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.820
Not only let's you explore the Google public

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.350
APIs, it let's you test out the APIs in

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.220
your own application. As you work through this course

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.870
you're going to be building up an application called Conference

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.600
Central, which let's users schedule and query for

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.245
conferences. And you're going to be focusing on implementing the

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:49.950
back-end functionality. Just like on a cooking show, where

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.730
they bake the cake for you ahead of time,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.320
and take it out of the oven ready baked,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.160
we've written some of the code for you. Particularly the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.810
boilerplate code, so that you can get straight to work

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.190
writing the code that really matters. You're going to start

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.690
out by downloading the starting version of Conference Central

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.620
for this lesson. And building it up as you go

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.680
from lesson to lesson. But, at any point, if you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.300
don't complete the exercises, you don't need to worry because

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.840
we provide starting code for you, to help you out, every

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.940
stage along the way. Come on, then. Let's go write some code.
