00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:20.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello, and
welcome to "YouTube Developers

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.040
Live." We have an exciting
show for you today.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.870
In this studio, I have
Jeremy Walker.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.350
JEREMY WALKER: Hello.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How are
you doing, Jeremy?

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.830
JEREMY WALKER: I'm doing well.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Long
time, no see, man.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.560
JEREMY WALKER: I know.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And I am very
happy to tell you that we

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.890
have exciting guests coming
from far today.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.160
We have Tim Wintle.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.620
TIM WINTLE: Hi.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How
are you doing, Tim?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.940
TIM WINTLE: Yeah.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.683
I'm very well.

00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:39.780
Thanks.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.000
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Where are
you visiting us from?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.340
TIM WINTLE: I've flown
in from the UK.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.600
And Matias Molinas.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.290
MATIAS MOLINAS: Hi.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.455
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How are
you doing, Matias?

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:48.055
MATIAS MOLINAS: Fine.

00:00:48.055 --> 00:00:49.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And
where are you from?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.070
MATIAS MOLINAS: From
Argentina.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.715
From Latin America.

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:51.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.850
So this is going to be
an exciting show.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.490
What we wanted to cover is tell
you a little bit about

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.620
our Google Developer Expert
Program and then chat with Tim

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.580
and Matias about their
experience with YouTube APIs

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.990
as well as tell us a little bit
more about the community

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.400
in the UK and Argentina,
respectively.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.660
So let's get into it.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.030
Some of you might have heard
about our Google Developers

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.730
Expert Program, and I'm very
proud to announce that we have

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.520
two developer experts right
now for YouTube APIs.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.300
We're looking for more, so if
you're excited about YouTube

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.920
API, please get in touch.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.380
And why don't we start
with you, Tim.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.990
So Tim, you mentioned you
are from the UK, right?

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.890
TIM WINTLE: Yeah.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And how
did you get started

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.985
with YouTube APIs?

00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:43.130
TIM WINTLE: So we initially--

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.900
I needed to collect data around
kind of how much videos

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.220
had been viewed and all kind
of information around it.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.160
And we kind of looked at
scraping YouTube, which

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.750
quickly we discovered in terms
of service kind of say, you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.060
can't do that.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.030
And so eventually, we found
the APIs, and I started

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.800
looking at that.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.530
And then I just found the groups
and ended up posting

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.470
quite a lot on there.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.560
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And was that
a site project or was it a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.625
work project?

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.030
TIM WINTLE: It is actually
a research project.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.170
We got funding.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.460
It was kind of working
with the same

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.455
company I work at now.

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:23.300
Well, in fact, it's developed
into that company.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: What
do you do for work?

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.410
TIM WINTLE: So I work at an
ad network called Viral Ad

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.290
Network in the UK.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.140
We have a lot of kind of YouTube
content that we put

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.950
out through our ad network.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.160
And we kind of track engagement
with us and we use

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.940
the Player API a lot to
make sure that we know

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.610
what's going on.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.370
And we do some custom builds for
ads and things like that.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool
About you, Matias.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.740
What got you into
YouTube APIs?

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.370
MATIAS MOLINAS: Well, I
am GDG organizer tool.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.980
So I begin to make some session

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.960
about the YouTube APIs.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.710
And I have my company tool.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.230
And I've been to working out on
my own product that I use

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.690
YouTube API v3 experimental
away.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.600
And I made two open-source
projects.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.370
And I try to provide session
with different kind of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.640
articles, and projects
in my situation.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.275
So this is the way that I've
come to use the API.

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:32.900
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And you
mentioned you also involved in

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.300
the Google Developers,
group community.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.780
Which city?

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.440
MATIAS MOLINAS: In Santa
Fe and in Argentina.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.570
We have several GDG groups
in Argentina and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.870
in all South America.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.900
Well, I work with the GDGs from
another service and in

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.700
other countries from
Latin America.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.020
While I made sessions in Santa
Fe or via Hangout in another

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.220
city or in other countries, I
talk about the YouTube API.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.380
And Tim, back to you.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.290
Where in UK do you live?

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.880
TIM WINTLE: So I actually live
in the Northwest now.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.050
When I first started working
with YouTube, I was living in

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.544
the southwest.

00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:21.029
And so I've kind
of moved about.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.490
I think there is a local sort of
Google Developer Group that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.400
used to be in Gita, but I've not
managed to make it there.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.740
And it's not quite made
it across to--

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.452
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:38.050
TIM WINTLE: --to the UK or
has not become big like

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.240
it is in the US.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.630
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.010
Great.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.810
Well, we'll fix that.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.600
So a couple of questions
about your personal

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.960
preferences, if I may.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.240
So what's your favorite
programming language?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.860
TIM WINTLE: I work
in Python a lot.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.980
I like dynamic languages, so
yeah, I use a lot of Python,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.360
and C, and JavaScript.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.770
C is obviously the one that
stands out differently.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.900
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.730
I rarely see Python
and C and dynamic

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.880
languages in the same sentence.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.170
But--

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.830
TIM WINTLE: You can do object
orientated C. You just need to

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.500
have standards for it.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And I guess in
Python, it's pretty common

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.340
to build libraries and
then wrap them in

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.232
Python code, right?

00:05:18.232 --> 00:05:18.680
TIM WINTLE: Yeah.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.380
And just optimize the kind of
just the loops that really

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.770
need to be optimized instead
of writing the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.815
whole thing in C++.

00:05:26.815 --> 00:05:29.750
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And are you a
client library guy or do you

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.182
prefer use REST APIs directly?

00:05:34.182 --> 00:05:41.290
TIM WINTLE: So since if you've
been following the YouTube

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.760
APIs, it's kind of all
gone to OAuth 2.0.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.790
Since OAuth 2.0 came out, I've
started using the client

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.100
libraries, because you
kind of have to.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.060
It's very difficult not to.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.030
But before that, I was making
the REST requests myself and

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.560
doing auths and stuff.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: With
client login.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.210
TIM WINTLE: Sometimes, yeah,
which you shouldn't use now as

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.695
we've been hosting a lot.

00:06:08.695 --> 00:06:09.520
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Definitely.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.570
OAuth is the way to go.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.760
TIM WINTLE: But actually,
there's a few ways that aren't

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.360
quite documented,
if you'd like.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.120
If you look at some of the demo
apps that have come out

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.580
for the v3 API, they kind of--

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.050
they get around some of the
automatic spec for the library

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.100
that gets downloaded.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.070
And they make the kind of input
in the endpoint URL, and

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.700
it just handles the
auth for you.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.120
And you can manage this just
at a slightly lower level.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.680
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.410
TIM WINTLE: And that's really
useful if you need to kind of

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.160
wrap all of your HTTP requests
if you're doing offline stuff

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.780
or that kind of--

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: It sounds like
an interesting blog post

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.360
article for those resisting
client libraries, and yet they

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.460
don't want to deal with OAuth.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.500
TIM WINTLE: Yeah.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.760
Cool.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.220
And how you, Matias?

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.530
What's your favorite programming
language?

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.260
MATIAS MOLINAS: I like Java,
JavaScript, and maybe C# too.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:15.120
But this is maybe my core
set of language.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.330
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.520
MATIAS MOLINAS: Yes.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.040
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Very good
set for service-side and

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.650
client-side development.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.530
And what about client
libraries.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.190
Do you like them or do you
prefer to parse based on XML?

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.930
MATIAS MOLINAS: I prefer to do
the codes directly and parse

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:33.110
the result.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.670
So I have more control
in this way.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.600
MATIAS MOLINAS: And I
like have control.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, I see.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.280
Interesting.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.380
Well, we are learning
a lot about your

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.290
character in this interview.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.710
All right.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.370
So real men use REST directly.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.640
Right?

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.410
Is that?

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:48.690
Cool.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.430
So I know Jeremy wanted to ask
you a few questions about some

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.060
of the new APIs.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.390
So Jeremy, over to you.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.770
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.810
Great.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.970
So of course, I usually
like to focus on

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.560
the three main APIs.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.490
You have the player and a couple
of ones that we have

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.840
that I wanted to talk to you
guys a little bit about.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.730
So the first one would be the
Data API or version 3.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:14.990
So for you that don't know,
we've had an experimental

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.050
stage for this API, and it's
kind of a complete

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.710
rewrite of version 2.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.190
And there's a lot of new
features we've added, and it's

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.470
all Jason based, and it's
much more you just

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.155
get what you need.

00:08:28.155 --> 00:08:30.580
So it's a lot more lighter
and a lot more efficient.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.240
So I wanted to talk to you guys
a little bit about that

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.309
to see if you've used it a
little bit and tell us about

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:38.940
what you've done.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.890
TIM WINTLE: I used this new
API, and I like the

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.980
integration with the Freebase
and the possibility that you

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.390
can search videos using Freebase
Topics, because I

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.220
think that this a very
powerful feature.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.210
It's a key feature if you want
to make, for example,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.120
recommendation system, you can
access this from a playlist

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.890
from the user.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:08.480
And your can retrieve the
different Freebase topics that

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:16.500
related to the videos that the
user what like, or maybe

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.510
provide the videos, or maybe the
videos that the user want

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.020
to watch later.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:31.330
So you have a very good source
for recommendations.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.260
I think that the Explorer, the
Topic Explorer sample is a

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:42.610
very good application tool
to begin to use this API.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:50.360
In fact, I use this project to
learn the YouTube API v3.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.920
And I recommend to all the
people to use and to test this

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.410
application.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.950
JEREMY WALKER: We will tell our
colleague Jeffrey Posnick

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.600
that you like it.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.020
MATIAS MOLINAS: Yeah.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.865
I like this application.

00:10:01.865 --> 00:10:03.700
TIM WINTLE: And that
actually uses that

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.350
method as I was saying.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.360
I think this is documented under
the General GAPI API

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.950
that you can just make
these requests

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.973
outside of the main flow.

00:10:12.973 --> 00:10:13.760
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.500
And for those out, there the
Topics API, what you do is

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.900
semantic search and it's based
on Freebase like you were

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.460
talking about.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.370
And that's one of the
big features.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.650
It's just a way that you can
search terms that may have

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.430
multiple meanings and get
the exact version.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.770
We have a talk on it, so be
sure to check that out.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.650
So I'm assuming then you didn't
use, from what you were

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.210
saying earlier, you didn't use
the Java client library then.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.830
You just used server?

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:46.430
MATIAS MOLINAS: I used the
AngularJS and JavaScript to

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.250
test the API because I
discovered AngularJS with the

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.400
Topic Explorer.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.610
And I like AngularJS.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:00.430
And I like JavaScript, so I use
the YouTube API v3 with

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.916
JavaScript.

00:11:01.916 --> 00:11:03.890
JEREMY WALKER: So was there
anything that you ran into

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:09.090
that kind of surprise you at all
about using the API that

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.920
you weren't expecting?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.420
MATIAS MOLINAS: No.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:21.070
I think that another thing I
like is the API, you can use

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.210
the API in the same
way that you use

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.520
another APIs from Google.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.910
For example, I use the
Provision API tool.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.270
And I use the same libraries,
and the same clients, and the

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.440
same optimization system.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.640
So really, this is the I life
from YouTube API v3.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.670
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.400
Building it on the same
architecture plug-in, it makes

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.740
it easy to switch between them
if you need to pick up some

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.920
extra APIs to use with
your product.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.660
So yeah, I totally agree
with that one.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.450
MATIAS MOLINAS: And you can
use the same tools.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:01.520
You can use the API Explorer
to test the different codes

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.560
and this is very productive.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.550
You are the developer, you don't
need to learn a lot of

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.895
tools or a lot of client
libraries.

00:12:11.895 --> 00:12:12.470
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.090
The API Explorer is a big
thing for me too.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.520
For those who don't know, it's
right below our docs.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.850
We have this little like
interactive thing where you

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.880
can kind of fill out forms of
what you kind of want, and it

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.170
puts together dynamically the
requests that goes out, the

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.280
restore request, the
HTTP request that

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.190
goes out to our system.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.250
And it shows the response down
below so you can start editing

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.250
stuff directly.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.050
And I'm sure that's really
useful, especially if you're

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.630
not necessarily using the client
libraries, because then

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.300
you can see exactly what you're
looking for and make

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.250
sure it's right before you even
try starting to integrate

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.080
it into your app.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.370
Great.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.200
Well, let's talk a little bit
about the Player and the

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.710
Analytics API because I know
you use that quite a bit.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.400
TIM WINTLE: Yeah.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.430
JEREMY WALKER: So why don't we
start with the Player API, and

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.630
for you out there, that's
just a way to play

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.470
back videos off YouTube.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.370
I'm assuming you use
the IFrame embed.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.710
TIM WINTLE: Well actually, I use
most of the Player APIs so

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.060
there's an old-style
JavaScript API.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.400
There's two Flash APIs, although
there's one of them--

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.990
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: S2.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.540
S3.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.580
TIM WINTLE: Yeah, is S2.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.920
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.310
It's still there.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:29.440
TIM WINTLE: And there's the
IFrame API which allows HTML5

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.520
playback on mobile, which is
particularly useful, which is

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.730
now a full, it's not
experimental.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:36.995
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:39.375
No longer experimental.

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:40.270
TIM WINTLE: So yeah.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.220
I kind of a switch between
them depending on

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.440
what I need to do.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.480
And I try to avoid Flash, but
sometimes you've got a big

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.155
Flash movie, and you need
a video in there.

00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:55.070
JEREMY WALKER: And I'm
suspecting a lot with ads, you

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.780
have some ads that you've
constructed like you're saying

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.240
using the AS3, probably, player
within those ads, so

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.360
you need access to that.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.770
TIM WINTLE: So actually, a lot
of our stuff is pulling off

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.440
the kind of events that
come back from them.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.610
And luckily, there are all
fairly similar in what events

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.170
they give, they throw it in
slightly different ways, so

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:21.400
like the IFrame API looks more
like a DOM event, that's

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.820
bubbling compared to the
ActionScript APIs.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:27.830
But, yes.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.470
So that's the kind of
main stuff we use.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:36.930
We try not to use the playVideo
method and stuff

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.100
like that because people don't
realize that normally doesn't

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.936
count as a view on YouTube.

00:14:44.936 --> 00:14:45.520
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.410
The playback has to be user
generated, user initiated in

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.530
order to count.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:49.910
TIM WINTLE: Yeah.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.730
That's something I think a lot
of people don't realize when

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.370
they first start
looking at it.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.335
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That's true.

00:14:57.335 --> 00:14:59.680
But it makes a lot of sense.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.110
It's really good to see that
kind of people can't abuse the

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.226
API in that way.

00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:07.880
JEREMY WALKER: Was there
anything that, I guess,

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.020
surprised you when you were
using the Player APIs or was

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.475
it pretty straightforward?

00:15:14.475 --> 00:15:18.180
TIM WINTLE: So once you've got
the skeleton code there, it's

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.770
fairly easy.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:25.620
I think it's more inheritance
in JavaScript.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.700
There are kind of several
different callbacks.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.902
So there's a callback once the
script is being inserted into

00:15:31.902 --> 00:15:32.980
the IFrame API.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.280
And then there's another
callback once the Player has

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.200
been instantiated.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.930
And like I see a lot of
confusion coming from kind of

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.750
if someone else is reading my
code and they're not used to

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.390
the APIs, there's kind of like
at what point is this a Player

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.130
instance, and at what point
is this a global setting.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.930
But once you've got that kind
of done, it just works.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.530
And this is really good,
especially now that there's

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.690
kind of mobile support, and you
can actually play videos

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.610
on mobile using this API in the
same way you would on any

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.085
other platform.

00:16:11.085 --> 00:16:13.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think the
API platform life cycle in a

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.020
very asynchronous system
is always a challenge.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:21.290
But I think the team has kind
of evolved over the years to

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.195
what it is.

00:16:22.195 --> 00:16:28.750
TIM WINTLE: The other thing that
they made quite a kind of

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:34.190
clean-cut decision when they
made the IFrame API into not

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.610
supporting any browsers that
don't have the postMessage

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.200
API, which is post HTML5.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:49.350
Which kind of means that IE8 and
Quirks load doesn't work

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.690
and anything below that works, I
think IE8 and Standards load

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.182
should work rather than INI.

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
You find this an

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.050
issue for your clients?

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:05.089
TIM WINTLE: So I've actually I
have a kind of general rapid

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.470
assign insert that detects if
there's a postMessage, and if

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.140
there is, it uses the
IFrame embed.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.220
TIM WINTLE: And if there's not,
then it drops in the old

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.830
JavaScript API to the Flash.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:16.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.280
I think the motivation there
was really with a

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.990
proliferation of
mobile devices.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.750
This is where when you get
something that would work

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.000
across different platforms,
and that is a very good

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.350
interface to use for some of the
mobile platforms as well.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:35.123
TIM WINTLE: It's a very clean
API, and this will be, well, a

00:17:35.123 --> 00:17:38.680
lot of people aren't
supporting IE8 now.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.760
And by this time next year, I
think I'll have removed all of

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.660
the code that kind of deals
with, if you haven't got it.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.030
So yeah.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:54.010
I'm very glad this kind of a
clean cut and not trying to

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.130
support everything
indefinitely.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So sometimes
inflicting a little bit of

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.085
pain pays off in the long run.

00:17:59.085 --> 00:18:00.985
TIM WINTLE: Yeah.

00:18:00.985 --> 00:18:01.750
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.750
Well, I also, now you use the
Insight, which for you that

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.130
don't know, Insight is kind of
the, it's part of version 2,

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.630
so the older data API that
lets you pull analytics

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.480
information.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.440
And we have a new Analytics API
that is in experimental

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.750
mode right now that a lot of
people are playing with.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.570
So I was going to ask you like,
just a quick overview

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.600
like what you thought of that
and if you've seen any

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.580
benefits to all the data you're

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.010
pulling now with Insight.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.510
TIM WINTLE: So yeah.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.740
The biggest thing is that the
old Insight API just kind of

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.520
gave you like almost a
[? toggle ?] or a zip file

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.990
with a big CSV with columns.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.610
And the columns used to change
as more data was added.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.810
And you had to kind of download,
then store this all

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.770
in RAM, extract it.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.380
And yeah, it was messy.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.160
So one of the biggest
things is you don't

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.260
need to do that anymore.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.660
It's more like a kind
of query language.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.890
So it's a really clean kind of
service-orientated query that

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.540
you can just make as though you
were querying a database.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.600
And you could also
query right back.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.605
So you're not kind of limited
to just the last I think it

00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:23.670
was 14 days, it could have been
30 days that you could

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:28.390
query before you can actually
get loads of data going back.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:34.000
Plus there's all of the new
stuff like Average Freelance.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.380
And I'm hoping that it's
going to be expanding

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.250
more and more before--

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think
metrics is what you're

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.040
referring to.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.990
And definitely, we are always
pushing the team, Jeremy, to

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.670
expose more of these metrics.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.540
And I think they've done a good
job catching up with what

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.570
we have available
on YouTube.com.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.440
And that's really the goal is
to expose as much as we can

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.900
through the new API as opposed
to the Insight API.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.330
So I think for folks that are
still using Insight, we would

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.790
like to have switched to
the new Insight API.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.820
And this is something that I
know, Jeremy, you've been

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.330
working a lot on trying to help
people and work with the

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.950
team so that we can actually
apply Insight at some point.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:16.410
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.390
I mean, like you said, you
were getting Jason or CSV

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.940
directly back, and you get to
specify only the parts you

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.005
want, not this message zip files
with all these CSVs you

00:20:25.005 --> 00:20:27.760
have to kind of wade through
to find the right stuff.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:27.970
TIM WINTLE: Yeah.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:32.800
Like if you're on kind of a
cloud provider, or VPN, or

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.200
something, you're bandwidth is
quite kind of restricted by

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.390
the data that you're getting in,
then being able to really

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.390
compress the responses is
really good as well.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.140
And luckily with YouTube
posting, a lot of so many

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.150
videos for people, you're
actually in a point where you

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.760
are worrying about this kind
of response size instead of

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.800
the size of a video file
that you would have

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.536
hosted 10 years ago.

00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:02.472
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:21:02.472 --> 00:21:02.940
Great.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.380
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Well, all right.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.010
So I think this is all the
time we have today.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.200
Thank you very much
for visiting us.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.950
Enjoy the rest of your trip here
in northern California.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.785
And we will hopefully
see you soon again.

00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:15.470
MATIAS MOLINAS: Thank you.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:16.070
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.560
TIM WINTLE: Thank you.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.460
JEREMY WALKER: Thanks Bye.
