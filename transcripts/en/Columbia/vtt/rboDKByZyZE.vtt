Aleksander Kwasniewski: Distinguished director,
professors, dear ladies and gentlemen, dear

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.730
students, I hope some students from Poland
as well, (speaks Polish). Some students from

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.860
Poland are here, so this is an additional
honor for me. Dear friends, I'm extremely

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.010
glad to be a guest of Columbia University.
Thanks for nice and very kind introduction.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And, first of all, I'd like to thank you for
this invitation. It is a source of great satisfaction

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.699
to me to be able to meet with representatives
of the United States intellectual elite, with

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.650
the community that is sketching the path of
the future, not just for America, but also

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.710
for the entire world.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.710
Indeed, that is the dimension of today's debate
at the World Leaders forum. I'm very pleased

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.560
that Columbia University, one of America's
most prestigious places of higher learning

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.560
is closely affiliated with Poland. It was
here that the Polish Studies program was created

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.409
two years ago. Thanks to this program, the
research is being conducted into Poland's

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.859
more distant and contemporary history and
our country has become much better known to

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:51.200
the American public opinion. I would like
to thank cordially the authorities of Columbia

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.200
University, especially its Eastern European
Studies Center for supporting this wonderful

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.880
undertaking. I would also like to thank the
Katsushika Foundation and the Semper Palonia

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.039
Foundation. I hope that it will be possible
for the Polish students, faculty, to launch

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.039
operations in the near future at this renowned
university which will make our country even

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.140
better known to Americans.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.140
Ladies and gentlemen, dear students, two notions
have modeled the most recent quarter of the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.400
century of Polish history: freedom and solidarity.
Today no one has any doubt whatsoever that

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.349
what happened in Poland 25 years ago deserves
to be called a turning point. The formation

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.510
of Solidarnosc, Solidarity, in 1980 changed
the course of history and it initiated changes

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.730
throughout Europe. The sowing of Solidarnosc
has led, although not immediately, to a great

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.799
yield. In Poland this took place in 1989 in
the form of the Round Table Agreement between

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.430
the authorities and the opposition, which
demanded democratic changes. Consequently,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.750
the first non-communistic government was formed.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.750
Immediately thereafter, just like a domino,
changes took place in Eastern Germany, the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.760
Berlin Wall fell. The Velvet Revolution occurred
in Czechoslovakia. Changes took place in Hungary,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.849
Romania, the Baltic States. And the Soviet,
finally the Soviet Union disintegrated. The

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:48.849
Iron Curtain which had seemed was supposed
to have split our continent asunder for eternity

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.209
simply and suddenly melted away. The Cold
War came to an end. The processes of Enlargement

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:05.849
NATO, and the European Union, demarcated a
new era. An era of openness, cooperation,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.670
and integration. Poland is an excellent proof
of the immense creativities strength freedom

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.989
arbors. The greatest resource we had at the
starting point was human energy and creativity.

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:31.009
The Poland of 1989-90, when we embarked on
the path of transformation, and contemporary

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.080
Poland are, in fact, two different countries.
Some examples. Our gross domestic product

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.440
has grown over these 15 years by 42 percent.
This is the greatest increase among all the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.150
Central and Eastern European states. The year
of 2004 had particular meaning as that was

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.440
the year Poland acceded to the European Union.
It was a time of truth for the competitiveness

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.669
of our economy. The results have proven to
be spectacular, especially in terms of exports,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.340
which compared to the previous year, have
spiked by more than 37 percent. The Polish

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.000
economy has modernized.
It is not just that

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
it produces incomparably more than 15 year
ago, but that at the same time it also consumes

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.050
one-third less one-third less water, one-half
less coal, with admitting ten times less dust

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.880
into the atmosphere. Living conditions have
improved considerably. Poles live three years

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.550
longer on average. There are four times more
phone lines and three times more passenger

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.550
cars per 1000 inhabitants. We are experiencing
an educational boom. You, dear students from

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.110
Poland, are a good example of this educational
boom. Now in Poland we have two million students

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:13.889
in the universities and that is five times
more than in 1990. Nearly every other young

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.660
Poland is studying.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:27.660
Although we are still not a wealthy nation,
this year's UN report ranks Poland high in

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.020
terms of living condition in number 36. We
are among the most developed nations, of course,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.039
and that is necessary to underline. We also
have problems. We must urgently create new

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:49.039
jobs, reduce public debt, and effectively
reform the healthcare system. You will concur

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:56.270
that these Polish challenges sound very familiar,
even here in America, and especially in Western

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:03.289
Europe. We can see the problems which we have,
challenges which we face, they mean simply

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:11.180
normalcy. Including all its splendors and
shadows, but this normalcy is really fact

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.740
measure of our success.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:22.740
Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement
of the European Union include ten new member

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:29.910
states, including eight from Central and Eastern
Europe, marked with the experience of communism

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:36.910
become a great historical event. It is response
to the avenue of the conflicts and divisions

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:45.430
that Europe once lived through while also
being an opening to new and numerous opportunities

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:53.650
for development. Poland today is actively
participating in debate on the EU's future.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:01.300
This community of 25 states, which will grow
to 27 in the near future, and certainly more

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:11.750
after is a complicated mechanism which must
work in a coherent and effective manner. As

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:19.490
problems appear, people sometimes even speak
openly of crisis. However, for some who looks

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.800
at the European Union from the outside, the
sentiment of crisis may be something incomprehensible.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.949
Or even absurd.

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:37.150
Europe, in the process of uniting, does not
have any reasons to have complexes or to be

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:44.150
despondent. Its score card of achievement
is really impressive. The countries that are

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:54.770
waiting to join the community also see things
this way. After all, they would not all be

00:08:54.770 --> 00:09:01.770
knocking on the EU's door if they believe
the life of crisis awaits them there. The

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:08.950
reality of the EU is considerably better than
the sentiment prevailing within. The process

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:16.390
of EU enlargement should be continued. That
is the most certain recipe for security, stability,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:26.610
and development for all Europeans. And the
best that Europe can offer to the world.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:35.270
Ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important
pillars of global security and stability is

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:42.270
the transatlantic bonds. Poland is of the
opinion that the European Union should continue

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:49.540
with America to strengthen this close and
lasting partnership. Only this will make it

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.960
possible to counteract the global threats
and challenges effectively. This model reflects

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:04.270
much better the idea of international solidarity
than a la carte partnership, calling for cooperation

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:11.400
on select issues. At the same time, we are
in favor on the EU's co-accountability for

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:19.690
global security to be considerably greater
than to date. Europe and America may have

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:27.310
different views and even different interests
in one or another matter. Experience shows,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:33.190
however, that whenever we want we are capable
of reaching an agreement.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:39.430
A perfect example of this is the accord in
the issue of jointly persuading the Iranian

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:46.430
authorities to desist from uranium enrichment
program. Its achievement is a good prognostic

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:54.130
for further Euro-American cooperation. In
matters of fundamental importance to the world

00:10:54.770 --> 00:11:01.250
we have common interests. I think that this
one is currently more firmly rooted on both

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:08.250
sides the Atlantic, than just two or three
ago. Europe and America contribute toward

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:15.960
politics' advantages that are complimentary,
not mutually exclusive. I think that people

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:23.950
in regions afflicted with crisis or countries
suffering under despotic governments would

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:32.240
have a hard time understanding why we cannot
combine our forces to provide them with effective

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.790
aid.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:41.790
Europe needs America and America needs Europe.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:49.450
also something that strongly bonds our continents.
The alliance has found its place in the new

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:56.000
architecture of security after the end of
the Cold War. It plays an enormous role in

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
integration processes, in bolstering stability
and confidence. NATO's open door policy should

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.360
be continued because it serves democratic
reforms well in countries aspiring to the

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.750
alliance.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:22.750
Ladies and gentlemen, Poland feels accountable
for the direction that matters take and not

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.310
just in our vicinity, not only in the European
Union or in the transatlantic community but

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:38.310
also in the whole world. I am thinking now
both of problems that concern security as

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:45.980
well of threats ensuing from the absence of
sustainable development. The essence of today's

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:52.990
world is interdependency and Poland has drawn
its conclusions from this. We have not just

00:12:53.930 --> 00:13:00.450
fixed our gaze on ourselves. We also look
to others, seeing them as partners for joint

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:07.450
activities or as to persons to whom a helping
hand must be extended. Indeed, this commitment

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:14.960
is the leverage that elevates Poland's international
position.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.920
Our country has good relations with all its
neighbors. Polish soldiers have been taking

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:27.700
part in peace and stabilization missions for
more than half a century and in special way

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:34.700
in recent years. We know from our history
what the tragedy of war, external aggression,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:42.110
the violation of a nation's freedom and human
rights, and the bitterness of isolation mean.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:49.220
That is why those who are currently living
through similar misfortunes can count on the

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:56.220
Poles. We are in different places around the
world. In those places where there are threats

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:04.370
of conflict, where citizens have suffered
at the hands of authoritative regimes, as

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:11.550
well as in those places where are smoldering
ruins people are attempting to build a tranquil

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.100
existence anew.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:20.100
Polish soldiers bring support and hope in
Afghanistan and in Iraq, in Syria and Lebanon,

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:28.010
in Kosovo, Macedonia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our response to global challenges takes the

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:35.180
form of support provided to more impoverished
nations and the participation of Polish services

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:42.550
and non-governmental organizations in humanitarian
operations. Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:51.150
in conclusion I would like to say the idea
of solidarity was not born in Poland. It is

00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:01.160
an eternal idea that goes to the core of what
is best in our humanity. Nevertheless, the

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:09.800
Poles were the ones who introduced it to the
circle of political values. Who transformed

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.560
it into a social movement capable of changing
reality.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:22.320
Today this is our great message addressed
to the entire world. At this time I would

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:29.320
like to mention Czeslaw Milosz who died one
year ago. A great poet, a winner of Nobel

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:36.420
Prize for Literature, a sage who spent 32
years of his long life here in the U.S. He

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:45.010
lectured in American universities. Milosz
was partially one of us and partially one

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:52.010
of you. He embodied the fulfillment of the
American dream coupled with the innocent longing

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:59.080
for his lost homeland. He investigated the
intricate path of the history and culture

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:07.220
of our times. This great humanist wrote as
follows in his moral treatise. I quote: 'You

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.730
are living here now. Hick at noon.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:21.730
You have one life, one point. What you manage
to do will remain.' Dear ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:31.950
let us do our utmost to manage to do as much
good as possible for the world and for our

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:39.270
joint success. Let's ensure that our posterity
is as meaningful as possible. Let's build

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:50.240
our call to openness, cooperation among nations
and people. Let's cherish solidarity. Thank

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.040
you for your attention.
