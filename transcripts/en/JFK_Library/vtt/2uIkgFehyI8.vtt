00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:01.069
- I said well, how do you,

00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:01.902
why are you here?

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.608
And he goes I'm with my girlfriend,

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:04.998
we're traveling around, I met the Pope

00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:08.059
on the subway about when I was 17.

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:09.965
And I'm like, you met
the Pope on a subway?

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:11.519
And he goes, yeah, and
you know he talked to me

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.560
about Catholicism and
had me go down and work

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.568
in the villas with Pepe and, you know,

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:18.707
that's how I got to know Pepe and I said,

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:21.047
well when did you see him last?

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:22.779
And he goes like four years ago,

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.928
just before he became Pope.

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:26.429
And I said, well, how did you end up here

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.760
you must be good pals with him.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.309
And he goes, no no no, I was

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.600
in the general congregation
there on Wednesday

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.418
when the Pope goes
through in the Popemobile

00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:36.269
and waves at everybody, and he gets out

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.680
of the Popemobile, sees this guy,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.477
and he goes, I can't
remember the guy's name,

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:41.680
let's just say Andru,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.137
hey, how are you?

00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:44.920
And the guy goes, you remember me?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.579
And he goes, of course, I got out

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.528
of the Popemobile to say hi to you.

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:49.838
He introduces him to his girlfriend

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:52.299
that he's traveling around in Europe with,

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.966
they're now married,

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:57.589
and the Pope goes,

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.029
Hey, do you wanna come to Mass tomorrow?

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:01.946
And the guy goes, sure.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.811
And he goes, give me your phone number

00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:06.960
He gives him his cell phone number,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.200
he hands it to his, you know, aide,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.869
and the guy goes, he gives him a hug,

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.286
and was like wow.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:14.686
I said what happened,

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:15.899
he goes I sat with my cell phone,

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.497
two o'clock, three o'clock, four o'clock

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:20.328
nobody called, five
o'clock the phone rings,

00:01:20.328 --> 00:01:21.800
the guys say you're friends with the Pope,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.336
I say yeah I'm friends with the Pope.

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:27.097
He says show up at the gate at 6:30,

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:29.459
and we have no clothes
because we're traveling

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.867
through Europe, so my girlfriend's
in this red, ugly outfit

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:37.617
and I'm in like a sport
coat, and I said, wow

00:01:39.207 --> 00:01:42.149
and he was the last one
in line for the picture,

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.488
and I said, what did the Pope say to you?

00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:49.205
And he said, Francesco
goes, you crashed the party.

00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:51.939
And he gave me a hug and I'm like,

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.356
that's the story.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.229
I mean the guy's driving
around the Popemobile

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.840
in the middle of St. Peter's
Square and sees this guy

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.680
he hasn't seen in four years, stops,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.579
and gives him a hug and
invites his girlfriend and him,

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.808
who are traveling in sin, to Mass,

00:02:07.808 --> 00:02:10.141
to have Mass in the morning.

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.029

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.059
