00:00:00.664 --> 00:00:03.743
- [Voiceover] Imagine you
had a monatomic ideal gas

00:00:03.743 --> 00:00:06.862
in this cylinder here, an
there was this tightly fitted

00:00:06.862 --> 00:00:10.604
piston above it that prevented
any gas from getting out.

00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:13.233
Well we know that the
total internal energy

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.372
for a monatomic ideal gas is just three

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:19.455
halves P times V or three halves NKT,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.280
or three halves little nRT,

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:27.798
and we know that saying U internal

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:31.804
the internal energy is really
just code for the total

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:35.024
kinetic energy of the monatomic ideal gas,

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:36.603
that these are the same thing.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.940
When we talk about internal energy

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.775
we're talking about how fast
are these particles moving,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.023
in other words, what's the
total kinetic energy of

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:45.979
all of these particles added up.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.491
My question is how do we go about

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:50.313
changing the internal energy?

00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:52.865
Let's say we wanted to increase
the total kinetic energy,

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:54.323
what could we do?

00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:56.591
Well, we could say increase the pressure,

00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:58.434
or the volume, or the
temperature, yeah but I mean

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:02.504
physically, actually, in
the lab, what do we do?

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:04.530
And there's basically two ways to change

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.866
the internal energy.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.608
If you want to add internal energy,

00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:09.977
i.e. get these particles moving faster,

00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:13.177
we can heat it up so
put this above a flame

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:14.696
or on a hot plate,

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:18.280
and heat will flow into the gas which will

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.318
cause these particles to
move faster and faster.

00:01:21.318 --> 00:01:23.402
That's one way to do it, to add heat.

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:27.036
The other way to do it
is to do work on the gas.

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:28.904
I could take this piston and push it down,

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:30.704
and if you push this down hard enough

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:32.706
it will squash this gas together,

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:35.744
and those impacts with this
piston while it's moving down

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:38.602
will cause them to start
moving faster and faster,

00:01:38.602 --> 00:01:41.617
that will also add
internal energy to the gas.

00:01:41.617 --> 00:01:44.542
So if we wanted to write
down a formula that told us

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:47.220
how you could get a change
in the internal energy,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.762
if I want to change the internal energy,

00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:52.057
Delta U, which is really just saying

00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:53.905
changing the kinetic energy,

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.073
well there's two ways to do it.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.558
I can add heat.

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:58.380
If I added ten joules of heat

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.856
I'd add ten joules to the internal energy,

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:03.691
but I've also got to take into
account this work being done,

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:07.156
and so I can do plus the
work done on the gas,

00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:09.316
and that's it, this is
actually the first law

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:11.769
of thermodynamics, it's the
law of conservation of energy

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.424
it says there's only
two ways to add energy,

00:02:14.424 --> 00:02:16.179
internal energy to a gas.

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.294
Let me talk a little bit more
about this work done though

00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:20.611
cause getting the sign right is important.

00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:22.727
If you're doing work on
the gas compressing it

00:02:22.727 --> 00:02:24.684
you're adding energy to the gas,

00:02:24.684 --> 00:02:28.241
but if you let the gas
push up on the piston

00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:31.255
and this gas expands
pushing the piston up,

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:33.010
then the gas is doing the work,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.463
that's energy leaving the system.

00:02:35.463 --> 00:02:37.780
So if the gas does work
you have to subtract

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.445
work done by the gas.

00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:42.371
If the outside force does work on the gas

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.801
you add that to the internal energy.

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:45.927
So you got to pay attention to

00:02:45.927 --> 00:02:47.456
which way the energy is flowing.

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:49.188
Work done on gas, energy goes in.

00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:51.889
Work done by the gas, energy goes out,

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.891
and you'd have to subtract that over here.

00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:55.781
Let's say the gas did expand.

00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:58.843
Let's say the gas in here
was under so much pressure

00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:01.587
that the force it exerted
on this piston was enough

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:06.110
to push that piston upward
by a certain amount.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.125
So let's say it started right
here and it went up to here

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.700
so that piston went from here to there

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.872
no gasses escaping cause
this is tightly fitting,

00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:16.596
but the gas was able to push
it up a certain distance d,

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.622
how much work was done?

00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.400
You know the definition of work.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.986
Work is defined to be the
force times the distance

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:24.898
through which that force was applied.

00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:27.801
So the work that the
gas did was F times d,

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:30.191
but we want this to be in
terms of thermal quantities

00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.661
like pressure, and
volume, and temperature.

00:03:32.661 --> 00:03:33.899
So what could we do?

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.104
We can say that this volume,

00:03:36.104 --> 00:03:37.881
not only did the piston raise up,

00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:40.807
but there was an extra
volume generated within here

00:03:40.807 --> 00:03:42.899
that I'm going to call Delta V,

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:45.464
and I know that this
Delta V has got to equal

00:03:45.464 --> 00:03:49.087
the area of the piston times the distance

00:03:49.087 --> 00:03:51.045
through which that piston moved

00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:54.397
because this height
times that area gives me

00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:56.310
this volume right in here.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.390
Why am I doing this?

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.418
Cause look I can write d
as equal to Delta V over A,

00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:05.693
and I can take this, I can
substitute this formula for d

00:04:05.693 --> 00:04:09.293
into here, and something magical happens,

00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:12.960
I'll get work equals F
times Delta V over A,

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.316
but look F over A, we
know what F over A is,

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:20.926
that's pressure so I get
that the work done by the gas

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:22.929
is the pressure times Delta V.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.999
This is an equation that I
like because it's in terms

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.699
of thermodynamic quantities
that we're already dealing with.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.760
So work done you can figure
out by taking P times Delta V

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.887
but strictly speaking
this is only true if this

00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:36.025
pressure remained constant, right?

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:37.375
If the pressure was changing,

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:39.289
then what am I supposed to plug in here,

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.560
the initial pressure, the final pressure?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.471
If the pressure's staying constant

00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:44.764
this gives you an exact
way to find the work done.

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:46.789
You might object and say wait,

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.359
how is it possible for a
gas to expand and remain

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:50.506
at the same pressure?

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:51.901
Well, you basically have to heat it up

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:53.791
while the gas expands,

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:56.394
that allows the pressure
to remain constant

00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:57.811
as the gas expands.

00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:01.141
And now we're finally ready
to talk about heat capacities.

00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:02.921
So let's get rid of this,

00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:05.844
and heat capacity is defined to be,

00:05:05.844 --> 00:05:08.207
imagine you had a certain
amount of heat being added.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:12.640
So a certain amount of heat
gets added to your gas.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.485
How much does the temperature increase?

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.307
That's what the heat capacity tells you.

00:05:16.307 --> 00:05:18.782
So capital C is heat capacity

00:05:18.782 --> 00:05:22.000
and it's defined to be the amount of heat

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.350
that you've added to the gas,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.311
divided by the amount of change

00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:28.772
in the temperature of that gas.

00:05:28.772 --> 00:05:31.247
And actually, something
you'll hear about often

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:32.797
is the molar heat capacity,

00:05:32.797 --> 00:05:36.218
which is actually divided
by an extra n here.

00:05:36.218 --> 00:05:37.907
So instead of Q over Delta T

00:05:37.907 --> 00:05:41.663
it's Q over n the number
of moles times Delta T.

00:05:41.663 --> 00:05:43.904
Pretty simple but think about it.

00:05:43.904 --> 00:05:45.142
If we had a piston in here,

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:47.167
are we going to allow that piston to move

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:48.540
while we add the heat,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.105
or are we not going to
allow the piston to move?

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:52.927
There's different ways
that this can happen,

00:05:52.927 --> 00:05:55.313
and because of that there's
different heat capacities.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.878
If we don't allow this piston to move,

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:00.983
if we weld this thing
shut so it can't move

00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:03.863
we've got heat capacity
at constant volume,

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:07.441
and if we do allow this
piston to move freely while

00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:09.849
we add the heat so that the pressure

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.446
inside of here remains constant,

00:06:11.446 --> 00:06:14.708
we'd have the heat capacity
at constant pressure.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.004
And these are similar but different,

00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:19.231
and they're related, and
we can figure them out.

00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:22.179
So let's clear this
away, let's get a nice,

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:25.127
here we go, two pistons
inside of cylinders.

00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:26.185
We'll put a piston in here,

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:27.602
but I'm going to weld this one shut.

00:06:27.602 --> 00:06:29.357
This one can't move.

00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:31.746
We'll have another one over
here, it can move freely.

00:06:31.746 --> 00:06:33.205
So over on this side,

00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:35.028
we'll have the definition of

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:37.390
heat capacity, regular heat capacity,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.620
is the amount of heat you add divided by

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.733
the change in temperature that you get.

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:43.466
So on this side we're
adding heat, let's say

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:46.908
heat goes in, but the piston does not move

00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:48.933
and so the gas in here is stuck,

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:50.896
it can't move, no work can be done.

00:06:50.896 --> 00:06:52.669
Since this piston can't move,

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.279
external forces can't do work on the gas,

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.799
and the gas can't do work
and allow energy to leave.

00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:01.399
Q is the only thing adding
energy into this system,

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.405
or in other words,

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:04.348
we've got heat capacity at constant

00:07:04.348 --> 00:07:06.507
volume is going to equal,

00:07:06.507 --> 00:07:08.735
well, remember the first
law of thermodynamics said

00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:12.650
that Delta U, the only way
to add internal energy,

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.205
or take it away is that you
can add or subtract heat,

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:18.500
and you can do work on the gas.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.190
In this case, Q, if I
subtract W from both sides

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.107
I get Delta U minus W over Delta T,

00:07:25.973 --> 00:07:29.751
but since we're not
allowing this piston to move

00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:33.021
the work done has got to be zero.

00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:35.736
So there's no work done at
all so the heat capacity

00:07:35.736 --> 00:07:38.369
at constant volume is going to be Delta U

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:41.564
over Delta T, what's Delta U?

00:07:41.564 --> 00:07:43.904
Let's just assume this
is a monatomic ideal gas,

00:07:43.904 --> 00:07:46.897
if it's monatomic we've
got a formula for this.

00:07:46.897 --> 00:07:51.064
Delta U is just three halves,
P times V over Delta T.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.827
That's not the only way I can write it.

00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:57.994
Remember I can also write it
as three halves NK Delta T

00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:04.493
over Delta T, and
something magical happens,

00:08:04.493 --> 00:08:06.338
check it out the Delta T's go away

00:08:06.338 --> 00:08:08.164
and you get that this is a constant.

00:08:08.164 --> 00:08:11.108
That the heat capacity for
any monatomic ideal gas

00:08:11.108 --> 00:08:13.561
is just going to be three halves,

00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:16.509
Capital NK, Boltzmann's constant,

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:18.669
N is the total number of molecules.

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:22.836
Or you could have rewrote
this as little n R Delta T.

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:25.914
The T's would still have cancelled

00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:29.222
and you would have got
three halves, little n,

00:08:29.222 --> 00:08:32.507
the number of moles,
times R, the gas constant.

00:08:32.507 --> 00:08:35.860
So the heat capacity at
constant volume for any

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.325
monatomic ideal gas is
just three halves nR,

00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:41.782
and if you wanted the molar heat capacity

00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:44.635
remember that's just divide
by an extra mole here

00:08:44.635 --> 00:08:48.775
so everything gets divided
by moles everywhere

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:52.128
divided by moles, that
just cancels this out,

00:08:52.128 --> 00:08:55.144
and the molar heat
capacity at constant volume

00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:57.618
is just three halves R.

00:08:57.618 --> 00:08:59.284
So that's heat capacity
at constant volume,

00:08:59.284 --> 00:09:02.096
what about heat capacity
at constant pressure?

00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:03.604
Now we're going to look at this side.

00:09:03.604 --> 00:09:07.564
Again, we're going to
allow this gas to have heat

00:09:07.564 --> 00:09:10.647
enter the cylinder, but
we're going to allow this

00:09:10.647 --> 00:09:13.191
piston to move up while
it does that so that

00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:15.800
the pressure inside of
here remains constant

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.275
and this is going to be the heat capacity

00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:19.944
at constant pressure.

00:09:19.944 --> 00:09:22.573
Well, again, we're going to get that it's

00:09:22.573 --> 00:09:26.656
Q over Delta T, and just
like the first law said,

00:09:27.553 --> 00:09:30.136
Q has to equal Delta U minus W.

00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:34.964
So we get Delta U minus W, the work done,

00:09:34.964 --> 00:09:38.317
over Delta T, this time W is not zero.

00:09:38.317 --> 00:09:39.857
What's W going to be?

00:09:39.857 --> 00:09:43.064
Remember W is P times Delta V.

00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:46.192
So this is a way we can find
the work done by the gas,

00:09:46.192 --> 00:09:48.826
P times Delta V, so this is going to equal

00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:51.143
Delta U, we know what that is.

00:09:51.143 --> 00:09:53.325
If this is again, a monatomic ideal gas,

00:09:53.325 --> 00:09:57.158
this is going to equal
three halves nR Delta T

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:03.068
plus this is P times Delta V,

00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:04.070
but we have to be careful,

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.533
in this formula this work is referring to

00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:08.153
work done on the gas,

00:10:08.153 --> 00:10:11.124
but in this case, work
is being done by the gas,

00:10:11.124 --> 00:10:12.991
so I need another negative.

00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:16.434
Technically the work done on
the gas would be a negative

00:10:16.434 --> 00:10:19.967
amount of this since energy
is leaving the system.

00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:21.924
So that negative cancels this negative

00:10:21.924 --> 00:10:25.012
and I get plus P times Delta V,

00:10:25.012 --> 00:10:27.595
all of that over Delta T, phew.

00:10:28.765 --> 00:10:29.937
So what do we get?

00:10:29.937 --> 00:10:31.854
Three halves nR Delta T

00:10:34.031 --> 00:10:37.180
plus I want to rewrite P times Delta V,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.643
but I know how to do that.

00:10:38.643 --> 00:10:42.468
The Ideal Gas Law says PV equals nRT,

00:10:42.468 --> 00:10:45.326
well if that's true, then P times Delta V

00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:48.364
is going to equal nR Delta T.

00:10:48.364 --> 00:10:53.066
So can rewrite this as nR
Delta T divided by Delta T,

00:10:53.066 --> 00:10:56.284
almost there, all of
the Delta T's go away.

00:10:56.284 --> 00:10:58.129
Look what I'm left with.

00:10:58.129 --> 00:10:59.705
I'm left with C.

00:10:59.705 --> 00:11:01.707
Heat capacity at constant
pressure is going to be

00:11:01.707 --> 00:11:05.172
equal to three halves nR plus nR,

00:11:05.172 --> 00:11:07.422
that's just five halves nR,

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.585
and if I wanted the
molar heat capacity again

00:11:11.585 --> 00:11:14.221
I could divide everything,
everything around here

00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:17.818
by little n, and that would just give me

00:11:17.818 --> 00:11:19.775
the molar heat capacity constant pressure

00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:22.071
would be five halves R.

00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:23.578
And notice they're almost the same.

00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:28.303
The heat capacity at constant
volume is three halves nR,

00:11:28.303 --> 00:11:30.261
and the heat capacity at constant pressure

00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:31.993
is five halves nR.

00:11:31.993 --> 00:11:34.199
They just differ by nR.

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:36.743
So the difference
between the heat capacity

00:11:36.743 --> 00:11:40.410
at constant volume which
is three halves nR,

00:11:41.489 --> 00:11:45.070
and the heat capacity at constant pressure

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.070
which is five halves nR,

00:11:48.217 --> 00:11:50.884
is just Cp minus Cv which is nR,

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:57.266
just nR, and if you wanted
to take the difference

00:11:57.266 --> 00:12:00.536
between the molar heat
capacities at constant volume

00:12:00.536 --> 00:12:03.276
and pressure, it would just be R.

00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:04.828
The difference would just be R

00:12:04.828 --> 00:12:06.156
because everything
would get divided by the

00:12:06.156 --> 00:12:07.641
number of moles.

00:12:07.641 --> 00:12:09.914
So there's a relationship,
an important relationship.

00:12:09.914 --> 00:12:11.736
It tells you the difference between

00:12:11.736 --> 00:12:13.379
the heat capacity at constant pressure

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:15.604
and the heat capacity at constant volume.
