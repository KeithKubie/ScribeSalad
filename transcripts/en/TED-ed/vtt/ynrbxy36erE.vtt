00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:10.427
Perfumers can learn to distinguish
individual odors

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:13.946
in a fragrance made of hundreds of scents.

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:16.026
Tea experts have been known to sniff out

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:18.467
not just the location 
where a tea was from,

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:22.835
but the season of harvest
and whether it was planted by a plum tree.

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:24.728
And the New York City Transit Authority

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:28.717
once had an employee responsible
only for sniffing out gas leaks

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:30.738
in the subway system.

00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:35.248
Can just anyone learn to smell
with the sensitivity of those experts?

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:38.728
For most of us, what we smell
is largely involuntary,

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:40.738
whether it's garbage behind a restaurant,

00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:43.518
the shampoo of the woman leaving
an elevator as you enter,

00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:46.469
or a bakery's fresh-made bread.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.990
With a few million olfactory receptors
in our noses,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.478
we clearly don't lack the ability
to smell well.

00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:56.139
We just might not always pay close
enough attention.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.068
That's a shame because we may be
missing opportunities

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:01.698
to make strong emotional connections.

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:04.300
Smells are powerfully linked to emotions

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.161
and can awaken memories of places
we've long ago left

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:09.109
and people we've loved.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.469
But fortunately, it is possible
to train our brains to smell better.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.010
For example, Helen Keller was able
to recognize a person's work,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.797
and in her words,

00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:21.559
distinguish the carpenter
from the iron worker,

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:24.360
the artist from the mason or the chemist,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.770
by a simple inhale.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.571
Follow these steps and you too can
change the way the world smells to you.

00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:34.630
First, stick your nose in it.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.122
Some animals that are known
to be great smellers,

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:39.460
like dogs who can sniff out explosives

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.899
and pigs who can 
find truffles underground,

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.890
put their noses right at the place
they want to smell.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.501
Human noses, meanwhile, are casting
around in the middle of the air,

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:52.452
giving us an anatomical disadvantage.

00:01:52.452 --> 00:01:55.846
So bring your nose close to the world
around you.

00:01:55.846 --> 00:01:56.711
The ground,

00:01:56.711 --> 00:01:57.621
surfaces,

00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:58.662
objects,

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:00.203
the food in your hand.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:01.631
Get close to your dog,

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:02.520
your partner,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.392
the book you're reading.

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:06.980
Not only will your nose be closer
to the odor source,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.072
but the warmth of your breath
will make odors easier to smell.

00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:14.022
Second, sniff like you mean it.

00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:17.322
Smelling actually happens way up near
the bridge of our noses

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:23.072
in a postage stamp-sized square
of tissue called the olfactory epithelium.

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:26.801
When we sniff, odor molecules are sucked
up into our nostrils

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:28.842
until they hit this tissue

00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:33.844
where they combine to our olfactory,
or scent, receptors.

00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:37.072
When we inhale normally,
only a little air makes it there.

00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:39.543
But one or two solid sharp sniffs

00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:43.124
will ensure that more air gets to
your smell receptors.

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:44.693
After just a few more sniffs,

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:47.872
the receptors, which are best at
noticing new smells,

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:50.034
turn off temporarily.

00:02:50.034 --> 00:02:53.764
So you can give your nose a rest
and sniff again later.

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:56.793
Finally, dwell on the smell.

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:59.875
Most smells pass by us 
with little attention,

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:01.844
but simply noticing what you're smelling

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:05.245
and by trying to describe it, name it,
and locate its source,

00:03:05.245 --> 00:03:09.393
you can expand your vocabulary of smells.

00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:12.087
When an odor molecule binds
to a scent receptor,

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:15.044
it sends an electrical signal
from the sensory neurons

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:17.774
to our brain's olfactory bulbs.

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:20.495
The signal then continues to other
areas of the brain,

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:22.275
where it's integrated with taste,

00:03:22.275 --> 00:03:23.176
memory,

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:24.530
or emotional information

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.855
before registering to us as a smell.

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:32.015
FMRI research shows that the extra
time spent focusing on scent

00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:35.415
changes the brain of experienced smellers.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:39.099
For them, perceiving and imagining odors
becomes more automatic

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.908
than for non-experts.

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:44.249
To get started yourself, take ingredients
from your kitchen:

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:45.198
spices,

00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:45.808
vanilla,

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:46.690
or fruit,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.510
but never anything toxic.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.250
Close your eyes and have someone
bring them under your nose.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.780
Sniff and try to name the source.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.109
Over time, you'll begin to appreciate
nuances in familiar odors

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.528
and recognize characteristics of new
and unusual smells.

00:04:03.528 --> 00:04:07.941
The perfumer has practiced these steps
enough to become an artist of odor,

00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:10.659
but even if you never pursue smelling
to that degree,

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.931
the spectacular result 
of an unspectacular action

00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:17.551
will change how you sense 
and experience your days.
