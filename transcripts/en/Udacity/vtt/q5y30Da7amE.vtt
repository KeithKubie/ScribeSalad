00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:02.711
So again let’s use our Jersey Square team as an

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.629
example of what customer relationships might

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.013
look like. If you remember we keep talking about

00:00:08.013 --> 00:00:12.728
get, keep and grow. But what does that exactly

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:15.194
look like. What is it that you are doing. Well

00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:17.747
getting customers is just like it sounds. I need to

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.478
acquire them and activate them. And if you

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:24.025
remember Jersey Square team said, my primary

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:27.532
channel will be our own company website. So,

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:31.130
therefore probably my number one way of getting

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.377
customers are Google AdWords. And you can see

00:00:33.377 --> 00:00:35.360
the little experiments that they ran here in the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.794
bottom and they are doing a whole bunch A/B

00:00:36.794 --> 00:00:39.426
testing and Google AdWord testing and Facebook

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:42.015
testing. But they are trying to see whether that

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.966
hypothesis about low cost acquisition is possible.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.903
They’re also doing gross marketing on Facebook,

00:00:47.903 --> 00:00:51.367
YouTube and Twitter and they’re trying to see

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.783
whether they can make their business viral by

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:57.264
actually having customers who refer others. The

00:00:57.264 --> 00:01:00.732
key tenet of virality is can you get other people to

00:01:00.732 --> 00:01:03.337
do your marketing for free. And they are also

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:05.631
going to work on targeted promotions. All these

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.431
right now are hypothesis, but pretty good starting

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:11.655
points. But later on they’re thinking about what

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:14.655
their funnel like in year two or three. How are

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:16.626
they going to keep these customers. Again these

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:19.354
are further out hypotheses but we’re thinking

00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:21.985
about customer royalty programs, seniority

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:24.620
credits, partnership rewards, free jersey

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.557
giveaways. And ultimately can they grow their

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:31.945
customer base? Can they sell their customer

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:35.178
data? Can they have a family plan? It’s not only

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.381
you wear a jersey, but you could have your wife

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.179
and children and we’ll ship the entire box jerseys

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.781
for every game to you. Premium subscriptions and

00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:46.379
possibly you could actually rent out additional

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.678
products like phone fingers, noise makers, funny

00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:52.313
hats etcetera that actually might come in the

00:01:52.313 --> 00:01:56.209
shipping box. And now you’re getting a higher

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.000
average selling price.
