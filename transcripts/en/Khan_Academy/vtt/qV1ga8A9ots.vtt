00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.900
- My name's Claudia, and I am currently

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.850
a freshman at MIT.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.574
I'm from South Florida, and
now my journey continues here.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:10.407
(uplifting music)

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.730
My family is from the Azores islands,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.220
which are in the middle of the Atlantic.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.570
Just knowing that where
my family comes from

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.890
and the lack of education,
they've built me up

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.640
with such important
skills of interpersonal

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.210
communication, team building, leadership

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.930
and now it's just my turn to take

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.887
this and put it in an academic context.

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:32.470
(uplifting music)

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.010
Being a first-generation
high school graduate,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860
first-generation college student,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.280
I didn't really have that background

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580
of really good testing
skills or just the role

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.980
models around me to really show

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.910
me how to do things academically.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.270
Getting the academic support
had to come from somewhere,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.000
and Khan Academy being online, being free

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.790
and available, having SAT prep,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.910
even pairing up with the College Board,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.270
I was able to get accurate
very, very closely-related

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.170
questions, so when I was on the test,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.357
nothing was a surprise.

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:02.453
(uplifting music)

00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:04.930
So whenever it's free,
it's open, it's fair.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.290
And I have that fire in my stomach

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.050
that I know that this
is where I want to be,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.220
this is what I want to do.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.150
I have so many opinions and so many things

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.410
I find wrong with the
world, and I really know

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.740
that this is a place where I can grow,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.390
learn, and gain even more skills

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.511
to be able to do just that.

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:22.344
(inspiring music)
