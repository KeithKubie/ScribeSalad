00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:05.405
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:06.240
I'M JON STEWART.

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:08.509
WE HAVE A VERY, VERY GOOD SHOW
TONIGHT.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:12.613
MY GUEST TONIGHT, HOWARD SCHULTZ
WILL BE HERE.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:14.581
HE'S THE C.E.O. OF STARBUCKS.

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:17.618
ACTUALLY, HE'S JUST HERE TO USE
OUR BATHROOM, BUT I'M MAKING HIM

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:18.952
BUY SOMETHING.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.021
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE U.S.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.391
WE BEAT GHANA 6-0.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.794
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:29.530
[AUDIENCE CHANTING U-S-A!]

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:30.464
&gt;&gt; Jon: HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.867
I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
SCORE WAS.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.803
THEY'RE ACTUALLY, THEY'RE
PLAYING RIGHT NOW.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:40.140
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE
OPTIMISTIC.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:42.643
BUT, LET'S START TONIGHT WITH
OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.578
MESS 'O POTAMIA.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:48.549
AS YOU KNOW, WE WENT INTO IRAQ
FOR ONE REASON AND FOR ONE

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:49.750
REASON ONLY.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.553
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS FIGHT IS
ABOUT IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD,

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:53.420
PLANTING THE SEEDS OF DEMOCRACY.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:56.823
&gt;&gt; THAT SEED OF DEMOCRACY IN
IRAQ.

00:00:56.857 --> 00:01:01.995
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WASN'T ABOUT
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OR

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:04.598
9/11.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.700
[LAUGHTER]
ONCE THOSE REASONS WERE FOUND TO

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.968
BE UNSUPPORTED BY REALITY.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.037
IT WAS ABOUT AMERICA.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.007
IT WAS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
ONE COUNTRY LOVES ANOTHER

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:16.577
COUNTRY VERY MUCH.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.082
[LAUGHTER]
AND THAT COUNTRY THEN DEPOSITS

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:32.426
HIS DEMOCRACY SEED, TYPICALLY
LASER GUIDED, INTO ANOTHER

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.796
COUNTRY'S, LET'S SAY,
FERTILE CRESCENT.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.064
BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK...

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:42.436
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
IF YOU THINK THE SEEDING OF

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.138
DEMOCRACY METAPHOR IS SLIGHTLY
MORE TORTURED THAN MANY OF THE

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:49.176
PEOPLE WE BROUGHT THAT DEMOCRACY
TO, YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.846
&gt;&gt; THE SEEDS OF FREEDOM HAVE
ONLY RECENTLY BEEN PLANTED IN

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.986
IRAQ, BUT DEMOCRACY, WHEN IT
GROWS, IS NOT A FRAGILE FLOWER.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:04.424
IT IS A HEALTHY, STURDY TREE.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.293
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THAT TREE IS

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.794
FAMILY TREE.

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:10.297
IT'S FAMILY MAN, FOR NO MAN IS
AN ISLAND, EXCEPT FOR

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.331
THE ISLE OF MAN.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:11.965
WHERE IS THAT?

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.002
YOU KNOW WHAT? [BLEEPED] IT.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.671
I'M GONNA GO PAINT A CAT.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:21.542
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS THIS: WE
SPREAD OUR SEED ALL OVER IRAQ

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:27.014
AND IT BLOOMED, BABY, UNTIL OLD
JOHNNY O'BAMMY CAME IN,

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:30.284
AND NOW YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT'S
GROWING THERE.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.587
&gt;&gt; THE SEEDS OF 9/11 ARE BEING
PLANTED ALL OVER IRAQ AND SYRIA.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.722
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED?

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:39.393
THEY DONE SWAPPED OUT OUR
DEMOCRACY SEEDS WITH THE SEEDS

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:42.429
OF 9/11.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:46.366
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHY
BURPEE'S EVEN SELLS THOSE 9/11

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.501
SEEDS. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:51.705
THAT'S LIKE, SEEMS LIKE A
LAWSUIT WAITING TO HAPPEN.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.840
[APPLAUSE]
IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY STOCKED ALL

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:54.508
THOSE VENUS DOG TRAPS.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:59.613
IT'S JUST STUPID.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:03.116
[LAUGHTER]
I'M GOING TO GO BEAGLE.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.687
POINT IS ALL THAT GREAT STUFF WE
DID AFTER OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.022
BAD STUFF WE DID IS TOTALLY
UNDONE NOW BY THE ISLAMIC STATE

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:12.392
OF IRAQ AND SYRIA, WHO ARE
CURRENTLY SOWING CHAOS SEEDS.

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:13.727
SO NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.165
WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER IN
THE ORIGINAL RUSH TO WAR, I MEAN

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:22.369
DILIGENTLY PLANNED,
INTERNATIONALLY SANCTIONED

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:30.878
FREEDOM RAVE, THERE WERE SOME
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE WRONG, UH,

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:34.214
ABOUT THE WHOLE [BLEEPED] THING,
JUST WRONG, JUST DEAD WRONG,

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:35.449
LIKE ABOUT EVERYTHING, ALL OF
THEM.

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:39.319
&gt;&gt; LET'S ACT NOW TO GET RID OF
A TYRANT WHO HAS ABUSED AND

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:42.723
KILLED HIS OWN PEOPLE,
WHO IS PROCURING WEAPONS

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:43.957
OF MASS DESTRUCTION, SUBSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT.

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:49.496
&gt;&gt; THE CHOICE IS DISARMING HIM
BY WAR OR LETTING HIM HAVE THESE

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.764
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:53.500
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE DEALING WITH A COUNTRY
THAT CAN REALLY FINANCE ITS OWN

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:54.835
RECONSTRUCTION AND RELATIVELY
SOON.

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:58.906
&gt;&gt; THE BA'ATHISTS WHO USED THEIR
POWER TO REPRESS THE IRAQI

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.174
PEOPLE WILL BE
REMOVED FROM OFFICE.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:03.877
&gt;&gt; Jon: BY THE WAY, YOU CAN HAVE
ALL THESE MEMORABLE SCREWUPS AND

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:07.314
MORE, JUST CALL NOW AND ORDER,
"NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL BEING

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.749
COMPLETELY BLEEP WRONG ABOUT
IRAQ."

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:09.983
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Jon: ANYHOW, SO, BUT

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.752
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, YOU'LL
APPRECIATE THIS.

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.320
I THINK YOU'LL APPRECIATE THIS,
THOSE IDIOTS WERE OSTRACIZED,

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:18.692
NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN, BECAUSE
OF HOW -- I'M KIDDING.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.061
BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL KNOW FOUR
WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.364
AND IN THIS CURRENT CRISIS, THE
NEWS MEDIA HAS CRUSHED TO GET

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:25.666
THE BAND BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.571
AND THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME
ADVICE.

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:34.208
ON BASS... ICALLY WRONG ABOUT
EVERYTHING, BILL KRISTOL.

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:39.279
ON DRUM... MING UP SUPPORT FOR
ENDLESS WAR, PAUL WOLFOWITZ.

00:04:39.313 --> 00:04:43.851
ON GUITAR YOU KIDDING ME, HOW
DOES THIS GUY KEEP GETTING

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:45.452
BOOKED ON TELEVISION, LINDSEY
GRAHAM.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.822
&gt;&gt; THIS STUBBORN-HEADED
PRESIDENT WE HAVE WHO THINKS HE

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:53.861
KNOWS BETTER THAN EVERYBODY
ELSE, WHO WITHDREW TROOPS.

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.663
STUBBORN-HEADED, DELUSIONAL,
DETACHED PRESIDENT, BUT THAT'S

00:04:56.697 --> 00:05:00.300
THE LAST BAD THING I'M GOING TO
SAY.

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:05.272
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; Jon: MY WICKED TONGUE.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:10.344
[LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKING WITH SOUTHERN ACCENT]:

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:15.215
I'M SO BAD... AT FOREIGN POLICY.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.151
NOW POUR ME ANOTHER JULEP.
LINDSEY FEELS A SONG.

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:20.721
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT, LIKE ANY TERRIBLE
BAND, THEY'RE NOTHING WITHOUT

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:24.725
THEIR LEAD SINGER, OLD JOHNNY
ROTTEN.

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:26.493
JOHNNY ROTTEN JUDGMENT.

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:30.364
HIS ADVOCACY OF THE IRAQ WAR WAS
LEGEND, HIS SOPHISTICATED

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:34.535
KNOWLEDGE OF THE REGION
UNPARALLELED, IN THAT IT DID NOT

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:36.503
PARALLEL WITH ANYBODY WHO HAD
KNOWLEDGE OF THE REGION.

00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:41.208
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NOT A HISTORY OF
CLASHES THAT ARE VIOLENT BETWEEN

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:45.445
SUNNIS AND SHIAS, SO I THINK
THEY CAN PROBABLY GET ALONG.

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.349
&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, THAT IS A TRUE
STATEMENT IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:52.519
LONG HISTORY OF VIOLENT CLASHES
BETWEEN SUNNI AND SHIITE.

00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:56.056
AND HE'S RIGHT, THROUGHOUT
HISTORY THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.027
EXAMPLES OF SUNNIS AND SHIAS
PEACEFULLY SHARING POWER LIKE

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.263
WE WERE GOING TO HAVE
THEM DO IN IRAQ. LIKE, UM,

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:08.001
OKAY, HERE'S A GREAT ONE, BACK
IN THE 50s, 950, YEAH, THE

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:12.339
ONLY TIME IT'S EVER HAPPENED IS
OVER 1,000 YEARS AGO IN WHAT IS

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.507
NOW IRAN AND IRAQ.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:21.582
THERE WAS A PRO-SHIITE WARLORD
DYNASTY SHARING POWER WITH A

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:22.416
PRO-SUNNI CALIPH.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:23.550
YEAH, IN 950.

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:26.787
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY COULDN'T
FIND THIS BOOK.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.923
[LAUGHTER]
AND, SINCE JOHN McCAIN WAS ONE

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:32.292
OF THE WRONGEST BEFORE AND
DURING THE WAR, IT'S ONLY

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:35.295
FITTING THAT IN THIS CURRENT
CRISIS HE WAS ON SO MANY SHOWS

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.864
YOU'D THINK HE JUST WON "DANCING
WITH THE STARS."

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.398
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; A DECISION WAS MADE BY THE

00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:41.535
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO NOT HAVE
A RESIDUAL FORCE IN IRAQ.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:46.673
&gt;&gt; WE LEFT TROOPS BEHIND IN
KOREA, IN GERMANY, IN JAPAN,

00:06:46.707 --> 00:06:49.943
EVEN IN BOSNIA.

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.144
THEY ARE STABLIZING FORCE.

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:52.546
WE HAD THE CONFLICT WON.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.614
WE HAD THAT WAR WON.

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.115
AND WE BLEW IT.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:58.452
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND ALL WE WOULD HAVE DO
MAINTAIN THE VICTORY IS STAY

00:06:58.485 --> 00:06:59.253
THERE FOREVER.

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:05.459
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU WIN AT A
CASINO.

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:07.961
AND TO GET THE MONEY, YOU HAVE
TO LIVE THERE.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:11.331
WHY DID OBAMA SNATCH DEFEAT FROM
THE JAWS OF VICTORY?

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:12.933
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED A
TREATY AT THE END OF 2008 THE

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.736
STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT,
WHICH SAID THAT ALL U.S. FORCES,

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:19.406
NOT JUST COMBAT FORCES,
ALL U.S. FORCES, WILL BE OUT OF

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.341
IRAQ BY THE END OF 2011.

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:22.543
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:31.251
ONLY A SECRET MUSLIM KENYAN
TERRORIST VEGAN IS SHREWD ENOUGH

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:39.359
TO ENSURE OUR DEFEAT BEFORE HE
EVER TOOK OFFICE BY JEDI

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:41.295
MIND-TRICKING PATRIOT MAN.

00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:44.031
ACTUALLY, FOR HIM YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY NEED TO USE THE JEDI

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:45.165
MIND TRICK.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:48.035
YOU JUST KIND OF WAVE YOUR HAND
AND HE DOES WHATEVER...

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:51.238
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR TO JOHN
McCAIN, IT'S NOT LIKE

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:52.439
THIS IS JUST HIS IRAQ STRATEGY.
HE IS CONSISTENT.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.275
&gt;&gt; UKRAINE IS GOING TO NEED A
LONG-TERM MILITARY ASSISTANCE

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:57.377
PROGRAM FROM THE UNITED STATES.

00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:01.915
&gt;&gt; QUOTE, "IF THEY KNEW WHERE
THEY WERE, I CERTAINLY WOULD

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:04.952
SEND IN U.S. TROOPS TO RESCUE
THEM, IN A NEW YORK MINUTE I

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:05.652
WOULD."

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:06.720
&gt;&gt; APPROPRIATE USE OF AIR POWER.

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.555
AIR STRIKES ON ASSAD'S FORCE.

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:12.926
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT OLD BEACH BOY
SONG "BOMB IRAN,"

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.962
BOMB-BOMB-BOMB, BOMB-BOMB IRAN.

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.096
ANYWAY...

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:21.835
&gt;&gt; Jon: HA! THE JOHN McCAIN
MILITARY VICTORY PLAN FOR

00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:24.137
AMERICA IS THE SAME AS THE JOHN
MCCAIN MEDIA STRATEGY,

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:28.842
BE EVERYWHERE FOREVER.

00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:29.776
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
