00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.609
The perimeter of the triangle
is 24 feet, 8 + 10 + 6 = 24.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.896
Just like with squares and rectangles,

00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:13.804
to calculate the perimeter of
a triangle, you just add up the sides.

00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:14.500
Nice work.
