00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.340
Today I want to talk to you about matter.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:13.610
Specifically, what happens when it collides
with other matter.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.970
This is a bit of equipment I built for this
year's CHRISTMAS LECTURES, to discuss the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.230
hazards of micrometeoroid impacts in space.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.019
Whether this is with man-made stuff of natural
micrometeroids.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.160
Micrometeoroids are tiny specs of space dust
which become very dangerous at high speeds.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.409
So we built this bit of kit here to demonstrate
that anything can be dangerous it it's going

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.580
fast enough.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.909
Even a carrot.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.369
Using this high-speed footage we were able
to clock the carrots travelling at around

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:48.369
100 metres per second.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:52.970
That's well over 300 km per hour...

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:01.640
which is more than enough velocity to obliterate
a lightbulb, just in case you were wondering.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.900
But the carrot is actually travelling pretty
slowly compared to things orbiting the Earth.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.270
The speed of something in a low earth orbit,
like the International Space Station, is around

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.640
8km/s.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.090
That's just under 28,000 km per hour, which
is almost 100 times the speed of our carrot.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.430
At this speeds, even specks of dust could
be dangerous, posing a huge risk to astronauts

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.930
and spacecraft.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.640
This crack in the window of the ISS is about
7mm in diameter, but is thought to be cause

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.250
by a tiny fleck of paint, no more than a few
thousands of a mm across.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:44.820
So what happens when matter collides at these
extreme speeds and why does it become so dangerous?

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.070
First we need to consider what matter is.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.170
That's easy, you might think: matter is made
of atoms and molecules, right?

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.950
Well, yes and no. In a sense, matter as we're
familiar with it is really formed of chemical

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.650
bonds.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.630
It's the bonds that determine the properties
of matter: how hard it is, how strong it is,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.740
what it looks like.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.380
So when objects collide, really it's the bonds
that are interacting.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.649
It's the bonds that absorb and transmit energy
through the solid to determine the outcome.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.590
Just about the strongest bonds of all are
in diamonds.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.040
Even this tiny thing would require about 12,000
Joules of energy to break all its chemical

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.250
bonds.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.780
But even at a speed of 300 km/h, the speed
of the carrot gun, its kinetic energy by comparison

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.690
would be less than 1 Joule,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.670
and that's why we saw the carrot largely surviving
earlier, because bonds take so much energy

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.250
to break,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.810
and therefore dominate the way matter behaves
in the low-speed world around us.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.310
But at the much higher speeds of space, there's
just so much more kinetic energy in play,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.420
the relationship between speed and kinetic
energy is a square relationship,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.650
which means that if you're going 100 times
as fast, you have 10,000 times as much kinetic

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.510
energy.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.410
If this diamond were travelling at around
11 km/s, it would have a kinetic energy of

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.280
around 12,000 Joules.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.849
So a collision at this energy would be enough
in principle to break every single one of

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.209
its chemical bonds.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.040
What this means is that the high energy collisions
of space make solid matter behave in a way

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.209
that's wholly unfamiliar to us.

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.239
Chemical bonds suddenly become much less important
because they're just not strong enough to

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.670
withstand the enormous energy that each atom
carries into the collision.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.810
Really we have to abandon to some extent the
concept of a solid, because solidity as a

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.010
property of matter is completely dependent
on bonding forces.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.180
Essentially we have to consider objects as
just a collection of unbound atoms, moving

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.010
along together.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.230
As they collide, all of those atoms ricochet
wildly off each other in all directions.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.520
Also, because this surrounding material doesn't
have time to get out of the way,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.530
you end up with lots of atoms much closer
together than they would normally be.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.489
This creates huge pressure, which is a force
that doesn't just act along the direction

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.760
of impact, but in all directions.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.849
What I'm describing here is basically a high-energy
explosion.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.910
When we think of high-speed collisions it's
easy to imagine something like a bullet punching

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.459
its way through a target, leaving a clean
hole.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.959
Instead you get this moving explosion, vaporising
matter and blasting much bigger holes in things.

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.800
This test footage shows the result of a high
velocity impact between a tiny stainless steel

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.160
ball and two aluminium plates.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.089
The ball in only 6mm in diameter, but is travelling
at a whopping 6.7km per second.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.479
This is still slower than the orbital speed
of the ISS.

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.279
Here you can see the dramatic impact of a
6.8km per second impact between a small aluminium

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.620
sphere and a piece of aluminium.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.279
During these sorts of impacts, the pressure
and temperature generated can exceed those

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.089
found at the centre of the Earth,

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:42.449
and this is why tiny specks of space dust
pose such a risk in space.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.189
So how do spacecraft protect themselves from
impacts in space?

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.759
Interestingly, they still mostly use an idea
devised by astronomer Fred Whipple in the

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.080
1940s, before the space age had really got
started.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.999
The Whipple shield takes advantage of the
way impacts spread out in all directions,

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.809
like explosions.

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:03.639
Basically you have a wall made up of several
layers. The outermost layer isn't intended

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.830
to stop the projectile, just vaporise it.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.770
You then have this big gap before the next
layer. This allowsd the vaporised cloud of

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.559
material to expand,

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:16.469
so that by the time it gets to this layer
its energy and momentum are spread out over

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:21.289
a wide area and can be absorbed easily.

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.580
As we can see here, in the first instance
with these two pieces of card together, the

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.969
carrot makes it through and obliterates the
egg.

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:42.990
But with the spacing as in a Whipple shield,
we do a lot better.
