00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Welcome,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.020
we're here at the
Library of Congress.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.320
My name is Stephen
Winick and I'm here

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.670
with my colleague, Valda Morris.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.110
We both work in the
American Folklife Center

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.410
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.250
And we're here interviewing
Barbara Freeman,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.500
who is a prominent storyteller,
who's been telling stories

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.310
around the country for --

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.610
&gt;&gt; Forty-eight years.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.990
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Forty-eight years.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.290
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, we're
interested, first of all,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.890
in your -- in your early life

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.400
and what got you
interested in storytelling.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.780
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well, I
was always the kid on the block

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.610
that had the lemonade stand.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.660
And, so, I learned from my
dad, too, he was a joke teller.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.630
I didn't always understand
his jokes,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.300
which I think was a
blessing as a little girl.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.930
But, my family always told
stories, but on each other.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.290
Remember the time I took the
cabbage and threw it at you

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.570
because you did this, you
know, that sort of thing.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.620
So, that was an early beginning.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.920
And, in high school and
elementary school and college,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.780
I would always enter these,
you know, performance things

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.970
where you get up and
make a fool of yourself,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.430
and I was very comfortable doing
that, and I got a few prizes.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.860
So, that was an encouragement.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.410
And then I loved to listen to
Martha Ray and Carol Burnett

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.200
and other comedians, and so
I could see what kind joy

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.600
that brought me to hear them.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.110
And, so, I wanted to do
that for other people, too.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.380
So, that was kind of a
background for storytelling.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.620
Plus, I worked at the
library in Chattanooga

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.710
as a research librarian,
not official

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.370
with any paperwork though.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.990
I was just a schoolteacher that
decided to be at the library.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.570
And, as a schoolteacher, I
taught reading and told stories

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.380
to my seventh and
eighth grade class,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.510
and I was the only white
teacher in an all-black school

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.390
in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.180
And that -- being
from Tennessee,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.710
it's the volunteer state,
so I volunteered to be one

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.200
of the first teachers, you know,
so we were no longer segregated.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.430
And, so --

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.730
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.030
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
I loved that,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.330
and I loved telling
my kids stories,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.180
and I got a letter right
after I stopped teaching

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.100
and went into the library.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.410
I actually wanted to work
with the government to go

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.430
to disadvantaged
neighborhoods and tell people

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.790
to buy their kids library books,
or give them library books,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.900
because I thought
that was so important.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.740
But, they wanted me not
to do the fieldwork.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.600
They wanted me to be in office
and do interviews and stuff

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.360
like that, and I
said, no, I want to be

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.660
in the field somewhere.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.590
So, I got the job at the
library as a research librarian,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.330
and then I was encouraged
to go to library school.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.000
And they wrote a letter for
me, so I got a full fellowship.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.980
And, so, that was wonderful,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.050
because I failed
all the math exams.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.910
I did. I did.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.130
They thought I didn't
take the test [laughter].

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.090
They said, you aced the English,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.440
but were you sick
for the math part?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.010
And I said, no, I filled
it out as best I could.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.490
But, they gave me a chance
anyway on a fellowship.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.190
So, I got my degree
in library science.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.600
And then they asked me to
be children's librarian

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.030
at Chattanooga, Tennessee.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.330
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Nice.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.630
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: So,
I got to tell stories

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.320
to all the little
elementary kids.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.900
And then asked me to be
the young adult librarian,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.270
head of that department, so
I got to tell the teenagers,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.790
the college right next
door and the students came

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.960
over for drama classes,
and all like that,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.050
so I got to tell
it to the older.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.940
And then I was being
asked to come

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.530
and do young adult
book conferences

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.340
and give a workshop
on storytelling.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.390
And, meanwhile, Connie [assumed
spelling] came up to visit me

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.670
and she said, I -- you know,
I don't have a real job.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.010
I've just been in Europe
traveling in my Volkswagen.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.500
And I said, well,
we need another --

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.840
we need somebody to tell
stories to disadvantaged kids

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.300
that economically are poor
and make them love books.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.160
So, we'll give you a
little book mobile.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.130
You will be called Miss
Daisy [assumed spelling].

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.690
You will wear a daisy outfit on
your blue dress, and you'll go

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.840
to these neighborhoods and tell
stories and hand them books.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.420
And, if the books come back
destroyed because there's five

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.150
or six kids in the same
bed, then you just tell him,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.960
honey, here's another book.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.960
Just put it on top
of your refrigerator.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.100
We want them to love reading
and, you know, love the books.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.540
So, Connie did that
for three years.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.860
I was already there at
the library for a year.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.670
So, after four years we
said, pooey [phonetic],

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.550
we're being asked to come to
folk music festivals and stuff

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.150
and that looks like fun.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.750
Let's become traveling
professional storytellers.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.050
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Oh.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.350
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: And we did.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.570
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow,
so, that was amazing.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.340
So, how did you -- tell me
about your life on the road.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.640
Like, so, you packed up.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.600
You decided to leave your
job after so many years jobs.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.130
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
Yeah, jobs we loved.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.880
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yeah, and then,
so, how did you finance that?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.290
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well,
we didn't have a job --

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.990
or, when we -- when we
quit our jobs and cashed

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.690
in our life insurance and
sold everything we owned.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.120
And, I had a Datsun
pickup truck.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.860
We put a little topper on it
and we were down the road.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.080
But, we had tickets to a major
folk festival near Woodstock

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.140
in New York, Fox Hollow,
and they had famous people.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.700
You know, Joan Baez type
people and stuff like that.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.680
So, we got there as audience,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.640
and our campground was
flooded that night.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.940
It was --

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.240
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.540
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
The water was rising

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.870
from the Little Hoosic creek
all the way up, like three feet.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.510
And, so, they knocked on the
door of our camper and said,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.950
get out of here, get
out of here fast.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.790
And it's like, oh, Connie,
we -- Connie says, now, now.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.120
She's very organized.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.590
And, so, we drove out through
the water and the flood

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.640
and there was a person at the
end of the campground who said,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.050
you all come and camp with
the professional music people,

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.670
the performers, the stars,

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.600
and you can have a
little spot there.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.110
So, we met people during
the day, and at night we set

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.560
up a campfire and we had told
a lot of the stars and a lot

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.690
of people at the
festival, just come over,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.990
we're going to tell stories.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.340
We're traveling storytellers.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:19.620
And at that campfire was Sandy
Patton from Folk Legacy Records,

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.830
and he said, and other
people, Bob Zentz,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.490
I mean some famous
people, and they said,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.730
come on to Connecticut
next week.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.720
We're having a festival.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.590
We've already got
all our booking,

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.420
but if we have time we'll
put you on the stage.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.100
And we got there and he said,
we've only got time for one

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.020
of you, and we'll
put you on the stage.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.250
And, so, they asked
me to tell Wicked John

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.420
and the Devil, and I did.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.870
So, we couldn't get off the
stage before people were coming

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.720
up to us saying, I run a
coffee house in California,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.610
and I'll fly you out to New
York for my coffee house.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.970
And, a teacher came up and said,
I have a daycare center right

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.890
down the street and
I want to hire you

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.340
to come tomorrow morning.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.750
So, and Bob Zentz said, I've got
the Old Dominion Festival next

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.040
month and, I not only want you
to come there and tell stories,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.580
but I want you to
go to the university

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.330
and teach a six-month
course on storytelling.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.630
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.930
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
So, you know,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.230
we didn't have a business card.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.440
We didn't have a name then.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.880
But, in Connecticut
actually, somebody said, well,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.520
if you're concerned about
the word storytelling,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.660
meaning it's going to
just be for three, four,

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.630
and five-year-olds, why don't
you just call yourself The Folk

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.440
Tellers, and then it's
for all the folks.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.290
So, that was cool.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.040
And then another wonderful man
named Bob Donneller ran off

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.780
on his print machine a
little business card for us

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:06.740
and our first brochure,
and it was really sweet.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That is sweet.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.640
So, you mentioned Wicked
John and the Devil.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.500
And now, from what Connie
said, you got that story

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.060
from Ray Hicks and his family.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.680
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Yeah,
actually I have been telling it

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.290
at the library from
Richard Chase's book.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Oh, sure, yeah.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.890
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
Wicked John and the Devil.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.780
I had been telling it
to the young adults.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:34.880
And, also, from -- I actually
had gone up to near Banner Elk

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.360
where there was a
little local festival,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.030
and I had met Ray Hicks
before he even came

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.230
to the National Storytelling
Festival

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.130
in Jonesboro, Tennessee.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:50.620
But, I had met him and I had
heard him tell Wicked John

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.920
and the Devil.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.010
And I showed him, you know,
my book and I said, gosh,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.450
I'd really love to learn that.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.410
And he said, well, you
learn it, you just learn it.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.570
You know, so, I had learned it.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.910
And then when he came a year
later to Jonesboro, Tennessee,

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.060
I asked him to tell it
again to Connie and I.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.530
And, so, we both got to
listen to him tell it,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:15.210
and he tells it much
better than I do, you know.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.520
He's -- I mean, he's
the kingpin.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.820
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yeah.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.300
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, tell
us a little about how you --

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.620
how you came to him
and work with him.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.720
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well,
having met him at Banner Elk --

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.320
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: And
then getting with him again

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.400
at Jonesboro, Tennessee, Connie
and I really wanted to go

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.190
up there and sit on his porch
and just soak him in, you know.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.450
And when we got there
the first time it was --

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.600
it was -- we were fascinated.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.340
He goes from one story to the
other, and it was starting

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.850
to get dark, and it
was cold, you know.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.050
And we were thinking,
man, we've got to go home.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.630
But, he -- there's
no stopping with --

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.760
you know, as soon
as he gets to --

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.370
and he's been happy ever since
with his mom, then he would,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.980
and Jack, he went looking
for a unicorn one day.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.930
And we'd have to say,
Rosa, that's his wife.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.230
Rosa, could you come
in here please

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.350
and tell Ray we got
to leave [laughter]?

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.100
And she would say, Ray,
now you need to hush

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.990
and let these girls go home.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.750
Well, I'll just tell
them about [laughter] --

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.660
and, so, we went
up there so often.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:31.730
And, nowadays, once a year we
have a Hicks family reunion

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.460
with all the neighbors and
friends, and Ed Stivender

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.340
from Philadelphia
drives down for it,

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.610
and lots of storytellers
will drive from all over.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.850
And we just sit around and tell
stories and have a good time,

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.610
even though Ray and
Rosa have passed away,

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.020
and their beloved son, Ted,

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.390
died within just a
couple weeks of Rosa.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.430
And I was with Rosa
right before she died.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.630
I just -- I just -- we just
loved those people so much.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.930
They're family.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.230
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yeah.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.640
So, Ray has been a staple, and
his family has been a staple

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.380
in both you and Connie's lives.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.680
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
And, you know, even,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.260
I was asked to do a --

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.140
play a cast role in a
major motion picture called

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.440
Winter People.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.740
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.080
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: And when
I went to do that movie,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.920
Winter People is about the
mountain people in Appalachia.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.310
And I said, you guys, you know,
Kelly McGillis and Kurt Russell

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.910
and Lloyd Bridges and, I
said, you all have got to go

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:39.040
up with me and sit on the porch
of a winter person [laughter].

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.340
And I took them up there, a lot
of the cast, to meet Ray Hicks.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.640
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Nice.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.940
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: And
they were just stunned.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.960
I mean, it was like -- they
couldn't -- they couldn't --

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.340
and they were there a long time.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.640
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.940
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
Rosa [laughter],

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.740
these movie people have
got a movie to go to.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.040
Can't wink [laughter].

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.090
They were so sweet.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.390
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris:
So, apart from Ray,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.050
do you have any other mentors or
other traditional storytellers

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.980
that you could attest
to and inspire you?

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.160
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well, as
the years went by, yeah, a lot.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.860
Well, like I said, in the
funny world, you know,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.470
for me it was Martha
Ray and Carol Burnett

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:26.830
and other just very,
very funny people.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.100
But, since Connie and I
were kind of the first ones

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.730
out of the gate, you
know, we didn't have any,

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:41.840
except Ray maybe, but we
very soon were able to travel

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.840
to St. Louis to be with
my brother and his family.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.240
And wherever our families
were, you know, we would set

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.870
up jobs there, called
it a library and find

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.450
out what festival
they were having

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.220
and send our little brochure
and see what we could do.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.230
So, we met Gamble Rogers,
and he mostly 90% music,

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.570
but his introductions to
his stories were phenomenal.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.140
And we said, you have got to
come to Jonesboro, Tennessee.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.770
And, so, he inspired me, but
he came with a lot more story

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.110
and a little bit
less music, you know.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.650
But, he was -- I don't
know if you all know this.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:30.420
But, he died holding out his
hand to save a person's life

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.550
in Saint Augustine,
Florida on the beach,

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.150
and Gamble couldn't even swim.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.800
But, a little child
came running up,

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.150
my daddy, my daddy's drowning.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.290
And Gamble looked and he
went out into the water,

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.670
stretched out his hand,
and pulled that man out,

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.980
but Gamble drowned, yeah.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.480
So, and he was like that
in real life anyway.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.810
He was always holding
out his hand to us.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:01.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, thank
you for remembering him here.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.570
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yes.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.170
you mentioned several
times the festival

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.470
that you brought Gamble
to, and other people,

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.090
the National Storytelling
Festival in Jonesboro.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.490
Explain the importance of
that festival and setting you

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.880
on the path of being
a storyteller.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.540
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
Well, the fun thing

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.160
about that festival was
that Jimmy Neil Smith,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.360
who later became the mayor
of Jonesboro, was listening

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.570
to the radio and he heard
Jerry Clower, you know,

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.780
Marcel the chainsaw kind
of comedian on the radio.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.760
And he said, you
know, we ought --

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.660
I'm a journalist teacher here,
I'd like to interview him.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.950
Let's get him here and have
a storytelling festival,

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.640
and we'll have it at the high
school, maybe 3000 people.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.720
Maybe we can pack the place.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.660
And we'll just have a
storytelling festival

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.070
and I'm going to write to
some of the politicians,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.490
stump speakers, and stuff like
that, and get them to come,

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.510
and we'll just have a festival.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.720
And, meanwhile, Connie
had written to him

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.490
and he had written back and
wrote a letter to me, too,

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.350
as the nearby librarian,
and said,

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.330
you all come to the festival.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.800
He didn't -- I don't
think he said

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.840
at that time we could tell
stories, he just said come.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.360
So, we both went, and it was
20 people on the front porch,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:27.450
you know, and we had
the stump speakers.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.460
And then, he said, anybody
out there in the audience want

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.760
to get up here and tell a story?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.060
Well, Connie and
I were, you know,

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.360
just running toward the stage.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.610
We weren't telling tandem then.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:42.370
So, she told a story and then
I told a story on a hay bale.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.430
Ray Hicks got up
and told a story.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.920
And, he stood at
that microphone,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.980
he was a nervous wreck.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.140
He just looked to heaven
and stuttering Jack,

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.670
he was seeking his
fortune, and all this stuff.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.620
And I thought, oh,
this is a mistake.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.470
This is a mistake
because the man's going

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.170
to have a heart attack
and, you know,

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.730
just got to take
everybody to him.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.790
You can't bring him
behind a microphone,

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.730
technology, and stuff.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:13.920
But, the next year, grabbed
that mic, Jack [laughter].

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.040
And, you know, he was
the star from then on.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.660
So, it was -- it was all right.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.990
It turns out all
right, you know.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.840
So, that festival, Jimmy
Neil Smith asked us to be

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.280
on the Board of Directors
along with David Holt

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.980
and a few other people,

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.220
some people from PBS
that were wonderful.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.010
And, so, we allowed
that we would.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.800
Jimmy Neil said he
was going to call

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.680
that festival the
Podunk [phonetic] Hill

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.190
Storytelling Festival.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.320
And we said, you know,
Jimmy Neil, this might grow

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.050
into something kind of big.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:54.560
Connie and I are right here
trying to save storytelling.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.900
That's why we quit our
jobs with the money.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:02.950
And, you know, maybe call
it something really cool

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.720
like a National Storytelling
Festival, or --

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.350
oh, and the organization
could be NAPPS, N A P P S,

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.960
the National Association
for the Preservation

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.410
and Perpetuation
of Storytelling.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.640
Like a bedtime story, a NAPPS.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.000
And, so, that's what
it was called.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.480
It was -- that was really good.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.410
That was my only contribution.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.330
Connie did all the rest
of the work [laughter].

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.830
She's organized.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.130
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris:
That is really neat.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:34.290
I did not realize that you all
were so instrumental in coming

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.100
up with the name and coming

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.440
up with the name of
the organization.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.390
That's really great.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.110
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well,
we had other input, too.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:46.370
I mean, we sat around
and argued [laughter].

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.930
The whole board got in on it.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.230
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: So,
you've been in the field

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.560
of storytelling for 48 years.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.860
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:01.310
if you count my being a
storytelling reading teacher,

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:06.210
you know, you can push
it up to at least 50.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.810
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: All right,
so you've been involved

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.990
in storytelling for
at least 50 years.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.290
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Yeah.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.590
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: And you
are being [inaudible]

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.890
of what we call a revival

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.490
of storytelling,
which was nationwide.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:22.800
How do you see the scene has
grown and changed over time?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.360
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: The
storytelling itself?

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.850
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yes,
the telling of stories.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.830
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well, now
it seems like everybody wants

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.340
to call themselves
a storyteller.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.570
Architects will say, I'm a
storyteller when it comes

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.760
to developing the building.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.450
It's one story after
another [laughter].

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:48.350
But, you know, Tom T. Hall, the
storyteller, country singer.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:53.180
So, but back in the day,
storytelling did mean, oh,

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.960
you're going to sit down with,
you know, a three-year-old

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.210
and tell them a nice little
story, read them a book.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:04.890
So, now storytelling
has a whole new meaning.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.470
We could even go out now and
call ourselves the storytellers

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.790
and be accepted, you know.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:17.300
So, but there was
a real change, too,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.860
in the fact that people
almost never talked

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.860
about their private
life on the stage.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:29.760
They would tell, you know,
a story back in the day

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.390
and traditional and
folklore kind of thing.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.040
But, then it got to be

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:43.350
where even some storytellers
were almost using a psychiatric

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.310
couch, you know, to bring

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:51.880
to the fore their alcoholic
parents or whatever.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.050
So, a lot of things
started to change.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:21:00.530
I think now it's come down to
the personal experience stories

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.020
are just hilarious.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.670
They're wonderful, and
they don't get you nervous

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.070
or stressed out.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.430
They just bring you health
and happiness, you know.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.540
So, I think it would be
great if we went back

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.860
to the real blend
though, at least 50/50

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:22.610
with traditional and, you
know, personal experience.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.430
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Personal experience, yeah.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.300
So, you mentioned before
that you and Connie,

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.570
at that early stage
of your career,

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:32.870
you weren't telling tandem,

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.170
and then at some point
you developed this --

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.470
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
It was very soon.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.770
[ Inaudible ]

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:42.430
When we pulled into a
Connecticut parking lot,

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.660
Bob Zentz had been in
there with Bob Donneller,

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.320
even though Bob lived in
Virginia, he was there

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.990
to perform at the festival,

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.660
which was like two days
later, or one day later.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.630
So, we had -- we were taking
stuff out of our truck

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.660
to take it into the
copy print shop.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.700
And, these little kids were
walking down the street

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.190
and they say, what you all
doing, because we were taking

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:13.390
out suitcases and we were
taking out a little limber jack,

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.970
you know, the little
dancing dolls.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.950
I had a collection of about
80 of them, people would make

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.250
for me at the library.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.500
So, they -- what you doing?

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.380
I said, well, we're
storytellers.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.820
He said, storytellers?

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.940
Well, we want to hear
a story [laughter].

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:34.560
So, we stood there on
our tailgate of our truck

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.210
and we just said, well, why
don't we tell them Wild Things?

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:42.340
And we just started out
with, okay, now, you kids,

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.210
open up your closet door,
put on your wolf suit.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.920
Now, try out a roar or two.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.220
And they were [growling sounds].

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.170
And I said, all right, now,

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.270
we're going to tell
you this story,

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:01.820
because one night Max
wore his wolf suit.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.830
And Connie said, and made
mischief of one kind.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.870
And, I said, and another.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.170
And his mother called
him, Wild Thing.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.340
You know, we went
back and forth.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.120
And, Bob Zentz was across
the street and he walked over

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.130
and he said, that's my
favorite story, you know.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.200
I want you to tell that when
you come to Old Dominion.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.170
So, then we thought,
well, that really worked.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.500
Let's learn some more and
see what we can do in tandem.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.070
So, that was -- we
started very soon.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:43.830
Actually, we left our homes on
July the -- in July of 1975,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.340
even though we had been
telling stories before.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.580
And then, this was like
August or September.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That's pretty quick.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.180
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: So, I mean,

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.480
right away we did
get the tandem thing.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.080
It sounds like it was
pretty easy to develop, too.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.480
It wasn't a big labor.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.780
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
It is so natural

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.770
and so your first cousin stuff.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.070
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yeah.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.370
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: You know,
it really -- it really is.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.950
And we kind of know which
role to play, too, you know.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.560
Sometimes we change it around.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.440
That makes it a little
more interesting, too.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.740
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: So --

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.040
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: We even
knew which side to sit on.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.640
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: If Connie
was in this room right now,

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.530
she'd be right here [laughter].

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:24.830
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yeah.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.600
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: And, so, the
one that was driving the truck,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.010
it had to be a certain one
before we could learn a story

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.310
in the truck.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Oh, right.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:35.910
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
Because we couldn't --

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.210
we couldn't do it like this.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.480
It was too confusing.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.260
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Okay,
so, you've developed --

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.770
over the years you
developed a play.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.120
Can you tell me about this play?

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.420
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Oh, the --

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.720
[ Inaudible ]

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.020
Play was so much.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.550
There's a little
girl, 16 years old,

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.850
named Savannah Dargan
[assumed spelling].

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.040
She's been writing plays
since she was about 10.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.570
And, her daddy is John
Basinger [assumed spelling].

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.340
And John -- they
lived in Connecticut.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.230
And John called taught
theater at his college,

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:12.350
and he also wrote plays and
had, you know, produced them,

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:17.120
directed them, and had either
the students or famous stars

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.030
that came to Connecticut do the
theater pieces in the summer,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.800
like summer stock kind of thing.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.420
Well, John, we had met him
earlier and asked him to come

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.860
to Jonesboro, because he
was also an interpreter

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:38.580
for the hearing impaired
in sign language.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:45.390
And, so, John, we asked John
to come down and help us,

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:51.830
give us something to make
our performance really good

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.350
so we could do a long run
somewhere in Asheville.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.850
We could get off the road.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.460
We'd been on the road
for so many years,

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.340
and sometimes we'd be gone for
an entire month or three weeks

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.860
or two weeks, and Connie
had just got married.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.650
You know, she didn't
want to do that anymore.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:13.200
And we were both getting a
little tired of, you know, it.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:19.690
And, so, John and Savannah
came down and took our stories,

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.640
like kind of tells
this beautiful story

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:27.480
about two white horses, and
he taught us how to make

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.400
that a story told by our great
Aunt Jenny [assumed spelling].

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.940
So, just with a turn of the head
and just a few words, you know,

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.950
she can say, I remember
great Aunt Jenny.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:44.710
She was just a little girl on
the day of her mama's funeral.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.850
And she told us [inaudible]
Amanda Jane [assumed spelling]

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.350
fixed me with her
big brown eyes.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:53.290
She would be into the story,
but we played great Aunt Jenny

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:57.290
and we also played -- she
played Sarah [assumed spelling]

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.290
and I played Jenny Rose [assumed
spelling], and I had to go

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.650
to Detroit to keep
the home place

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.230
from the taxes taking over.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.180
And, so, it was a play
about us being little kids

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.880
that always gave our great
Aunt Olio [assumed spelling]

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.530
a performance.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.590
And, when somebody
would come into town,

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:23.850
like Sheila Adams Barnhill, we
would have her knock on the door

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.090
of Great Aunt Jenny's house,
and we'd say, come on in, girl.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.360
We're just about to
give our Aunt Olio --

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.360
and, so, she would
bring her banjo

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.950
and she would play
for Great Aunt Jenny.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.870
So, sometimes the play morphed
into this wonderful invite

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.500
for other storytellers
and music people.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:52.090
And, we had so many seasons, you
know, like 16 seasons of it ran,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.850
almost eight years, or
right at eight years.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.150
It was -- it was great.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:02.730
It kept us home and we got to
the actress thing, you know.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.330
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Theater
is a little different

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.630
than storytelling.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.260
Storytelling, we like the lights
up so we can see all the people

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.330
and make eye-to-eye contact.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.910
When you're on the theater,
it's really a dialogue

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:19.270
between two actors and you
don't even need an audience

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.590
to have the play happen.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.760
But, with storytelling
you've got to --

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.660
you know, you've got to have
a person to tell the story to.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.530
So, the set was a
little bit different,

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.330
but we made it very
storytelling style in the play.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.490
And, Good Morning America
got us to interview us

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:40.110
and Good Housekeeping
did a nice article on us.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:44.080
And I told my folks, I said,
that's the only way I'll ever be

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.810
in Good housekeeping [laughter]
is through storytelling.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.580
Connie has a nice [inaudible].

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.040
[ Laughter ]

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So, eventually you

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.540
and Connie did part
ways as storytellers.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.820
You went on to solo careers.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.390
How did -- how did that happen?

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.460
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well, that's
kind of an interesting story,

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.090
because Connie and I like to
do everything exactly together,

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.240
after every performance
or before.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.250
No matter where we
were, we loved to go

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.840
in stationery shops
and buy stationery.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.870
We would love to go to yard
sales and look at the antiques.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:25.340
And, we just were like two peas
in a pod, and more like sisters.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:32.490
I was on an airplane one time
and I had all my scandal sheets

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.800
out in front of me, you
know, National Enquirer

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.810
and The Globe and
stuff like that.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:43.180
The Globe even called me
one time and interviewed me,

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.460
and I thought it was the Boston
Globe newspaper [laughter].

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.660
And, so, I was given this
big interview over the phone

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.390
and finally they said, well,
you know, you'll be coming

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.610
out in one of our issues.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.270
And I said, issue?

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.050
We're not even coming
to Boston, honey.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.490
We're not doing any
performances in Boston.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.910
And she said, we're not The
Boston Globe, we're The Globe.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.210
And I said, the scandal sheet?

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.510
I said, what did I say?

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.560
What did I say?

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.710
Tell me what I said.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.520
And she said, no,
you did really fine.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.780
Well, when it came out we were
right underneath Uncle Ike's

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.460
[assumed spelling] ant farm
and a nice picture of his ants,

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.210
and it was really good.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:30.680
It was really good, but that
is how my brother knew I

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.980
had arrived.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.190
I mean, they could care
less that we were, you know,

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:37.000
sort of getting famous
and all this stuff.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.270
But, when he saw in the grocery,
The Globe, with, you know,

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.300
storyteller, I mean, it had a
little headline on the cover.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.750
And he said, surely not.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.470
And he looked it up and saw that
it was a nice article about us

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.200
and our truck, daput [phonetic],

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.450
Datsun pickup truck,
daput, 200,000 miles.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.700
So, I had arrived through that.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.060
But, anyway, I'm
on this airplane

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:06.000
and somebody handed
me a newspaper

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.890
about a miracle happening
in Medjugorje, Yugoslavia,

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.980
a communist country, the
Blessed Virgin Mary appearing

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.540
to some children.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.400
And I hadn't been in a church or
thought about it for 22 years,

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.870
so this is 1987 on
September the 14th.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:28.960
And, so, I'm reading this paper
and it says her first message.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.150
Dear children, I
have come to tell you

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.600
that God exists and
he loves you.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.290
And, for some strange reason,

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.820
I knew in my heart
that it was true.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.980
And, then I went to the
back, like I always do,

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.370
I hate to tell this
because I was a librarian,

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.870
but I always read the
ending of every book.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.220
I don't like surprises.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.120
So, I went to the back.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.900
Her last message
was, dear children,

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.340
reincarnation is
a false doctrine.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.090
You have one body and one soul.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.350
And I thought, dang, because
I was in the New Age movement

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.920
for many years, and I
really believed in that.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.990
And I would tell people,
look, a tulip dies

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.290
and then it comes back.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.890
But, of course, it doesn't
come back as a giraffe,

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.120
but I thought it did it maybe.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.840
And, two weeks before I
had been on an airplane

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:25.570
and the cargo door came loose
and ripped off, and Connie

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.730
and I were told, and
everybody else to get

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.370
in the crash position.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.230
He had no idea why we
were losing altitude.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.090
And, so, we're going down
and I look out at the Statue

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.940
of Liberty and I
said, this is so cool.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.560
The Statue of Liberty.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.960
I'll probably bond with this.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.930
I may even come back as
the Statue of Liberty.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:50.000
And people were praying, and
some were crying, some were kind

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.220
of humming or singing.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.140
And, all I wanted
was a stick of gum

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.110
because my ears were popping
off the side of my head.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:01.740
And I heard a lady say, I
don't want to die with gum

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.170
in my mouth, and
she took out her gun

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.860
and stuck it under her seat.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.060
And I thought, if I wasn't
in the crash position,

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.240
I would go over there and
free up that chewing up.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.920
People were making notes to,
I guess, their loved ones.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.530
No note, nothing.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.480
And then that was two weeks
before we made an emergency

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.130
landing and I didn't
die or come back

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.620
as the Statue of
Liberty, you know.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:34.900
So, to fast-forward, somebody
hands me this miracle newspaper,

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:41.140
and I believe it, and then
our Lord took me off the plane

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:46.510
and he read me the riot act.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:51.660
At that time I was living
with a man for four years

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.900
and we had two houses
together and two cars together.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.420
And, our Lord said to
me, I didn't see him,

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.520
but I heard his voice
and I knew it was him.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.240
I was kind of like
in an egg shell

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.770
or some kind of yellow mist.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.920
And, He said, I call
it fornication

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.560
and it greatly offends me.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.600
You must amend your life.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.450
And he told me two other sins
I was never again to commit

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.080
and put me back on the plane.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:22.330
And it was like, Lord, do
they still call you Lord?

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.210
I didn't even know
you were in history.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:30.320
Look, I don't love you because
I don't know you, but I'm going

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.780
to read about you, I'm
going to discover you,

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.430
and I'm sure I'll grow to
love you but, to be honest

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:38.520
with you, I don't right now.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.350
I'm just scared to
death of my destiny.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:45.100
He didn't show me
hell, but my soul knew

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.610
that that's where I was headed.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:52.800
So, unrepentant sin, you
know, the whole nine yards.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.590
So, it changed my whole life.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.890
So, then I thought I had

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:58.280
to fix everybody else's
life, including my family.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.810
You ought to go to Medjugorje.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.200
You ought to go to Yugoslavia.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.500
It's a communist country.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.800
You ought to go anyway.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.100
There's a miracle over there.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.010
And, so, I did use the
Bible, but I hammered people

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.100
over the head with it, and you
can only take so much of that.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.470
Finally, Jesus told me,
you know, I'm the carpenter

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.700
and I fix things, not you.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.460
But, it was hard on Connie.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.440
It was hard on everybody.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.790
But, I just thought, boy,

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.330
that's the best news
I've ever had in my life.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:31.950
So, I really -- you know, that
changed my life that experience.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:37.970
And I'm grateful for it, but
it also meant that, you know,

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:41.610
I said I now give you chillers,
you know, because I'm not going

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.540
to tell those dark
stories anymore.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.400
I'm going to go for the light.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:51.330
But, it was just -- and I'd
rather go to mass and go

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.990
to church then to go to
the stationery stores

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.600
or go to the yard sales.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.250
So, I should have been a
lot more conscious of Connie

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:06.210
and her needs than I was
trying to make up for lost time

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.420
that I had lost with
God, you know.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.500
So, that's -- was that
answering your question?

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yes [laughter].

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.540
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: What was
your question [laughter]?

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.620
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: No,
that was perfect.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.920
That was perfect.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.680
Because we always wondered,
so you just opened that door.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:29.090
Thanks. So, tonight our program
includes both you and Connie --

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.390
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: I know.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.800
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Back
together again on the stage.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.740
So, what was it like
preparing for this?

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.090
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
It was so much fun.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.880
We met at Connie's house
every time, you know.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.540
We did three sessions.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.060
And, she was telling
me this hilarious story

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:49.010
about Phil [assumed spelling] on
a bicycle ride up the mountain

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:53.660
where you buy these little
clips and, and it was --

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.930
it's clearly one of
the funniest things,

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.270
but she didn't have
a title for it.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:02.370
And, so, Phil came up the steps
and I said, Connie, you're going

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:06.940
to call it Spandex
Versus Leather,

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.700
but that doesn't tell
anybody anything.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.940
I said, we need an
adjective in front of spandex.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.200
And, maybe one in front
of leather, you know,

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.490
to invite people into the story.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.090
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: And Phil
came up the steps and I said,

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.610
Phil, your experience where
you kept falling off that bike

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:26.890
because you forgot to click
out your heels with the --

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:29.690
getting the clips off
for your mountain ride,

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.030
and so you'd fall over.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.060
And then, the bicyclists
would come by

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.610
and say, you all right, buddy?

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:37.440
You'd say, yeah, I'm fine.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.480
It must just be the way
you like to ride then.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.780
You're okay?

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.080
I'm out of here.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.250
So, the funny -- the
story is really involved.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:50.890
But, [inaudible] what would
be an adjective in front

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.170
of spandex, which
you had to wear

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.560
for your big biking experience?

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.100
And he said, dorky [laughter].

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.570
And I said, Dorky Spandex, and
then Connie finished it off

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.460
Versus Macho Leather [laughter].

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.360
So, we had so many laughs.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.970
And then we would stand up and
figure out who stood on the left

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.510
and who was on the right.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.780
And, as soon as we did that,
we were off and running.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.160
We just had the best
time with it.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.460
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Great.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.760
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.790
do you have any favorite
types of stories to tell?

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:26.250
I mean, you mentioned
that you've gone away

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.140
from the dark stories and
toward a certain other kind.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:33.520
So, what's that experience like?

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.880
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
Well, it's wonderful.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.400
But, when I first did that
I would develop stories

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.540
about the saints and
martyrs, and also stories

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.950
of when I would go to
churches and stuff.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.450
Maybe they would want a story
about Billy Graham's wife,

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.900
Ruth Graham, or if it was
an Episcopalian church,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.500
they wanted a story about
their namesake, you know,

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.150
St. Andrew or Saint Philip.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.220
So, I was doing all
this research.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.460
But, when I'd tell those stories
they would appreciate them,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.010
but they wouldn't be as
well developed and --

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:12.880
as the ones that, you know,
I've lived with for 50 years

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.180
or something like that.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:19.070
So, that was a change for me.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:23.400
But, then I started finding
these really wholesome,

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.850
wonderful stories that
really touch your heart.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:27.290
I'm going to tell one tonight.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.810
It's called Old Joe
and the Carpenter.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:37.180
And with that story,
I just started --

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.150
first of all, when I
was on that airplane,

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.260
I asked God to take away
from me my sense of humor

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.150
that could take any conversation
and put it into the gutter.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.620
And I said, could you please
just remove that from me,

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.540
because that's going to be a
hard place for me to return to,

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.300
and I don't want
to return to that.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.600
And, he did.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.930
But, when he -- when he
ripped out the part that --

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.810
he took it all [laughter].

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.810
So, for -- that was another
reason Connie and I had --

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.420
I wasn't funny anymore.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.720
I really wasn't.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.040
And, then when he gave
it back to me, it was --

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.730
it was wholesome and, you know,

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.640
cute little jokes
and stuff like that.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.460
And, so, when I -- I don't know.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:26.010
I found story --
He sent me stories.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.400
God sent me stories, like
the Tale of Three Trees,

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.470
about three little trees
dreaming what they wanted

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:32.770
to become.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.070
And, I just love that story.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.370
It's one of my favorites.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:37.830
The Clown of God, about
the juggler who was so poor

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:43.670
and he juggled in a church
one night on Christmas Eve,

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.650
and he had no gift
to give the child.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.910
But, he decided to juggle.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:53.140
And the baby in the statue
of the Blessed Mother

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.540
and baby Jesus, the baby was
holding onto the golden ball

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.980
at the end of the story.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.590
It's a real sweet thing.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.370
So, I tell just -- I
tell wholesome stories,

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:08.060
but I put my sense
of humor into them.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.820
You know, I tell little side
jokes and stuff like that.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:18.220
Like tonight for Dry Fry, which
is an old grandfather tale,

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.030
I've added that he was
also a veterinarian.

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:23.300
Yes, sir, he was a
veterinarian, and right next

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.810
to his veterinary he had
a little taxidermy shop.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:30.010
It's kind of interesting to have
veterinary next to a taxidermy.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:35.720
But, what's most interesting
was the sign he had out front.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.440
Either way, you get
your dog back.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.450
So, you know, stuff like that.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:43.660
I kind of just inject that,

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:48.070
because that is part
of who I am.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:51.100
And, so, I can do that with
the saint stories, too,

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.760
because there's a lot of funny
things that happen to them.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.430
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.730
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris:
So, you get these.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.320
So, where do you look
for these materials?

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.180
Like, how do you come
up with these materials?

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.480
Do you --

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.150
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well, as a
librarian I really read a lot

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.890
of books, and I know the endings
to all of them [laughter].

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.070
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris:
Of course, you do.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.680
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: And, so,
it's -- and listening to,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.740
you know, the old-timers
and people that I meet.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.780
And, I tell stories -- for
the last five years I've gone

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.310
out to Pisgah View
Dude Horse Ranch

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.070
in Asheville, North Carolina.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.990
It's actually a little
down the road in Candler.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:41.540
And, when I tell stories to
people, I always say at the end

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:47.030
of my little concert that, it's
family reunions and weddings

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.260
and stuff like that out
there all the time, I'll say,

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.930
does anybody have a story?

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:55.230
And, a lot of times, their
stories are just phenomenal.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.850
And the little kids, too.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:00.620
They'll do great stories.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:05.240
So, I get stories from
people and from books and --

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.060
And, how do you then craft
them into your story?

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.330
I mean, how do you make a
performance out of them?

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.460
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well,
one thing I've always done is

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.470
when I hear a story or read a
story I'll tell it immediately.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.540
I'll somebody, even though
I don't know it fully,

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.200
I'll just call somebody, or
I'll get somebody to come over,

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.370
and I'll try it out on them.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.460
And that's the way
I learn, you know.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:32.240
I've never been one to
kind of write it all down

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.550
or anything like that.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:41.670
I just treat a story, each
story as if they are my family.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:44.650
If I tell Dry Fry, he's
one of my family members.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:45.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:47.250
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
He's like my uncle.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.860
And, so, I don't have to
worry about remembering it,

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:57.810
because it's happening on the
spot, in the present moment.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.960
And, I try not to know
the ending of a story,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.100
because I don't want to be
thinking, oh, they're going

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.170
to love it when I get to
that paragraph that says,

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:09.710
I try not to do that at all.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:14.520
I just try to tell it, but
be on the spot with it,

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.270
and picture my family
members and stuff.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:22.690
So, I make it real personal.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:26.230
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: So, you've
traveled both nationally

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.640
and internationally
telling stories.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.280
Can you tell me one of your --

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.540
the most unusual place
that you told a story?

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.950
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Now, that's
a good question [laughter].

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:39.290
That would have been
nice if you had called me

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.010
on the phone [laughter].

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.000
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.560
Well, I'll tell you.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.280
I went to Jerusalem and told
the Tale of Three Trees.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.050
And that's a story about, you
know, one little scene in it --

00:44:56.050 --> 00:45:00.100
in it is the tree that
wanted to look up at the --

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.400
he looked up to the heavens

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.230
and saw the stars
twinkling like diamonds.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.420
And, so, he wanted to be made
into a beautiful treasure chest,

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:11.880
inlaid with gold and silver,
and hold jewels and diamonds.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.850
And, that was his dream
standing on the hillside.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:19.810
The second little tree wanted
to be a sailing ship made

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:24.340
into a large, important vessel
and carry kings to and fro.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:28.580
And, the third one, I just want
to stay on the mountaintop.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.530
I don't want to ever leave.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:33.380
I see the hustle and
bustle of men and women

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.050
and children in the valley.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:39.520
And, I just want to grow
tall, and taller still.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.110
And people, if they want
to see me, they'll have

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:47.460
to raise their eyes, and when
they do, I will point to heaven,

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.720
and perhaps they'll
think of God.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.050
I will be the tallest
tree in the world.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:59.350
And, what ends up is the
first tree is instead taken

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:03.010
to a carpenter shop, once
cut down, and not made

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.710
into a beautiful,
magnificent treasure chest,

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:11.310
but a feedbox taken to a farm
for animals to eat out of it.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.820
And then, that develops
later on.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:19.770
You see that tree years
later as the feedbox.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:21.880
But, it's a cold
bitter winter night

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.470
and golden star light shone
down on the first tree,

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.820
as a young mother placed her
newborn babe onto the hay.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.220
Her husband said, I wish I could
have made a cradle for him.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.330
But, that mother, when she
saw that smooth sturdy wooden

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:40.140
and that golden star
light on her babe,

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.530
she touched her husband's
arm and she said,

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.180
this manger is beautiful.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:47.990
And, suddenly, the first tree,

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:52.810
he was holding the
greatest treasure on Earth.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.420
And the second one and
then the third one.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.320
The third one is the tallest
tree, because she was left

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.530
in the lumberyard, but on a
Friday she was roughly shaken

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:08.340
and removed, carried through
a mob of angry jeering people.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.310
And, she shuddered when a
soldier nailed a man's hands

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:16.590
and feet to her and
she felt sorrow.

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.370
But, on Sunday morning, when
the sun rose, you know --

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:22.280
so, she was the tree
of the cross.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.580
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow, powerful.

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.880
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: And, so,

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.630
those kind of stories I
just -- I love to find.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:29.050
That's synonymous by the way.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
And to tell it

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:31.650
in Jerusalem must have been --

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:32.950
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
And I told it

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.360
in Jerusalem, and it was a hit.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.660
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:43.440
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Because I
had just walked the Via Dolorosa

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.850
and been to Nazareth on my
birthday, as a matter of fact.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.010
I mean, Bethlehem
on my birthday.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.900
They even sung Happy Birthday
to me and Jesus together

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.180
in the same town [laughter].

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.990
It's like all right.

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.290
I'm living high [laughter].

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:03.420
And those little limber
jacks that I told you about,

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:08.190
that I had 80 of them,
I had called Gail Haley,

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.760
she's a famous illustrator
of children's books.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.310
She won the Caldecott
Medal from the Library --

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:15.060
American Library Association.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.780
And, I said, Gail, I
want to go to Holy Land.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:22.200
It's $999 and I'm going
to sell my limber jacks

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.500
and I'm just going to keep two

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.160
for the kids, for
kids' programs.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.840
And, she said, Barbara, I've
seen them at book conferences

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.400
and festivals that
we've been together.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.650
She said, I'm going to drive
down there, spread them out.

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:37.990
And I had Mini Pearl and String
Bean Ackerman, and horses

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.310
and toads and roosters that --

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:42.180
limber jack that
danced, you know.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.480
It was so cute.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.160
And, she said, I'll buy them.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.250
I'll give you $1000.

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.720
And I said, that's wonderful.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.020
Isn't that just like the Lord

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.960
to give you one lousy
book when you get there?

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.050
No, no, it was a blessing.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.470
It was a real blessing.

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:01.720
But, so, yeah, I loved
that trip to Jerusalem.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.500
I've has since been back, too.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.800
It's wonderful.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wonderful.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.390
Well, nothing left except to
say thank you to Barbara Freeman

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:12.600
for participating
in this interview.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.640
I'd asked if there's
anything else that you would

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.850
like to add just for the record.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:19.680
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Well,
Connie and I will tell you,

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.580
storytelling, if it ain't true,
it ought to be [laughter].

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:30.920
No, just that, don't be
afraid of storytelling.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.320
Don't say, oh, I could
never tell a story.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.460
It's like me saying, oh, I
could never play the piano.

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.160
And, right now I can't.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.970
But, if I practiced and if
I shared that kind of thing,

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:46.290
and if I had in my
heart the desire

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:49.510
for that talent,
you just go for it.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:52.810
You tell your story and tell it.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:54.750
You know, don't charge
any money for it.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:58.590
Just go and volunteer at
the local fire department,

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.040
at family reunions,
whatever you can do.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:07.930
And then, if you find that is
your life's dream, live it.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:09.230
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Thank you.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:10.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Thank
you on behalf of myself

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:13.680
and Valda Morris and the
American Folklife Center.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.040
I'd like to thank
Barbara Freeman

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.340
for this wonderful interview.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.640
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: Thank you.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.940
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Thank you.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.240
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman: That
was great, thank you.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.540
Thank you for the
trick questions, too.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.840
It was great [laughter].

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Alright.

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:27.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.180
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: All
righty [phonetic].

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.480
Thank you, that was
wonderful [laughter].

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.160
&gt;&gt; Barbara Freeman:
It was so good.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.400

of the Library of Congress.
