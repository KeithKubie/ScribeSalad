style for things like action bar icons

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869
style for things like action bar icons
 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.400
style for things like action bar icons
and notification icons now this is a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
and notification icons now this is a
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.740
and notification icons now this is a
technique that works with raster icons

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
technique that works with raster icons

things like p.m. G's ideally you'd be

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
things like p.m. G's ideally you'd be
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.569
things like p.m. G's ideally you'd be
starting with vector shapes and things

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
starting with vector shapes and things
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.299
starting with vector shapes and things
like illustrator files or vector shapes

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
like illustrator files or vector shapes
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.540
like illustrator files or vector shapes
in Photoshop and working on those but in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
in Photoshop and working on those but in
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.220
in Photoshop and working on those but in
some cases you simply don't have those

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
some cases you simply don't have those
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.069
some cases you simply don't have those
source materials and in some cases it's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
source materials and in some cases it's
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.500
source materials and in some cases it's
actually really hard to replicate the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
actually really hard to replicate the
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.310
actually really hard to replicate the
the icon using vector shapes so let's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
the icon using vector shapes so let's
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.600
the icon using vector shapes so let's
take a look at how to do this in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
take a look at how to do this in
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369
take a look at how to do this in
Photoshop how to take an existing icon

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
Photoshop how to take an existing icon
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.170
Photoshop how to take an existing icon
and flatten it to better match that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
and flatten it to better match that
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.389
and flatten it to better match that
style the first thing we're going to do

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
style the first thing we're going to do
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.060
style the first thing we're going to do
is open up an existing graphic here

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070
is open up an existing graphic here
 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.729
is open up an existing graphic here
we're going to just tweak the to set up

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
we're going to just tweak the to set up
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.109
we're going to just tweak the to set up
a little bit to make it a little easier

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
a little bit to make it a little easier
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.039
a little bit to make it a little easier
to work with and we're going to create a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
to work with and we're going to create a
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.640
to work with and we're going to create a
new fill layer it's gonna be black and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
new fill layer it's gonna be black and
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.649
new fill layer it's gonna be black and
we're gonna put it at the bottom

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
we're gonna put it at the bottom
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.600
we're gonna put it at the bottom
I guess below the primary layer now the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
I guess below the primary layer now the
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.050
I guess below the primary layer now the
next step is to merge these two layers

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060
 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.840
and then go into the the curves tool and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850
and then go into the the curves tool and
 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.280
and then go into the the curves tool and
this curves tool is going to let you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
this curves tool is going to let you
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.620
this curves tool is going to let you
tweak the brightness values of the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
tweak the brightness values of the
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.749
tweak the brightness values of the
pixels and your icon now these

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
pixels and your icon now these
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.240
pixels and your icon now these
brightness values will in the end become

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
brightness values will in the end become
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.960
brightness values will in the end become
the transparency or alpha values for the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
the transparency or alpha values for the
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.859
the transparency or alpha values for the
final icon so we'll take our black

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
final icon so we'll take our black
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.260
final icon so we'll take our black
background and leave that as black and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
background and leave that as black and
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050
background and leave that as black and
we'll take this gray we'll make that the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
we'll take this gray we'll make that the
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.630
we'll take this gray we'll make that the
the brightest part or the the most

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
the brightest part or the the most
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.429
the brightest part or the the most
opaque part of the icon we will then

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
opaque part of the icon we will then
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.729
opaque part of the icon we will then
select the entire icon just like the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
select the entire icon just like the
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.979
select the entire icon just like the
entire layer we'll copy it into the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989
entire layer we'll copy it into the
 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.910
entire layer we'll copy it into the
clipboard and we'll

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
clipboard and we'll
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.240
clipboard and we'll
a new channel now this channel is going

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250
a new channel now this channel is going
 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.420
a new channel now this channel is going
to be the basically the final alpha

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
to be the basically the final alpha
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.650
to be the basically the final alpha
channel for our resultant graphic and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
channel for our resultant graphic and
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.479
channel for our resultant graphic and
we'll paste that graphic that we have in

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
we'll paste that graphic that we have in
 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.860
we'll paste that graphic that we have in
the clipboard into this alpha channel

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
the clipboard into this alpha channel
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.590
the clipboard into this alpha channel
and this is the big step the key step

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600
and this is the big step the key step
 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.030
and this is the big step the key step
here is to then load this alpha channel

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
here is to then load this alpha channel
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.559
here is to then load this alpha channel
as a selection and that's going to be

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569
as a selection and that's going to be
 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.300
as a selection and that's going to be
using this this button at the bottom

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
using this this button at the bottom
 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.270
using this this button at the bottom
right now now once we have that alpha

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280
right now now once we have that alpha
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.610
right now now once we have that alpha
channel loaded into a selection we can

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
channel loaded into a selection we can
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.860
channel loaded into a selection we can
go back into the layers palette and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
go back into the layers palette and
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.800
go back into the layers palette and
create a new layer and then simply fill

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
create a new layer and then simply fill
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.680
create a new layer and then simply fill
our selection with a foreground color

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
our selection with a foreground color
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.870
our selection with a foreground color
now this foreground color should depend

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880
now this foreground color should depend
 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.210
now this foreground color should depend
entirely on your needs if you're

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
entirely on your needs if you're
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.920
entirely on your needs if you're
creating an action bar icon or you are

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930
creating an action bar icon or you are
 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.800
creating an action bar icon or you are
using the the normal holo dark and holo

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810
using the the normal holo dark and holo
 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.840
using the the normal holo dark and holo
light styling then you can get the right

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850
light styling then you can get the right
 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.490
light styling then you can get the right
color and opacity values from the action

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500
color and opacity values from the action
 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.490
color and opacity values from the action
bar iconography section and the design

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
bar iconography section and the design
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.410
bar iconography section and the design
guide or if you're trying to use a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
guide or if you're trying to use a
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.270
guide or if you're trying to use a
different color that better matches your

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
different color that better matches your
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.520
different color that better matches your
brand this is the point in which you can

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530
brand this is the point in which you can
 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.800
brand this is the point in which you can
put that in then we'll simply fill the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
put that in then we'll simply fill the
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.039
put that in then we'll simply fill the
selection and then deselect our

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049
selection and then deselect our
 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.340
selection and then deselect our
selection and then get rid of the

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350
selection and then get rid of the
 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.310
selection and then get rid of the
original icon and that's it what we're

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320
original icon and that's it what we're
 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.330
original icon and that's it what we're
left with is basically a layer you can

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
left with is basically a layer you can
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.340
left with is basically a layer you can
turn this into a smart object to resize

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350
turn this into a smart object to resize
 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.099
turn this into a smart object to resize
it down to smaller sizes but we're left

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109
it down to smaller sizes but we're left
 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.229
it down to smaller sizes but we're left
with a layer that has a single

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
with a layer that has a single
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.960
with a layer that has a single
foreground color with no special effects

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970
foreground color with no special effects
 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.849
foreground color with no special effects
or anything like that and we can use

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859
or anything like that and we can use
 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.949
or anything like that and we can use
this as potentially a source material

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
this as potentially a source material
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.979
this as potentially a source material
for smaller icons and that's it for

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989
for smaller icons and that's it for
 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.780
for smaller icons and that's it for

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
today's very quick design bite on how to
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.970
today's very quick design bite on how to
use Photoshop to take an existing icon

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980
use Photoshop to take an existing icon
 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.700
use Photoshop to take an existing icon
and flatten it
