00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.286
Today I will begin by talking
about a subject that we were

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:26.250
just getting to at the end of
class last time,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.565
and that will be electrolysis.
And this is an interesting

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.328
topic.
One of the examples of

00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:40.953
electrolysis that is commonly
used is that which forms the

00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:45.000
basis for the so-called Dow
process.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.244
Here, what I am representing is
a container.

00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:20.068
And a container that would be
used to house molten magnesium

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:25.004
chloride.
If you take magnesium chloride,

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:29.545
which is a typical salt,
and get it hot enough,

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:35.910
then it will become liquid.
And when it becomes liquid in

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.429
the melt, what you can do is
carry out a non-spontaneous

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.442
reaction by applying an external
voltage.

00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:50.861
So, the idea is that this is
some source of a potential

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:54.674
difference.
And you can take a positive

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:59.993
electrode and a negative
electrode and immerse it into

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:04.183
the melt.
And if the potential is

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:08.928
sufficiently great,
you can force a non-spontaneous

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:11.966
reaction to run,
because overall,

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:16.711
the reaction will be
spontaneous when you factor in

00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:21.172
the potential difference of the
external source.

00:02:21.172 --> 00:02:26.393
And, in this particular case,
the reaction that would be

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:32.533
taking place is as follows.
At one side we would have

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:37.802
magnesium two plus
ions being reduced to,

00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:42.565
at this temperature,
liquid elemental magnesium.

00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:46.517
So, metallic magnesium at one
electrode.

00:02:46.517 --> 00:02:51.077
And, at the same time,
at the other electrode,

00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:57.157
what would be taking place is
the oxidation of chloride ions,

00:02:57.157 --> 00:03:03.338
two of which counterbalance the
magnesium two plus

00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:08.000
in the salt magnesium
dichloride.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.357
And we put in a couple of
electrons.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:13.725
Sorry, we are oxidizing
chloride to Cl two,

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:17.632
which would be bubbling out as
a gas at the temperatures of

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:20.259
this melt.
You initially would have this

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.818
molten salt.
You would immerse your two

00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:25.378
electrodes.
You would apply an external

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:28.072
potential.
And if that potential is great

00:03:28.072 --> 00:03:32.181
enough, then these two reactions
start taking place at the two

00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:36.374
electrodes.
And you can see that in order

00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:40.140
for this to happen,
chloride is being oxidized.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.807
And so we can see then that
this must be the source of the

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:50.046
positive electrode and electrons
will be going this way and going

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:53.239
down here.
And when they collect in this

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.923
electrode on the left,
they are used to reduce

00:03:56.923 --> 00:04:02.000
magnesium two plus
to liquid magnesium.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.214
So, that is an electrolysis
reaction in which something that

00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:09.571
does not want to happen,
namely the reduction of

00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:13.785
magnesium two plus
to magnesium zero by chloride

00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:18.142
ions, that is non-spontaneous.
And we are forcing it to happen

00:04:18.142 --> 00:04:20.642
by applying this external
potential.

00:04:20.642 --> 00:04:25.000
And just how great must that
external potential be?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.269
Well, Christine,
could you locate for me on the

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:33.352
table, there,
the potential for magnesium two

00:04:33.352 --> 00:04:39.013
plus plus two electrons going to
magnesium

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:44.675
and the potential for
Cl two plus two electrons going

00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:48.944
to two Cl minus?

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:53.863
Note that our standard
potentials that we defined last

00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:58.410
time, relative to the standard
hydrogen electrode,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:05.000
are always written as reduction
potentials by convention.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.017
What is it here?
Can we zoom in on it?

00:05:12.017 --> 00:05:16.000
Zoom in our finger.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.081
Okay.
By the way, I had her do this

00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:28.755
in part because I wanted to draw
your attention to this table

00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:32.000
that is in one of the appendices
of the textbook.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.795
So, it is in the back.
There is an abbreviated form of

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:40.020
this table right in Chapter 12,
which you should be reading.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.102
But when you want to find a
standard potential that is not

00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:48.112
in that abbreviated table,
you will now know that you can

00:05:48.112 --> 00:05:51.836
go to your appendix to find that
reduction potential.

00:05:51.836 --> 00:05:56.061
Christine, please read out to
me the value for the chloride.

00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:58.567
Is that the one that you have
there?

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:00.386
+1.36.
Okay.

00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:04.640
And this is positive of the
standard hydrogen electrode,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.049
showing you that Cl two
is an oxidizing substance.

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:13.149
And then what about the
magnesium plus two

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:14.386
electrons?
-2.36.

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:19.182
Remember I mentioned last time
that elemental sodium was around

00:06:19.182 --> 00:06:23.049
-2.7 volts, so it was a very
strong reducing agent,

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.679
magnesium.
It is also a very strong

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:29.744
reducing agent.
Chlorine is an oxidant,

00:06:29.744 --> 00:06:33.990
so clearly the direction of
spontaneity in this system is

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.388
for a magnesium metal to be
reducing Cl two to make

00:06:38.388 --> 00:06:41.800
chloride ions.
And that is why the form of the

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.123
salt that Henry Dow as a young
man was extracting from the

00:06:46.123 --> 00:06:50.748
briny marshes near his home in
Michigan, and later founded the

00:06:50.748 --> 00:06:54.464
Dow company on the basis of
chemistries like this.

00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:58.028
That is how you found it,
as magnesium two plus,

00:06:58.028 --> 00:07:01.435
2 Cl minus.
And so, overall,

00:07:01.435 --> 00:07:06.996
if you reverse the sign of the
anode reaction and add it to the

00:07:06.996 --> 00:07:11.212
cathode reaction,
you are going to see that this

00:07:11.212 --> 00:07:15.428
one is downhill,
sorry, is non-spontaneous by an

00:07:15.428 --> 00:07:20.451
absolute magnitude of 3.72
volts, which is the difference

00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:25.116
between these two values,
this absolute difference in

00:07:25.116 --> 00:07:29.361
potential.
That means that we are going to

00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:33.399
have to apply an external
voltage of greater than 3.72

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.828
volts, positive,
in order to get this thing to

00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:41.095
run and to be able to get
gaseous Cl two bubbling

00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:45.590
out and in order to get liquid
molten magnesium to be formed

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.323
and separating from the molten
magnesium chloride.

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:51.914
That is a large external
potential.

00:07:51.914 --> 00:07:55.723
That is the price that you have
to pay to make this

00:07:55.723 --> 00:08:02.399
non-spontaneous reaction go.
And that is the minimum price.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:09.426
If we could just briefly switch
to the Athena from the document

00:08:09.426 --> 00:08:13.166
camera.
I want to mention this one

00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:16.000
word, overpotential.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.503
You will see an explicit
definition of the word

00:08:27.503 --> 00:08:32.202
overpotential given in my notes
and in your book,

00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:37.000
but what overpotential is,
in fact, a number.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.833
And it is the amount of voltage
that is greater than this

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:45.008
non-spontaneous cell potential
that you have to apply in order

00:08:45.008 --> 00:08:48.773
for the reaction really to start
kicking in and working.

00:08:48.773 --> 00:08:51.306
In practice,
you choose maybe a couple

00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:54.797
platinum electrodes,
and you dip them into the thing

00:08:54.797 --> 00:08:58.494
that you want to electrolyze,
and you apply an external

00:08:58.494 --> 00:09:01.193
potential.
And, in practice,

00:09:01.193 --> 00:09:05.196
that external potential is
something much greater than the

00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:08.778
cell voltage of interest.
And sometimes it is even a

00:09:08.778 --> 00:09:12.429
large amount in excess.
And the reason has to do with

00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:16.432
the barrier to the reaction,
that is introduced by the way

00:09:16.432 --> 00:09:20.154
that it takes place at the
interface on the surface of

00:09:20.154 --> 00:09:23.103
these electrodes,
so you have to apply some

00:09:23.103 --> 00:09:27.368
overpotential.
That is energy that you have to

00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:31.954
put into the system over and
above the inherent energy of the

00:09:31.954 --> 00:09:35.698
electrolysis to make it actually
work in practice.

00:09:35.698 --> 00:09:40.131
And so, the substance that we
would most like to be able to

00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:44.104
electrolyze is water.
Because, if you think about it,

00:09:44.104 --> 00:09:48.307
electrolysis of water would
produce hydrogen and oxygen.

00:09:48.307 --> 00:09:51.746
And then we could have those in
our fuel tank,

00:09:51.746 --> 00:09:55.491
and we can go ahead and let
combustion take place,

00:09:55.491 --> 00:10:00.000
which produces what?
It would produce water.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.829
You would get a beautiful
complete cycle,

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:06.860
if you could do a good job of
electrolyzing water into its

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.760
components, H two and O
two.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.934
And the reason that that is
difficult is because you have to

00:10:13.934 --> 00:10:17.046
put in energy,
somehow, in order to make that

00:10:17.046 --> 00:10:19.451
non-spontaneous reaction go
uphill.

00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:23.765
We would like to make that the
basis for the hydrogen economy.

00:10:23.765 --> 00:10:27.302
I really love Iceland.
This is my favorite country,

00:10:27.302 --> 00:10:30.658
I think.
Although, I have never been

00:10:30.658 --> 00:10:32.932
there.
And it is, because they do this

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.205
reaction.
They do this electrolysis of

00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:38.216
water every night,
so that they will have hydrogen

00:10:38.216 --> 00:10:41.595
and oxygen for combustion
purposes the next day in their

00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:44.360
buses in the city.
And they are actually doing

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.326
this.
And why are they able to do

00:10:46.326 --> 00:10:48.538
that?
Well, their special location on

00:10:48.538 --> 00:10:52.224
the planet gives them a lot of
free electricity that they can

00:10:52.224 --> 00:10:55.665
use to run the electrolysis of
water to make hydrogen and

00:10:55.665 --> 00:10:59.986
oxygen every night.
And then they can combust that

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:02.900
in their buses.
And you essentially have free

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.086
hydrogen, and it is not a
problem.

00:11:05.086 --> 00:11:08.728
And in places like Iceland or
other places in the world,

00:11:08.728 --> 00:11:12.768
where you have freely available
energy from geothermal sources

00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:16.013
or from hydroelectric power,
then you can do that.

00:11:16.013 --> 00:11:19.589
You can use that energy,
that electricity that is free,

00:11:19.589 --> 00:11:23.496
that the earth is just giving
you, to go ahead and carry out

00:11:23.496 --> 00:11:28.000
the electrolysis of water and
make hydrogen that way.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.093
And we would like to be able to
do that using photochemistry.

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:39.984
One possible way to get the
positive holes in the electrons

00:11:39.984 --> 00:11:44.656
apart is to use h nu.
A photon can impinge on a

00:11:44.656 --> 00:11:50.242
material and lead to the
separation of charge in what is

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:56.054
called a photovoltaic device.
And, if you can interface a

00:11:56.054 --> 00:12:00.849
photovoltaic device to a couple
of electrodes that have surfaces

00:12:00.849 --> 00:12:04.731
that are appropriate,
chemically, for minimizing the

00:12:04.731 --> 00:12:08.004
overpotential,
then you can use light coming

00:12:08.004 --> 00:12:12.114
in from the sun to make
electrolysis of water happen to

00:12:12.114 --> 00:12:16.680
get hydrogen and oxygen from
light that is coming in incident

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.572
on the earth.
And so, one thing that is

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:24.291
currently ongoing research in a
partnership at Caltech and MIT,

00:12:24.291 --> 00:12:28.325
and I am involved with this,
this is Professor Nocera,

00:12:28.325 --> 00:12:31.970
here.
And you will see this furry

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.817
face walking around the hallways
at MIT.

00:12:34.817 --> 00:12:38.467
And he is an amazing guy.
And if he does what he is

00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:42.043
trying to do right,
he is probably going to be the

00:12:42.043 --> 00:12:45.620
next one in our department to
win the Nobel Prize.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.197
So, Professor Nocera is
currently the professor of

00:12:49.197 --> 00:12:52.481
chemistry and professor of
energy here at MIT.

00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:56.496
He is the energy professor.
And he is a lot more voluble

00:12:56.496 --> 00:13:00.000
and vigorous,
I think, than I am.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.199
He is really bouncing off the
walls with energy.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:07.011
And that is good because the
technical challenges that we

00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:11.096
have to surmount in order to be
able to use sunlight to carry

00:13:11.096 --> 00:13:14.295
out water oxidation,
water electrolysis are very

00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:18.039
great, but they come down to
chemistry and to molecules.

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:21.920
And starting on Wednesday,
we are going to enter a part of

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.664
the semester in which we treat
the subject of bonding in

00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:29.000
chemistry in quite a bit of
detail.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.382
We are going to be talking
about molecular orbitals and

00:13:32.382 --> 00:13:34.762
things like that.
And if you get a good

00:13:34.762 --> 00:13:38.207
understanding of molecular
orbital theory and electronic

00:13:38.207 --> 00:13:41.714
structure and the shapes of
molecules, you may be able to

00:13:41.714 --> 00:13:45.535
contribute to this problem by
helping to design molecules that

00:13:45.535 --> 00:13:47.978
can go on the surface of the
electrodes.

00:13:47.978 --> 00:13:51.110
And the purpose of those
molecules is to reduce the

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.367
overpotential for water
electrolysis with sunlight as

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:58.000
the source of the electrons and
the holes.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.013
And this man's entire life is
defined by one number,

00:14:02.013 --> 00:14:06.185
and that is the overpotential.
We are making electrode

00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:10.986
molecules that will bring down
the overpotential and give us a

00:14:10.986 --> 00:14:13.976
free source of clean energy from
water.

00:14:13.976 --> 00:14:17.912
One week from today,
you are going to have a little

00:14:17.912 --> 00:14:21.847
introduction to undergraduate
research here at MIT.

00:14:21.847 --> 00:14:26.097
We are going to have some
visitors who will come in and

00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:30.425
talk to you about the 5.301
subject that is given during

00:14:30.425 --> 00:14:34.320
IAP.
And the people who successfully

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.887
complete the 5.301 subject are
then guaranteed a position in a

00:14:38.887 --> 00:14:43.379
research laboratory in chemistry
as an undergraduate research

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:47.871
opportunities program student.
If you want to get involved in

00:14:47.871 --> 00:14:51.090
the molecular chemistry of
renewable energy,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.283
then you might want to make
sure you are here on time for

00:14:55.283 --> 00:14:58.053
class on Monday,
and you will get that

00:14:58.053 --> 00:15:02.936
introduction.
And you can think about what to

00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:07.768
do in terms of 5.301.
Now, I want to bring you up to

00:15:07.768 --> 00:15:12.694
speed on some more important
concepts that pertain to

00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:16.863
electrochemistry.
Let's talk about electrical

00:15:16.863 --> 00:15:18.000
work.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.250
Here, I want to make an analogy
to the way that electrons can do

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.666
work when they fall through a
potential difference and

00:15:42.666 --> 00:15:45.416
experience a potential
difference.

00:15:45.416 --> 00:15:49.916
I want to make an analogy
between that and the way that

00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:55.000
things go downhill by virtue of
the force of gravity.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.033
And so, you can think of a
waterfall of electrons flowing

00:16:00.033 --> 00:16:05.426
from a place of high potential
to a place of low potential if

00:16:05.426 --> 00:16:11.000
you want to get an idea for our
expression for the way that the

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.764
free energy of reaction is
related to electrical work.

00:16:15.764 --> 00:16:20.977
And it is the total charge that
is passed multiplied by the

00:16:20.977 --> 00:16:27.000
potential difference through
which the charge is passing.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.308
We have been talking about this
potential difference and calling

00:16:37.308 --> 00:16:39.500
it E.
And if it is standard

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.544
potential, then we will use the
superscript zero,

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:47.084
or the little degree symbol for
a standard.

00:16:47.084 --> 00:16:51.213
And now, we want to know what
is the total charge?

00:16:51.213 --> 00:16:56.269
It is going to be negative n
times the charge on the electron

00:16:56.269 --> 00:17:02.000
times N sub A,
which is Avogadro's number.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.592
And we are going to be
interested in getting the total

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:10.750
charge expressed in terms of a
quantity per mole.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.689
Actually, we are going to
express it in Coulombs per mole.

00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:18.981
And so, we combine e and (N)A
together.

00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:22.794
And this is one of our
fundamental constants.

00:17:22.794 --> 00:17:30.632
This is Faraday's constant.
And you will remember that that

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:37.057
is approximately 96,485.3
Coulombs per mole.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:45.724
That is Faraday's constant.
And we will use that as our way

00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:53.793
of expressing charge here.
And so, we get the important

00:17:53.793 --> 00:18:00.517
expression, delta Gr is equal to
negative nFE.

00:18:00.517 --> 00:18:07.526
And we will use that a couple

00:18:07.526 --> 00:18:12.055
of times today in getting access
to other quantities.

00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:15.278
And what is n?
That is going to be the

00:18:15.278 --> 00:18:19.372
stoichiometric number of
electrons passed in the

00:18:19.372 --> 00:18:23.989
half-reaction of interest.
I will show you a couple of

00:18:23.989 --> 00:18:30.000
examples of how you figure out
what n is in this expression.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.009
So, it is the total charge
times the potential difference.

00:18:36.009 --> 00:18:42.018
One of the things that this is
useful for is for finding a

00:18:42.018 --> 00:18:47.183
relationship between an
equilibrium constant and a

00:18:47.183 --> 00:18:52.981
standard cell potential.
And we can do that by recalling

00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:59.412
from chemical equilibrium the
expression that delta G is equal

00:18:59.412 --> 00:19:05.000
to minus RT ln K.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.119
And now we have a new
expression, down here,

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:18.907
for delta G.
And let's go ahead and insert

00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:30.000
that, and we will see that nFE
is going to be equal to RT ln K.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.673
And so, we can just rearrange
that and solve for quantity of

00:19:35.673 --> 00:19:39.711
interest here.
We are going to see that the

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:44.519
equilibrium constant,
K, is equal to an exponential

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:49.326
of nFE divided by RT. And

00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:53.076
this should be for a standard
potential.

00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:57.019
And then this is the
equilibrium constant,

00:19:57.019 --> 00:20:02.500
that special value of Q that
applies when the system is at

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.980
equilibrium.
So, let me put the little

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.732
superscript up here to make it
clear that we are talking here

00:20:11.732 --> 00:20:16.247
about a standard potential.
The idea is then if you have a

00:20:16.247 --> 00:20:20.841
reaction and you can express it
in terms of half-reactions,

00:20:20.841 --> 00:20:24.326
then you can go to our table in
the appendix,

00:20:24.326 --> 00:20:29.000
if those half-reactions happen
to be in the table.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.715
And then you can calculate the
value of the standard potential

00:20:33.715 --> 00:20:37.426
for the cell that would be
comprised of those two

00:20:37.426 --> 00:20:40.596
half-reactions,
as we described last time.

00:20:40.596 --> 00:20:45.157
And then, given these other
quantities, we can calculate the

00:20:45.157 --> 00:20:48.017
equilibrium constant for the
reaction.

00:20:48.017 --> 00:20:51.187
So, it is a useful thing to be
able to do.

00:20:51.187 --> 00:20:54.975
You take a standard cell
potential and then take a

00:20:54.975 --> 00:21:00.000
temperature like the standard
temperature, 298.15K.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.041
And you have your value of F
that I gave you.

00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:06.358
And you can look up,
of course, the value for the

00:21:06.358 --> 00:21:08.293
gas constant.
And you have n,

00:21:08.293 --> 00:21:12.164
from the stoichiometry of the
number of electrons passing

00:21:12.164 --> 00:21:14.444
through this potential
difference.

00:21:14.444 --> 00:21:17.485
And then you can get K.
And you see that this

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:21.563
equilibrium constant K goes up
exponentially as the standard

00:21:21.563 --> 00:21:25.226
cell potential increases.
That is quite an interesting

00:21:25.226 --> 00:21:26.401
relationship,
too.

00:21:26.401 --> 00:21:32.000
And I would like to give you an
example of how we can use this.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Let's consider a possible
reaction of this sort.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.993
This reaction,
of course, as you would see in

00:21:52.993 --> 00:21:57.006
the table of standard reduction
potentials, is assumed to be

00:21:57.006 --> 00:22:00.000
taking place in dilute aqueous
solution.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.729
Actually, if it is in a
standard state,

00:22:02.729 --> 00:22:07.040
the concentrations of the ions
will be taken to be 1.0 molar,

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.554
which is the standard
concentration.

00:22:09.554 --> 00:22:13.793
One thing that I regret about
my lecture on Friday and about

00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:17.816
my lecture today is that I am
not really talking too much

00:22:17.816 --> 00:22:21.910
about molecules and molecular
shapes and what these things

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.791
actually look like in solution.
But normally,

00:22:25.791 --> 00:22:28.775
when you have metal or
metalloid ions dissolved in

00:22:28.775 --> 00:22:31.576
aqueous solution,
there is some number of water

00:22:31.576 --> 00:22:35.168
molecules that are interacting
directly with the metal ions.

00:22:35.168 --> 00:22:37.725
It is just not a so-called
naked metal ion,

00:22:37.725 --> 00:22:40.587
but it is bonded to water
molecules in solution.

00:22:40.587 --> 00:22:44.423
And this is through the type of
Lewis acid, Lewis base chemistry

00:22:44.423 --> 00:22:47.772
that we talked about earlier.
There would really be some

00:22:47.772 --> 00:22:51.000
number of water molecules bonded
here.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.847
And we will look at so-called
coordination complexes in quite

00:22:55.847 --> 00:23:00.048
a bit more detail in the
upcoming section on chemical

00:23:00.048 --> 00:23:04.733
bonding, but this is how you
will find it typically written

00:23:04.733 --> 00:23:07.965
in a book.
And that is not representative

00:23:07.965 --> 00:23:12.569
of the structure in solution,
which you do need to know in

00:23:12.569 --> 00:23:17.417
order to have a little bit of an
understanding of the system.

00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:22.183
And we are going to consider
the possibility that indium may

00:23:22.183 --> 00:23:28.000
react with uranium to provide
indium two plus.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.307
We are going from trivalent to
divalent indium.

00:23:31.307 --> 00:23:35.333
And the source of that electron
is the uranium three plus

00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:39.287
ion going to the
uranium four plus ion.

00:23:39.287 --> 00:23:41.228
There is a hypothetical

00:23:41.228 --> 00:23:43.601
reaction that we want to
consider.

00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:48.058
And we are going to need to be
able to express that in terms of

00:23:48.058 --> 00:23:50.000
half-reactions.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.436
And one of these half-reactions
is simply indium two plus

00:24:01.436 --> 00:24:08.125
plus the electron.
Sorry, indium three plus plus

00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:14.267
an electron going to indium two
plus.

00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:16.961
And, similarly,

00:24:16.961 --> 00:24:20.948
over here, we have uranium
three plus.

00:24:20.948 --> 00:24:27.090
I am writing both of these as
reductions, as you will find

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:33.003
them in the table.
Four plus, plus an electron,

00:24:33.003 --> 00:24:39.117
going to uranium three plus.

00:24:39.117 --> 00:24:42.550
Those are our two
half-reactions.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.197
Christine, can you zero in on
them?

00:24:46.197 --> 00:24:49.522
Yes, you are doing that
already.

00:24:49.522 --> 00:24:52.418
Thank you.
-0.49 for indium.

00:24:52.418 --> 00:24:57.996
And then, when we look at
uranium, these are arranged

00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:01.000
alphabetically.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.285
Here they are in alphabetical
order.

00:25:10.285 --> 00:25:15.355
In the tables they can be
arranged by potential or they

00:25:15.355 --> 00:25:21.081
can be arranged alphabetically.
Sometimes it is easier to find

00:25:21.081 --> 00:25:25.775
a potential by taking advantage
of alphabetization.

00:25:25.775 --> 00:25:30.000
And so, if we can focus in on
that --

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.480
We focus in on that,
and you will see that the 4+

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.000
going to the 3+ is -0.61.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.369
And then you will remember that
to find the standard cell

00:25:48.369 --> 00:25:55.421
potential, E zero of the
cell is going to be equal to E

00:25:55.421 --> 00:26:00.540
zero of the cathode minus E zero
of the anode.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.153
And what we can see here is
that this reaction is going to

00:26:10.153 --> 00:26:14.597
proceed spontaneously as written
because in going from left to

00:26:14.597 --> 00:26:18.095
right, as written,
uranium plus three is going to

00:26:18.095 --> 00:26:22.394
plus four.
So, uranium is the reducing

00:26:22.394 --> 00:26:24.944
agent.
And it is a stronger reducing

00:26:24.944 --> 00:26:28.150
agent than the other possible
reducing agent,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:32.158
indium two plus,
because it is more negative

00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:38.362
than the indium two plus.
And how much more negative is

00:26:38.362 --> 00:26:41.956
it?
It is more negative by +0.12

00:26:41.956 --> 00:26:43.000
volts.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.918
And we, therefore,
because this cell potential is

00:26:51.918 --> 00:26:56.244
positive, we know that this
reaction is spontaneous as

00:26:56.244 --> 00:26:59.020
written.
And it is positive by 0.12

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.583
volts.
That is a spontaneous reaction.

00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:07.000
And now we have all the
information that we would need

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.833
in order to get the equilibrium
constant for this reaction.

00:27:11.833 --> 00:27:15.500
We know that,
in terms of standard potential,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.750
it is 0.12.
Let's see, here,

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:21.000
if we can just calculate this.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.083
All right.
I am going to take this and

00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:10.000
zoom it a little bit.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:37.268
We are going to put in
Faraday's constant of 96,485.3,

00:28:37.268 --> 00:28:46.181
and also we are going to need
the gas constant.

00:28:46.181 --> 00:28:55.287
Everyone remember the value of
the gas constant,

00:28:55.287 --> 00:29:00.785
8.31447?
And now, if we look over at our

00:29:00.785 --> 00:29:05.457
relationship between the
equilibrium constant and the

00:29:05.457 --> 00:29:10.040
free energy over there.
We took a free energy and we

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.904
converted it into a standard
cell potential.

00:29:13.904 --> 00:29:17.588
Now we have it,
so we want to solve for an

00:29:17.588 --> 00:29:21.272
exponential of nFE.
n is one here because,

00:29:21.272 --> 00:29:24.866
in both cases,
we have one electron being

00:29:24.866 --> 00:29:29.000
transferred in the
half-reaction.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.544
We have the exponential of F
times 0.12.

00:29:36.544 --> 00:29:40.796
And then, that is divided by
RT.

00:29:40.796 --> 00:29:45.048
And so we have R times 298.15
K.

00:29:45.048 --> 00:29:53.415
And let me just make sure I get
back over here and get another

00:29:53.415 --> 00:30:00.000
parenthesis in there and see
what it is.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.440
Our equilibrium constant,
for that reaction,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.920
with a separation for the
standard cell potential of only

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.240
0.12 volts, is about 106.
The equilibrium constant says

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.279
that the concentration of these
ions multiplied together divided

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:22.079
by the concentration of these
ions multiplied together is 106

00:30:22.079 --> 00:30:26.079
based on the information
contained in the half-cell

00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:30.000
potentials.
So, that was pretty cool.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.597
And we will now go ahead and
talk about another relationship

00:30:34.597 --> 00:30:36.000
that we can get.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.317
Over there, I was able to give
you that relationship between

00:30:46.317 --> 00:30:50.268
the equilibrium constant and
standard cell potential by

00:30:50.268 --> 00:30:53.707
remembering something from
chemical equilibrium.

00:30:53.707 --> 00:30:57.000
And now, we are going to do
that again.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.391
And we are going to remember
that delta G for a reaction is

00:31:02.391 --> 00:31:05.738
equal to delta G nought plus RT
ln Q.

00:31:05.738 --> 00:31:11.315
That is something that

00:31:11.315 --> 00:31:16.985
you should remember from your
studies of chemical equilibrium.

00:31:16.985 --> 00:31:21.447
And the neat thing now is we
know we have another

00:31:21.447 --> 00:31:27.397
relationship for the free energy
of a reaction that is related to

00:31:27.397 --> 00:31:31.956
electrical work.
We got that up there.

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:34.192
Now we can go,
minus nFE.

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:39.782
Notice that what we are going
here is we are considering what

00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:45.372
happens when we perturb a system
from equilibrium conditions.

00:31:45.372 --> 00:31:50.590
And when might that happen?
Well, I showed you how to set

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:55.434
up a Galvanic cell last time,
and I showed you how to

00:31:55.434 --> 00:32:00.000
calculate its standard cell
potential.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.910
You could measure the standard
cell potential by using,

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.966
externally, a volt meter.
And, as long as you did not let

00:32:07.966 --> 00:32:11.298
the reaction proceed to any
significant extent,

00:32:11.298 --> 00:32:14.919
then you would know the
standard potential for that

00:32:14.919 --> 00:32:17.526
cell.
And what we are going to do now

00:32:17.526 --> 00:32:21.437
is we are going to say,
let's let the reaction proceed.

00:32:21.437 --> 00:32:26.000
Let's let a battery become
discharged, for example.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.914
And, as the reaction is
proceeding, we might want,

00:32:30.914 --> 00:32:34.926
for example,
to be able to make a plot of

00:32:34.926 --> 00:32:40.141
the potential at any particular
extent of a reaction.

00:32:40.141 --> 00:32:45.657
And, in order to do that,
we will develop this equation,

00:32:45.657 --> 00:32:50.772
here, that shows how the
potential at any particular

00:32:50.772 --> 00:32:56.890
point along the reaction going
to completion is related to the

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:00.000
standard potential.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.945
And all I have done now is
substitute minus nFE

00:33:12.945 --> 00:33:17.918
and minus nFE zero
in, respectively,

00:33:17.918 --> 00:33:23.432
for delta G and delta G zero
for the

00:33:23.432 --> 00:33:27.432
reaction.
And now I want to go through

00:33:27.432 --> 00:33:31.972
and divide by minus nF.
And when I do that,

00:33:31.972 --> 00:33:38.675
I am going to get E is equal to
E zero minus (RT over nF) ln Q.

00:33:38.675 --> 00:33:45.669
And this equation is very

00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:51.436
central to electrochemistry.
It is the Nernst equation.

00:33:51.436 --> 00:33:57.951
And you will be able to use the
Nernst equation to predict how

00:33:57.951 --> 00:34:05.000
systems will behave when they
are perturbed from equilibrium.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.089
And one example would be that
of a battery discharge,

00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:12.000
like I was mentioning a moment
ago.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.626
And so, let's kind of pick some
arbitrary material,

00:34:26.626 --> 00:34:31.000
out of which to make a battery.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.910
And we will use the Nernst
equation to get information

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:48.486
about how it will discharge.
And let's consider the

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:53.617
following cell.
It will be one in which the two

00:34:53.617 --> 00:34:59.416
half-reactions are as follows.
Iron two plus plus two

00:34:59.416 --> 00:35:07.000
electrons going to Fe metal.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.339
And the other material will be
cadmium two plus plus two

00:35:12.339 --> 00:35:15.446
electrons going to cadmium
metal.

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:21.174
Now we need the two standard

00:35:21.174 --> 00:35:26.029
reduction potentials for iron
two plus,

00:35:26.029 --> 00:35:27.000
--

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.844
-- which is coordinated in
aqueous solution to six water

00:35:37.844 --> 00:35:42.777
molecules in an octahedral
array, but we will get to that

00:35:42.777 --> 00:35:45.948
later.
And I can see the equation but

00:35:45.948 --> 00:35:50.000
not the value.
And there it is at -0.44.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.333
And now we need cadmium two
plus going to

00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:07.500
cadmium, elemental form.
And we see that it is up there

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.000
at -0.40.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.073
Both cadmium metal and iron
metal are negative of the

00:36:27.073 --> 00:36:32.554
standard hydrogen electrode.
They are both reducing systems,

00:36:32.554 --> 00:36:35.769
as it were.
However, we see that iron is

00:36:35.769 --> 00:36:38.818
more negative.
And, since iron is more

00:36:38.818 --> 00:36:43.846
negative, if we set the cell up,
if we have a piece of cadmium

00:36:43.846 --> 00:36:48.956
on one side and a piece of iron
on the other side in this cell,

00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:53.653
then this piece of iron metal
is going to be providing the

00:36:53.653 --> 00:36:58.104
electrons in this system,
when we go in the spontaneous

00:36:58.104 --> 00:37:02.343
direction.
The electron flow in the

00:37:02.343 --> 00:37:08.201
external circuit will be from
the iron metal electrode to the

00:37:08.201 --> 00:37:13.473
cadmium metal electrode.
And things happen in solution,

00:37:13.473 --> 00:37:18.257
as we've discussed,
but that makes iron the anode.

00:37:18.257 --> 00:37:24.408
And for the reaction going that
way, as we would have set it up,

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:30.266
then we have a standard cell
potential E zero of +0.04 volts.

00:37:30.266 --> 00:37:35.421
And now, in order to apply the

00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:40.023
Nernst equation to answer a
question about this battery --

00:37:40.023 --> 00:37:43.736
and this battery is not a
high-voltage battery,

00:37:43.736 --> 00:37:47.450
it is only 0.04 volts,
not high-voltage at all,

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:51.164
so you probably would not use
it for a battery,

00:37:51.164 --> 00:37:56.007
unless you really only needed a
small potential difference in

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:58.833
the first place -- but,
nonetheless,

00:37:58.833 --> 00:38:04.000
we want to know how we can use
the Nernst equation.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:18.000
We can say, what is E at 80%
completion?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.776
That is the type of question we
can answer using the Nernst

00:38:27.776 --> 00:38:30.905
equation.
What is the potential drop to

00:38:30.905 --> 00:38:35.764
from an initial positive 0.04
volts when the reaction is 80%

00:38:35.764 --> 00:38:39.450
complete?
Under standard conditions,

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:44.352
we have one molar solution on
both sides of the ions.

00:38:44.352 --> 00:38:49.254
So, in this solution,
we would have 1.0 molar candium

00:38:49.254 --> 00:38:53.118
two plus,
and over here,

00:38:53.118 --> 00:38:57.454
in this solution, we have 
1.0 molar Fe two plus.

00:38:57.454 --> 00:39:02.158
Because those are the standard

00:39:02.158 --> 00:39:06.188
conditions, as you will see
written in the header to that

00:39:06.188 --> 00:39:10.074
long table in your appendix,
because you have to define

00:39:10.074 --> 00:39:14.176
standard conditions in order to
have a standard potential.

00:39:14.176 --> 00:39:17.990
And the standard conditions are
1.0 molar of the ions,

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.789
respectively,
in solution.

00:39:19.789 --> 00:39:23.027
At 80% completion,
what will happen is we will

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:27.272
have gone in terms of producing
iron two ions in

00:39:27.272 --> 00:39:31.288
solution.
We are producing them in

00:39:31.288 --> 00:39:36.817
solution as the electrons flow
through the external circuit

00:39:36.817 --> 00:39:41.012
because the piece of iron metal
is the anode.

00:39:41.012 --> 00:39:45.112
And so, what we are interested
in here is Q.

00:39:45.112 --> 00:39:50.069
I am writing backwards.
Pretty soon I will be writing

00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:54.074
straight down or sideways.
In the reaction,

00:39:54.074 --> 00:39:59.317
as written in the forward
direction, we are producing Fe

00:39:59.317 --> 00:40:05.228
two plus ions such
that we can define our Q at this

00:40:05.228 --> 00:40:10.377
80% completion value as 1.8
molar divided by 0.2 molar.

00:40:10.377 --> 00:40:16.319
And that is equal to,

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:20.738
of course, just nine.
Q is equal to nine.

00:40:20.738 --> 00:40:24.936
We have RT, that will be 298.15
Kelvin.

00:40:24.936 --> 00:40:29.023
RF is our number of Coulombs
per mole.

00:40:29.023 --> 00:40:34.740
That is the Faraday constant.
And, in this case,

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:40.444
because in the half-reactions,
you have two electrons rather

00:40:40.444 --> 00:40:44.794
than one being transferred,
n is equal to two.

00:40:44.794 --> 00:40:49.628
If you plug in now,
you have E zero is 0.04 and you

00:40:49.628 --> 00:40:54.075
have RT over nF ln of 9,
that will give you the

00:40:54.075 --> 00:40:59.586
potential at 80% completion,
which is somewhere in between

00:40:59.586 --> 00:41:05.000
0.04 and zero,
as this battery is discharged.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.758
If you want to model the way in
which a battery is discharged,

00:41:09.758 --> 00:41:13.503
you can use the Nernst equation
for that purpose.

00:41:13.503 --> 00:41:17.716
But, there is another type of
cell that is interesting,

00:41:17.716 --> 00:41:22.553
that you can also describe very
well using the Nernst equation.

00:41:22.553 --> 00:41:27.000
This will be what is called a
concentration cell.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.816
Concentration cells are pretty
neat.

00:41:45.816 --> 00:41:50.724
In a concentration cell you set
up a potential difference with

00:41:50.724 --> 00:41:55.310
the same electrode materials on
both sides, just different

00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:00.349
concentrations.
If I were writing this in terms

00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:06.939
of the type of diagram I used
last time, I could show you that

00:42:06.939 --> 00:42:13.421
we could connect two beakers
with a salt bridge like that and

00:42:13.421 --> 00:42:18.822
we could have electrode
materials here dipping into

00:42:18.822 --> 00:42:24.440
solution on both sides.
And, in solution on one side,

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.193
we are going to have Sn two
plus,

00:42:29.193 --> 00:42:33.947
divalent tin ions,
at a concentration of 0.01

00:42:33.947 --> 00:42:39.035
molar.
And, on the other side,

00:42:39.035 --> 00:42:46.162
we will have Sn two plus
at a concentration

00:42:46.162 --> 00:42:51.969
of 0.10 molar.
This one on the left is dilute

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:58.568
by a factor of ten.
That one is the more dilute one

00:42:58.568 --> 00:43:04.913
by a factor of ten.
And we can ask what kind of a

00:43:04.913 --> 00:43:09.735
voltage is set up as a
consequence of just simply

00:43:09.735 --> 00:43:15.964
having different concentrations
of tin ions in the two beakers.

00:43:15.964 --> 00:43:21.189
And we can ask in which
direction the electrons would

00:43:21.189 --> 00:43:26.212
flow in a system like this.
Well, in this reaction,

00:43:26.212 --> 00:43:32.341
the system wants to go from a
state where tin two plus ions at

00:43:32.341 --> 00:43:38.469
0.10 molar
go to the beaker where we have

00:43:38.469 --> 00:43:45.000
Sn two plus ions at 0.01 molar.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.087
We have a potential setup here
that is similar to the way

00:43:49.087 --> 00:43:52.591
osmosis takes place.
The ions want to move from a

00:43:52.591 --> 00:43:57.043
region of high concentration to
a region of low concentration.

00:43:57.043 --> 00:44:01.204
And the system would come to
equilibrium at that time when

00:44:01.204 --> 00:44:05.000
the concentration is the same on
both sides.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.304
And then there would no longer
be any potential.

00:44:09.304 --> 00:44:14.065
The value of E nought for this
cell is equal to zero,

00:44:14.065 --> 00:44:19.010
because we have the same
half-reactions that would take

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:23.498
place on both sides.
So, E nought is equal to zero

00:44:23.498 --> 00:44:30.000
volts in the concentration cell.
And which way do electrons go?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.985
Well, here is how you can think
of it.

00:44:32.985 --> 00:44:37.745
The electrode material can be
made out of tin on both sides.

00:44:37.745 --> 00:44:42.344
And, since tin ions are going
to appear in solution on the

00:44:42.344 --> 00:44:46.943
dilute side, they are going to
jump into solution from the

00:44:46.943 --> 00:44:50.655
electrode itself.
A tin atom that is a piece of

00:44:50.655 --> 00:44:55.092
the metal on the surface of the
electrode will jump into

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:59.369
solution, increasing the
concentration of tin two plus

00:44:59.369 --> 00:45:05.028
on the dilute side.
And, every time it does that,

00:45:05.028 --> 00:45:08.945
we get two electrons racing
through the external circuit,

00:45:08.945 --> 00:45:12.093
going over here,
where those two electrons can

00:45:12.093 --> 00:45:15.800
be used to reduce tin two
ions in solution

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.997
that become a new tin atom on
the surface of the electrode on

00:45:19.997 --> 00:45:23.564
the right-hand side.
That is physically what happens

00:45:23.564 --> 00:45:27.901
to equilibrate the concentration
of tin ions on both sides as a

00:45:27.901 --> 00:45:33.857
function of time.
And so, what we can find is

00:45:33.857 --> 00:45:41.000
that these two values of the
concentrations go into

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
determining our Q in the
following way.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.321
We have Q of 0.1.
Because the tin ions are going

00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:16.925
from a place of high
concentration to a place of low

00:46:16.925 --> 00:46:19.823
concentration,
and electrons are traveling

00:46:19.823 --> 00:46:23.780
through the external circuit
defining the cathode and the

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:27.809
anode in the direction that I
mentioned, the electrons are

00:46:27.809 --> 00:46:32.270
coming out over here.
So, the dilute side is going to

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.272
be your anode.
And we have n equal to two,

00:46:35.272 --> 00:46:39.080
in this particular case,
because it is a two electron

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:43.401
process that converts tin two
plus into metallic

00:46:43.401 --> 00:46:45.891
tin.
You can take these numbers and

00:46:45.891 --> 00:46:48.381
plug them into the Nernst
equation.

00:46:48.381 --> 00:46:51.603
And where you have E nought is
equal to zero,

00:46:51.603 --> 00:46:54.239
n is equal to two,
T would be 298.15.

00:46:54.239 --> 00:46:59.000
We know the Faraday constant
and the gas constant.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.495
We have Q is equal to 0.1,
which is our concentration

00:47:03.495 --> 00:47:07.991
ratio between the two sides.
And, when we solve that,

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:12.746
we are going to find that some
small voltage is produced

00:47:12.746 --> 00:47:16.118
initially at this set of
concentrations.

00:47:16.118 --> 00:47:21.046
I hope that in the last couple
of lectures, today and last

00:47:21.046 --> 00:47:25.541
Friday, I have hammered home the
relationship between

00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:31.075
electrochemistry and energy.
And next time we will go

00:47:31.075 --> 00:47:35.831
forward in talking about
molecular structure and see how

00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:37.764
that is going to play a role.
