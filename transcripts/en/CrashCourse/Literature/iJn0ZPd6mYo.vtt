00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi, I'm John Green.
This is Crash Course Literature.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.020
And today we're going to talk about
the poetry of Sylvia Plath.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.380
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Ugh, I heard she's like
the patron saint of sad teenage girls.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.820
Well, me from the past, once again you're
prejudging an author based on what you've

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.690
heard rather than what you've actually read.
I know this, because I used to be you, and

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.770
I am keenly aware of the fact that you have
not actually read Sylvia Plath.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.620
So, let's actually read some poems before trying
to convince everyone about how smart we are.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:34.000
[Theme Music]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.620
So, Sylvia Plath is often described as a feminist
poet, writing about the plight of women before

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.550
women's rights were a mainstream idea. Like,
essayist Thomas McClanahan wrote "At her brutal

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.180
best -- and Plath is a brutal poet -- she taps
a source of power that transforms her poetic

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.250
voice into a raving avenger of womanhood and
innocence."

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.520
And you though the Hulk was the only raving
avenger. No, there is also 'The Plath!'

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.080
And there is no question that Plath's feminism is
extremely important to her poetry, but she also wrote

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.560
about a lot of day-to-day experiences and made them significant through her use of metaphor and simile.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.020
Former American poet laureate Robert Pinsky
said her poems "throw off images and phrases

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:16.689
with the energy of a runaway horse or a machine
with its throttle stuck wide open."

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.799
Like, here's part of her poem "Cut," which
she wrote about cutting her thumb while cooking.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.880
"What a thrill ---
My thumb instead of an onion.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.450
The top quite gone
Except for a sort of a hinge

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.780
Of skin,
A flap like a hat,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.620
Dead white.
Then that red plush."

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.279
So, she takes a commonplace experience and
turns it into something more, and that's one

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:40.829
of the hallmarks of a great poem. You can
relate to it even though you've never considered

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.069
the particular subject in that particular way.
Like, you understand how she's cut herself,

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.829
and you can picture the piece of skin like
a hat or a scalp on her finger. You know what

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.859
the red plush looks like and the dead white,
and you can almost feel it.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.369
But while you can relate to it, the imagery
is also sort of disorienting. I mean this

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.200
is a poem that begins "What a thrill." And
I think some of us can relate to that feeling

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.309
that injury or destruction can be kind of
thrilling. It's not a healthy thing; it's

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:08.700
not something we want to romanticize, but
it is true.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.250
So, let's talk about Sylvia Plath's biography
in the 'Thought Bubble.' Plath was born in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.280
1932 in Boston. Her father was an entomologist
and wrote a book about bees, which would be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.799
the subject of many of Plath's later poems.
Her mom was a first generation American pursing

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.060
a master's in teaching when she met Plath's
father. Sylvia published her first poem at

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.030
the age of eight. Her father died that same
year.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.780
She was a good student and attended Smith
College and was awarded a summer internship

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.120
at Mademoiselle Magazine. The internship was
the inspiration for her wonderful novel The

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.180
Bell Jar. She said she looked back at the
experience as though looking through a bell

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.950
jar, which distorted it into a work of fiction.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.939
The book tells us the tale of a woman who
finds herself unable to enjoy her summer in

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.219
the city and all the perks that come with
her internship. When she returns home, her

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.790
mother sees her depression and takes her to
a doctor, who treats her extensively with

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.590
electric shock therapy. She continues to get
worse until a benefactor pays for her to go

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.280
to a private hospital where she is treated
appropriately and gets well enough to leave

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.269
the hospital and go back to school.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.840
In real life, Plath's first suicide attempt
was in 1953. She crawled underneath her house

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.959
and took her mother's sleeping pills and said
later that she was "blissfully succumbed to

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.939
the whirling blackness that I honestly believed
was eternal oblivion."

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.540
But she survived at graduated from Smith and
then went on to win a Fulbright scholarship

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.560
to study at the University of Cambridge where
she met Ted Hughes, a poet whose work she

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.189
admired. They married a few months later and
found a mutual interest in astrology and the

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.249
supernatural and a mutual admiration for each
other's work.

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:36.569
In 1962, Plath discovered that Hughes
was having an affair and they separated.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.200
Later that year, she experienced a creative burst
and wrote a book's worth of poems. And then,

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.480
in February of 1963, she took her own life.
She was only 30.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.329
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Oh, it must be time
for the open letter! Abe Lincoln?!

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:56.989
All right, an open letter to suicide. Dear Suicide,
you are a permanent response to a temporary

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.329
problem, and you are a solution to nothing.
I just want to say that at the outset, there

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:08.820
is nothing good or romantic about you, Suicide. You are a tragedy. You are also, in almost all cases, preventable.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.799
Abe Lincoln had periods of intense, paralyzing
depression throughout his life, and he became

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.599
the best president of the United States ever
in history, except for Franklin Pierce. I'm

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.380
kidding, Franklin Pierce. You were the worst.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.669
There is a correlation between depressive
personalities and creativity, but people who

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.460
are suffering from paralyzing depression don't
create anything.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.480
So, it's very important to me when we talk
about a writer whose life ended with suicide

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.139
that we note that people survive depression.
And also that Sylvia Plath wasn't a good writer,

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.919
because she eventually committed suicide.
In fact, her career was cut short and I mourn

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.699
all of the many wonderful books we might've
had.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.680
In short, Suicide, I don't like to say mean
things, but you suck. Best wishes, John Green.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.870
Okay, so Sylvia Plath became the first person
to posthumously win a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.120
for her book The Collected Poems, published
in 1981. But she's best known for Ariel, a collection

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.900
of poems written in something of a poetic frenzy in the months before she died, and published in 1965.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.780
Robert Penn Warren called Ariel "a unique
book, it scarcely seems a book at all, rather

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.640
a keen, cold gust of reality as though somebody
had knocked out a window pane on a brilliant night."

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.100
In the introduction to Ariel, Robert Lowell says that in this book "...Plath becomes herself...everything

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.310
we customarily think of as feminine is turned
on its head. The voice is now cooly amused,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:33.310
witty, now sour, now fanciful, girlish, charming,
now sinking to the strident rasp of the vampire."

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.710
So here are a couple excerpts from one of
Plath's most famous poems, Lady Lazarus.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.400
You can hear me read the whole thing here.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.400
"Dying
Is an art, like everything else.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.639
I do it exceptionally well.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.509
I do it so it feels like hell.
I do it so it feels real.

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.690
I guess you could say I’ve a call.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.650
It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.
It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.030
It’s the theatrical

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.150
Comeback in broad day
To the same place, the same face, the same

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.090
brute
Amused shout:

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.659
‘A miracle!'
That knocks me out."

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.620
"Out of the ash
I rise with my red hair

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.039
And I eat men like air."

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.979
The poem is brutal, and angry, and morbid.
It involves a lot of corpses. But it's also

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.759
a poem of empowerment, and in a weird way,
it's kind of hopeful. It's the kind of hard,

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.000
one hope that you can take with you no matter
how difficult things get.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.159
Lazarus, of course, refers to the Bible story
of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. She's

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.279
imagining herself as rising from the dead,
because she lived through a suicide attempt.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.220
And throughout the poem, she uses repetition
and rhyme so that you can't look away from

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.169
these things that are difficult to face. Every
time your mind starts to wander, there's a

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.680
rhyme that sucks you back in.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.389
And then there are the line breaks, which
are really fascinating in this poem. So, when

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.460
I was a kid, I though that you look a three or four
second pause at the end of every line of poetry.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.360
And that may be the case in many Shel Silverstein poems, but it's definitely not the case in many Sylvia Plath poems.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.540
Now, like when proper poets read from their
poetry, they read it all so slowly that they

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.409
can afford to take a full breath at the end
of each line. But you should treat a line

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:06.590
break as some kind of punctuation, like maybe
it reads as a comma. Maybe it just means there's

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.190
a stronger emphasis on the word before or
after the line break.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.600
One of the pleasures of reading poetry for
me is that I kind of get to be the co-creator

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.159
of the poem by making choices about how to
read it.

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:20.210
Sylvia Plath wrote in her journal once that
she felt as though she lived two extremes:

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.639
"joyous positive and despairing negative."
And we see both in her poems. Like in "Letter

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:28.509
in November," she gives us a glimpse of the
joyous positive.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:32.110
"...I am flushed and warm.
I think I may be enormous,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.070
I am so stupidly happy..."

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.939
And we've all felt puffed up with happiness,
and she finds brilliant words to describe

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:42.519
the feeling just as it is, but I also think
there's something else going on here.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.740
There's a longstanding idea that women should
be quiet and small, right? Like when I'm on

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:52.750
an airplane, men usually sit like blueergh, and
God forbid if a woman takes an armrest on an plane!

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.800
Anyway, in that sense, allowing yourself to
become enormous with happiness is a kind of

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.620
countercultural action. Instead of enormity
being, like, 'unwomanly,' it becomes the perfect

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.820
and most wonderful thing for a woman to be.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.400
So, Sylvia Plath was influenced by writers
like James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence,

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:13.609
but also by Emily Dickinson. And if you watched our episode on Dickinson last year, you'll see that influence.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.139
They both share a preoccupation with death,
but they also both write from the perspective

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:20.310
of women who find themselves trapped by lack
of opportunity.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.710
So along poets like Robert Lowell and Anne
Sexton, Plath is often seen as a member of

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.189
the 'Confessional School of Poetry.' This
so-called poetry of the 'I' dealt directly

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:33.420
with trauma and with relationships, and these
poems were often autobiographical.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.950
But vitally, they weren't just recording their
emotions on paper and then just inserting

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.480
line breaks and rhymes. Confessional poetry
isn't just about capturing the 'self', it's

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.730
also a kind of remaking the 'self'.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.560
That's one of the great things about writing.
And "Lady Lazarus" is actually a really good

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.800
example of this. I mean, in that poem, the
narrator dies, but then is slowly reformed.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.960
The last poem I want to talk about today is
"Tulips," the poem that was included in Ariel,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.060
although though it was written much earlier
than most of the poems in the book. It was

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.180
about a hospital stay in which she was recovering
from an appendectomy.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.830
"The tulips are too excitable, it is winter
here.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.800
Look how white everything is, how quiet,
how snowed-in.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.700
I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself
quietly

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.380
As the light lies on these white walls,
this bed, these hands.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:24.340
I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.120
And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.500
They have propped my head between the pillow
and the sheet-cuff

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.380
Like an eye between two white lids that will
not shut.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.600
Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in."

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.720
For me, this idea of "two white lids that
will not shut" is central to my understanding

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.850
of humanity and our ineradicable hope.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:52.300
Plath is trying to give up and just lie still
in the absolute white, but those two exciting

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.090
tulips are pulling her back into the world.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:01.300
Everything is white and quiet and snowed-in, but
those tulips, we read, are "too red...they hurt me."

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:07.280
This poem, for me at least, captures the difficulty of being a person, but also what's rewarding about being a person.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.140
We are called to attentiveness even when it's
painful.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:15.000
I think Sylvia Plath often gets a bad rap precisely
because her poetry resonates with teenagers.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.900
And I think it's a little bit unfair.
Yes, there are times when she romanticizes

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.120
death and self-injury, and I don't like it
when she does that.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.800
But there is astonishing emotional authenticity
in her poems, and she manages it without irony.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:33.020
And that incredible frankness in Plath's writing
is what I think makes it endure. It all feels true.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.280
Her focused observation of the world around
her, the pupil that has to take everything

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.930
in, that was a great gift to us because by
keeping her eyes open as long as she did,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.990
she helped us to keep ours open. Thanks for
watching. I'll see you next week.
