&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.550
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Short
and sweet this afternoon.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.480
We are going to begin
landing on Earth.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.840
We have three very
promising talks ahead of us.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.720
Leslie Overstreet,
who's the Curator

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.600
of Natural History Rare Books

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.400
at the Smithsonian Libraries
will introduce our next speaker.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.700
Leslie.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.590
[ Applause ]

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.650
&gt;&gt; Leslie Overstreet:
Thanks, Mark.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.590
Actually, before I
introduce our next speaker,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.850
I've been very fortuitously
reminded of something

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.120
that might be of interest
to a number of you,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360
and Mark has given me permission

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.510
to make a very brief
announcement.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.870
The Guild of Natural
Science Illustrators,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.680
which was founded 50 years ago
this year at the National Museum

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.000
of Natural History
just down the street,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.130
is celebrating its anniversary

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.860
with its annual conference
this year here in Washington.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.060
It will be July 15 through 21,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.660
primarily at American
University,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.310
but with at least one day at
the Natural History Museum.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.160
You can get more information
from brochures at the back.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.790
There's a representative from
the Guild here who's happy

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:42.640
to answer questions, and you can
consult their website, GNSI.org.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.790
So now I am very happy

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.560
to introduce Kay Etheridge
as our next speaker.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.740
With a Doctorate in Zoology
from the University of Florida,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.550
Kay is a Professor of Biology

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.310
at Gettysburg College
in Pennsylvania.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.470
She teaches courses in Biology,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.110
Comparative Physiology,
and Ecology.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.260
Her research and publications
have ranged from hibernation

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.010
in lizards, estivation
in salamanders,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.990
and the foraging behavior
of tropical bat species.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.420
Beginning at least 10 years
ago, probably a bit longer,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.630
with her publication
of <i>Loathsome Beasts,</i>

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.920
<i>Images of Reptiles and
Amphibians in Art and Science </i>,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.570
she has been a strong
proponent of the expansion

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.940
of STEM education to STEAM,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.510
incorporating the arts
with the sciences.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.280
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.300
Her focus on the role of
images in plants and animals

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.860
in the history of the
natural sciences led

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.950
to her being a driving force
in organizing and speaking

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.830
at the International Conference
on the 17th century naturalist

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.480
and artist, Maria Sibylla
Merian at the University

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.190
of Amsterdam last summer which
I was lucky enough to attend.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.690
Her talk today will be just
as interesting I'm sure --

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.260
Art and Science Intertwined.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.510
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Kay Etheridge.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:33.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.340
&gt;&gt; Kay Etheridge: Thank
you, Leslie, and thank you

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.020
to the organizers of this event.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.240
It's just something I'm
really enjoying very much.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.610
So to get started here I've
already changed my talk

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.950
with notes from this morning,
so we'll see how this works in.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.890
But some points were made that
I'd like to link to my own talk

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.190
because it's thoughts I've had,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.580
and I think they'll
link very nicely now

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.060
that we're back on Earth.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.380
So I'm going to start
talking about nature images

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.310
with this very sophisticated
one.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.950
This is going to be -- this
is going to be Biology.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.960
I'll just say there's
obviously many kinds

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.730
of nature, but this is Biology.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.650
So I'm going to make
the argument --

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.660
I'm going to talk about the
purposes of these nature images,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.170
meaning Biology images.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.690
What purposes can
they serve aside

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.410
from being aesthetically
beautiful

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.580
and stimulating and inspiring?

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.470
You can -- they can
be decorative,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.670
they can be symbolic,
they certainly can be used

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.370
to influence, you know,
don't smoke in the forest

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.670
and drop your cigarettes.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.370
And I'm going to concentrate
on the information in images

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.960
because as a biologist that's
one way I look at images,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.250
is what information is there?

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.060
And how is this information
presented?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.830
And since I was a child
I liked creepy crawlers,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.600
hence the snakes
and bats and such.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.990
And I'll get back
to this image later.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.500
But there's a tremendous amount

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.470
of information packed
into this image.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.920
There's also the perspective
of the viewer which we heard

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.980
about this morning to
take into consideration.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.060
And here you have your
face-up close in a slice

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.590
of tropical life in
what's going on here.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:25.210
So a little bit about how nature
images have changed over time.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.280
And I'm going to zip through
many millennia very quickly

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.580
on that.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.690
And then slow down as we
get to the Renaissance.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.600
And how have these
images been spread?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.960
How have they been disseminated?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.360
There's a couple
of different way.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.060
We'll talk about that.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.660
And the last thing, and the
most important in a way,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.950
is why are these portrayals
of nature important?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.630
And the biggest point
I want to make is

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.170
that they affect how we
understand and how we think

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.820
about the natural world.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.540
And I think there was
some of this also brought

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.800
into the talks this morning,
but we're just looking at it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.110
on a different level now.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.930
So, I'm going to
use a case study

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.880
on my favorite naturalist
artist, Maria Sibylla Merian,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.300
and that's too immersed in now

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.960
because I'm writing
a book on her.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.950
And so there will be
a lot of her images.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.410
And this is one of
her images as well.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.460
So we're going to go
back 20,000 years.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.380
No, more than that,
because this is B.C., right?

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.230
So nature images have
been around a long time,

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.530
longer than this even.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.530
So, clearly they're important.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.500
You don't go into a cave
with a torch, with materials

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.770
that you've made yourself,
and pigments that you've dug

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.290
up from the Earth, and somehow
go up high and make these images

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.400
of these animals unless
it's important to you.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.490
Why this was important
enough to do, I don't know.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.770
This is not something I work on.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.630
But it's early nature images.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:56.360
Moving forward many millennia,
you've got frescoes in Greece.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.770
And these are somewhat
naturalistic.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.330
You can tell there
are dolphin and fish.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.430
I don't know what the
purposes of these were.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.730
They may have been symbolic.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.460
But they're also showing
what was around them.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.810
There's water all
around and there's fish.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.870
And the fish are important
to their livelihood.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.640
So these images continue.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.210
This is a fairly
naturalistic lion except

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:23.430
for the problem that, if that's
an adult male he would be taller

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.120
than that man on his hind legs.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.960
So here symbolism is important.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.950
This is a king, and the king
can't be smaller than the lion.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.060
The king can't look afraid
in front of the lion.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.570
So even though you've
got a naturalistic image,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.800
it's not about the lion.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.710
It's not about what a lion
looks like or what a lion does.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.450
It's about the king's power.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.200
So this is maybe decorative.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.500
I don't know.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.860
I took this photograph
in the museum in Naples,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.750
but this would have been
on the floor in Pompei.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.950
And it's in pretty good
shape because it was buried

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.890
for a long time by Vesuvius.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.310
And then they excavated it and
looked at these mosaics closely.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.950
Each little piece is about
the size of maybe one

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.660
of your fingernails,
and they portray fairly

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.570
naturalistic organisms.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.240
You can easily tell that's
a squid and a dogfish

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.730
and an ichthyologist could
probably identify a lot

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.410
of these fish to species.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.660
There's enough information there

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.780
to tell you what kind
of fish this was.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.350
Nature images continue on in the
medieval times in many forms.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.800
And in some ways, less
naturalistic than things

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.100
that proceeded them in Europe.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.690
And I just put up three
kinds of books, nature books.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.900
These wouldn't have been
printed books, but handwritten

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.780
and hand-illustrated
before the printing press.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.320
And I always -- when I show
this, I ask my students

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.570
if they know what kind of
plant that is in that herbal.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.530
These were used for medical.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.830
&gt;&gt; Mandrake, mandrake.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.130
&gt;&gt; Kay Etheridge: Right.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.430
And what do you think --
if I say Harry Potter,

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.730
how fast do you think
they'd get that?

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.490
Yeah. So, this mandrake.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.530
They look at the Greek and
Latin, and they don't make --

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.830
get Mandrake out of it.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.220
But they've read <i>Harry
Potter </i>or seen the movies.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.270
So herbals conveyed information.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.740
And the idea would be to -- if
it was an illustrated herbal,

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.420
would be to give you
enough information

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.320
that you would choose the
right plant for a medicine.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.620
And some of the herbals --

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.370
it's pretty hard to
tell what the plant is.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.300
Bestiaries are another
thing altogether.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.620
Bestiaries would
have varying degrees

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.610
of naturalistic representation
of animals,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.040
but that wasn't the point.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.470
The point was to make
-- to tell the stories,

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.100
to have an allegory, to
have a moral, often related

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.920
to the Bible, although a lot

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.100
of these stories were
much older than the Bible.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.400
This is a gorgeous example
that's in the University

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.070
of Aberdeen, and it's online.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.180
You could see images
through the whole thing.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.430
So this is about 1200.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.080
And what is that animal?

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.380
I can't see that.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.680
The slide is blinding.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.980
What is that animal?

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.280
There's lots of them.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.580
What are those?

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.880
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
They're snakes.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.180
&gt;&gt; Kay Etheridge:
They're snakes, right?

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.780
&gt;&gt; Kay Etheridge: Okay.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.270
Snakes arrive coming
out of the fire.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.250
These are salamanders.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.220
So they look nothing like what
we think of as the salamander.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.430
But the Latin text with
this says salamander.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.660
And the salamanders are
poisoning the apples

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.490
and poisoning the water.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.130
So there's information here.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.060
Salamanders are poisonous
and they survive fire.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.480
There's not very
good information

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.630
about what a salamander
looks like, but the monk

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.930
who illustrated this probably
didn't know what a salamander

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.410
was or what it looked like.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.060
So hold that image and hold
the idea of fire and poison

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.680
and salamanders, and
we'll come back to that.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.290
Okay. So in hunting [inaudible].

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.590
These are beautiful.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.890
They're decorative.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.190
But there's information
about how

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.490
to find things you want to hunt.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.630
So these kinds of images
through the medieval period.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:57.010
And then, if I can
go forward here,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.590
in the Renaissance
the rebirth --

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.810
there is a move towards
more naturalism.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.780
And Leonardo de Vinci's sort
of the post child for that,

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.850
and Albrecht Durer's
another one.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.880
And this is the Little
Tuft of Grass of Piece

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.180
of Turf I think is the title.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.420
And it's about -- I'd
say it's about that big.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.780
It's a tiny painting.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.900
I've only see it once in person.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.590
And it's got beautifully
rendered --

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.500
see the dandelion here?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.940
You can tell exactly
what that is.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.960
And then he did animals
and this bunny.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.460
You feel like you could touch
his fur, and it would be soft.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.380
And this is what he thought
a rhinoceros looked like.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.950
So this is not Durer's fault.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.690
If he had even seen a rhinoceros
it would probably be a more

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:44.990
naturalistic rendering.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.290
But he did not see one.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.640
At least we don't think he did.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.550
And he based this
incredibly long-living image

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.000
of a rhinoceros on
notes from someone else,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.300
maybe sketches from
someone else.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.900
I don't actually
recall the whole story.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.310
But this image gets
reprinted all the way

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:05.380
up into 19th century German
textbooks as being a rhinoceros.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.020
So this dissemination of
images changes dramatically

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.780
with the advent of
the printing press.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.030
It then becomes easy to make
images very quickly relative

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.730
to hand-copying each one.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.030
It also makes them
less expensive.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.180
They're still expensive
to the average person,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.730
but they're much less expensive

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.180
than if they're hand-made
images.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.410
So images are spreading faster.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.500
They're not always
spreading accurate

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.870
or naturalistic information, but
they're moving around faster.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:42.570
So here's 16th century herbal
on the right, a page from one.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.640
And I wanted to also bring
out the point about color.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.390
So some of the information in
images is color, and Leslie

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.650
and I were just talking
about this at lunch.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.580
We were talking about this
at lunch because later

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.670
on naturalists actually
used guides

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.730
as to how to describe color.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.650
But if you bought a
book in these days,

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.900
you usually bought it, or print,
you usually bought it uncolored.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.440
To buy a colored copy
would cost much, much more.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.360
And so people would
color them themselves.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.790
So the books you see now in the
Library, in Leslie's library,

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.370
that are colored, changes
are pretty good they were not

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.800
colored by the person who
actually produced the book.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.720
But they were colored later.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.250
And that -- the quality of
coloring, the way it's put on,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.940
whether the colors are natural
or not, varies tremendously.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.420
So colored printing is not
coming along for hundreds --

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.640
for a long time after my talk.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.010
So everything you see
will be hand-colored.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.310
All right.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.170
So in terms of dissemination
of both information and images,

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.090
at the same time you've got the
printing press revolutionizing

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.390
how images are made.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.380
You've got people,
Europeans, travelling the globe

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.380
and collecting things.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.940
Now if you think that
all of the animals

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.300
on the planet are what you've
read about in the Bible or seen

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.280
in a bestiary, you're
going to be surprised

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.730
when you see an armadillo or
a giraffe or a hippopotamus

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.370
or a crocodile in these things

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.950
that start coming back
all over the world.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.970
You're going to see a banana.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.270
Imagine a banana.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.670
And this stuff is coming back
and people are collecting it,

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.020
and collecting is even quite
a competitive sport among the

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.530
people who can afford it.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.840
So people make collection
cabinets,

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.160
and a cabinet can be anything
literally from a small cabinet

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.290
to a suite of rooms if you --
or prints, and can afford it.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.600
And this one is one of
my favorites in part just

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.280
because it does name
Old Worm, Ole Worm.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.100
But he was a Danish Physician,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.560
and this is from a book he had
published about his cabinet.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.990
So they'd make the collection
and they'd publish about it,

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.330
so you've got images
of the collection.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.630
And you can't see it very well,

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.280
but mixed in with baby stuffed
polar bears and naturalia,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.380
or excuse me, artifacts
from humans like kayaks,

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.320
are little art objects,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.700
like there's a little
Giambologna statuette

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.000
over there.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.830
And he also had animals, alive.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:26.370
This is the only known image
made from life of a Great Auk.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.310
They've been extinct
for quite a while.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.990
This was his pet.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.360
And I guess he probably
stuffed it when it died.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.660
But he illustrated it.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.960
He had it illustrated .

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.830
As far as I know he did not
make his own illustrations.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:42.170
So these images -- then
people can see what an auk is

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.610
and they can name it
and they can think

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.120
about its place in
the natural world.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.150
So this brings us
to other travelers.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.760
I like this guy, Pierre Belon.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.890
He would include
like fish recipes

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.680
in his book on great stuff.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.080
He was French after all.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.740
But here's this giraffe.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.640
I believe he made his
own images in woodcuts.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.940
And here's this chameleon.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.890
This chameleon's going to
pop up again later, too.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.270
And he travelled extensively.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.490
I'm just putting in
here, as an example.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.900
And people who travelled
brought things back.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.680
And other people
collected these things.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.820
And this was a collection in
Naples made by an apothecary,

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:29.450
Ferrante, Imperato, and it was
visited by people from all over.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.590
So a part of the grand
tour of a young gentleman

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.260
or scholar would be to go and
visit these collection cabinets.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.200
And then these people made
images of their collections.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.580
They published these in books.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.880
There's a whole book
of his collection.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.510
They brought their little dogs.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.250
But what I want to
focus in on is

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:51.180
in these collections there
are also books and prints.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.620
So the collection is
artifacts and objects,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.140
books and prints as well.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.750
And I've been really lucky
twice to teach a course

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.050
at Gettysburg College
to undergraduates

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.480
where the students made
a collection cabinet

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.930
in the art gallery.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.280
And this was in 2012.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.990
I team-taught it with
Felicia Else, my colleague

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.210
in Renaissance Art History.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:18.760
And the students assembled this,
and these are facsimilie books.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.800
I don't want you
librarians to worry

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.300
that we have actual Aldrovandi's
line out for everyone to fondle.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:32.190
And then this was the one
last fall, and narwhal tusk.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:38.940
This is to show we have Catesby
prints and then we have a gar

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.960
to go with Catesby's gar.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.430
This was the students' idea to
put these pairings together.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.390
And we've got the crocodile
and the alligator skulls.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.310
So the point is these
collections --

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.130
it was just as important for
them to have images as it was

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.560
for them to have the artifacts.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.170
And then if you visited
a collection,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.170
you might make an image and then
share that with your friends.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.370
Or you might document
your collection

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.030
by publishing a book on it.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.340
So the physical object,
the artifact,

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.400
and the images were
very much interwoven.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.830
So here's a painting to
Jacopo Ligozzi who worked

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:20.560
for the Medici and was sort of
loaned out by them, I think,

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.560
to Aldrovandi when he
made his encyclopedia.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.290
Now I want you just to
compare the information

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.590
in these two things.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.190
I scaled it as nearly as I could

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.920
to make the bird's
head the same size,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.270
so let me just flip it back.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.480
That's actually better.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.330
What's the difference
in the information?

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.090
&gt;&gt; The color.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.390
&gt;&gt; Kay Etheridge:
The color's huge.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.140
Yeah, the color is enormous.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.100
But also, once you
start trying --

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.510
if you scale it to
the bird's head,

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.410
you notice the tail's not long
enough in the finished plates.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.310
So sometimes you run out
of space on our plate

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.310
or you woodblock or your page,
even if it's a folio size.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.790
Sometimes you just run out.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.940
So there's more information
in the color.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.020
But if you want to print it
and sell it to a lot of people,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:11.580
obviously you can't hand-copy
this at any cost-effective rate.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.550
So the printing -- you
lose some information,

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.960
but you also can
disseminate it more widely.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.730
Okay. So here's a famous
animal encyclopedia by a Swiss,

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.500
Conrad Gesner, and who's
our star over here.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.880
Well, we've seen him before.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.180
That's Belon's [inaudible].

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.480
It's oriented differently.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.100
He credits Belon for this.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.250
So this information that was
collected is now in an image

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.290
that more people can see
in this encyclopedia.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.560
And guess who's also back
in this encyclopedia?

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.390
Yeah. So sometimes you
can tell -- notice the --

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.950
isn't he facing the
opposite direction there?

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.510
Yeah. So when you
copy something,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.100
and then it's printed, it flips.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.270
So you can sort of watch these
things flip back and forth

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.320
which is fun, and it's not
identical to [inaudible] print,

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.720
but it's pretty close.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.150
There's actually a
mistake in the toe position

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.630
of the chameleon in this one,

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.510
but only a herpetologist
like me would notice.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.690
So Gesner did something
really interesting.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.480
He did not just compile
other people's information.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.000
He look at mythical salamanders.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.240
Now this is our salamanders,
not snake-like,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.270
but it's hairy, which is weird.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:29.140
And then he had his artists
draw a European fire salamander,

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.920
they're called fire
salamanders, from a specimen.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.250
And just for fun, there's
what they look like.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.690
Little snub-nosed
things, color pattern.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.910
And if you look up close at
those dots on the back --

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.580
-- those are poison glands.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.020
So the beast theory
wasn't entirely wrong.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.180
You wouldn't kill an adult human
with the poison from these,

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.700
but this protects them
against predators.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.490
They are poisonous.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.230
So what's the story with
them surviving fire?

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.520
Well, they hibernate in rotting
logs and under the bark of logs.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.080
So the peasant brings the wood
in, throws it on the fire.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.920
Salamander thaws out and
does I am out of here.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.470
Goes, you know, running
out of the fire.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.750
And they think, oh, they
sprang from the fire.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.960
So there's -- some of these
stories and myths have more

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.850
to them than you might imagine.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.670
So, jumping forward
another hundred years.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.940
This is our protagonist.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.260
Pretty pearl earrings and
very lady-like, but she ends

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:36.660
up at some point going
through the jungle of Suriname

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.990
in South America and making
pictures of bird-eating spiders.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.920
So she was quite intrepid.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.020
But more than that, she
studied the life cycles of moths

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.760
and butterflies on
the post plants

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.270
of the moths and butterflies.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.990
And this is where I
want to make the point

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.450
that she changed how
we viewed nature.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.230
She put plants and animals
together before anybody did

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.040
in a way that was
ecologically relevant,

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.720
not just to be decorative,

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.460
but that species
does eat that plant.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.400
So that's the story I
want to focus on now.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.740
So she was born into a
publishing and printing family.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.080
I'll come back to
them in a minute.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.350
But her father died when
she was about three,

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.790
and her mother remarried
this guy, Jacob Marrel,

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.920
who was a very good still-life
painter and included insects.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.440
There's a butterfly
up there somewhere.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.620
But he also did portraits
of tulips

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.960
for people who collected tulips.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.590
And he decorated these
with little insects.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.520
And as far as I can tell,
he's the only tulip painter

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.380
who made these tulip
portraits that put in insects

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.190
and he shows them
eating the plant leaves.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.800
Most people wanted
their tulip portraits

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.100
to be perfect, not damaged.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.900
And he trained her.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.740
And I think she was
very influenced by him.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.760
But the family firm --
these are her stepbrothers.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.400
And they published this
encyclopedia of insects.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.050
And the interest thing about
this is she would have grown

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.180
up with this stuff in
the house probably.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.850
This is a plate that's many,
many pages before this plate,

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.150
so the adults are here.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.580
Many, many pages later
are the caterpillars.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.510
And there's no association
made between them

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.490
and there's no food plants.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.480
It's just specimens on a page.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.780
And they're categorizing them

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.280
by whether the caterpillars
are furry or not furry.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.450
So they're trying to
understand all of this nature,

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.580
but they're not putting
it in any natural context.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.810
They're not putting it
in an ecological context.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.450
And that's where
Merian comes along.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.550
She had one person before her
who looked at the life cycles

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.770
of these, and put the
caterpillars and adults together

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.400
and the pupae, and this
was Johannes Goedaert,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.230
a Dutchman who published
his book a little more

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.770
than a decade before
she published hers.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.070
And she read it.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.370
She knew his work.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.840
But notice, no plants.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.780
And sometimes not even
the full lifecycle.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.560
He wasn't as successful as she
was at raising them all the way

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.860
through the lifecycle.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.020
But still good work,
very good work.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.070
She comes along and at the age

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.470
of 32 publishes what she calls
her first caterpillar book,

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.320
<i>Raupen </i>, German
for caterpillar.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.850
And that's the frontispiece.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:22.150
And she publishes two more

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.270
in her lifetime plus
a third tropical book

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.570
which we'll get to.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.360
She studied insects for --

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.350
we know she started when she
was 13, she wrote it herself,

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.430
and probably until
she died at 70.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.200
So for more than five
decades she studied insects.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.850
More than 300 species
of insects.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.040
But she's best know
today for being an artist

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.910
because she produced these
beautiful compositions.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.380
So here we've got
one that's colored,

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.630
and here we've got
the etching engraving.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.100
She was taught to make
prints, so in her books,

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.790
all of these books, she did --
she raised all of the insects,

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:04.070
she painted them, she engraved
the plates and/or etched.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.860
I need to talk to some
expert about that.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.400
And she wrote the text
and she marketed them.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.490
She had a lot of control
over the process which led

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.290
to interesting output.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:21.620
So just to show you in terms of
information, here is Goedaert

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.900
and the same species by Merian.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.190
So that caterpillar
eats that plant.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:34.950
And she has not only the
pupae, but she has the eggs.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.710
And Goedaert's still talking
about spontaneous generation

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.800
of insects in his book.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.970
He says, they're born
on the wind in one case.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.300
He talks about eggs sometimes,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.980
so he's not even
internally consistent.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.560
But he didn't quite believe
that all of them came from eggs.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.860
And she did.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.210
She studied it very explicitly.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:56.050
Then if you color the images
you add a lot of information.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.190
And you add dramatic impact.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.950
So if you have a wealthy buyer

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.000
and you can sell a colored
copy, more power to you.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.860
Now this is the same species.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.450
Look at his caterpillar
up there, her caterpillar,

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.580
and this is the actual
caterpillar.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.890
Now it's hard when
you're rendering this

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.690
to show those long thin
light-color bristles.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.030
That's really hard to convey,
so the bristles look shorter.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:24.000
But other than that
it's very identifiable.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.890
Okay. So how to you
make an image like this?

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.900
Well, first you have
to find the animal.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.920
So where is it?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.130
Different species --
where's the caterpillar?

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.250
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.170
You guys have a good eye.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.030
Oop, my thing got moved.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:43.310
It's a little to the left
of the circle [laughter].

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.920
I went to the 16-9 format
and didn't adjust for that.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.220
So, anyway.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.520
But you can see the caterpillar.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.820
So you've got to go
and find these things.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.100
And she'd go out in the
gardens and she'd collect them.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.270
And this is the best
stage to start.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.150
Finding eggs is next
to impossible.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.370
Catching the adults -- forget
about it because then you got

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.740
to get them to mate
and lay the eggs.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.360
So you start with
the caterpillar.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.660
Then you bring it back.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.040
And she used wooden boxes,
but you've got to raise it.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.340
I've looked at papers

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.360
where professionals raising
this species only got 25%

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.410
to metamorphose to adults.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:15.840
And they were working
on one species

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.840
and they had graduate
students and undergraduates

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.700
in a climate-controlled lab.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.880
It's not easy to do.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.590
Some months she would
have been having

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.090
to raise 10 different
species at the same time.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:32.280
She also -- the year
she published this book,

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.480
she had a one-year-old daughter
and an eight-year-old daughter.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.270
And not a lot of domestic help.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.050
So makes me tired just
thinking about it.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.830
She said that she had to feed
these caterpillars every day.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.960
They all had to have
specific foods.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.570
And she wrote in her book that,

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:49.470
I could hardly give
them enough nettles

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.330
so active were they
in their feeding.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.880
These things eat more than
their bodyweight a day

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.680
in plant material.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.980
I don't know what you weight,

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.510
but for me that would
be a lot of salad.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.370
So this is a lot of work.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.670
And then she has to
stay up and draw them.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.320
She would sometimes stay up all
night to get this changing stage

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.420
so that she could illustrate
it and, of course, know nothing

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.270
but candles and I
guess little oil lamps.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:19.820
And she would show the whole
lifecycle on the plant.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.010
This animal does
indeed eat fennel.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.550
So how did she make
these images?

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.850
What's the process.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.870
So she -- we have
her study images.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.460
They're actually in Russia.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.440
Long story.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.330
But we don't have
the plant images.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.630
They've been lost.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.930
We don't know how.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.550
So this is the lifecycle
including some parasites

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.800
of this particular species.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.670
This is a -- she
would do a painting,

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.030
and then she would make
the engraved plate.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.160
And I have these
oriented the same.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.460
No, these are reversed.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.980
And then she might
paint the plate

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.440
or she might sell it unpainted.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.720
So you can see the
information transfer.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.280
The thing that's
missing, of course,

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.070
is the original image
of the plant.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:07.560
And the study doesn't
have as many insects.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.420
She's added -- by the time she
published it, she's decided

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.480
to add another size
of caterpillar

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.540
that she didn't have originally,
and she's added another type

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.630
of parasite in the eggs.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.920
So a lot of information.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.330
Now, I just want to put --
hold up, back up there quickly

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.240
so you can compare the
information in his.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.540
Same species.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.840
All right.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.140
So, don't want to
run out of time here.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.250
She's -- in her first
book she had 50 plates;

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.570
her second book she had 50
plates and she had the text.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.030
And the text is amazing.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:42.000
It's outside the scope of
this study of this talk today,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.340
but she looked at behavior, she
looked at the effect of climate,

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:49.670
she looked at all sorts of
things about the insects.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.220
But she was a curious woman.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.080
And when she was living in
Amsterdam later in life,

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.550
she saw collections
of tropical insects

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:59.900
like these morpho
butterflies -- spectacular.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.350
There are no European insects

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.790
that come close in
size or color.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.240
And she said, I want
to go see those.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.240
And I want to learn --
she said, I don't want

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.550
to just see the dead specimens.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:14.280
I want to learn how they live,
how they grow, what came before.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.450
So at age 52 she and one

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.680
of her grown daughters take
a two-months ship voyage

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.130
to Suriname, Dutch Suriname.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.920
She stays on various
sugar plantations and goes

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.990
out into the jungle
and the details

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.310
of making this book
are another whole talk.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.940
But she's there two
years and she comes back.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.010
She makes a fabulous book.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.070
Now, to put it into
context, other people went

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.610
to the New World before her.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.170
This is the kind of
images was in the book.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.870
This is a woodblock print
so it's surrounded by text.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.850
Hans Sloane, whose collection
founded the British Museum,

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.730
was also in Jamaica before her.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.030
He was in Jamaica here.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.420
He didn't publish his
book until after her book,

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.600
but he made images --
animals on one page,

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.190
plants on another page,
never the two shall meet.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.760
And this is what
Merian produced.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:16.910
Now, in terms of size, this is a
full folio sheet, so it's large.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.550
If you bought the colored
edition, and it's large,

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:25.300
and it's this dramatic,
this is like 3D color IMAX

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.720
to the average European
person who's been looking

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.350
at things uncolored,
smaller, and no drama,

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.640
no plants and animals together.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.600
So she made this book and
this is what made her famous.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.100
So I scaled these.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.500
I don't think I corrected
the size exactly right,

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.620
but on the left is
the European plates.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.920
They're quarto.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.220
And then the folio is

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.500
on the right shown
more or less to scale.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.650
Figs, pomegranates,
bananas, pineapple --

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.440
she tried to emphasize a lot

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.380
of the exotic plants
that you could eat.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.800
But let's move on.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.030
So what do you do
with this information?

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.730
You can do a couple of things.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.060
You can use it to
classify the world.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.000
Linnaeus famously
said something like,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.900
God creates; Linnaeus
classifies.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.560
I'm paraphrasing, but
he was not a modest man.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:23.710
And he published his
<i>Systema Naturae </i>in 1735,

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:28.490
and the binomial system we use
now is put firmly into place.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:32.910
But he named a lot of things
based on other people's images.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.350
Not always did they
have a specimen.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.650
They often had images.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.000
And if you're trying to
catalog the natural world,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.730
and understand it, you need
to know what's out there.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:46.410
And Merian, among many other
artists and naturalists work fed

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.210
into the -- were
grist for the mill

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.510
of Linnaeus and his followers.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.640
And they named over 200
species of plants and animals

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.710
and insects just
from Merian alone.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.730
And that's one of her --

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.490
so that's one way you can use
the information in these images.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:06.820
But I argue that -- that was
only a minor contribution

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.120
by Merian.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.610
I think she changed how we
portray the natural world

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.240
because after her,
people like Eleazar Albin

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.220
and many others started putting
animals and plants together

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.230
in ways that were
ecologically relevant.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.420
So here's one example.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.830
Here's another.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.250
George Edwards --
and you can see here,

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.180
this lizard is contemplating
eating this butterfly.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.480
It's harder to see.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.350
There's a tiny little ant
there in front of this lizard.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.190
This lizard's name is
actually named after Merian

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.410
in the scientific name.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.960
Here is Mark Catesby who came
along afterwards, and his format

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.700
of his book is very
similar to Merian's.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.600
And here's a butterfly
and a plant.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.510
But Catesby was fantastic
with birds.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.800
And so here's an
ivory-billed woodpecker.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.880
We wouldn't even really know
what these looked like an aux

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.820
if we didn't have these
naturalist artists

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.940
because these are
gone, they're extinct.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.620
So to remind you again,
let's get reference.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.690
There's Hans Sloane's boa.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.270
Somebody engraved that for him.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:11.760
He didn't do the artwork.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.600
There's Merian's little boa.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.630
Now I want to talk about scale.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.270
The talk this morning
made me think --

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.060
it reminded me to
talk about scale.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.610
Merian, every image
she made of an insect,

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.890
the insect is life-sized.

00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:30.740
So when you're looking
at her book, not here,

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.260
when you're looking at her
book, you could put that species

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.640
of insect up to it, and that's
how big the adult would be.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.160
The caterpillars
grow, obviously.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.710
But the adults -- and I have
a friend who's an artist who's

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.060
actually done this, so we know.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.750
So that sphinx moth on
the page is the size

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.100
of an adult sphinx
moth would be.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.320
The plants -- sometimes
she couldn't get them

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.250
to scale right, and that
boa -- the scale is wrong.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.830
They were not her stars.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.570
Her stars were the insects.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:58.550
So you wouldn't see
a boa that much --

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:03.730
that size next to a caterpillar,
but at least not an adult one.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.860
So she messed about with the
scale to get it onto a plate.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.400
But she's trying to convey
a lot of information --

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.280
the lifecycle of the
insect, the snake,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.850
a lot of information
in one play.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:20.030
And here's Mark Catesby artfully
draping his little bead snake

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.890
because he'd seen Merian's work
and he thought, that's great.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.190
It's a great way to go.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.810
And his pages were
the same size.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.110
They were large.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.410
And he hand-colored
his first editions,

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.230
or at least most
of them I'd say.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:34.940
Now, drama and spectacle, that
came out this morning, too.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.430
So what is more dramatic

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:40.590
than a caiman tossing an
egg-eating snake that's trying

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:44.030
to eat its egg while
also protecting a little

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.930
hatching caiman?

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:48.940
This is maternal care
in a crocodilian.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.270
They're one of the few reptiles

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.480
that actually do defend their
young, and she's documented this

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.660
in quite a dramatic
and baroque way.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.960
But these things to
happen in nature.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.600
So the drama I think
is just as important.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.870
So you've got the ecological
composition with animals

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.170
and plants that occur together.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.470
But then you've got drama.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.180
You're drawing in your viewer.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.390
Your viewer is seeing
this tree frog

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.880
as eyeing the spider for lunch.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.120
It's seeing this nasty
looking viper rearing

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.250
up in a most improbably
anatomical way,

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:26.320
about to go after this
poor little salamander.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.350
And then you've got drama.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:33.790
So this is my favorite plate
in Merian's Suriname volume.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:37.360
You've got three
species of spider.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.020
You've got army ants.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.440
You've got leaf cutter ants.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.070
You've got a roach.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.750
You've got a dying
hummingbird and its eggs.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.860
And you've got a guava tree,

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.660
which she says the leaf cutter
ants can defoliate overnight

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.700
down to something like a
broom handle, and they can.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.320
I've been in Costa Rica
and seen it happen.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.740
She shows the army ants
attacking this roach.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:10.030
She shows this spider snacking
on an ant while multitasking

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.380
and guard its egg sac.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.160
And this bridge of army ant
bodies which actually happens.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.600
This is a screenshot of --

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.670
from YouTube of army ants
making a body with their --

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.050
a bridge with their bodies.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.450
So there's a lot going
on in this image.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.050
A lot of drama, a
lot of ecology,

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.480
a lot of food chains,
a lot of action.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.070
Her images, like others',
other people's images,

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.530
get appropriated and
end u in catalogs or --

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.060
excuse me, this is a
children's encyclopedia.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.150
This is what you and your
kids look in at night.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.640
This is -- yeah, this is one --
actually this series was owned

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:51.060
by Darwin, so you've got spiders
eating birds copied from that.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:55.290
This is 170 years
after Merian published

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.750
and it's still going on.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.370
And now the mate's
coming in to defend it.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:03.640
And all of this leads us to
people like John James Audubon.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.720
And so today you could turn

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.510
on the <i>Discovery Channel</i>
or <i>Animal Planet </i>,

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:11.050
or you can look at an
Audubon print, and, of course,

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.500
things are interacting
and, of course,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.150
there are these interactions.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.250
But Merian was the first.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.070
I'm not saying somebody else
wouldn't have come along

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.420
and done it, but she was
the first to put these kinds

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.760
of things into her images.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.060
And that's all.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.290
I want to thank a lot of people
though, especially people

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.870
like Leslie and their libraries.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.120
Oh, my goodness, I
couldn't do it without them.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.420
And some funding.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.510
And that's all I have to say.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:55.260
[ Applause ]

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.560
&gt;&gt; Nicki Saylor: Hello.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.860
I'm Nicki Saylor.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.450
I'm Head of the Archive at the
American Folklife Center here

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.460
at the Library of Congress.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:06.310
It is my sincere pleasure
to introduce Tom Keegan.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.620
He's the Director of
Digital Scholarship

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:13.290
and Publishing Studio at the
University of Iowa Libraries.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:17.460
Tom is in charge of a team of
11 who collaborate with faculty

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.760
and students on designing,
creating, circulating,

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.440
and archiving this
digital scholarship.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.770
This involves not only
overseeing the University's

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.640
Digital Library,
Institutional Repository,

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.120
and the Crowdsourcing
Platform DIY History.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.490
Tom and his team
are heavily involved

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.700
in helping instructors
thread digital scholarship

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.870
into University and
community curricula.

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.080
In fact, Tom has long
applied digital methods

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.680
in his own teaching
in the Departments

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.760
of Rhetoric and English.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.420
So, as a folklore's
archivist I'm delighted

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.170
that his talk is titled
"Strong in Their Lowliness --

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.890
Everyday People,
Everyday Illustration."

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:02.010
It focuses on how everyday
people, students, soldiers,

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.720
[inaudible] artists create
illustrations as a way

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.090
to explore their
place in the world.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:12.030
Tom has a PhD in English
Literature from the University

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:15.890
of Iowa and he did his
dissertation on Pubs

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.360
in James Joyce's
Work [laughter].

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:25.470
And as I understand it,
Tom resituated Irish pubs,

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.800
a "token symbol of paternalistic
Irish drunkenness" --

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.850
this is in quotes -- as the
site for Joyce's development

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.790
of a philosophy of being.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:39.230
And so, read this way, pubs
illustrate ways humans come

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:42.050
to understand their place in
the world through objects,

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:45.530
practices, and later as
part of a public entity.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.150
So, yes, Tom and I
have a shared affinity

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.760
for traditional culture,
and how people make meaning

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.970
of their lives, how
they express themselves,

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:55.800
and how they situate
themselves within a community.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.460
He and I also have
Iowa in common.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.750
He occupies the job that
I left before arriving

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.340
at the Library five years ago.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.650
So I've watched with
pride and admiration

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.760
as Tom has taken the Digital
Scholarship Program there

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.250
to new heights.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.080
He's absorbed the Campus
Digital Humanities Studio,

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.810
doubling the size of the staff.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:20.000
He's developed the DIY
History Crowdsourcing Platform

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.050
into this awesome
publishing gate --

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.960
public engagement
tool that boasts more

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.070
than 80,000 pages transcribed.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.510
And he provides Digital
Humanities teaching and support

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:33.350
for more than 70 faculty
and their students.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:38.060
So Tom possesses a rare mix
of confidence, curiosity,

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.680
intellectual heft, and seemingly
boundless interpersonal finesse

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.860
that helped make --
I heard a laugh --

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.770
that helped make program
growth like that possible.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.310
So in preparing for
the introduction,

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.630
of course I went Googling,

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:56.600
and I came across his Rate
my Professor site, his entry.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.670
And this is a site
where people can --

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.590
students can comment
on their experiences

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:04.210
with a professor and/or course.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.740
And so for the record he
has earned above a 4.0,

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.540
above a 4.0, and a chili pepper.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.780
One of the comments seemed
particularly suitable to point

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.210
up to what we're about
to experience today.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.770
A student wrote that
Tom is a, quote,

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.230
"awesome guy to listen to.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.600
Love his rants,"
unquote [laughter].

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.100
As an aside, rants were
mentioned in multiple entries

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.320
and I've been witness
to a few of them myself.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.620
They are rapid fire.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.920
They are witty.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.220
They're performative.

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.520
And they're a kick to behold.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.820
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.120
&gt;&gt; The student went
on to write, quote,

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.420
"He really makes you wonder

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.020
about the things the
world has to offer."

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.950
Indeed. And you're
in for a treat.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.510
Please welcome Tom Keegan.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:52.180
[ Applause ]

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.480
&gt;&gt; Tom Keegan: And it is hard.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.450
I'm not sure I can follow my
own introduction [laughter].

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.580
All right.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.850
Is this, is this, what's --

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.910
is there a pointer up
here, or was there?

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.250
&gt;&gt; I don't [inaudible]
something.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.460
&gt;&gt; Tom Keegan: Oh, oh,
this thing in front of me.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.530
Is that what you -- okay.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.590
Okay. So thank you very much.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.250
I want to say thank you
to the Library of Congress

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.690
and thank you very much
to Stephanie Stillo

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.640
for putting this together and
giving me this opportunity.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.570
It's a total delight to be here,
made even moreso by the kind

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.070
of homecoming that I get
to experience with Nicki

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.880
who had the job I
have now previously.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.400
I'm not sure I'm due all
that praise, either from her

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.980
or my students, but
I will take it.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.590
And I'm glad that Nicki began
with teaching, because a lot

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:40.690
of my talk is going to be
about what we do with the stuff

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:41.990
that we're doing
in my department.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.550
So I want to talk a little bit

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.720
about what you're
going to see here.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.710
All these slides come from
the holding of the University

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.500
of Iowa Libraries, in particular
the John Martin Rare Book Room

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.540
and the UI Special Collections.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.890
But to get them here requires
a particular degree of labor

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.990
that I would be remiss if
I didn't point that out.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.310
So just as we're talking about
the process by which some

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.150
of these things are drawn,
I think it's important

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:06.430
to acknowledge as a
librarian who's connected

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:11.250
to the digital endeavor
that nothing you're going

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.570
to see here didn't first
come out of the vault,

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:15.360
go through the hands
of conservators

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.310
and preservationists, move into
digitization which takes place

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:21.940
at our library in
Preservation an Conservation,

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.000
then get handled by Library
Information Technology,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.850
the catalogers, until
we finally move it

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:29.870
into the Iowa Digital Library
where -- and/or DIY History.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:33.080
So it takes a lot of
people to get that done.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.120
And I think sometimes it's, when
we have nice high-res photos

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.630
and they're visually
captivating,

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.020
I think sometimes we
miss intentionally

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.460
because it would be weird if
you were looking at at image

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.810
that seemed very difficult
in its manifestation.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.380
But I think I kind
of want to just start

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.680
by acknowledging that.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.570
And we are fortunate at
Iowa, as Nicki pointed out,

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:56.060
to have a kind of growing
digital presence and operation.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.600
A lot of that starts with,
for here -- I want to --

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.600
-- talk about -- the first thing
I'll talk about with respect

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.900
to her is stuff that comes

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.200
out of the John Martin
Rare Book Room.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.140
That stuff is the most germane
to I think the broad topic

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.690
of this symposium, even though
I'm going to diverge, I think,

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.100
kind of wildly, well,
relatively wildly,

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.300
after these next few slides.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.390
The John Martin Rare Book Room
has over 6500 original works,

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.780
and these are --
that Rare Book Room,

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.110
it's kind of like the
special collections

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:28.910
of our Health Sciences Library.

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:32.100
It's situated on the west half
of campus by the hospital.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.330
And it includes things like
what you see here in the back

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.600
of this, or, you know, the
background of this slide.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.040
Giovanni Alfonso
Borelli's engravings

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.640
from <i>De Motu Animalium</i>
, 1680 to 1681.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.250
And this volume is designed
to showcase humans and animals

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.840
in various positions of
muscle exertion with an eye

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.940
to physics rather than anatomy.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.240
And so what we're seeing

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.080
in these illustrations
is the expansion

00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.820
of the enlightenment's
desire to classify and define

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.390
and understand humanity through
representation and scale,

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:04.690
which -- that's not new news.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.520
We've been hearing about that
throughout the presentations.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.820
So we've been digitizing
stuff like this.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.250
I'll show you a few
other examples.

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.610
What you have here
is an illustration

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:20.120
from Georg Bartisch's 1583 work,
<i>Ophthalmodouleia: Das ist,</i>

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.530
<i>Augendienst </i>, and it
has I think 92 woodcuts.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:27.160
One here. And they're executed,
believed to have been executed

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.040
by Hans Hemmerwahl
[assumed spelling]

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.860
after Bartisch's own drawings.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.710
You can see here that -- I
think you can see in the shadows

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:37.250
that there are super-imposed
flaps, so this is close

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.210
to where -- you know we're
talking 16th century [inaudible]

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.440
about the anatomy and
operation of the eye.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.830
I also, just in -- [inaudible]
remarkable, I also want to point

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:49.920
out that despite or in addition
to its scientific merits,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.000
Bartisch was into, and a
believer in, things like magic,

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.170
astrology, and witchcraft.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:59.130
And I don't -- I'm not
trying to knock him.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:02.090
I'm also not like advocating
for a belief in magic,

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.950
but I want to point out
that when we're talking

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:07.830
about the sciences, we're
talking about a kind of broad

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.700
and varied terrain which
is constantly changing.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.440
My wife is a Classics Professor
and she wanted me to make sure

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.440
that everyone was aware that
the word science is right

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.150
from the Greek and Latin
for -- word for knowing.

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:20.920
And so when we're talking
about science we're talking

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.220
about forms of knowing.

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.520
And I think that that will come

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.650
across throughout a
number of the slides.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.180
Here's another example
of stuff that's

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:31.050
in the John Martin
Rare Book Room.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:32.760
This is Gasper --
these are two plates

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.900
from Caspar Schott
<i>Physica Curioso </i>in 1697

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.650
which itself is not an
original scholarly work so much

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:43.390
as a collection of commonly-held
beliefs or thoughts

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.420
about monsters, physical
abnormalities,

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.720
and bizarre animals.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.140
And so, again, I see this
as a kind of, you know --

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.910
it's located in the
Rare Book Room.

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:56.950
It's an illustration of
this evolving imagination

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:01.310
with respect to zoology and
things that are taking place

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:06.750
in the world complete
with satyrs and centaurs.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.400
One more example or
two more examples here.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.710
We also have these two plates.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:14.500
The one on the left is Andre
de Bois-Regard's 1751 --

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.520
it comes from the work
<i>Orthopedics or the Art</i>

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.820
<i>of Preventing and Corrupting</i>

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.940
<i>in Children Deformities
of the Body </i>.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:23.290
And you also have on the right
Bernhard Siegfried Albinus's

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.890
<i>Tables of the Skeleton and
Muscles of the Human Body </i>.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.430
And here to the left,
most of the book,

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.330
most of Bois-Regard's work is
interested in this [inaudible],

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:37.100
is interested in preventing and
correcting poor body posture

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.510
and other defects caused

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:41.030
by improper habits during
children's formative years;

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.520
As you can, I think see,
she's balancing a book

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.030
on her head in that one.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:46.540
On the right you have --

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:49.950
this engraving's by Yan
Wandalarr [assumed spelling].

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.720
A depiction of the human
skeleton complete with a natural

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.980
and Renaissance stylization
for which, I believe,

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.190
he was criticized for
including that kind of stuff.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:58.490
In any case, so that's --

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:01.630
this is as professional as
it gets from here on out.

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.440
And so I wanted to
point this out thought

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.580
that across all these --
whatever their scientific merit,

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:10.150
there is this ongoing interest
in defining and categorizing

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:15.670
and uncovering an understanding
of our place in the world.

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.810
And I think that's
imaginative in nature.

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.440
So that being said, I should
-- the title of my talk is,

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.430
"Strong in Their
Lowliness, Everyday People,

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:24.750
Everyday Illustration."

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.490
And I don't -- I mean my
illustrations don't look

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:28.790
like this.

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:30.090
So I thought we would
get to some

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:31.600
that come closer
to that reality.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.050
Okay. So Nicki mentions
DIY History.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.040
And I want to talk a
little bit about that.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.910
It began about six
years ago as an attempt

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.990
by Special Collections working
with a version of my department

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:45.730
that Nicki was running
then to get the public

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.730
to transcribe Civil War
letters and diaries.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.630
The idea being that this
stuff is manuscript.

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:50.980
It's not text searchable.

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.780
How do you get -- you don't
get a Librarian to do that.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.740
No one is like, aw, you can
definitely pay me a salary.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.940
Just sit down and transcribe
thousands of pages of Civil War.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.240
I mean that would be cool if
that were a job, but that's not

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.730
where the money's
going in the library.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.380
So these things were
digitized and made public.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.570
And over the years
we've expanded the scope

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:08.870
of that process.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:10.780
So now beyond Civil War letters
and diaries, we have things

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.920
like -- this is a
World War II letter.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.950
But most recently I think our
newest collection is the Hevelin

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.940
Fanzine's collection,
so these are --

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.600
I'll talk a little bit about
that at the end of the talk,

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.310
but they were talking about
10,000-plus zines that --

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.470
from the 1930s to
the present day.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:25.960
And so we've been
digitizing these things

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.390
and making them public.

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.880
And the public, as Nicki
said, has transcribed

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.980
over 80,000 pages for which
we are incredibly grateful.

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:36.360
And we think of it now less
as a transcription platform

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.910
than we do a public
engagement platform.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:39.790
So how do we get the
public interacting

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:42.110
with exploring the contents
of these collections

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.300
because otherwise, if we had
not digitized these things

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.820
and made them public,
they're sitting in a vault,

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:50.860
and we're hoping that the
subject guides are sufficient

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.570
to seduce you into
the Reading Room.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.300
And that's not always the case.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.790
This letter -- and I think
there's some unique things

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.090
in here.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.930
So this letter is
from August 14, 1942,

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:06.530
and it is from Laura Davis
to her husband, Lloyd,

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.850
about two months
after he was drafted.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.450
I don't know if you
can read the cursive.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:14.330
I know that's going
out of fashion.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.630
Good night, Laddie.

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:16.930
Off to the post office

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:19.570
so you will have a letter
arriving on schedule.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:24.050
And then at the bottom
you'll see the stick figures

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.860
which I'm counting
as an illustration.

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.040
And it says, my place here.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.730
Ready? To which the larger
figure says, yes, honey.

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:35.560
And the response, good Laddie.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.320
And I know you're thinking
like oh, that's amusing,

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.630
but it's not scientific
illustration.

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:40.930
That's doodling.

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:43.600
And I'm willing to agree at
this moment in the presentation

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.040
that that's the case,
though I plan to bring you

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.490
over to my side by
the end [laughter].

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:51.540
What I want to point out
is that these doodles --

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.840
what I want to try
and argue here is

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.020
that these doodles are a part
of a long process of the science

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:59.310
of human communication and
understanding, and a process

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:01.820
that -- amongst all the
other things that we've seen

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.390
and will see, also includes
the marginal and the mundane.

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:09.690
But before I inflict that
on you, I want to talk

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.250
about this kind of stuff.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:15.230
Two years ago -- a few
years ago this month,

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:18.450
for Women's History Month,
we made public 3000 --

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:20.470
we dumped into the
L.A History 3000 pages

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.600
of manuscript material
that had been digitized

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.070
but nothing was really
going on with them.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:28.250
And this material was -- this
material is undergraduate

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.830
and graduate thesis material
from the 1880s and '90s,

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:35.190
predominantly about science and
predominantly written by women

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.140
at what was then called the
State University of Iowa,

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:38.610
which is now the
University of Iowa.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:41.630
So this [inaudible] sitting
there and I said, well,

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:43.210
we've got to make this public.

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:44.970
This is too cool.

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.480
I think this is important.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.530
So, you know, we shared
this and I wrote a --

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:52.620
I was writing some
blog posts about it,

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.690
and we were putting it
out on social media.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.230
And I had the occasion to
talk to a faculty member

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:58.530
from a different institution.

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.910
So I was not [inaudible] faculty
to my mind I'm not guilty

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:02.760
of this, but I spoke
to a faculty member

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.060
about this collection.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.770
And he said, well
that's -- sure.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:09.150
What's the scientific --

00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:12.050
the sell-by date's
passed on that, you know.

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.870
The [inaudible] of Iowa
city and vicinity of thesis

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.730
by Annette Slaughterbeck in 1888
is no longer scientifically,

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:20.990
you know, useful.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.190
And I -- fine, you know,
that the kind of --

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:24.610
I think librarians
like those kinds

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:26.530
of softball snide
comments [laughter].

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.650
It's like it's not --
we're not preserving it

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:31.310
because I think someone's
going to mine it

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:33.270
for scientific data about moss.

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:36.920
This is something
that, you know,

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.470
we do this because
it's a artifact

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:42.560
that illustrates what students
at the institution were doing.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.860
But when they were
doing in science

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.850
at our particular institution
at a time when we're talking

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:49.760
about STEM or STEAM, here's
a vivid example, I think,

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.850
of that kind of work and labor.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:53.870
And that itself is a
historical artifact that's

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:56.150
worth preserving.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.230
It's captivating
past that because

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.790
of how these things are
constructed on the process

00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:05.580
by which students were
constructing these things.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:10.050
So I want to -- I want
to just -- let's see.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:11.380
I want to show you this.

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.040
The title for the talk
comes from her thesis,

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.390
her undergraduate thesis.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:21.940
And the quote that begins
it, strong in her lowliness,

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.690
is taken by her from
John Ruskin,

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:28.130
the famous Victorian art critic.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:30.700
Line five of his
<i>Modern Painters </i>,

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.700
the section leaves motionless.

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.670
Okay. So she starts quoting
Ruskin and she writes,

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:38.450
"Strong in her lowliness"
-- that part's from Ruskin.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:39.750
And this is her.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:42.520
The humble little plants passed
every damn thoughtlessness

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.680
and indifference through
an important place

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.510
in the category of nature.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:48.760
Carelessly scattered
in waste spots

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:52.660
and lonely unvisited haunts,
clinging to the rocky slopes

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.700
or lingering by the
water's edge,

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:58.380
slowly and unconsciously they
fulfill the mission entrusted

00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.710
to their care.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:03.340
Peacemakers they are, rounding
the sharp edges of the rocks,

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.920
filling cracks and
crevices in the wake --

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.450
following in the wake
of rain and decay

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:09.750
in their painful traces.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.240
And then she quotes
Ruskin again.

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.540
"Covering with strange

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.740
and tender honor the
scarred disgrace of ruin,

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.230
laying their quiet finger

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:21.520
on the trembling stones
to teach them rest."

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.820
So that's cool, right.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.120
Jesus Christ.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.960
That's like -- my
dissertation does not --

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.410
my dissertation reads like that
garbage Nicki quoted, you know,

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:30.700
"the paternal token --

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.150
paternalistic token
of Irish drunkenness."

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:37.440
That line of Ruskin's,
"strong in their lowliness,"

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.350
I think that's a
totally beautiful line,

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:42.360
and clearly Annette
Slaughterbeck thought so, too.

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.630
And I think that idea of
acknowledging the lowliest flora

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:47.690
and it's role in shaping
the larger world is equally

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.020
beautiful and wonderful.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.110
I think it is also wonderful
to watch and to observe

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:56.910
on these pages the mind of
this undergraduate Bachelor

00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:00.170
of Science candidate weave
together prose inspired

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.640
by an art critic with
illustrations derived

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.290
from hundreds of years of
scientific observation.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:09.140
I don't care about these things

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:12.550
for their scientific
content any more than I care

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:15.240
about the scientific content
of Renaissance-era [inaudible]

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.840
and engravers capturing the
human imagination one zoological

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.580
bestiary at a time.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.930
That's not the point.

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:26.140
The point is I'm
interested in the process.

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.500
There's a care and personality
in these illustrations.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.970
And regardless of the scientific
contribution they may make

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:35.260
today, they continue to
have merit in their ability

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:36.900
to help us see ourselves,
and particular

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:39.830
to help see how students
see themselves in the past.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.160
A student looking at this
today might well recognize

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.200
in their own mediocre
talents or [inaudible], the --

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.010
you know, the --
their own abilities

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:50.310
in these illustrations.

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:52.580
In doing so they see
themselves in a form of thing

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.880
in these illustrations.

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.570
And that is why we preserve and
share outdated scientific work

00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:58.940
by undergraduate women working
in the sciences at the edge

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.210
of the 19th century, and
why I want my students

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:03.240
to see themselves as part
of a much longer story

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.430
about human inquiry
and endeavor, okay?

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:07.800
And I just have a few
more examples from this.

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.740
This is another -- this is Ann
B. Jewett's 1890 thesis called

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.900
<i>The Sun Flower As a Type
of Flowering Plants."</i>

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:17.980
<i>And it includes this
like lovely water coloring</i>

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:21.780
<i>and in this nice poem which
reads, "And as the sunflower</i>

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.060
<i>in some barren field
lights up the waste</i>

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:27.980
<i>with cheerful golden glow."</i>

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:31.900
<i>She also has detailed
cross-section drawings</i>

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.210
<i>of parenchyma cells and on
the right you'll see the spiral</i>

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:37.710
<i>arrangement of leaves
on a stem.</i>

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:39.500
<i>And so students here
are seeing, you know,</i>

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.530
<i>this kind of studious,
hand-drawn,</i>

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:43.940
<i>attentive engagement
with the sciences.</i>

00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.590
<i>And I think that that should
be hope resonate with them.</i>

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:50.480
<i>You can see it as well in Nelly
Peery's, The Fertilizing Cell,</i>

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.560
<i>Its Form and Behavior</i>
in these drawings.

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.890
And in the <i>Curious Observations</i>

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:58.570
<i>of Minapee [assumed spelling]
Humphry's "The Slime Molds</i>

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.060
<i>of Eastern Iowa </i>, okay?

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.580
She had to do your
work on something.

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:07.390
And so these, these are not --
these are not throwaway records

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:09.880
of amateur scientists.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:14.060
These are part of a much longer
imagination about human endeavor

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.450
and a glimpse into
the everyday work.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:17.010
These are not famous people.

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:19.780
Annette Slaughterbeck
goes on to get a degree

00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:25.080
in Temperance Science, and is
a German and Science Teacher

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.310
in the high school in
Illinois later in life.

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:29.500
So these things are valuable.

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.940
I think they're part of
the historical record

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.760
in the conversation
about illustration.

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:36.670
But they're very germane
to those opening slides.

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:38.540
I want to kind of
push the definition

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.580
or weaken the definition or
bring lower the definition

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.880
of scientific illustration.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.980
So I went, excuse me, so I
went looking for other things.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.730
And that brought me to letters,
other letters and diaries.

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:52.220
So I wanted to find these
strongly mundane forms.

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.520
And we have an example here.

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:54.890
This is an August 13,

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:59.850
1918 letter from Walter
Fox to his wife, Bess.

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:04.010
And it details that,
that u-shaped,

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:06.870
w-shaped thing is a
detail of his barracks

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:09.210
at Fort Sill in Oklahoma.

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.440
And so I was looking at this,
and I said, you know, okay,

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:13.080
why -- the doodle
got me thinking.

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:15.230
Why does Fox doodle this?

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:18.360
And I think in part he
does it because words fail

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:22.030
at different moments when we
constructing these things.

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:24.830
He's trying to give his wife
a picture of his surroundings.

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:27.570
He's trying to document his
lived experience and working

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:29.340
within the economy of space

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.810
that is a letter he
uses illustrations

00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:33.430
to convey that reality.

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:34.730
I'll show you another one.

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:36.030
This was another unexpected one.

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.390
This is an illustration

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:41.270
from Jackson Harrison
Alspaugh's 1865 diary

00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:43.460
in which he captures Old Tom,

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.060
Company H's pack
mule through Georgia.

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:49.790
Alspaugh was member of the
31st Ohio Infantry Regiment

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:53.330
in the Civil War, and
participated in Sherman's March

00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:56.110
to the Sea, which, if you're
familiar with the line ascribed

00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:58.330
to Sherman about 40 acres
and a mule for freed slaves,

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:00.180
then this takes on another
kind of historical resonance.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.650
But we're not -- we don't --

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:04.070
it's not a history
lecture so much

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.640
as just how do pictures kind
of arrest the imagination

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.120
and draw us into
those conversations?

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.040
Here's another one, but,
again, has deeper context.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.260
But when I was digging
through [inaudible] history,

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.160
this is what I saw first,
and I saw a picture.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.460
This is good.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.500
I need more signs.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.400
This though was found in the --

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.910
this comes from Thomas
Clark Durant's miscellaneous

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:30.860
correspondence of 1872 to
1899, and I didn't off the top

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.380
of my head know who
Thomas Clark Durant is.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.680
Some of you may.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.870
He was kind of a
railroad tycoon.

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:38.170
Okay, he's responsible --

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:39.600
he's the Vice President of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.520
He was friends with
Abraham Lincoln

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.870
and Lincoln gets him the deal

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:47.460
to begin the first
transcontinental railroad.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.400
He is also -- he was a cotton
smuggler during the Civil War.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.500
He was involved in the
Credit Mobilier Scandal.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.170
He manipulated the Stock Market.

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:58.860
He was not a particularly
charismatic --

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.960
well, maybe he was very
charismatic, but not a, not a,

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.550
you know, an ethical
person which, I suppose,

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:06.720
if you're a railroad
person you're probably not.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.010
But what is great about this is
this is directions to himself

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:13.390
on how to unlock his
safe which is probably --

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:15.280
if you're him, you probably
want to make sure you know how.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.340
So what he's written here is,
you know, "To unlock the safe,

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.240
screw the knob on thus
and insert the key as far

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.850
into the keyhole as possible
and turn to the left.

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:25.150
The letter U on knob
must stand upright

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.080
to insert or withdraw the key."

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.170
And, again, while that's not
groundbreaking scientific

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:30.470
illustration, it's interesting

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:34.170
to see how everyday people are
using illustrations to kind

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:39.020
of convey meaning and
method in their daily lives.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:42.390
This is from some
correspondence from 1880

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:43.740
from the Bean [assumed
spelling] Family letters

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.940
in which two brothers
are discussing how best

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.450
to put a roof on a barn.

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:53.730
So the letter reads,
"It may be best to carry

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:56.630
up the octagonal gable
thus as to pitch.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:59.300
But I'm not as yet
satisfied without the drawings

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.060
which would really
be the best way.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.270
The dotted lines are for
a uniform pitch of roof.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:06.970
And the other is a peaked pitch
so as to have the ridge come

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.610
out even with the
sides of the building.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:12.940
And, again, not a
remarkable thing.

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.270
But I'm no architect,
but I [inaudible]

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.730
if that's not a scientific
illustration.

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:21.910
I want to show you -- so,
again, so now we're getting,

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:24.290
now we're back to doodles.

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:27.260
These are -- well you can see.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.190
We have a collection of
smiley faces, frowny faces,

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:35.680
and other faces which to
me are precursors of one

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.200
of the most substantial
technological innovations

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.550
of the 21st century and a lingua
franca of our times, the emoji.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:48.860
And so I think this stand
in similarly as examples

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.100
of people using art
to fill the gaps

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.330
when words will not
or cannot do.

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:57.530
These, in particular, are
letters from the First

01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:59.860
and Second World Wars in
which men and women try

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.620
to bring themselves as close
as they can to one another.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.590
In the first letter on the left,
Laura David, who, you know,

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:08.050
is from one of those earlier
slides, write to her husband.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:10.020
"Tell me what to
write or how to write

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.310
if you wish I would
write differently.

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:15.510
I want the letters to
help and to be good

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:17.220
so that you are glad
when they come.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.940
Smiley Face not Frowny
Face [laughter].

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.240
Yeah, right?

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.790
I have written here, that is
wonderfully mundane poignancy,

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.090
right?

01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:27.390
There is like --
in that sentiment.

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:32.120
There are -- there is John
Graham's letter of December 7,

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:39.560
1942, and this is at the --
up on the top left there,

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.990
where he's writing to
his wife about the antics

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:44.760
of his company in 1942.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.320
"Makes it kind of touch on the
image of a Sergeant's stripes,

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.760
but no one seems to care."

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.680
And that idea that you'd
let the image stand

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.460
in for the person I
think is quite elegant.

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.750
You also see, in talking
about public engagement,

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.330
those two images at the bottom
are from Daphne Reynolds

01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:02.740
to her husband Conger
Reynolds in 1918.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.950
And the one on the -- you'll
see the one on the bottom right,

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:06.250
the one on the bottom right --

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.780
well, I'll tell you
how that's defined

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.110
by a transcriber
here in a minute.

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:11.520
The one on the bottom left
is a crying face that --

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.850
I don't know if you can see it.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.000
The tears are labelled tears.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.680
In case that -- well, I don't
know what else would be conveyed

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.190
there, but she made sure
that he got the message.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:24.510
But the one on the bottom
right is a letter to Conger

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:27.320
from Daphne in which she's
talking about how difficult --

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.710
he has to appreciate how
difficult it is for her

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:33.360
to have recently given
up candy and ice cream.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.790
And every time she
passes the shop,

01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:36.090
you know, how tough that is.

01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:39.560
And so she writes, "Do pat me
on the back a little, dearest."

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.110
And then there's that kind of --
that face which a transcriber,

01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:44.630
and this is the beautiful
part about the Iowa history

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:46.320
and how the public
reads these images.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.400
The transcriber put in
brackets, [smug face],

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.950
which I -- which I love.

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:52.250
I'm can say okay.

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:53.550
If you think so, okay.

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:54.850
That says a lot.

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:56.150
As -- all it -- say something
about the translator.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.670
But, again, in these letters,
I think that it's interesting

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:01.840
to see everyday art in the
science of human presence

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.680
in these difficult spaces or
places where words fail us.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.770
Another example along
these lines --

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:08.910
this is a letter from George
Davis to his brother, Lloyd,

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:12.530
and June 1st, 1944, and this is
towards the end of the letter.

01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:13.880
George has already
signed off at this point,

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.230
but he's got a post-script.

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.930
And he signs in this
post-script --

01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:21.060
he says, "Still get to draw like
we did when we went to school,"

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.500
and there's this animal.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.800
"It is funny.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.500
When I am working in the field,
there are a dozen things I want

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.800
to tell you, but when I start
to write, I don't know nothing."

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.560
And I think that just beneath
those off-the-cuff sentiments

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.530
lurks kind of real
emotion, and it's hard not

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:39.170
to freight those -- when
you read them in context,

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.570
it's hard not to
freight the doodles

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.430
with a meaning past
their seeming lowliness.

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:45.980
These are examples from --

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.290
so we're looking at
people writing to soldiers.

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:49.650
These are examples of
soldiers writing back home,

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:51.430
and these come from
the Civil War,

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.840
World War -- up to World War II.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.350
And in them -- we won't
go through all of them,

01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:58.850
because I'm conscious
of time here --

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:02.140
men are detailing their
battlefields, camps,

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:05.220
their movements in foreign
countries, flight formations,

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.950
as in the top the left there.

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:11.620
And on the left, plans to
fix up Aunt Maude's garden

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.920
in Wyandotte [assumed spelling].

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.070
So in the incident to the
left here, the garden,

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:17.560
you have Burton J. Smith
[assumed spelling] writing

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.790
to his fiancee, Williametta
Turnipseed [assumed spelling] --

01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:22.160
and that is -- I promise you,
that is her name [laughter].

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.390
And this is, like, a
super-poignant story.

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:28.730
I won't -- he dies, sadly,
on the day she writes him,

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:30.210
which I hate to do
after laughter.

01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:32.670
It's like, her name's Turnipseed
-- oh, he passed away.

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:34.320
But he dies in a plane crash,
but throughout the world,

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.930
we have all these really
remarkable letters between them.

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:39.600
But in this one, just to give
you a sense -- so here he is --

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.280
that's him -- that
flight formation is him,

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.170
but this garden is him as well.

01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:45.560
And in the letter, he says --

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.570
you know, he has this
bit about the garden.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:48.870
He says, "As you can see,

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.520
my mind is wandering,
making plans again."

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:53.060
But just prior to that, he's
writing about what's happening

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.660
at the time, and he
says -- he -- let's see.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.960
Where are we?

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.260
"I am still on the flight line.

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.560
The hurricane is expected

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.930
about 2:00 p.m. We will
soon be taking off.

01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:04.230
Motors are roaring.

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:05.830
Everything that can
fly is going.

01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:08.590
About 4:00 a.m., all those
ships, on which only one motor

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:11.800
of the two would run, limped
off to a safer place."

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.820
And amidst all -- that's
in the same letter.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.160
Amidst all this, he's
sketching plans for a garden,

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.460
you know, his aunt's garden.

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.260
Which I think -- again, if
we're talking about science

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.520
in illustration, I find
that a telling illustration

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.030
of human consciousness, and
how we think about things,

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:26.940
and what preoccupies us, and
how we communicate our way

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.250
of being in the world.

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:30.550
So we looked at letters
and diaries.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:33.210
I also started looking at
notebooks and cookbooks,

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:36.170
and so -- as another kind of
lowly form of illustration.

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:41.010
And so, this slide is a
doodle by James Van Allen,

01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:43.930
who was a physicist and former
professor at the University

01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:47.400
of Iowa, who helped --
who was instrumental

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.800
in studying the radiation
belts that circle the Earth

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.070
and prevent us from dying,
and they bear his name,

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.370
the Van Allen radiation belts.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:58.380
So these are -- we have
Van Allen's very extensive

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.670
collection of his papers, and
among them, we have notebooks

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:04.540
of his, which we have digitized,
and the public has transcribed.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.840
I should point out that
the doodle is not actually

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.470
of the belts.

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:12.440
It is a Swedish penholder
that is carefully documented

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.640
and measured in one
of his journals.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.720
You can see we have -- he has a
four-inch scale at the bottom,

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.980
and he has labeled the holes.

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.280
But I -- I just think this --

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.060
interesting illustration
of the scientific mind,

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.360
and we're going to
come back to him.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.240
But I want to show you
this cookbook first.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.290
So we have another collection
called the Szathmary Culinary

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:30.410
Collection, which has a
number of cookbooks in it,

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.820
stretching back to
the 17th century.

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:34.180
And a 17th century
cookbook, in some instances,

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:37.290
reads like a survival guide
more than a recipe book.

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:38.660
But this one is fascinating
to me.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.110
This comes in from -- this is

01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:47.100
from the Willis family recipe
books, 1833 to 1861, and it --

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.400
here's the writer, is
grappling with the phenomenon

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.120
of negative afterimages.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.420
Okay, so when you
stare at something,

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.930
and you close your eyes,
and you see the inverse

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.440
of that image colorscape --

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.370
so this was written
in the cookbook.

01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:01.080
"The fluctuation of colors
at the border of patterns,

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.630
when the ground and the pattern
are of complementary colors,

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:06.780
so that if a red wafer
is laid on a white paper

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.860
in a strong light, and looked at
for some time, and then removed,

01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:13.000
the eye, now looking on the
paper, receives the white light

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.140
over the part of the eye when
the red image was before.

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.980
But the red portion of that
white light produces less

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.280
than its proper effect.

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.290
Consequently, there
appears a greenish spot

01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:24.730
where the red wafer was."

01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:28.070
And so, the hashing out of this
scientific experiment goes on,

01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:32.050
and then there's a subject
of an amusing experiment.

01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:34.400
"A very amusing illustration
of the property

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.910
of the complementary colors
may thus be made on a paper

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:39.500
about twice the size of
a sheet of note paper.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.990
Draw a rough figure.

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:43.470
Paint every part with
bright colors complementary

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.540
to what the colors ought
to be, as green cheeks,

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:51.310
white of the eye, black -- a
black cap, a red ribbon green,

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:53.350
a green gown red, and so on,

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:55.620
a very black frame
pattern all around.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.100
Then lay this on the
floor in a strong light.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.940
Look for some time, then
put up to the ceiling --

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.240
then look up to the ceiling.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.740
And in a minute, you will
see a spectral picture

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.350
with all the colors right.

01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:07.950
This requires a little practice,

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:10.790
and some eyes see it
better than other -- "

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.270
-- with the -- I think,
the closing line there,

01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:15.090
with some wry candor,
"young eyes best."

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.610
So this is great.

01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:18.920
I love these instructions that
are -- you know, these weird,

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.610
unanticipated illustrations
creeping

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.680
into these mundane spaces.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.980
And these are Van Allen.

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:25.500
Now, Van Allen -- no one's
calling him an amateur

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.800
scientist, okay?

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.100
He's pre-NASA.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.400
He's involved in the
U.S.'s first satellite.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.370
He is instrumental, as I
said, in space exploration

01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:34.790
in the U.S., and globally.

01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:39.700
But these are doodles, you
know, from his notebooks, and,

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.230
you know, he's got
things in here --

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:42.780
I don't want to walk through
all the illustrations.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:46.320
But he's sketching
crude manometers,

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.190
square-wave frequency
calculations, radio antennae,

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:51.840
and a bunch of other
technical concerns.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.620
When we show these
things to students --

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.530
or why we'd want to show
them to the public is

01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:59.640
to help them understand
the ad hoc, immediate,

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.730
and improvisational
character of a process,

01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:05.740
that the work is not
always so clearly-defined.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.990
It is a muddle, and you work
things through in shorthand.

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:11.530
So I think it's important
to be able to share

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:14.080
that kind of material.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.830
And since we're talking about
space, I wanted to go to just,

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:19.330
you know, the last section.

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:21.530
I want to talk about
the Hevelin fanzines,

01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:23.040
which may be more jarring,

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.710
because these look
a bit more coherent,

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:26.260
but they're also further afield.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.950
The James L. Rusty Hevelin
Collection at the University

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:32.590
of Iowa contains about --
over 10,000 science fiction,

01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:35.750
as I said, fantasy
and horror zines,

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.820
collected by Rusty Hevelin.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:40.640
He was this uber-fan,
and took everything,

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.090
and we were happy
to have it from him.

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:46.450
Recently the University of Iowa
Library's made the decision

01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:49.150
to make about 6000 pages
of this material available,

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:53.260
so we digitized these things and
turned them out to the public.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:54.560
Many of them are deeply --

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.860
if we're talking
about lowly objects,

01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.580
these are deeply
ephemeral materials.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.900
They are mimeographed, and
in most cases, stapled,

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.570
and published in
small quantities.

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:08.140
Like, some -- for instance, this
is a cover from "Fan Slants" --

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.250
this is the back cover, I
should say, of "Fan Slants,"

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.840
had a three-issue run.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.210
This is from September
1943, and it features --

01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:17.530
I don't know if you can tell.

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:21.000
I think you can -- has a
ghost reading people stories,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.730
clearly shocked at
what it is discovering

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:25.920
in those morbid pages.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.960
But I love that title,
"People Stories,"

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.550
because my argument would be
that that's what 'zines are.

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:34.990
They are people stories.

01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:37.790
That's what these -- the
fantastical, the imaginary,

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:40.840
the horrific -- we create
these things in an effort

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.880
to better understand
ourselves, and I also dig

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.380
that it's got a memento
mori, this --

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.360
you know, the death
trope that is --

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.660
it's also artistically
present in history, I think,

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.590
or influenced by
what's come before.

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:57.240
But so -- these are a couple
examples of zines that are,

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.410
you know, showing us where
the cultural imagination is

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:02.270
at the time, and how we're
understanding our place

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:03.570
in the world.

01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:04.870
These are also people who saw --

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:06.730
and Lovecraft is an
absolute touchstone

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:10.570
for this fan community, and
they saw him as an illustrator.

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:12.390
And so, I just wanted to
include -- this is a --

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:17.260
these are illustrations by
H.P. Lovecraft, and they ran --

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.560
this is a letter they ran.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.250
This comes from "Acolyte,"
volume one, issue four,

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:25.620
in which -- the summer of
1943, titled "Lovecraft

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.040
as Illustrator,"
and it's a reprint

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.050
from a letter Lovecraft
wrote in 1934.

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:33.410
I want to share just part
of this letter with you,

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:36.210
because it's interesting to
hear Lovecraft, a horror writer,

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:38.940
you know, weird -- the father,
in part, of weird fiction,

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.370
describe what he thinks
he is as an illustrator.

01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:43.950
"I feel tremendously and
undeservedly flattered

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:47.170
by your kindly mention of
the crude and casual sketch

01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:48.470
in my letter to Rimmel.

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:51.410
I've always wished I could draw,
but have no natural aptitude

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:54.410
for it, so that despite
infinite pains, my best efforts

01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:57.620
in that direction are rather
ludicrous and pathetic.

01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:01.780
Odd, too, from my grandmother,
great aunt, and late elder aunt,

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.340
were all accomplished artists,

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:06.540
while my father's sketchbooks
attest his very passable skill

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.840
with a pencil.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.140
It makes me green with envy

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.440
when I see certain
naturally-gifted persons

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.980
effortlessly translate a
visual impression to paper.

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.310
When I try the same thing,
the result is an awkward mess

01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:21.270
of forced pen scratches.

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:24.620
I have always envied authors who
can illustrate their own tales,

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:27.640
pulling into visibility
exactly what they have in mind,

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.880
instead of depending on the
routine work, often careless,

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.000
uncomprehending,
and unsympathetic,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.210
of magazine illustrators.

01:14:35.210 --> 01:14:37.060
But I have scarcely
hoped to be able

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.190
to produce anything
suitable myself.

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:41.780
I'm under no illusions
as to the inaptitude

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.660
of my unschooled
pictorial blunderings."

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:47.620
And so, despite how
harsh he is on himself,

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:50.510
this is a community that's
interested in illustration,

01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:52.240
interested in trying to
communicate what's inside

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.400
of them, and what
they're thinking about.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.480
And it's not so far afield, I
think, from where we started,

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.080
if you think of Albanus's
centaur, or satyrs,

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.380
or where the cultural historical
imagination lies with respect

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.600
to what counts as
knowing the world.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.830
I have you literally
covered, because here again,

01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:09.400
we have two covers, this one
on the left from "Venus,"

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.630
volume one, issue one, from
1944, featuring a centaur,

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:15.010
and on the right, "Le
Zombie," volume five,

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:17.860
issue four, January 1943.

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.510
Again, with these
ideas, and these figures

01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:22.930
in different contexts, but still
part of that longer history.

01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:25.260
It's hard not to see
in this history --

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:29.490
for instance, on the left,
R.A. Hoffman's cover for

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:32.280
"Acolyte" volume one,
issue four, summer of 1943,

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.420
the kind of attention to
cellular, microbial detail

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.840
that we saw earlier
in something like one

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.930
of Nelly Piery's
[assumed spelling] looking

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:41.230
at the fertilizing cell.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:44.340
Or the anatomical observations
in Nils Helmer Frome's cover for

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:49.010
"Canadian Fandom" at the top
in 1947, or the influence

01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:52.520
of biological study in Clark
Ashton Smith's alien creature

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.410
in the pages of "Acolyte" two,
issue four, 1944 at the bottom.

01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:58.460
These zines are awash
in the fantastical,

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.860
but perhaps no moreso than any
other -- any of the illustrators

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.720
or scientists we'll
see or have seen today,

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.020
and coming up tomorrow.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.160
All of them, it seems to
me, are addressing our place

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.650
in the world, whether
real or surreal --

01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:13.030
which today are continually
confused, I think --

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:16.330
but I want to end on
this idea of sight.

01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:17.630
We saw that Bartrich

01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.110
and Hamoval's [assumed
spelling] eye, with the flaps,

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:24.130
and I thought this was too
good not to share with you.

01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:27.820
This is a story by -- I
assume this is a penname,

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.120
Jean St. Jean [assumed
spelling],

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.150
called "The Discerning Eye,"

01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:34.150
from the March-April 1942
issue of "The Comet."

01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:37.780
In this brief story, Paul
Dunlop, an amateur chemist,

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:41.920
prone to verbal mania, a sad
disease which afflicts someone

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.930
with a propensity for
big words, falls victim

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:49.620
to a horrible accident that
allows him supernatural sight.

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:53.590
He can see the table, quote,
"composed of multitudinous,

01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:55.500
tiny, active organisms."

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.640
He comes to see the
Earth, quote,

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.660
"with a great seething mass."

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.250
The impact -- it drives him mad,

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.550
which is where these
stories often go.

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:05.440
But -- so his wife finds him
covered in this chemical,

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.410
and she's asked him can he see.

01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:09.420
And he shouts to her, "'See!

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.550
The magic word, see!

01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:15.480
Not view, observe,
look on, but see!'

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.030
In the excitement of the
moment, he forgot large words.

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:22.830
He began another deep
chuckle, submerged in the depth

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:25.230
of his chest, and as
it reached his peak,

01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:28.720
he realized the tremendous
force he possessed,

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.050
the various possibilities
of his state of being.

01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:33.510
No more days at the office."

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:36.290
[Laughter] Love that's
where you go, first thing.

01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:39.040
"No more odious hypocrisy.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.980
No more fetid miasma
of pretension.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.980
He could see in.

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.690
His sight was an eruption,

01:17:46.690 --> 01:17:49.490
a scientific hyperbole,
but a truth.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:54.110
He had no walls to contain his
sight, no bonds to bind him.

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:56.830
He could look through
anything, or anyone,

01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:59.450
and his peculiarity
was permanent.

01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:01.300
This, he could feel.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.190
Nothing could maintain
his sight.

01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:05.230
What a power he had!

01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:06.940
And when they led
him to the asylum --

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:09.820
" [laughter] that's
the next sentence.

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:14.910
"And he protested, as always,
to their imbecilic fallacy.

01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:19.280
The gates closed with a final
click on the man who could look

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.120
through the strongest
walls, the stoutest barrier,

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.690
but he could only look."

01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:27.060
Now, despite that
dark ending for Paul,

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:31.240
I truly appreciate the crazed
emphasis on sight here.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.460
Perhaps if we, like Paul,
look more closely into the --

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:41.370
to quote again, "waste spots
and lonely, unvisited haunts,"

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:43.870
into the, dare I say,
archives and collections

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:46.480
that contain these lowliest
forms of illustration.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.690
We will come to discover new
ways at looking at things --

01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:52.040
oh, new ways of looking
at things, and new ways

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.430
of recognizing ourselves
and our world

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:57.580
from the elegant engravings
to the most fleeting doodles,

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.860
all of them revealing
a kind of strength

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.760
in our earthly presence.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.560
Thank you.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:22.080
[ Applause ]

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.790
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: Hello.

01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:25.090
I am Abby Potter.

01:19:25.090 --> 01:19:26.780
I'm the acting chief

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.200
of the National Digital
Initiatives here at the Library

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.660
of Congress, also known as
the Library of Congress Labs,

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:36.040
and I have the pleasure to
introduce our next speaker

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.300
and her talk, which is called
"Storytelling with Science."

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:44.480
Eleanor Lutz is a Ph.D.
candidate at the University

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.670
of Washington, studying biology,

01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:49.580
specifically studying
how mosquitoes learn

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.100
and remember new experiences.

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:56.010
Lutz also runs the incredible
science illustration blog,

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:57.740
"Tabletop Whale."

01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:02.220
Here, you can see her work,
which has also been published

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.040
in "National Geographic,"
"Scientific American,"

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.300
and "The Gates Foundation."

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:10.420
Her work adds a sense of wonder
and playfulness to science

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.790
by finding inspiration in
historical science illustrations

01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:17.150
and art movements, while also
ensuring they're accurate

01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:20.550
by working directly with
scientists and doctors.

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:23.940
Let's also include
digital design techniques,

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:27.960
such as animation and
programming in her work.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.620
Today, Lutz will speak to
us about finding the balance

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:34.110
between artistic styling
and scientific convention,

01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:37.370
celebrating the complexity
of scientific research,

01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:39.650
and combining digital
design technology

01:20:39.650 --> 01:20:41.810
with traditional art styles.

01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:43.610
Eleanor?

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:56.560
[ Applause ]

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.860
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Lutz: Okay.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.160
Hi, everyone.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.460
Thank you, Abby, for
the introduction.

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.830
It's really nice
to be here today.

01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:08.310
So I make science
illustrations, like this one.

01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:10.900
This one shows you how
grasshoppers breathe using this

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.200
very complicated
network of air tubes,

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:17.950
instead of having any lungs
or blood vessels, like we use.

01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:20.410
And it's not the most
efficient system, but it works,

01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:24.180
because insects are pretty small
and don't use a lot of oxygen.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.000
And I make a lot of animated
infographics like this one,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.120
but I've also done a
few static illustrations

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.400
for science articles
in magazines.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.920
And today, I want to
talk to you about some

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.570
of the things I personally
have learned

01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:38.770
through making these
infographics.

01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:41.010
So first, I'll talk a
little about how I got

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:43.860
into science illustration in
the first place, and then I'd

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:45.750
like to talk about
some of the things

01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:49.040
that I think are the main
challenges for me when I try

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.140
to make these projects,
and how I try

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:55.260
to address those challenges
while working on something.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.140
So I got into making
science illustrations more

01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:01.720
from the science side than
from an art background.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.860
I got my bachelor's
degree in molecular

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:09.480
and developmental biology,
broadly studying how people

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.520
and animals grow and change
throughout their lives.

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.410
So I've always been
really interested

01:22:14.410 --> 01:22:17.620
in these really intricate
processes that are happening

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:20.270
around us, and in our
own bodies every day.

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:23.900
So processes like this one,
where lifting a cup of coffee,

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:27.660
or just your arm, where these
trillions of tiny molecules,

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:31.270
and fibers, and molecular
machinery are really working

01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:34.830
together to make your movements
look seamless and easy.

01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:38.880
Or how everyone sitting
here today developed

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.610
into a functioning human from
just a tiny cluster of cells.

01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:45.620
So here in this graphic,
you start at the top right,

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:49.060
as a fertilized egg, and
it animates the process

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:51.290
of embryo development
all the way to birth,

01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:53.210
at the center of the diagram.

01:22:53.210 --> 01:22:56.430
And I really think it's kind
of incredible that we all went

01:22:56.430 --> 01:23:00.240
through this very complicated
developmental process before we

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.870
were even born, and so for me,
design is really a way for me

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:07.990
to share these really
awesome science stories.

01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:11.850
And I like to try and share
them in a way that uses color

01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:16.960
or movement, and really tries
to uncouple the technical jargon

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.390
from what's actually happening,

01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:21.190
and what the science
actually means.

01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:24.100
And when I'm making
these infographics,

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.400
there are really two challenges

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.430
that I think are the
most difficult for me,

01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:30.690
and the two questions,
really, that I try to think

01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:33.200
about when I work on a project.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.590
So the first challenge
for me is really

01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:39.520
to decide what information
belongs in a graphic.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.840
I think we have such
a huge, you know,

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.470
library of scientific
information,

01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:47.140
and it's very difficult to
pick out an individual story

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:50.220
that makes sense, and in
particular, to pick out a story

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:53.150
in a way that's, like,
respectful to the science,

01:23:53.150 --> 01:23:54.960
and also to the audience.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.630
So I think a good infographic
really lets you pay attention

01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:00.030
to what's really important,

01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:02.970
and it does that by removing
everything else that's

01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:04.270
less relevant.

01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:08.370
And the second challenge
that I try to really think

01:24:08.370 --> 01:24:11.800
about logically is
picking an art style

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.340
that really complements
the science.

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:18.930
I want -- okay, I want to
find a way of, you know,

01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:22.070
connecting the art and the
science, in a way where both

01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:25.470
of them are kind of talking
together in a conversation, and,

01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:27.610
you know, the graphics is
actually an integrated part

01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:29.270
of the science story.

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:32.800
Okay, so between these
two, you know, challenges

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.900
or overall goals, I want to talk
about the information first,

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:38.220
and I want to convince you
that this really is, like,

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:41.790
a big challenge to distill this
information, and that this is,

01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:43.100
like, a very big constraint

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:46.370
in making these science
illustrations.

01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:48.650
Because there are a lot
of other constraints

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.950
in making an infographic.

01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:51.580
Obviously, there's
things like the deadline,

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.300
or the size of what
you're allowed to work on,

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:57.490
but there's also things like
vocabulary, the amount of text.

01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:00.140
And of all these different
constraints in a project,

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.010
I still think that
deciding what to remove

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.710
in the first place is
really the most difficult.

01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:08.930
And to give you a more concrete
example, here's two examples

01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:10.690
of some really complicated
science figures

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:12.830
that I personally really love.

01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:17.390
On the left is a food network by
David Levine [assumed spelling].

01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:19.000
I'm not sure if you
can see that,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.190
but it's a food network based --

01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:26.770
it's intended to talk
about the codfish,

01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:29.370
which is near the
center of the diagram.

01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:33.020
And it's really -- its purpose
is to show you the huge variety

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.800
of animals and organisms that
are interacting with each other

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.670
in a natural food network.

01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:41.170
And we usually see, like,
a simplified food network,

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:44.810
where only a couple different
species, maybe the most common

01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:47.470
or important predator/prey
relationships,

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:51.530
but in the real world, there's
actually a lot more going on.

01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:58.430
And this one on the right --

01:25:58.430 --> 01:26:00.170
it's a diagram of
all the neurons

01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:02.950
in a tiny nematode
worm called C. elegans.

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:05.160
The worm's only about
a millimeter long,

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.010
and it has more or
less 300 neurons.

01:26:08.010 --> 01:26:10.130
And this kind of network diagram

01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:12.220
of neurons is called
a connectome,

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:13.890
and the C. elegans
worm is special,

01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:16.520
because it's the only
animal where all of these --

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.690
all these nodes have
been mapped in this way.

01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:24.510
And in this map, each of these
colors tells you a little bit

01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:27.020
about what's -- what each
of the nodes stands for.

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.580
So the purple on the edges of
the diagram are the muscles.

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.260
The yellow are the
motor neurons,

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.260
which are telling the
muscles what to do.

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:37.070
The blue are the neurons

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:38.740
that are gathering
sensory information

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.040
from the environment.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.380
They're detecting things like
touch, or smell, and the orange

01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:46.260
and interneurons, which connect
all of these other things,

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.830
and make up this very
complicated diagram

01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:52.340
that helps this tiny worm move
throughout its environment

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.970
and make decisions.

01:26:54.970 --> 01:26:57.320
Okay, I want to show you
just one more picture

01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.440
of a complicated science
diagram, and bear with me,

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.900
because it's my favorite one.

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:06.960
[Laughter] It's a
molecular diagram.

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:10.180
It's about all the things
that happen inside your body

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:14.600
when you digest some food and
turn it into molecular energy.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.380
And I love this because I
studied molecular biology.

01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:21.250
I really like the idea that
when you zoom down far enough

01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:22.710
into our own bodies, we --

01:27:22.710 --> 01:27:26.970
all of us look like this really
crazy, complicated network

01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:29.810
of molecules, and
chemicals, and interactions.

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:32.600
And all of these are -- you
know, different things happen

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.860
when you eat a protein
versus a sugar, like --

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.720
and these are, like, all
represented in this diagram.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.290
I actually didn't even
include the whole thing.

01:27:40.290 --> 01:27:42.590
It's cropped.

01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:48.190
Okay. But as much as
I love this figure,

01:27:48.190 --> 01:27:49.640
it's too much information.

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.820
It's just -- like,
nobody can look at this

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:53.520
and process it all at once.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.770
That's -- I don't
think that's possible.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:59.930
So a useful infographic to me
is never an accurate, like,

01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:02.500
complete representation
of all of the science.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:07.090
It's -- it has to be curated
in some way to be useful.

01:28:07.090 --> 01:28:08.760
So the first thing I try to do

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.630
when I plan an infographic
is really think

01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:13.670
about my particular
audience for that project,

01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:15.310
and what they really need.

01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:18.820
And, you know, most people
don't need all of this,

01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.770
and it's actually more
helpful to get rid

01:28:20.770 --> 01:28:23.100
of the things you don't need.

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.510
And depending on the audience,

01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:26.130
that can mean very
different things.

01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:29.240
So here's my attempt at
turning that molecular diagram

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.310
into something a
little more reasonable.

01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:34.260
This is a story for
medical students.

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:37.560
So it's part of a series of
20 different posters I made

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:41.420
in collaboration with a company
called Nerd Corp Medical.

01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:47.290
And the point of these posters
was to work as kind of a large,

01:28:47.290 --> 01:28:49.660
you know, interesting
picture that people could put

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:52.340
up on their walls, but
also use as a study guide

01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.980
for medical licensing exams.

01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:01.110
So that's a very specific
audience, with a very, you know,

01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:05.000
detailed and clear set of goals.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.550
And because the audience
is so specific,

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:09.720
I haven't actually removed
too much information.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.520
What I've done here is gone
through and picked out several

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.240
of the chemical pathways,
like the TZA cycle,

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.190
that you would probably
need to know

01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:21.600
for a medical licensing
exam, and I've removed a lot

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.860
of the pathways that you
probably wouldn't need to know,

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:26.200
or are less important,
or less known.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.190
But in the pathways
that I did include,

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:32.390
I didn't actually
remove a whole lot

01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:35.420
of the information
inside each pathway.

01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:39.050
So I still have things like
the names of all the molecules,

01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:40.990
the intermediate
chemicals, like even things

01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:44.900
like how much molecular
energy each step would take.

01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.020
And these are all things I
would probably have removed

01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:49.450
if this was for a
more general audience,

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:52.980
because I think this is still
a really complicated graphic

01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:54.550
that's hard to understand.

01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:57.550
But since the intended
audience here was really medical

01:29:57.550 --> 01:30:02.140
students, I needed to
include all this information,

01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:03.610
because they needed to know it.

01:30:03.610 --> 01:30:05.700
And that was really
the deciding factor

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.900
in how much information
to include.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.870
So I have a second
example here, where I'll go

01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:16.840
into a little more detail about
how exactly I made the design,

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.480
and how I try to think
about the audience

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.230
in concrete ways
throughout the process

01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:24.210
of making an infographic.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:27.120
This is a poster from
the same project.

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:31.670
It's about 60 different kinds
of viruses that affect humans,

01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:35.160
and which you might need to know
about, that are common diseases,

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:38.560
or are important in
various other ways.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.010
And the poster is arranged where
-- you probably can't read it,

01:30:42.010 --> 01:30:47.200
but each of those little gray
boxes is one specific type

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.580
of virus, and the box contains
some kind of interesting facts

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.480
that you probably need to know.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:57.650
And these specific facts include
things like, well, the symptoms

01:30:57.650 --> 01:31:00.920
if you get the virus, how you
might be able to treat it,

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.120
and also I used some icons

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.520
to provide a little
more information

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:06.820
that might also be useful

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:09.080
for medical students,
which is my audience.

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:14.910
So I have a little vaccine icon
on some of these virus boxes

01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:17.470
to show the ones where we
actually do have a vaccine

01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:19.070
for that virus.

01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:20.820
A lot of them don't.

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:23.190
And I also have an
insect icon --

01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:25.910
actually not sure if there's
one here that shows it,

01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:29.350
but I have an insect icon to
show which viruses can be spread

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:32.650
by mosquitoes, or ticks,
or other arthropods.

01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:35.500
So I'll show you some
sketches from the process

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:41.150
of making this infographic,
and really the major point,

01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:44.240
or the major problem that I
had when first starting out,

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.090
was deciding how to arrange
these 60 different types

01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:50.740
of viruses on one diagram.

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:55.340
Because if you have 60
things, there are a lot

01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.300
of different ways
to arrange them.

01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.130
You could arrange
them by phylogeny,

01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:00.430
like a family tree of viruses.

01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:04.300
You could arrange
them by order of --

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:07.410
you know, how dangerous they
are to people, or group them

01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:10.030
by how you would treat
the virus infection,

01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:14.130
or into general categories
of biology.

01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:18.630
And so when I have a kind of
open-ended question like that,

01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:20.630
I try to think of a
couple of these solutions,

01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:23.800
and then pick the one that
really makes the most sense

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.420
for my particular audience.

01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:29.120
So in my case, the audience
is medical students.

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.450
They don't actually really need

01:32:30.450 --> 01:32:33.400
to know how viruses are
related to each other.

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.020
This isn't a project meant
for evolutionary biologists,

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:39.530
so that's probably not
a great way to do it.

01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:43.810
And metrics like how dangerous a
virus is, or how to treat it --

01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:46.940
that -- those things
can really depend

01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:48.710
on a lot of external factors.

01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:52.060
So that's also -- I also
don't think that's a great way

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.610
to arrange something like that.

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:58.830
And what I ended up doing is to
divide up these 60 viruses based

01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:03.010
on three very broad,
major groupings.

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:06.790
So on the bottom of the figure,
in pink here, those are all

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:09.190
of the viruses that
infect humans using RNA,

01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:12.240
and in the top, those
are two different types

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:15.080
of viruses that use DNA.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.930
And these are, you
know, very broad topics,

01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:21.950
and I could've made
this a family tree.

01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:24.870
I could've put a lot more
information here, but really,

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:26.900
for the purposes
of my audience --

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:28.840
you know, medical students
studying for an exam --

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.220
they really don't
need that information.

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:35.250
And it's enough to just
have these three major types

01:33:35.250 --> 01:33:39.060
of biological -- you
know, how viruses work.

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:46.090
And sometimes, I think it's
actually better to have just --

01:33:46.090 --> 01:33:47.910
you know, stop at just
enough information,

01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:50.520
instead of including
everything you possibly could.

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:54.480
And in the end, I play with the
color and shapes a little bit.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.110
But the main -- you know, the
main point of the infographic,

01:33:57.110 --> 01:34:00.130
and the majority of the layout
that I work on is really based

01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:03.030
on these questions that I
try to ask myself about --

01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:05.620
does the audience actually
need this information?

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.990
Like, what is -- what do
they absolutely need to know?

01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:10.850
Because I have to include that,
and then everything else --

01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:14.330
like, really asking
myself, is this necessary?

01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:18.080
And this project was a
series of 20 posters.

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.230
I'm not going to go through all
of them, but throughout the year

01:34:21.230 --> 01:34:24.020
and a half that I spent
working on the project,

01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:26.990
these were the consistent
questions I tried to ask myself

01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:29.680
about what the audience
was really looking for.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.930
And I'm not a medical
student, so this kind

01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:38.830
of thought process was pretty
heavily reliant on, you know,

01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:42.410
medical textbooks, other kinds
of study guides for these exams.

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:44.940
And I also worked with Dr. Ruben
Matthews [assumed spelling],

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.650
who commissioned the project,
and who's a medical doctor

01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:50.380
who worked with me
throughout the process.

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:53.430
And I think this
research was important,

01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:55.720
because all these posters
are meant for a very,

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:59.340
very specific audience with
a very specific set of needs.

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.840
Like, the people who are looking
at this are actually trying

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.620
to use it to gain
some information.

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:06.810
It's not a project that's
meant for fun, or --

01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:09.510
I mean, it was fun,
but that's not --

01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:11.780
[laughter] that's not
really what the end goal

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:13.730
of the project is.

01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:16.970
So that's one very
specific type of infographic

01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:19.580
that I've designed, but I
also work on projects meant

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.880
for the general public.

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:24.160
And I think that's a
very different process.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.350
So I want to talk about an
example of a project I worked

01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:29.730
on for a more broad audience.

01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:36.940
So this is an infographic
I worked on with "Wired,"

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.350
[assumed spelling],
about how different kinds

01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.240
of plants have evolved
to survive in California,

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.850
where there are a
lot of wildfires.

01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:45.150
It's for the general public,

01:35:45.150 --> 01:35:50.130
and the full infographic has
six different examples of plants

01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:53.570
that have evolved unique
adaptations to fire.

01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:55.380
And I picked these six
plants because each

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:57.470
of them are very
well-known scientifically,

01:35:57.470 --> 01:36:01.120
and they all provide some
kind of unique example.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.280
They all have a different
adaptation to fire.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.030
So there's the giant
sequoia, the first one,

01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:09.320
which has very thick,
fire-resistant bark.

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.990
And the fireweed --
very aptly named --

01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:14.760
which grows very well after
a forest fire has swept

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.680
through a region and left this
very open, burned landscape.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.420
They grow very well in
those disturbed areas.

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:23.700
And the California black oak,

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:26.470
which has a very
extensive root system,

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:29.380
and even if a fire burns
most of the top of the tree,

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:32.110
it can regrow from the tree
stump left behind using its

01:36:32.110 --> 01:36:33.520
root structure.

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:39.300
And all of these six examples
really help illustrate a very

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.440
different aspect
of fire adaptation,

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:45.470
and in this infographic, I'm
limiting the number of examples

01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:48.670
to just six instead of the 60
viruses I showed you earlier.

01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:52.370
And that's because a general
audience is much more diverse,

01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:55.490
and I want to go into a
lot of detail with each one

01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:59.840
of these examples, so that I can
take a group of people that are

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.140
from very different backgrounds

01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:05.770
and really help them understand
the science in the same way.

01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:14.990
Okay. And when I'm curating an
infographic with fewer examples,

01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:17.560
I try to really make sure
each one has a purpose.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.840
So for the example I
showed you with 60 viruses,

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.840
a lot of them are very
similar to each other,

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.810
but a medical student
would probably still need

01:37:24.810 --> 01:37:26.130
to know both of them.

01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:28.110
For here, I didn't
want to include things

01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:31.390
that were redundant, because
I only have six examples.

01:37:31.390 --> 01:37:34.260
So I went through and really
tried to pick out the plants

01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:37.360
that contributed something
unique to the infographic.

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.690
Each one tells you something
a little bit different

01:37:39.690 --> 01:37:42.590
about fire and plants.

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:46.620
Okay. So I've been talking a lot

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:49.420
about how information editing
is a constraint, or, like,

01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:51.910
a limitation of making
infographics,

01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:54.000
but I think it's really
also an opportunity

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.430
to try some cool
design techniques,

01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:59.380
and do something a
little more creative.

01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:02.930
So I made this particular
infographic with actual paper

01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:05.050
and fire, which was
a lot of fun,

01:38:05.050 --> 01:38:06.990
and it's something I
wouldn't have been able to do

01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:10.430
if this was meant for a
more specialist audience.

01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:13.780
So because it's meant for the
general public, I didn't need

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:16.040
to include a lot of
-- like, you know,

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.580
very specific scientific
details.

01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.580
Like the number of seeds
each flower produces,

01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:24.390
or where exactly to find
the plant, its life cycle,

01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:26.430
all of these things
that would be important

01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:29.410
for a more specialist audience.

01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:33.230
So this doesn't have to be a
plant identification guide,

01:38:33.230 --> 01:38:34.840
which means I can
have a lot more fun

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:40.040
with how I present the
information, and, like,

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.840
removing things like
color, and those details.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:47.130
So I set the plant
sculptures actually on fire,

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:49.600
and videotaped them, and
afterwards, I turned them

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.630
into an animated
loop in Photoshop.

01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:56.290
And, you know, I
accept that using paper

01:38:56.290 --> 01:39:00.120
and fire isn't a conventional
way to make plant illustrations,

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.900
but I wanted to do this because
I think it really emphasized,

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:06.090
to me, what was the
point of the graphic.

01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:09.260
Which was really how
closely tied these plants are

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:12.920
to wildfire, how they really --
some of them really require fire

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:16.120
in order to complete their life
cycle, and how this is just

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.300
such an ingrained part of
the science for these plants.

01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:26.130
Okay, so the end
result is something

01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:28.030
where the visuals are a
little less conventional,

01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:32.320
but I think it still includes
a good amount of information.

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.020
And when I design infographics
for a less specialist audience,

01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.430
I need to curate the
information a little bit more,

01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:40.160
and really boil down
the infographic

01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.940
to the very important examples,

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.820
because I usually
include fewer examples.

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.860
But this information editing
isn't just a constraint

01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:50.160
for design.

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.490
It can actually open up
possibilities for new ways

01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:55.180
of showing information.

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:58.690
So to recap, when I make an
infographic, I really try

01:39:58.690 --> 01:40:02.580
to think about the audience,
what they actually need

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.130
from the project, and to try and
meet them there with something

01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:07.450
that provides the right
amount of information.

01:40:07.450 --> 01:40:10.310
And to some extent, the process
of doing that, and thinking

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:11.610
about the audience,

01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:15.070
really influences the
design choices I can make.

01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:19.470
And that brings me to the
graphics half of my talk.

01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:22.970
I talk, though, from -- I talked
about the information first,

01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:24.890
because I don't think you
can have a good infographic

01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:26.940
if your information is bad.

01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:29.500
But once you have the
data, then you get to work

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:33.210
on the really fun project
of finding an art style

01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:35.530
that really can be
combined with the science,

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:38.860
and really complement
what I'm trying to say.

01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:40.690
And this is a very
open-ended challenge,

01:40:40.690 --> 01:40:42.650
because design can
do a lot of things.

01:40:42.650 --> 01:40:47.140
It can make you feel, you
know, astonished, or upset,

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:50.110
or it can make a
difficult topic feel easy,

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:52.400
or at least more interesting.

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.870
So my specific goal for each
project is always a little bit

01:40:55.870 --> 01:41:00.550
different, but overall, for all
of my projects, I really try

01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:03.350
to make sure I have
some specific reason

01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:05.240
for using that design style.

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:08.690
So it might not always
work all the time,

01:41:08.690 --> 01:41:11.930
but if I can have a logical
reason for using that design,

01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:13.260
I'm pretty happy at the end.

01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:21.810
So I want to go back to this
molecular pathway diagram

01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:25.000
as an example, and what
really strikes me the most

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.810
about this image is
the really tiny scale

01:41:27.810 --> 01:41:30.120
at which everything
is happening.

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.830
It's really just so complicated
and tiny that, of course,

01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:37.230
we can't see any of this
happening with our own eyes.

01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:40.380
So when I turned this into an
infographic, I really wanted

01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:45.470
to highlight this kind
of impossible scale,

01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:48.100
because that's how I really
felt about the science,

01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.570
or that was what I thought
was the most awesome thing

01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:52.990
about this project.

01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:55.860
And this concept of extreme
size really reminds me

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.530
of old constellation
charts, like this page

01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:01.140
from a celestial atlas.

01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:05.220
Molecules and stars are both
just so different in size

01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:08.150
from humans that we have a
really hard time picturing them,

01:42:08.150 --> 01:42:09.940
and understanding them.

01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.620
And even though the idea

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:15.060
of molecules is actually a
pretty recent development,

01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:18.680
people have been looking at the
stars for thousands of years,

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:23.010
and inventing these patterns and
ways of looking at size to try

01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:25.510
and make sense of
something that's so different

01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:28.170
in size from ourselves.

01:42:28.170 --> 01:42:31.980
So when I made this infographic,
I decided to illustrate all

01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:35.510
of the chemicals kind
of in the style of stars

01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:38.430
in a constellation,
because that's a way

01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:41.290
of understanding size that
has been part of our history

01:42:41.290 --> 01:42:43.630
for a really long time.

01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:46.650
And I really like this kind
of, like, visual allegory --

01:42:46.650 --> 01:42:50.110
I suppose you would call it --
and I try to include something

01:42:50.110 --> 01:42:52.430
like that in a lot
of my projects,

01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:55.810
and to pick an art
style that has something

01:42:55.810 --> 01:43:02.690
at least thematically
to do with the science.

01:43:02.690 --> 01:43:05.320
And what I really want to do
with these visual, you know,

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.820
design experiments is highlight
what I think of as, like,

01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:11.330
the warm, human side of science.

01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:13.740
I think in a lot
of media or movies,

01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:15.850
scientists are often portrayed

01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:18.960
as these extremely serious
people in white lab coats,

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.110
and they're running around their
very high-tech lab frantically

01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:23.540
with a clipboard.

01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:26.530
Probably it hasn't really
been portrayed like that

01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:30.630
at this conference, but a
lot of movies, I think --

01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:33.980
but I don't really think science
is about the white lab coats

01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:35.280
and the high-tech equipment.

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:38.840
I think it's really about
the need to understand

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.820
where we came from,
or what we're made of,

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:45.400
what might happen
to us in the future.

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.220
So I don't think science
is a cold, technical field,

01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.580
even though it's sometimes
portrayed like that.

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:54.870
I think it's a very warm
expression of human curiosity,

01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:59.150
and I want to use art to kind
of add an element of warmth

01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:03.100
or surprise to my
science illustrations.

01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:06.730
So I have three examples
left in this talk,

01:44:06.730 --> 01:44:08.030
and I want to use them to share

01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:11.190
with you a few different
examples of how I've tried to do

01:44:11.190 --> 01:44:13.480
that in some of my
different projects.

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.960
So this first example is a
series of virus trading cards.

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:21.390
I animated them using a
science software called Chimera,

01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:23.440
which was developed
by University

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.580
of California San Francisco.

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:29.060
Each of these trading cards
shows you the structure

01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:32.130
of a viral capsid, which
is the protein shell

01:44:32.130 --> 01:44:34.970
that surrounds the
genetic material inside

01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:37.440
of a virus, and protects it.

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.600
And I've included a couple human
diseases, like dengue and HPV,

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:43.250
but also in the middle
is the Chlorella virus,

01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:46.210
which infects green
algae, because of course,

01:44:46.210 --> 01:44:49.830
humans aren't the only
ones that get viruses.

01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:52.890
And I decided to illustrate
all of these viruses

01:44:52.890 --> 01:44:56.070
as trading cards, and
to me, the excitement

01:44:56.070 --> 01:45:00.050
of finding a rare trading card
is, like, a nostalgic feeling

01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:02.430
that a lot of people
can identify with,

01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:05.280
even if they don't necessarily
think viruses themselves are

01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.450
particularly exciting
or interesting.

01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:11.150
And I was also inspired
a little bit

01:45:11.150 --> 01:45:13.360
by these cigarette
trading cards.

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.430
So these cigarette cards,
which you can see on the right,

01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:20.100
were trading cards
-- were fairly small,

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:24.430
and came in cigarette packs
in the 1920s and earlier.

01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:27.100
And they were really included
for structural support

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:31.490
for the cigarette pack, but
they came in sets of 25 to 50,

01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:35.560
and they would show you,
you know, trading --

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.560
like, collectible
images, like fire trucks,

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.060
or flowers, or actresses.

01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:42.810
And I wanted to play
off this concept

01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:46.020
of having something that's
not very good for you,

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:49.450
like cigarettes or viruses,
but they're still very --

01:45:49.450 --> 01:45:51.220
you know, they have something
beautiful about them,

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.390
and they're very
highly collectible.

01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:56.160
And I liked this
idea that viruses --

01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:00.720
I do think they're geometrically
beautiful, and fascinating

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:02.650
from a biological standpoint,

01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:05.100
even if they're not
very good for you.

01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:09.680
So my second example is this
animated butterfly infographic.

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:13.450
This project was
inspired by illustrations

01:46:13.450 --> 01:46:16.380
from 19th-century
naturalists and illustrators,

01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:20.220
like the insect pictures on
the right, and these days,

01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:22.960
we have photos, and 3D
scanners, and videos.

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:26.960
So as scientists, we don't have
to draw all of our discoveries,

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:31.300
but with this project,
I wanted to think

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:35.800
about what might a 19th-century
naturalist do if they had access

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.470
to all of this modern
art technology.

01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:39.990
What if we didn't
have photography,

01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:42.980
but we still had computers,
and animation, and Photoshop?

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:46.320
And of course, that's just a
playful thought experiment,

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.100
but it was also kind of a
way for me to remind myself

01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:54.290
of this very long history
of natural exploration.

01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:58.320
That people thousands of years
ago, and hundreds of years ago,

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:01.650
have been really interested and
excited by the natural world,

01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:04.950
and in very much the same
way as scientists today.

01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:08.790
And this last project I'm going

01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:12.340
to show you is an antique-style
map of Mars, and it's one

01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:14.440
of my favorite projects.

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.810
This isn't really
an infographic.

01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:18.810
It's more of a map, like
cartography project,

01:47:18.810 --> 01:47:22.090
but I'm including it here
anyway because it's a project

01:47:22.090 --> 01:47:25.690
where I've put a lot of thought
into trying to find an art style

01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:29.030
that really worked
together with the science.

01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:32.840
And for this map, I -- it's a
mix of hand-drawn and digital.

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:38.080
I -- the kind of 3D layer
underneath is open map data

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:41.620
from NASA, but I also printed
out a topographic map of Mars,

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:43.830
and traced it in pencil
to add some kind of,

01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:45.360
like, hand-drawn feeling.

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.880
And then I added everything
back together digitally,

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.690
and the style for
this map was inspired

01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:55.990
by 18th-century atlases,
like this map of the world.

01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:58.180
And I love these maps
from hundreds of years ago

01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:01.700
because there's still so much
left to explore in the world.

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:04.070
So you can see, like,
all of these blank edges

01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:07.610
where the information runs
out at the top, or the sides.

01:48:07.610 --> 01:48:11.110
There's just still so much to
explore at this time period.

01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:14.830
We -- Antarctica, the deep
seas, like, mountaintops,

01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:20.370
and deserts -- there's a lot
of mystery here on the map.

01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:21.670
And now there's, like --

01:48:21.670 --> 01:48:24.390
of course, we have these
very detailed satellite maps

01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:28.010
and images of Earth, so we
don't really have that kind

01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:31.440
of mystery anymore
on our own planet.

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.990
But we still don't know
very much, comparatively,

01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:36.930
about other planets and
moons in our solar system,

01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:40.350
so I think today, really,
planets like Mars are kind

01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:43.580
of the modern equivalent of
this geographic frontier,

01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:47.370
this mysterious land that we
still have left to explore.

01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:53.170
So in this project, I wanted to
use a very similar design style

01:48:53.170 --> 01:48:56.670
to kind of tie together how
we have such a long history

01:48:56.670 --> 01:48:59.450
of mapping and exploring
new places,

01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:02.990
and tie it into what we're
currently trying to do

01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:05.450
in exploring other planets.

01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:13.320
And I also had a
second reason here

01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.480
for using this design style.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.410
One of my favorite things

01:49:17.410 --> 01:49:20.860
about planetary science is
how scientists have decided

01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:23.110
to name different
features on other planets,

01:49:23.110 --> 01:49:25.230
like mountains and craters.

01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:28.910
And the feature naming
really is different depending

01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:31.720
on the planet, but for
Mars, we name craters

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.440
after famous scientists
or artists,

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.160
and for very small
craters, we name them

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:39.230
after tiny villages
and towns on Earth.

01:49:39.230 --> 01:49:40.740
So to me, that was such a --

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:42.060
like, a really fun example

01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:45.460
of how data isn't
impersonal or technical.

01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:48.970
Even when we're exploring
this lifeless, barren desert

01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:51.870
in outer space, we still
give the features names

01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:54.890
of people we care about
from history, or the places

01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:57.530
that are really close
to us on Earth.

01:49:57.530 --> 01:50:01.070
So my second goal here was
to use this very hand-drawn,

01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:04.070
personal style to try
and highlight the --

01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:09.760
I guess the human side
of planetary exploration.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.480
And I also made a second
map in this series.

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:19.320
This one's for Venus, and the
history of the exploration

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.350
of Venus is actually
very interesting,

01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:23.400
because the majority
of spacecraft

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:25.260
that have landed
here were probes sent

01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.730
by the Soviet Union
during the Cold War.

01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:30.190
And the Soviet Union was
actually very successful

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:33.360
in exploring Venus at this
historical time period.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.450
So for this map, I decided
to use a design style

01:50:36.450 --> 01:50:39.430
that was a little inspired
by propaganda posters

01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:41.580
from the Cold War era.

01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:43.790
It uses, you know, the
big, block letters,

01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:48.120
kind of '60s-inspired color
scheme with the red and yellow.

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:50.400
And here, I wanted to use art

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:55.260
to really emphasize the role
politics played, and the role

01:50:55.260 --> 01:51:00.310
of government in scientific
exploration, and how we got all

01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:02.690
of this information
in the first place.

01:51:02.690 --> 01:51:07.590
So those were two very different
examples of how I've tried

01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:12.640
to incorporate human values
and human history into maps

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:15.450
of planets where no one
has ever really even gone.

01:51:15.450 --> 01:51:20.670
Okay. So pulling back from
all those individual projects,

01:51:20.670 --> 01:51:24.230
I want to go back to the two
main challenges I talked about,

01:51:24.230 --> 01:51:28.510
and that I try to
address in my design work.

01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:32.070
So from an information side,
I think it's really important

01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:34.270
to try and understand
the audience,

01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:36.800
and what they really
need, and to at least try

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.100
and meet them there
with something

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:41.720
that provides the right amount
of information, but not so much

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:44.770
that it's overwhelming.

01:51:44.770 --> 01:51:47.010
And to me, this is one
of the biggest challenges

01:51:47.010 --> 01:51:50.400
in science communication, but
even though it's a challenge,

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.880
I think it's not
just a limitation.

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.700
It can also open possibilities

01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:59.010
for how you can communicate
the science, and introduce new,

01:51:59.010 --> 01:52:02.010
creative ways of
showing the data.

01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:04.890
And from an art perspective,

01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:10.000
I think art really can add
a sense of, you know, like,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.720
human warmth to the science,

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:14.720
and to really make the story
relatable, and visceral,

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:17.660
and make you feel, you know,
emotions about the science.

01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:20.980
It doesn't have to be
hard and technical,

01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.760
and I really think it
helps emphasize the idea

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:30.170
that science is just as
creative and driven by curiosity

01:52:30.170 --> 01:52:33.450
as things like art, or
writing and literature.

01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:38.330
And finally, I think the most
powerful stories are the ones

01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:41.600
where the science and the
art are really integrated,

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.540
so that if you changed
either one or the other,

01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:46.690
it wouldn't really be
the same story anymore.

01:52:46.690 --> 01:52:50.570
And I think there's a lot of
value in making visualizations

01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:53.740
where the art and the science
are talking back and forth

01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:55.040
in a conversation, instead

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.400
of being dominated
by one or the other.

01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:59.610
And that's really my
goal and what I try

01:52:59.610 --> 01:53:01.500
to do in my design work.

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:05.520
So thank you for taking the
time to listen to me today,
