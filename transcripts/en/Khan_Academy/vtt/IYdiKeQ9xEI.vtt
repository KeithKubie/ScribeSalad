00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.100
I'll now introduce you to the
concept of a random variable.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.390
And for me this is something
that I always had a lot of

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.550
trouble getting my head around,
and that's really because

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.040
it's a byproduct of
what it's called.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.470
It's called a variable and
we're used to variables as kind

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.770
of an unknown in the equation.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.830
If I write x plus 3 is equal
to 7, the variable was x.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.680
Maybe you could solve for it
or maybe you could have an

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.550
equation y is equal
to 3x minus 2.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.080
And then, here y and x
are both variables.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.620
If you input 1x you could solve
for the other variable, y.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.290
And you can change them.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.500
And variables were kind of
things that could change and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.990
that you could solve for.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.540
And they could take on
particular values.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.160
A random variable is kind of
the same thing in that it can

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.820
take on multiple values, but
it's not something that you

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.570
really ever solve for.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.910
So just so you get used to the
notation, a random variable

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.180
is usually a capital letter.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.140
Usually a Capital X, Y, or Z.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.940
Usually a capital X.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.530
And where it really defers from
a traditional variable is that

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.850
it can take on a bunch of
different values, like a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.890
traditional variable but
you never solve for it.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.750
And really, it's a little
misleading to call it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.480
a variable at all.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.110
It's really a function.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.490
And it's a function that maps
you from the world of random

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.740
processes to an actual number.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.180
So let's say-- I don't
know-- I wanted to somehow

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.560
quantify a random process.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.590
Is it going to rain
or not tomorrow?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.105
So let's see-- rain tomorrow.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.970
No rain.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.340
So you could observe that.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.850
You could wait until tomorrow
and see if it rains or not, but

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.940
then, how do you quantify it?

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.140
Well, we can define a random
variable that will quantify it.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.720
We can say this random variable
is going to be equal to 1 if it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.390
rains tomorrow and it equals 0
if it doesn't rain tomorrow.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.580
We didn't have to assign 1
and 0; those tend to be a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.500
little bit more useful.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.460
They make sense.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.400
But we could have assigned this
as-- I don't know-- we could

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.370
have said that this is 21
and that this is 100.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.680
It's however you define it.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.570
So it's important to keep this
distinction in mind, that a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.470
random variable-- it isn't a
variable in the traditional

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.520
sense of the world.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.160
It's more of a function that
maps us from the world of a

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.430
random process to a number.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.760
And then, this number
is going to be random.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.820
Because we don't know if it's
going to rain or not tomorrow,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.540
maybe we have some sense
of the probabilities.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.360
So this variable can
take on either value.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.780
And that leads us-- let me
draw a couple of more random

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.000
variable definitions just so
you get the intuition that

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.490
these really are functions.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.460
So we could define a random
variable x as equal to--

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.650
well, actually, let me--

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.940
It could just be a very
obvious numeric mapping.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:55.690
It could just be the
number facing up when

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.856
I roll a fair dice.

00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:00.560
That's a random variable.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.575
I could've also said just the
number most facing east when I

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:06.890
rolled a fair die, although
that's a little less useful.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.200
You could also define a random
variable, x is equal to-- you

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.730
could say it's equal to 1 if
heads, and I could

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.000
say 0 if tails.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.680
Or I could have done it
the other way around.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.940
Once again, these heads
and tails are outcomes

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.810
of an experiment.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.770
When I flip a coin that's a
random process, each flip is an

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.090
experiment and then the random
variable is just quantifying

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.100
that experiment.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.010
So I know it sounds a little
technical with the terminology,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.540
but what we're really doing
is fairly something simple.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.380
We're just assigning a
1 if we get a heads, a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.660
0 if we get a tails.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.150
And the random variable is
just that function mapping.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.630
Now I'm going into all of this
random variable business, which

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.500
I didn't do before when we did
probability because it does

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.800
start to become a little
bit useful notationally.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.090
Because we'll start to talk
about things like probability

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.380
distributions and expected
values, and it really is

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.590
useful to quantify things
as a random variable.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.270
And with that said, let's talk
about probability distributions

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.130
and expected values.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.560
So the first thing,
probability-- actually, let

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.570
me define something else.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.140
There's two types of
random variables.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.250
You can have discrete random
variables, or continuous.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.560
So there's two types.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.150
Discrete would be like, really
all of the definitions

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.210
that we had up until now.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.200
The flip of a coin, you're
either going to get a 1 or a 0.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.010
There's two discrete cases.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.560
When I roll a die there's
1 of 6 different

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.570
outcomes I can have.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.380
Whether it rains
tomorrow, there's 1 of

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.080
2 outcomes: yes or no.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.110
So in all of these situations
you could almost say you

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.920
could have accountable
number of outcomes.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.240
A continuous random variable
could take on an infinite

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.100
number of outcomes.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.850
So a continuous random variable
would be the exact-- it could

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:11.660
be x is equal to the exact
amount of rain in

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.610
inches tomorrow.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.500
Now why is this continuous?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.640
Well, if you think about it
that could take on any of

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.200
an infinite set of values.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.940
You might have 1 inch of
rain tomorrow or you might

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.750
have 1.1 inches of rain.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.620
You might have 1.111
inches of rain.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.560
You might have 2.1111
inches of rain.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.080
As you could see, you can come
up with an infinite number

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.610
of combinations of the
amount of rain you have.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.840
To get exact-- well, I'll go
into more of this when I

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.950
talk about probability
density functions.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.790
But in general, even though you
might say, oh, well, I can't

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.280
imagine having an infinite
amount of rain because we're

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.560
not going to have 100
gallons of rain tomorrow.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.180
But if you think about it, you
could take on any value between

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.990
1 and 2 inches of rain.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.170
There's actually an
infinite number of

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.900
values between 0 and 1.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.950
For any value you could find
a number that's a little--

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.670
just to think about it.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.090
Between 0 and 1, 1/2
is in between those.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.460
And you can always find a
number that's halfway between

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.740
those and then a number that's
halfway between those.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.770
There's an infinite number
of numbers between

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.640
any two numbers.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.130
While, with the discrete random
variables, it just took on

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.050
a finite number of values.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.740
Those ones up here, it
could only take on 1 or 0.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.400
It didn't take on 1.1.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.550
Or it couldn't
take on infinity.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.960
And I make that difference
because actually, how we look

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.190
at it in terms of their
probability distributions

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.990
are a little different.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.100
But they're very related.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.330
So a discreet random variable
like the ones that we had

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.800
defined at the beginning of
these videos, they have a

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.980
probability distribution.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.880
Let's do it for-- let's say
x is equal to the number

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:59.440
facing up on a fair dice.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.550
So we already know that
to get each outcome--

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.360
there's 6 outcomes.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.360
You either can get a 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, or 6 facing up.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.430
So let me draw the
probability distribution.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.690
So here are all the outcomes.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.580
I'll draw that on the
horizontal axis.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:30.330
So you get one outcome
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.850
And then, in the y-axis or in
the vertical, you plot what is

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.230
the probability of each of
those outcomes occurring?

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.295
What's the probability?

00:07:40.295 --> 00:07:42.510
I'll switch colors.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.980
So what's the probability
of getting a 1?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.960
Well, it's 1/6.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.976
So if I draw 1/6 here.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.330
So the probability is of each
of these occurring-- oh, I

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.970
didn't want to do it
like that-- are 1/6.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.425
It's essentially like a
histogram or a bar chart.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.930
My intention is to draw them
all the exact same height.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.840
So this is telling us that
each of these there's a 1/6

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.850
chance of it occurring.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.040
If I were to draw a probability
distribution for-- if I were to

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:27.080
find the random variable
x is equal to 1 if

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.840
heads, 0 if tails.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.150
This has a very simple
probability distribution.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.140
There's only 2 outcomes.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.730
You're either going
to get a 1 or a 0.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:49.360
And then in the y-axis you'll
have the probabilities.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.550
And each of these, if it's
a fair dice, it's going

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.040
to be a 1/2 probability.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.410
And you're going to draw a
little box like that that tells

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.160
you each of them are 1/2.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.880
Now let's say that you had
another-- I don't know--

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.320
probably distribution function
that looks something like this.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.390
Those are kind of very run of
the mill examples, but what if

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.400
I had something like this?

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:10.920
Let's see.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.120
Where I had some dice-- let's
say we had some weird

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:23.910
weightings on it where it had
an outcome of 1-- I had a

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.680
1/6 chance like that.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.805
Let's say for some reason
a 2 could never happen.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.240
Maybe there is no 2.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:42.532
Let's say 3 has a 1/6 chance,
a 4 has a 1/6 chance,

00:09:42.532 --> 00:09:44.810
a 5 has a 1/6 chance.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.710
And let's say there's two 6's.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.970
Like we erased the 2 and we
put a 6 where the 2 is,

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:50.690
so there's two 6's.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.710
So the 6 has a 2/6 chance.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.810
So the 6 would be a 2/6 chance.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.720
So now I think you can see
where the probability

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.490
distribution function
starts to become a little

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.620
bit more interesting.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.040
In the other ones it was kind
of what we would call a

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.410
uniform distribution.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.290
All of the outcomes
are equally likely.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.550
That's a uniform distribution.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.010
Once again, this is a
uniform distribution.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.410
This one, all of a sudden, is
not a uniform distribution.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.560
1 is just as likely as 3, 4, 5.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.740
2 is impossible to happen, but
6 is twice as likely to happen

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.800
as everything else-- is 2/6.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.610
If someone gives you a
probability density function or

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.460
if they give you a little chart
like this, you can immediately

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.710
say, what's the probability of
different events occurring?

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:44.570
So if you said that x is equal
to the number on unfair dice

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.730
that's described by
this probability

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.190
distribution function.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.450
Then if I were to ask you the
probability that x is equal to

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.370
6, you'd say, oh, the
probability x equals 6

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.570
is equal to 2/6 or 1/3.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:04.660
If I were to say what's the
probability that x, the random

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:10.390
variable x as given by this
definition, is greater than 5,

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.350
you would take-- well, let's
say greater than or equal to 5.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.270
Because you want to include
5, and at least, I did.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.290
So it would include this
situation and this situation.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.070
So it'd be 1/6 plus 2/6.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.060
And so you could say
that's 3/6 or 1/2.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.450
So it gets pretty interesting
once you don't have a

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.130
completely uniform
distribution.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.220
And I'm doing all of this
because in the next couple of

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.290
videos-- well, one, we'll move
away from discreet and actually

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.990
study continuous probability
distributions, which are called

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.680
probability density functions.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.260
And then we'll go to study kind
of a lot of distributions

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.560
that show up in nature.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.490
The uniform distribution
is one of them.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.520
There's also the binomial
distribution and the normal

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.590
distribution, which is
what some people call the

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.070
Gaussian or the bell curve.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.590
Which is kind of a
very common thing.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.500
But anyway, I'm all out
of time and I'll see

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.410
you in the next video.
