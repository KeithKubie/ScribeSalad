00:00:00.775 --> 00:00:04.800
Now the Hello World project here that you've got, it's

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.440
a very simple, application that uses end points. What I want

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.860
to do now is just talk you quickly through the code

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.660
so that you understand how to define endpoints, so you see

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.970
how to call them from a web page. So let's

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.900
take a look at the files in the Hello World end

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.043
points application. So here, you see here in src &gt; main

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:25.928
&gt; java. In the com &gt; google &gt; training &gt; helloworld

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:28.120
package, you see the Java files.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.081
There are three Java files, Constants.java, HelloClass.java

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:36.770
and HelloWorldEndpoints.java. So Constants.java defines some constants,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.700
as you might expect. HelloClass.java is a

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.670
very simple class we'll look at

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.710
in a minute. And then HelloWorldEndpoints.java defines

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.200
the endpoints used in the application. So

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.650
the source dir, contains the main folder,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.280
which contains the java and the webapp folders.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.930
We just looked at java, but now we're

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.060
going to look at webapp. So the webapp

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.720
folder contains the static files, the index.html, other

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.140
HTML files if you have them, JavaScript files,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.020
any static content. It also contains the WEB-I-N-F,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.320
or WEB-INF folder. And this folder's common to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.660
all web applications, and it's where you configure

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.250
your application. So for app engine apps, you have

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
to have the appengine-web.xml file, which we already looked at,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.860
which is where you configure the things that are specific

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.700
to your app engine app in, particular, you have to

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.100
specify the app ID if you want to deploy it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.190
to Appspot. Another file in here is web.xml. And let's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.240
take a quick look at that. So web.xml is where

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.999
you'd configure servers if you have them. In your web.xml

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.626
you should see that you have

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:46.030
the SystemsServiceServlet. And

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.000
it's mapped to com.google.api.server.spi.SystemServiceServlet.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.840
And this spi, means end points. So this servlet is crucial to your application,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.480
if you want to use end points.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.080
Basically you must have com.google.api.server.spi.SystemServiceServlet in your

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.050
app if you want to use endpoints. Also see we define the welcome file

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.639
here which is index.html, which is pretty much

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.480
the default. Another configuration I want to draw your

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.160
attention to, is this one here for the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.370
security constraint, where we specified that all web pages

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.680
must use HTTPS and this is how we

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.740
specify it, by setting the transport guarantee confidential. So

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.270
whenever you see this in your web.xml, it just

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.650
means that when the app's running on app spot,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.310
if the user goes to it without using

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.256
HTTPS, they'll be redirected to HTTPS. Okay, so back

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:42.627
in the webapp dir, you see there's also

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:46.770
hello.js. And there's index.html. And these are the two

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.410
files that this app uses in the web

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.800
UI, or in the web front-end. Hello.js contains the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.810
JavaScript functions used by the app, and index.html

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.580
is the home page for the app, and it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.730
shows the two buttons, and the input field. And

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.100
here you see the two buttons, and the input failed.
