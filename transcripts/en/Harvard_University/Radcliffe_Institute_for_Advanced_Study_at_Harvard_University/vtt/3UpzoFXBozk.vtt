00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.360
- So today, I want to talk
about the intersection of age

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.690
and power in US women's rights
arguments from 1870 to 1920.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.120
I'm going to draw on
archival sources that

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.420
are in the Schlesinger Library
here at Radcliffe's, especially

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.010
those that look at the
antislavery and women's rights

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150
activists Susan B. Anthony
and Harriet Tubman.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.280
And then after my talk,
we're going to go over,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.530
and we're going to see some
of this stuff in person.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.600
So that's really
the highlight here.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600
OK, first I need
to explain what I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.640
mean by the intersection of age
and power in American history.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.120
There are many ways to look
at issues related to aging.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.860
So here at the
Radcliffe Institute

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.960
this year, we have
scientists that

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.110
are looking at the
degeneration of human cells

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.160
or how childhood trauma
impacts health in later life.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
We have poets and
filmmakers and sociologists

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.610
that are exploring the ways in
which memories get passed down

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.200
within generations and families.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.160
And we have people looking
at how individual longevity

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.920
depends upon the sustainability
of our environment.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.190
We also have-- and
I'm so lucky to say--

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.820
Robin Bernstein, Tunisia
Ford, and Evie Shockley

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.280
whose work on youth
and childhood and race

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.770
has so deeply influenced my own.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.570
And I'm just thrilled
to be in conversation

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.200
with all these people.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.080
That's not what I'm going
to talk to you about.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.820
I'm going to talk about
old age and middle age

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.610
as political categories
in US history.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.510
So Margaret Gullette,
who's also here today,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.840
has shown that whatever
happens in our bodies,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.860
we are in her words
aged by culture.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.260
And she's asked us to
think in particular

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.950
about middle and old
age as key periods

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.170
where this happens
in ways that are

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.730
culturally defined but highly
variable and contingent.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.840
Now this headline proclaims
Harriet Tubman the oldest

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.990
ex-slave.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.920
She's not at all.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.330
But the fact that people thought
she was and held a reception

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.735
for her as such is politically
and culturally significant,

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.360
and these are the things that I
want to draw your attention to.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.440
So this souvenir from Anthony's
80th birthday celebration

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.790
juxtaposes two dated
portraits of her--

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.490
one a family
daguerreotype taken when

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.930
she was a 36-year-old
relatively marginalized reformer

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.040
and the second an official
portrait for her 80th birthday

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.070
when she had become the leader
of the national movement

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.120
and arguably one of the most
famous women in the world.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.060
The souvenir draws attention to
both precise birthdays 36, 80,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.900
and the long stage of life
in between, the middle years.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.110
And these are two ways,
age and stage, in which

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.020
we are aged by culture.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.100
Now can any of you tell me why
suffragists might have begun

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.960
with a portrait at age 36--

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.990
just after her 35th birthday?

00:03:12.178 --> 00:03:14.010
President-- yes.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.560
OK, so according to
the Constitution,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.330
you have to be at least 35
years old to run for president.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.800
In practice, Americans have
chosen men much older than men.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.490
In 1900, a man under 45
had never held the office.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.860
Now if I were you, I
would start googling this,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.070
so I just did it for you.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.740
The youngest man to
ever hold the office

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.450
was Roosevelt. He
was not elected.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.150
He was elevated after
McKinley's assassination.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.970
Kennedy is, in fact,
the youngest at 43.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.310
Trump is our oldest ever at 70.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.129
Reagan was 69.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.670
Clinton, if she'd
been elected, would

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.820
have been 69 and Sanders 75.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.720
The point I want to make here
is that our young presidents--

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.550
they're not really that young.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.840
In what other context do we
talk about young people of 45.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.350
And our old presidents
aren't really that old.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.630
It's really an office
for middle-aged men,

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.510
and this was a problem for women
because, in the 19th century,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.460
single women reported that
they became old maids at 30,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.370
and married women often
wrote about feeling

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.440
pushed to the background of
their family circles by age 45.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.100
So how is a woman to become
president or senator or even

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.190
city councilor?

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.420
In drawing attention to
Anthony's life after age 35,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.220
suffragists challenged
Americans to imagine her

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.520
not just as the President of
the National American Women's

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.280
Suffrage Association,
but I think

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.050
as a credible candidate for
the presidency of the United

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.240
States.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.180
So the historian
Alison Lange points out

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.110
that this profile pose was
new for women in the 1880s,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.420
and that suffragists
turned to that

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.710
to model their leaders
after Roman states.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.240
So this souvenir is drawing
on that visual convention

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.890
to imagine a very particular
passage through middle age.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.210
So Anthony leaves the ornate
but rather confined frame

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.230
of a family portrait and grows
not just in age but in stature.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.900
She looks back at
her former self

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.450
but not with a longing
for lost youth--

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.330
with pride in her
accomplishments over time.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.940
As these two birthday
programs suggest,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.350
suffragists modeled
Anthony's celebration

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.620
on those for George Washington.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.040
They used the birthday to
insert a founding mother

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.140
into a national narrative
built around founding fathers

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.040
and to suggest
that even at a time

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.002
when most women could
not vote for president,

00:06:03.002 --> 00:06:04.960
there was at least one
woman in the nation that

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.920
was qualified to be president.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.430
By 1900, Anthony had become
not just an old woman

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.110
but a grand old woman, and
she was not the only one.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.960
The archives of women's
suffrage are filled with efforts

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.930
to elevate mature women
as national leaders.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.060
Suffragists built
organizations that

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.670
put middle aged women
in executive power

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.070
and gave them a public voice.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.910
They theorize the significance
of the age in their writings

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.280
and speeches, and
they circulated

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.400
images of older women
and described these women

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.910
as beautiful and charismatic.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.890
Now suffrage is just one
angle on age and power

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.530
in American history, and what
I'm hoping with this work

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.410
is that it encourages you
to think about others.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.230
And I'm very curious in the
questions where you were

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.600
thinking of age popping up.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.040
But what I'm going
to do today is

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.820
I'm going to focus very
narrowly on public celebrations

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.410
for Susan B. Anthony and Harriet
Tubman using both as case

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.070
studies that I think show
why suffragists focused

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.770
on these connections
between age and power

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.440
and also how they
disagreed with each other

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.810
about what women's
leadership should be

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.260
and what ends it should be used.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:32.670
So I want to start right after
the Civil War when supporters

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:38.860
of Anthony and Tubman worked
to sustain them in middle life

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.930
and compared both of
them to Army generals.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.680
So Tubman was already famous
as the Moses of her race

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.520
for leading enslaved people to
freedom during the Civil War.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.340
She worked as a spy
and helped pilot ships

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.070
on the Combahee River
where Union troops

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.890
destroyed Confederate
supplies and liberated

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.860
more than 800 enslaved people.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.180
Many Union soldiers referred
to her as General Tubman.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.670
Yet because she had
not formally enlisted,

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.910
the US government did
not pay her a salary,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.450
nor did she receive a
pension for her disability.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.960
The government did pay pensions
to both white and black Union

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.470
soldiers who had been
injured in the line of duty,

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.390
but Tubman's
injuries had occurred

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.380
before the war when she
was an enslaved child

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.740
and right after when she
was coming home on a train

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.210
and a white conductor violently
threw her from the railroad.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.610
These were not arenas
that the US government

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.039
recognized as battlefields.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.870
Tubman's allies,
black and white,

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.210
were outraged that
she return to her home

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.210
in Auburn, New York with
no official recognition.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.480
They took up a subscription
to fund a biography

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.380
and organized a public fair at
which the book and other items

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.330
could be sold for her benefit.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.010
Now these were
tried and true ways

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.190
for supporting formerly
enslaved people.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.890
But what I think is
new here is the way

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.210
that supporters are
comparing Tubman

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.290
to a male military
commander, a general.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.370
So for instance, one supporter
wrote to the local paper

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.490
captains, colonels,
brigadier generals

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.720
have been created during our
late war who never accomplished

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.750
the shadow of the service
to the country which

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.080
this noble woman has performed.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.530
Now many male veterans
were entering politics.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.020
Comparing Tubman to
these men suggested

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.350
that she, though
female, illiterate,

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.780
and a manual
laborer, was not only

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:47.480
a citizen and a veteran but
a potential political leader.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.930
Middle age and indeed
chronological age

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.820
had a particular resonance
for Tubman and her family

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.670
because as she explained to
Bradford, her biographer,

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.870
her mother had a legal
claim to be freed at age 45

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.790
along with her children--

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.240
a directive in her master's
will that his heirs be

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.430
concealed from Tubman's family.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.970
Tubman liberated herself
and then her mother.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.660
Now this kind of age
fraud was quite common.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.280
Under both private wills and
gradual emancipation laws,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.730
many black families had to
sue for the freedom that

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.370
should have been theirs on the
basis of chronological age.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.160
Other fugitive slaves protested
that enslavers freed old people

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.440
when they could no
longer work and that this

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.040
wasn't benevolence but a
form of abuse or neglect.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.850
And as was true of
many enslaved people,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.280
both Tubman and her mother
had been denied access

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.310
to any documentation
of their birth dates.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.370
So Tubman's biographer
reported that quote

00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:00.530
"she was born as near as she
can remember in 1820 or 1821."

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.620
Harriet Tubman
grows famously old,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.840
but she never knows her age.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.710
And she never has a birthday
that she can celebrate.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.080
In contrast, white
women suffragists

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.920
emphasized their birthdays.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.680
So that the first
public birthday

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.870
for a middle-aged woman
in the United States

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.970
was Susan B Anthony's is 50
in 1870, or so she claimed.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.360
And I haven't proven otherwise.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.290
So I want to make a
crowdsourcing plea for anybody

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.380
who comes across mention of
a public birthday for a woman

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.000
in 19th-century
America, please let

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.749
me know because I'm
trying to put together

00:11:33.749 --> 00:11:35.150
this comprehensive list.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.970
I'm a little obsessed.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.200
So for Anthony's birthday,
the New York World

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.530
claimed in the hyperbolic
style of the day

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.350
Miss Anthony is again
the Moses of her sex.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.260
She has perpetrated a
daring innovations in regard

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.810
to that subject, which has
been with woman the most

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.970
sacred and inviolate.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.790
No more talk of women of a
certain or uncertain age.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.380
Susan squarely owns up to 50.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.170
Papers as far away
as San Francisco

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.750
and the Hawaiian Islands
noted that Anthony

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.560
was particularly transgressive
to announce her age because she

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.420
was unmarried.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.490
For years, journalists
and critics

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.800
had been dismissing
women's rights activists

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.920
as sour old maids who
couldn't get husbands.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.980
But in this moment, Anthony
her and her supporters

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.010
reclaimed and redefine the term.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.540
She was-- the New York Sun
declared-- a brave old maid.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.560
Matilda Joslyn Gage
explained the significance

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.950
of Anthony's 50th
birthday this way.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:45.840
Here to for tell one's age has
been looked upon as the death

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.580
knell for a woman.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.900
Her value has been only in
her youth and good looks.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.950
Her intellect and soul
have been passed aside,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.750
and no terms of reproach have
equaled that of old woman,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.070
old maid.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.430
And I just want to pause on
this and emphasize how often I'm

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.630
seeing in the archives that this
generation of women suffragists

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.610
argued that white men maintained
power in part by sexualizing

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.360
young girls and then ignoring
or denigrating older women.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.510
And I just think it's worth
pausing on this idea right

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.355
now in this context.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.310
OK, this was also
all about money.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.280
So the idea for the
party seems to have

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.710
originated as a fundraiser.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.610
Many guests brought $1 for
each year of Anthony's life

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.520
and other gifts, such
as this gold brooch.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.740
Anthony desperately
needed the money.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.820
The paper she published, The
Revolution, was deeply in debt.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.550
In the late 1860s,
she had alienated

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.270
her former anti-slavery
and Republican Party allies

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.930
when she decided to oppose
black men's suffrage until women

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.810
could be enfranchised as well.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:06.820
Rather than reforging
ties with black leaders,

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.190
Anthony decided that
she should appeal

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:16.220
to prominent white people who
had money and had connections.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.340
The birthday
perfectly suited these

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.210
aims as it functioned
to mute criticism, raise

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.360
money, and generate
positive publicity.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.080
So to be clear, the event did
not cause the racial and class

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.510
divisions in the women's
suffrage movement.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.540
What it did was
justify, even celebrate

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.700
Anthony's
controversial decisions

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.450
as a form of brave leadership.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.840
Said the poet Phoebe Cary
wrote an ode for the occasion.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.450
We touch our caps
and place tonight

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.760
the victor's wreath upon her--

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:56.150
the woman who outranks us
all in courage and in honor.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.380
This is really more
aspirational than true in 1870

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.050
there are arguably
other women who outrank

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.000
Anthony at this moment--

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.810
not least, as I'll talk
about, Harriet Tubman.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.060
So notice how Anthony,
her supporters,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.990
and the hyperbolic journalists
all took up titles widely used

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.790
to describe Tubman,
Moses, general,

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:22.940
while failing to
mention Tubman herself.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.860
Anthony certainly
knew of Tubman,

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.570
as they had many
friends in common,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.420
and people who congratulated
Anthony on her birthday

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.640
also helped organize
Tubman's fair.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.770
These connections
are very direct.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.700
Further, Frances Harper, another
leading black suffragist,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.870
had directly told Anthony
and her colleagues

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.440
to focus on the needs of
Moses and other black women.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.010
Instead, the birthday
promoted Anthony's lone status

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.830
as a woman general.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.870
So what we have here by 1870
and Tubman's fair and Anthony's

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.450
birthday are two efforts
to elevate and sustain

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.150
the public careers
of mature women.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.030
They presented different
and indeed incompatible

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.850
models of women's leadership.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.380
Tubman's redistributive
politics did not

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.830
appeal to most of the prominent
liberals gathered for Anthony's

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.160
birthday, and Anthony's
focus on women's suffrage

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.000
without mention of race
or class seemed misguided

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.870
to those organizing
Tubman's fair.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.790
Both women would become even
more prominent as they aged,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.360
and that's the story
I want to turn to now.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.970
So in the late 19th
century, public birthdays

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.940
grew in popularity,
but they became rituals

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.140
to honor the achievements of
old people in their 70s and 80s.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.660
After the Civil
War, all Americans,

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.300
not just women's suffrage,
just paid more attention

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.830
to chronological age in general
and old age as a stage of life,

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.180
in particular.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.000
So by the 1890s, the
US Pension Bureau

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.650
began using chronological age
as a proxy for disability.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.600
Private companies
experimented with

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.170
the first age-based
retirement programs,

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.450
and doctors specialized
in what would come

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.359
to be known as gerontology.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.619
Age also mattered
for young people

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:16.310
as schools instituted
age graded classrooms,

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:21.050
and states passed the first
age-based child labor laws.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.470
Historians explain these changes
as part of a broader effort

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.079
to bring scientific
tools of management

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.750
to bear on an
industrializing democracy

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.080
and a diverse citizenry.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.880
Printers, caterers,
and merchants

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.040
also commercialized birthdays.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.070
Prosperous Americans
celebrated children's birthdays

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.320
before the Civil
War inspired largely

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.510
by Queen Victoria it appears.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.480
By the 1850s, publishers
and political parties

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.350
held some birthday
celebrations for prominent men.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.980
Then in the 1880s, printers
marketed the first commercially

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.510
produced birthday cards.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.910
Most women still didn't want
to announce their exact age

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.540
but congratulating each other
on the day of their birth date

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:10.220
became more common among
friends and family.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.680
Members of the National
Women's Suffrage Association

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.040
continued to innovate
ways of publicly honoring

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.560
older women leaders
on their birthdays.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.300
In 1885, they not only hosted a
lavish party for Elizabeth Cady

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.320
Stanton in New York City
but also sent out directions

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.920
for how local suffrage clubs
could hold parallel events

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.560
all over the country,
and they then

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.400
documented this in
the souvenir program.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.090
This was the occasion at which
Stanton read her often quoted

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.240
essay on the pleasures
of age in which she

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:50.820
declared that 50, not 15, is
the heyday of a woman's life.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.040
Other suffragists
meanwhile resisted

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.870
the idea of public birthdays.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.050
So Lucy Stone, for example,
was shocked in 1888

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.920
when people sent her gifts and
telegrams congratulating her

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.960
on 70 years, as she had
quote no idea the day

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.990
was known except by relatives
and a few near friends.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:14.900
This convention program for 1893
presents middle aged and older

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.740
white women as the public face
of the National American Woman

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.150
Suffrage Association.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.670
Lucretia Mott on the
left died in 1880.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.010
She appears here
as the four mother

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.130
of Stanton, Stone, and Anthony.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.670
The speakers listed below
include younger white women

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.280
born between the
1840s and 1860s.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.270
They have a voice, but
they aren't elevated yet

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.640
into this pantheon
of great leaders.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.370
The implication is they're
going to have to wait for that.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.490
Black women do not
appear at all here,

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.920
despite the fact that
the women pictured were

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.070
all part of the antebellum
anti-slavery movement

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.210
and all collaborated throughout
their lives with black leaders.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.930
So what I want to emphasize
is that this segregation

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.410
of women's suffrage
leadership by race and age

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:11.480
was not natural or inevitable
or even really accurate,

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.060
but it was artificial,
constructed,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.550
and a misrepresentation
to be sure.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.310
One that was done for
political purposes to

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.890
empower older white women.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.920
So a more accurate
image would include

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.370
younger women and white
women as prominent leaders.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.050
It would emphasize Mott's
connection to black women,

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.290
including Harriet Tubman.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.680
In the 1880s and 1890s,
Tubman campaign for women's

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.720
suffrage and
fundraise to establish

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.940
a home for elderly
African-Americans

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.160
on her property in
Auburn, New York.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.590
She moved among
suffragists, black women's

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.800
reform organizations, and the
African Methodist Episcopal

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.400
Zion Church, always
linking the vote

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.020
to economic justice
for African-Americans.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.520
Interestingly, evidence suggests
that some white suffragists

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.930
sought to find some
kind of day that

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.450
could function for Tubman
the way a birthday did

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.870
for white women.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.970
So in 1894, Edna Dowd
Cheney sent funds to Tubman

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.570
describing the contributions
as quote "a gift to herself,"

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.910
a birthday gift to herself.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.030
In 1901, the woman's
journal printed an appeal

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.430
asking for contributions
by December,

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.440
so these could be
bundled and presented

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.700
to Tubman as a Christmas gift.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.310
So you can see them
trying to present

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.060
these dates as get give now.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.710
But the largest boost
to Tubman's reputation

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.570
came from black
women who invited

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.480
her to attend the founding
meeting of the National

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.500
Association of Colored
Women's Clubs in 1896.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.570
The black feminist
theorist Brittany Cooper

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.420
points out that
this organization

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.020
sought to counter the
quote "civic unknowability"

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.530
of black women.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.370
What I want to add here
is that celebrating Tubman

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.312
enabled them to emphasize black
women as national leaders.

00:21:59.312 --> 00:22:03.170
So in women's air under a
reprint of Tubman's civil war

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.730
portrait, Victoria Earl
Matthews wrote the fact

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:12.140
that we know so little that
is credible and truly noble

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.650
about our own people
constitutes one of the saddest

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:21.590
and most humiliating phases
of Afro-American life.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.680
Matthews rallied black women
to come to the convention

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.110
and meet them in person.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:31.100
In a grand spectacle of
intergenerational solidarity,

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.210
Tubman took the stage at the
convention, holding an infant--

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.820
the son of anti-lynching
activist Ida B, Wells-Barnett,

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.000
as she stood there the hall
overflowed with emotion--

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.320
as Matthews reported, the scene
was impressive and thrilling.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.150
It was the clasping of hands
of the early 19th and 20th

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.390
centuries.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:01.170
Anthony's 80th birthday in 1900
functioned in a similar way.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.050
The highlight of
the evening came

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.810
when 80 children marched
across the stage,

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.730
each handing her a rose.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.520
Now as far as I can tell from
press reports on this memorial

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.160
portrait, all of the
children were white,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.260
but Anthony did invite
African-American suffragists

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.836
to speak at her
public birthdays.

00:23:18.836 --> 00:23:20.210
And this I just
want to underline

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.150
was really striking at a
moment in American history

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.820
when almost all
public celebrations,

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.340
even Lincoln's
birthday celebrations,

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.080
were racially segregated.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.440
So she is bringing black
women into the movement.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:45.220
At Anthony's 80th, for example,
Coralee Franklin Cook spoke,

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.940
and she praised Anthony as
quote "the courageous defender

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.520
of rights wherever assailed."

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.430
Anthony, in turn, made a great
show of affection towards Cook,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.290
but this did not translate
into coalition building.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.140
A year earlier, Anthony
blocked a resolution

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.850
that would have
condemned Jim Crow

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.970
segregation on the railroads.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.860
So Anthony's
birthday celebrations

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.680
function to include black
women in the suffrage movement

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.110
while simultaneously
pushing their leadership

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.440
and their political
priorities to the margins.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.740
Anthony's 80th birthday
staged a grand spectacle

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.960
of generational succession in
which she represented the past.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.960
Middle-aged women took
power in the present,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.460
and white children
represented the future.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.840
This I think is a very early
presentation of an idea

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.910
that we've come to know
as a feminist waves.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.150
So in the 1960s,
feminist coined the term

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.660
"second wave" to both connect
themselves with and distance

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.900
themselves from this
historical period.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.210
Then in the 1980s,
we got younger women

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.960
saying they were a third way.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.680
We're now on to a fourth,
fifth, maybe sixth way,

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.570
depending who you talk to.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.190
Historians and
activists generally

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.720
agree that it's time to
let go of this metaphor,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.680
that it's divisive,
that it's inaccurate,

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.440
but we remain very
trapped inside it.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.000
And I think it's
in this moment--

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.030
surprisingly in
celebrations for older women

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.670
not the rebellion of youth
but in the celebrations

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.290
for old women that we see
this idea taking form.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.990
OK, so after Anthony's
event in 1900,

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.680
many prominent women
had 80th birthday galas,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.660
and not all were suffragists.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.890
So in 1982, when Elizabeth Cary
Agassi, the first president

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.200
of Radcliffe, heard
that supporters

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.570
wanted to hold a concert
for her 80th birthday.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:43.700
She wrote in her diary
quote, "it is a lovely plan,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.040
but I have sworn that
I would never have

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.070
one of these public birthdays.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.050
I must yield not without dread."

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.640
Her dread turned to delight when
on the morning of her birthday,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.880
she received a surprising gift.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.820
Does anybody know what
Agassi's birthday gift was?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.520
Agassi house-- Elizabeth Cary
Agassi on her 80th birthday

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.920
received $116,000 to
build Agassi house.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.965
That is the equivalent of almost
actually more than $3 million

00:26:19.965 --> 00:26:20.465
today--

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.620
quite a birthday present.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.050
Her son later wrote
that Agassi would

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.200
quote "like a second
festival provided it could

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.056
be as lucrative as the first."

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.350
So you can see that these
public birthdays are functioning

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.650
very effectively to
channel resources

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.370
towards women's institutions
and women's causes

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.160
to publicize the
achievements of older women

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.230
and to inspire young women.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.570
And this is all an achievement
and so really effective

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.090
in a lot of ways.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.290
The amount of money
raised, of course, vary.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.350
The same year that Agassi
received $160,000 birthday

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.750
gift, Tubman's
supporters struggled

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:11.620
mightily to raise
1,700 as a Christmas

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.440
gift that would pay off the
mortgage on her old people's

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.700
home.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.890
So in many ways,
these celebrations

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.080
didn't alleviate
that exacerbated

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.050
existing inequalities.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.330
OK, what about political power?

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.270
Did women suffragists succeed
in convincing Americans

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.030
outside their movement to
take older women seriously

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.860
as national leaders,
to view them

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:37.350
as potential congressmen
and senators and presidents?

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.550
Boiler alert-- not so much.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.640
So as Christian
Hopkinson points out

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.240
in our study of the
Spanish-American war,

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:52.350
expansionists label the
anti-imperialist aunties

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.430
to render their leadership
illegitimate and absurd.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.610
So cartoonists targeted
old white women

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.910
in particular as a
threat to male potency.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.110
Here prominent anti-imperialists
are dressed as busy old women

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.060
pulling down a
statue representing

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.170
the administration,
the army, and the Navy.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.380
Older African-American women
had to contend with a different

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.520
stereotype--

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.040
aunt as loyal servant
more dedicated

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.680
to her enslavers
family than her own.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.710
This bogus idea took
off in the 1890s

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.110
when the RT Davis
Mill Company began

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.100
to market Aunt Jemima pancake
mix, one of the first branded

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.010
and widely advertised
foodstuffs.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.410
The publicity
campaign dubbed this

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.100
invented character quote "the
most famous colored woman

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.060
in the world?

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.450
And made up a
biography for her--

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.680
the fake life of an
older black woman.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:52.350
An illustration claim to be a
truthful representation of Aunt

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.920
Jemima feeding Confederates
after the gunboats destroyed

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.740
the master's plantation.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:04.370
Now whether consciously or not,
this precisely and insidiously

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:07.010
erases Tubman's
actual leadership

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:10.430
navigating gunboats
during the Civil War,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.830
and I think we have
to read these images

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.440
as a direct backlash
against efforts

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.070
to empower older women
during this period.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.910
Now if this was all that
suffragists had to fight--

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.660
these misogynistic and racist
images in popular culture--

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.680
that would have been difficult
enough, but by the 1910s,

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.950
they also had to contend with
women's suffrage leaders who

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:35.990
began to market youth.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.340
I know, right.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.550
It's subtle.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:52.080
So white suffragists focused on
appealing to white male voters,

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.830
and this is how they did it.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:59.250
They prettier, conventionally
attractive women out front

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.710
as the face of the movement.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.140
This is actually my favorite.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.380
Beauty brigade in canvas
for votes for women.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.320
So these beauty brigades are
part of this massive propaganda

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.440
campaign that mobilized
the techniques

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:21.090
of modern advertising, public
spectacle and celebrity--

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.160
all of which turned
on circulating

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.760
images of conventionally
attractive white, often quite

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.230
wealthy women.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.500
None of these women are over 35.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.620
Old women remain
active in the movement.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.230
They join these massive
suffrage parades,

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.270
but they were put
behind the beauties,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.500
set apart in motor cars,
and treated as curiosities.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.530
Their birthdays continued
to receive attention,

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:50.800
but young women had become
the face of the movement.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.470
Black women adopted
this strategy too.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.830
The journalist Pauline Hopkins,
editor of The Colored American

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.980
magazine here in
Boston, wrote often

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.810
about the leadership
of mature black women,

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.220
including this really
important profile of Tubman.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.520
But the visual culture of
the magazine as a whole

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.810
centered on picturing young
black women as glamorous, as

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.270
modern, as beautiful.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.390
And I want to underline that
this is really important too.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.110
A lot of Americans felt that
black women weren't beautiful

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:26.980
and claiming them as beautiful
is political, is powerful.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.470
Even for white suffragists
who face the charge

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.860
that political activism
would make them unattractive,

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.050
this was important to say
that suffragists could

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.210
be beautiful and glamorous.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.000
But what drops out of
this effort entirely

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.960
is the connections
between maturity and power

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.890
that women were drawing
in the late 19th century.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.360
So beauty sells.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.720
And suffragists
took up advertising,

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.720
and then advertisers
appealed to suffragists.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.080
And this marketing accomplished
what Anthony and her supporters

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.840
had been unable to
achieve, the ratification

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.900
of the 19th Amendment in 1920.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.270
Now we should not describe
this as the winning

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.290
of women's suffrage.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.420
It just removed
sex as a barrier.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.810
State governments used
literacy tests, poll taxes,

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:18.190
and identity verification to
disenfranchisement many people.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.230
And in fact, the
voter ID laws that

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.800
are being passed in state after
state today are a continuation

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.820
of this strategy.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.280
So voting is not a secure right.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.250
It's a privilege that
states can regulate,

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.490
and voting is also very
different than running

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.400
for office or getting elected.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.090
So after 1920, American
women did not effectively

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.930
organize to elect women to
national office and progress

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.650
in this phase has
remained remarkably slow,

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.860
which brings us back to the
construction of Susan B,

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.250
Anthony as a great statement,
equivalent to the most

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.900
beloved president.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.860
So after 1920, members of
the National woman's party

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:05.830
gather every year on February 15
in the crypt of the US capitol

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.250
where there was this
statue of Elizabeth Cady

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.380
Stanton, Lucretia Mott,
and Susan B. Anthony.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:15.160
It's the closest suffragists
have to a national monument.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:15.700
They gather.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.690
They lay flowers.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:17.980
They give speeches.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.490
Black women continue
to attend these events.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.044
So that's Mary Church
Terrill, the first president

00:33:23.044 --> 00:33:25.210
of the National Association
of Colored Women's Clubs

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.860
in the lovely fur collar.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.770
She talked about how Anthony
was an abolitionist as well

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:34.100
as a suffragist just trying to
keep alive these connections.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.090
Rose Arnold Powell whose
papers are at the Schlesinger

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.450
campaigned relentlessly
to turn Anthony's birthday

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.760
into a national holiday.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.190
That Anthony had
been born in February

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:49.150
was a happy accident she used
to promote the idea of three

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.820
great emancipators.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.320
So Washington freed his country.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.140
Lincoln freed the slaves,
and Anthony freed women,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.740
or so the story went.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.520
Powell wrote every calendar
company in the US year after

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.210
year urging them to list
Anthony's birthday February,

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.760
along with Washington's
and Lincoln's.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.130
A few states, including
Massachusetts,

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.737
did turn Anthony's
birthday into holidays.

00:34:14.737 --> 00:34:16.570
As far as I know, this
is no longer a thing,

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.909
but it was briefly.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:22.090
Massachusetts had a holiday,
but we still in this country

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:28.540
have no national holiday that
honors a woman as a leader.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.190
And what about Tubman?

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.520
African-American women named
a number of social service

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.460
organizations in her honor,
including the Harriet Tubman

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.699
House here in Boston founded
when Thompson was still alive,

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:43.150
and she was actually
present at the dedication.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.159
This clipping from
the Delta Sigma Theta

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.380
papers at Schlesinger
shows schoolchildren

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:52.420
celebrating the 50th anniversary
of the Tubman home in 1959.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.500
So even though Tubman
didn't have a birthday,

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.730
these institutions named after
her could have anniversaries

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.450
and rallied people
around her memory.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.940
Under President Obama,
the Treasury Department

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.790
planned Tubman's face on
the redesigned $20 bill.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.320
Trump's Treasury
Secretary Steven Mnuchin

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.500
has announced that
this plan is on hold.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.950
In 1978, Tubman did become
the first black woman

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:20.560
to be put on a postage
stamp, and Pauline Murray,

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.740
the civil rights lawyer
an Episcopal priest,

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.730
read a beautiful
benediction at the day

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.970
of this year's ceremony.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.900
The point I want to
make here is that we

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.290
know about Anthony and
Tubman because women worked

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:37.430
to convince people that they
were national leaders as worthy

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.070
of recognition as white men.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.280
Now most Americans
never accepted the idea

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.680
that these women were on a par
with Washington or Lincoln,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.530
but that we remember
them at all is

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:52.370
an important legacy of black
and white women's organizing.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:54.260
That white women like
Powell downplayed

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:58.622
the contributions of black women
is also, of course, a legacy.

00:35:58.622 --> 00:36:00.330
But what I want to
leave you with today--

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.300
what I want to draw
your attention to--

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.540
is another facet of
this memorialization,

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:11.490
and that is how white women
remembered Anthony's age.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.900
By the 1930s, Anthony's
longevity was a curiosity.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.680
Ripley's Believe It or
Not for February 15, 1938,

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.460
read Susan B. Anthony
died at the age of 86.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.400
Her mother died
at the age of 86.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.390
Her grandmother died at 86.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:32.291
Never change the style of
her hair dress in 70 years.

00:36:32.291 --> 00:36:32.790
It's true.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.650
You could look at the photos.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.480
Soon a much younger
Anthony began

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.200
to appear in popular culture.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.160
So this Wonder Woman comic
is my favorite example

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.150
of a particularly
fresh-faced Anthony.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.580
In this comic,
she does grow old,

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:56.230
but her supporters all
remain remarkably young.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.980
In 1939, a year after
the Ripley's cartoon,

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.940
Ethel Adamson of the national
woman's party planted--

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.260
the word she used--

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.440
this picture in newspapers
for February stories

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.180
on Anthony's birthday.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.150
It shows Anthony at age 48.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:16.630
Adamson explained
to Powell quote

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.980
"we all love Susan at every
age, but a little youth

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.730
does seem more
attractive for a change."

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:25.760
Powell agreed.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.730
She thought schoolchildren
would relate more to this image,

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.370
and this is the
image that stuck.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:37.900
So here's Anthony on her
126th birthday looking younger

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.940
than she did when
she first celebrated

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:45.850
her birthday in 1870, and
she's still young in 1971

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.870
when the National
Organization for Women

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:51.100
joined the birthday
celebration ritual.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:56.770
And again, on the
coin minted in 1979.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.830
By the 1970s,
Anthony had undergone

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:05.650
one of the greatest anti-aging
treatments in American history.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:09.220
The result is that
we can remember her

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.940
without engaging in the
politics of age and power

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.840
that her generation
was so concerned with.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.930
So look again at this
image that I started with.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.850
Anthony at age 80--

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.310
she's posed against
a black cloth that

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.120
emphasizes her white hair
in harsh light showing

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.990
every wrinkle.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.400
This image was on a calendar
that suffrage just before

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.560
and hung in their homes.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.450
As they use the
calendar, they may

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.480
have planned their
own time in new ways,

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.450
looking forward to
growing older themselves,

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:45.610
certainly looking
forward to the day

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.150
when Americans would
recognize a woman like Anthony

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.640
as having demonstrated
the political skill

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.195
and experience to be elected
president of the United States.

00:38:56.195 --> 00:39:00.110
To get to that point to
elect a woman president,

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.890
we will need to innovate
a new politics of women's

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.110
midlife empowerment--

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:10.010
one that somehow resists
the tendency to divide women

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.250
by age, race, and
class and instead finds

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.620
ways to build
political coalitions

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.530
that work across divides
for shared purposes,

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.780
and this won't be easy.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.570
We can just hope
that young women

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.640
will do this work on their own.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.630
Middle aged and older women need
to work with them and for them

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.570
in particular movements,
and young women

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.870
will need to partner
with their elders.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.140
If we can understand that
age itself has a history,

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.040
a history deeply connected to
gender, race, class, and power,

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.130
we may be able to
generate better

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.690
strategies-- at least that is
my hope in talking to you today.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.540
Thank you so much for listening.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.490
