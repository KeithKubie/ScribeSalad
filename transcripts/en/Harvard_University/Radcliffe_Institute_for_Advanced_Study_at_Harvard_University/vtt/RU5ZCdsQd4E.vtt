00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.240
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.600
Glad to see you.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.300
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.980
I'm Dean at the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.700
And I'm very happy to welcome
you to today's conference--

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.430
Intersections, Understanding
Urbanism in the Global Age.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.600
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.630
Radcliffe is charged
with a dual mission

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.320
to both foster and then to
share transformative ideas

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.509
across academic disciplines.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.580
We do this by convening
and supporting scholars,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.420
scientists, and artists
from around the world who

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.630
work together at the
forefront of their fields.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.170
And we share this research with
a broad and interested public

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.830
through a full
calendar of events,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.620
including lectures, conferences,
performances, and exhibitions.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.050
All of Radcliffe's
events are made possible

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.620
by our supporters, many of
whom are here with us today.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.380
Your generosity
allows us to continue

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.010
making lectures, exhibitions,
conferences, and other events

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.960
free and open to the public.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.520
So thank you.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.670
Today's Intersections
Conference is the culmination

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.160
of two ambitious initiatives.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.820
First, here at Radcliffe
we choose a theme each year

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.360
to focus our programming
across the Institute.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.030
This past year we
have explored urbanism

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.850
through a wide range
of events, including

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.190
lectures and seminars, poetry
readings and walking tours.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.470
In addition to
serving as a capstone

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.630
to this year's
thematic programming,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.840
this conference wraps up
a four year initiative

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.420
on interdisciplinary
urbanism at Harvard

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.970
supported by a very generous
grant from the Mellon

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.170
Foundation.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.600
And this grant is
aimed at drawing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.630
humanities and urban
studies closer together.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.380
Radcliffe has collaborated with
the Graduate School of Design,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.310
the Mahindra Humanities Center,
and the Arts and Humanities

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.860
Division of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.090
to host the Harvard Mellon
Initiative from its inception.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.800
In addition to
public programming

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.500
like today's conference, the
Harvard Mellon Initiative

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.530
has produced new courses,
research projects,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.620
digital platforms,
and publications.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.750
A priority of the
Harvard Mellon Initiative

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.860
has been finding ways to bring
together the many faculty

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.990
and students across Harvard
who work on aspects of urbanism

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.790
but who are not in
communication with each other.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.890
To help achieve
this goal, Radcliffe

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.690
has convened
faculty and students

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.510
through lectures, workshops,
and thematic dinners

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.840
to generate exciting new
intellectual connections

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.180
and we hope potential
collaborations

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.420
in urban study in the
future at Harvard.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.640
Today's conference is
an opportunity for us

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.400
to consider together
the fundamental shifts

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.720
in the nature of urbanism on
a global scale that now affect

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.250
and concern us all.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.080
Today 54% of the
world's population

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.000
lives in urban environments.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.090
That is roughly
4.1 billion people.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.470
And UNICEF estimates that
70% of the world's population

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.140
will be urban by 2050.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.810
But understanding the
new global urbanism

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.280
requires more than statistics
on demographics, density,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.690
and diversity.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.440
At this conference we will probe
the way cities are experienced

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.570
by their inhabitants,
drawing out

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.470
the human in urban humanities,
to explore the challenges

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.050
and rewards that people
living in urban communities

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.670
face today.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.400
To get this lived
experience, we will

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.430
call on a wide range
of tools of analysis,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.580
ranging from new
media to big data.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.310
Our presenters will share
multiple and creative

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.100
approaches to discerning
the complex set

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.880
of interrelationships,
personal and group identities,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.390
change agents, and natural
and built environments that

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.800
shaped cityscapes and urban
life today and into the future.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.650
As we dig deep into
the nature of urbanism

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.010
in the 21st century, it
will be important not

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.790
to overgeneralize and
assume that all cities are

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.350
created equal.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.430
In the wake of the 2016
US presidential election,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.279
we heard a lot about
the urban-rural divide

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.959
in the United States.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.280
But the fate of American
cities is equally as diverse.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.800
A few superstar
cities increasingly

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.370
dominate global networks of
finance and communication

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.340
while other cities
are left behind.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.710
And even as the world
cities are increasingly

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.360
linked by networks of capital,
technology, and migration,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.810
distinctions created by
local traditions of culture

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.490
still matter.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.210
All of these issues must
be on our agenda for today.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.900
What is more, each
city is itself divided.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.940
Today cities
throughout the world

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.050
face what some experts have
called the new urban crisis.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.510
More and more, the
affluent and the educated

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.880
flocked to cities,
which then spurs

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.080
rising prices and segregated
and unequal living conditions.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.860
Amid this crisis urbanists
face complex challenges.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.290
How can we preserve
the opportunity

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.530
that cities have traditionally
offered their residents

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.940
and newcomers?

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.750
How can we sustain any
broad based urban identity

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.500
when a city's people lead
highly segmented lives?

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.290
What are the instruments
of creating healthier, more

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.250
just cities when they operate
within an unpoliced world

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.940
of global capitalism and
international institutions?

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.650
The attractions of the new city
are also its Achilles heel.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.630
And then, of course,
there are the challenges

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.650
raised by even larger forces,
including our planet's shifting

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.730
climate.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.920
With so many great
cities originally

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.240
ports on oceans and rivers
including our own Boston,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.700
sea rise is an imminent danger.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.940
In addition, threats
to water, clean air,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.180
and natural resources
destabilize our cities,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.500
think Flint, Michigan, and add
another layer of complexity

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.910
to contemplating the future.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.150
But there is hope, too.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.640
Smart cities are
now using big data

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.310
to solve complex urban problems.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.770
Experts in urbanism
are prioritizing

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.560
green infrastructure
and architecture.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.260
Urban planners have
placed renewed emphasis

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.410
on making well-designed
human-scaled public space

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.150
accessible to all.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.130
And citizens in
some cities are even

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.710
taking place making
into their own hands

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.220
to invent new ways to make
our cities more livable.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.430
Clearly, the challenges
facing today's global urbanism

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.840
are complex, multi-layered,
and vast in scale.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.630
Which is why I am so
glad we are welcoming

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.330
a wide range of speakers
to Radcliffe today

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.480
to reflect on the human
experience of urban living

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.590
from many angles.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.320
Here's how the day will work.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.720
We will open the conference
with a keynote address

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.880
by author Angela Flournoy.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.850
And I will tell you a bit
more about Angela in a minute.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.980
The panels that follow
will be moderated

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.220
by three scholars who have
directed the Harvard Mellon

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.300
Initiative.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.090
The first panel, Ways
of Knowing the City,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.430
will explore the
experiential sensory

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.240
and most human aspects of
urbanism made accessible to us

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.790
through a wide variety of media.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.120
It will be moderated by Julie
Buckler, the Samuel Hazard

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.870
Cross Professor of Slavic
Languages and Literatures

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.760
and of Comparative Literature
who is also the Faculty

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.100
Director of the Humanities
here at Radcliffe

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.430
and the Coprincipal Investigator
of the Harvard Mellon

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.540
Initiative.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.880
The second panel is entitled,
Beyond the Nature/Technology

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.960
Divide.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.600
And it will examine the
evolving relationship

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.690
between the technology
of urban infrastructure

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.740
and new notions of nature
and landscape design

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.020
that challenge this
traditional opposition.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.550
Eric Ghenoiu, the initiative's
research program manager,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.650
will moderate this panel.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.650
The third panel is
entitled Plan an Unplanned,

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.830
which could also be thought
of as formal and informal.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.700
This panel will highlight the
spontaneous, the grass roots,

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.220
and how even the
best of urban plans

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.850
can evolve in surprising
and refreshing directions.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.250
Yves Blau, Adjunct
Professor of the History

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.620
and Theory of Urban
Form and Design

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.770
at the Graduate School of
Design and the other Coprincipal

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.280
Investigator of the
Harvard Mellon Initiative,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.270
will moderate this panel.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.150
And after the keynote
and after each panel

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.400
we will open the floor
to your questions.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.860
We'll place a microphone
in the center aisle.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.460
If you have a question, please
line up, identify yourself,

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.070
and ask your question.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.520
And at the end of
the conference,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.620
I hope you will all join us for
a reception in the Sheerr room

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.500
of Fay house just next door.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.040
It's now my great pleasure
to introduce today's

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.770
keynote speaker Angela Flournoy.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.810
Angela's an award
winning writer whose

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.210
work has appeared in The
Paris Review, The New York

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.540
Times, and The New Republic,
among many other places.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.630
She's a graduate of the
Iowa Writer's Workshop.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.450
And she is the author of the
acclaimed novel The Turner

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.140
House, which was a finalist
for the National Book Award.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.070
We asked Angela to keynote our
conference because her fiction

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.810
probes deeply into the human
experience of living in cities.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.260
The Turner House explores
the lives of the large Turner

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.450
family in Detroit
for more than half

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.290
a century after Frances Turner
journeyed there from Arkansas

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.090
during World War II.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.420
Angela is currently
working on a novel that

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.450
traces the lives of a group
of African American women

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.040
in Los Angeles
and New York City.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.230
And I think and hope we will
hear more about that today.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.360
Please join me in giving a warm
welcome to Angela Flournoy.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.270
- Hi everyone.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.900
I'm honored to be
here this morning.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.270
Thank you Liz for that
flattering introduction.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.150
And thank you to
everyone at the Radcliffe

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.390
Institute for organizing
today's conference.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.270
When you write a novel that is
about something, whether it's

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.670
politics, history,
or even ghosts,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.492
you might from time
to time be asked

00:10:15.492 --> 00:10:17.450
to speak about these
subjects on the assumption

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.940
that in order to write
about them in your fiction

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.640
you must actually know
a great deal about them.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.170
The reality is is
that we fiction

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.430
writers get by on a passing
knowledge of most topics.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.250
Just what it takes to convince
the reader of continuity

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.646
in our make-believe story lines.

00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:36.020
We learn enough about a field
of medicine for a character

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.490
to convincingly practice it.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.710
Or about a trend
in 1940s women's

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.450
wear to compel the
reader to imagine it.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.420
Expertise is rarely achieved.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.430
I'm happy to report
that today is not one

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.650
when I find myself
having to beef up

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.630
a fleeting interest
in a topic in order

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.840
to pass as knowledgeable
in front of all of you.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.630
Urbanism is something I think
about often for many reasons

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.050
in many different ways.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.520
My interest in the phenomenon
has artistic as well as

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.830
professional and personal roots.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.710
I hope that by sharing some
of my thoughts on urbanism

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.020
and how these thoughts
influence my work as a novelist,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.610
I might be able to
spur a conversation

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.610
or at least keep you
awake at this early hour.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.220
First a confession,
my own origins

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.220
are not particularly urban.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.600
Or rather they
were at the onset.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.450
I was born in Los Angeles and
lived in what people broadly

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.600
call South Los Angeles for
the early years of my life.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.690
But my life subsequently
became suburban.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.660
I feel as if I have to get
that fact out in the beginning

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.910
as people are prickly about
the origins of writers

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.620
who talk of the cities.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.330
I write about big
cities, yet I hail

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.120
from West Covina, California
a city in Los Angeles

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.120
County with a mere 100,000
residents and enough cul de

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.970
sacs to seriously hinder
horseback invasion.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.849
Still this wasn't a homogeneous
existence most conjure

00:11:49.849 --> 00:11:51.015
up when thinking of suburbs.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.620
It worked.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.800
West Covina is an ethnoburb,
one of many in the San Gabriel

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.500
Valley, populated by
predominantly Latino and Asian

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.850
American families.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.280
My neighborhood sat in
a corner between Walnut,

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.900
an affluent,
predominantly Chinese

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.320
American and Filipino town and
La Puente, a working class,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.474
largely Mexican American city.

00:12:12.474 --> 00:12:14.640
I had friends who rode
horseback on trails in Walnut

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.100
on weekends and friends who
lived in section 8 housing

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.650
across the street from
my apartment complex.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.870
I watched films about the
shortcomings of urban life

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.730
and had the sensation
of both identifying

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.550
with some of those ills,
the outdated textbooks,

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.790
and overcrowded classrooms,
and the gang violence,

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.119
the teen pregnancy, the
uneasy race relations.

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:33.660
And understanding
that we were living

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.451
in the place that was
supposed to be better

00:12:35.451 --> 00:12:37.080
off than these city centers.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.000
We were supposed
to be the escape.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.950
Indeed, my own mother
had moved to West Covina

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.420
for this purpose.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.130
I did not identify
with pop culture

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.560
and literary representations
of suburban life.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.640
I had a single mother.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.410
We lived in apartments,
the suburbs,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.240
from The Wonder
Years to Full House,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.070
all the way back
to Updike's Rabbit,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.740
Run were presented
as outside of time,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.160
without a distinctive sound,
save for the opening of garage

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.680
doors and devoid
of all odors save

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.660
for the smell of
cut grass, barbecue

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.260
smoke, and hot asphalt.
We had smells and sounds

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.000
a plenty in West Covina.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.600
At the time 30% of the city's
population was foreign born.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.482
I was in bilingual
English Spanish classes

00:13:14.482 --> 00:13:16.440
until fourth grade when
the state of California

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.690
stopped funding
bilingual education.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.570
There wasn't an easy category
for our city at the time.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.847
We were 30 years too early
to the browning of America.

00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.430
Something that I
only recently learned

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.670
might ruin this country if
it is allowed to transpire.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.650
But none of us felt ruined.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.930
I concluded that the
word urban is slippery.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.179
It didn't translate depending
on where in this country

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:36.730
one lived.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.370
And like all
language, its meaning

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.560
was determined by the
person employing It.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.000
For instance, the
city of Compton

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.130
is another Los Angeles
County satellite

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.130
with fewer than 100,000
residents, a decades old

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.160
equestrian club, and more
tall elegant palm trees

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.170
than West Covina
could ever yield.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.330
Yet few would argue with
Compton's categorization

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.030
as urban, especially not
in the '80s and '90s.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.950
This is perhaps because
of its elevated crime

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.790
rate or the efforts of
rappers Dr. Dre and the group

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.340
NWA to put the small city
on the national stage.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.290
But more likely, its
due to the heavily Black

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.840
population of Compton
during those years.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.850
Until the late aughts,
urban in this country

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.050
was a well-worn euphemism for
Black and often poor and Black.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.330
It was handier than
ethnic, because on its face

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.390
it wasn't about race, and more
flexible than inner city, which

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.532
suffered from being
overly specific.

00:14:23.532 --> 00:14:24.990
The Oxford English
Dictionary still

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.940
offers a secondary
definition of urban

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.440
that is simply denoting Black
popular culture in general.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.530
Urban adult and contemporary is
used by the Recording Industry

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.450
Academy of America as
a catch-all category

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.300
for music made by
or for Black folks

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.070
that isn't hip hop or gospel.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.910
But times change and words
mutate at an astonishing rate.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.370
Today the word urban
may just as easily

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.010
conjure images of
gleaming high-rises,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.010
minimalist coffee boutiques,
co-working spaces,

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.100
and a man walking 12
dogs at once for pay.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.690
The dog walker trope
is so prevalent,

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.398
it has graced the
cover of The New Yorker

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.410
more than once over
the past decade.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.530
And by affixing "ism" to
the end of the word urban,

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.560
we move from talking
about people all together

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.200
to talking about trends and
data and fields of study.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.850
The definitions have shifted.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.469
But some people did
not get this memo.

00:15:14.469 --> 00:15:15.510
You're living in poverty.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.410
You have no jobs.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.160
58% of your youth is unemployed.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.860
What the hell do
you have to lose?

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.420
This was Donald
Trump on the campaign

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.899
trail in Detroit in October.

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:25.440
When Trump referred
to urban centers,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.070
he employed the old codes,
which offended many urbanites

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.396
sensibilities.

00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:31.020
It was like he hopped
out of a DeLorean

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.930
from a bygone decade
sporting a wide tie

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.820
and using the wrong language.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.520
Didn't he know that urban
meant something different now?

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.600
Apparently not.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.870
So confident was he in the
inextricable relationship

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.710
of Black folks to urban
spaces, spaces mired in misery,

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.511
that he nominated
an unqualified man

00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:50.760
to run the Department of
Housing and Urban Development

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.010
by virtue of his
blackness alone.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.450
It is one of the
more absurd cases

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.870
of coded language influencing
actual decision making.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.900
For literature, the word urban
and the concept of urbanism

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.670
has just as many faces.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.580
I'm proud to say that I am
a writer of the urban novel.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.250
This is not to be confused
with urban fiction, which

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.370
in the book-selling world is
used to categorize those page

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.290
turners by African Americans.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.210
From Iceberg Slim to
Sister Souljah that

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.000
focus on the violence, sex,
and fast money of street life,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.970
the urban novel is a
literary tradition more

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.612
than a hard and fast genre.

00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:24.570
These are narratives that
make it their mission

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.600
to analyze what it is like to
be a single person or a network

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.810
of people in a large system
of housing, transportation,

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.740
and industry.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.570
There are many reasons
to write an urban novel.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.520
City residents have an
increased probability

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.934
of encountering a stranger
or the downright strange.

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.350
They may experience
the dissonance

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.230
of turning off a well to do
block onto an alleyway mired

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.479
in poverty.

00:16:47.479 --> 00:16:49.020
And what's more,
they may come to see

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.240
this juxtaposition as normal.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.790
Their lives are impacted by
street corner policing and city

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.110
hall politics.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.640
The standard fare claustrophobia
of apartment living

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.220
can morph into
paranoid agoraphobia

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.800
during times of
political upheaval.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.250
Neighbors can become threats
to one's existence overnight.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.099
It follows then that characters
who dwell in cities both real

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.890
and imagined often have
concerns and desires that

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.500
differ from those who
dwell outside of them.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.810
And through the preoccupations
of a novel's characters,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.020
we might get a window into the
underlying concerns of a city's

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.180
real life residents.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.060
A person may never have a chance
to visit Mexico City or Delhi

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.540
or Tokyo but they may read
fiction by Roberto Belano,

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.110
Karan Mahajan or Haruki Murakami
that helps them understand

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.600
something about those cities
that guidebooks and historical

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.440
texts cannot, the psychological
essence of a place.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.930
When readers say the city
feels like a character,

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.720
as they often say to me in
a work of fiction, what they

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.450
really mean is the
characters' lives

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.130
are so connected to the city
that the more I know them,

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.654
the more I know it.

00:17:49.654 --> 00:17:51.570
I'm interested in how
writers accomplish this.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.610
How urban settings impact
characters psyches' and how

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.670
these settings influence
a story structure.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.009
Rarely is an urban novel
described as quiet.

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:03.550
We employ that adjective when
talking about stories where not

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.250
much happens on a plot
level but emotional shifts

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.570
are afoot that keep us
reading nonetheless.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.500
Quiet is most often the realm
of the country or the cookie

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.760
cutter suburb.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.130
These places are more likely
to have controlled exterior

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.400
environments, whether
it's because your nearest

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.647
neighbor is miles away or you
live in a bedroom community.

00:18:21.647 --> 00:18:23.980
In such settings the character
might experience a change

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.230
to their exterior worlds
gradually, perhaps

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.660
at the pace of an
entire lifetime.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.520
Barring those novels
where a character

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.950
lives in an urban space
but seldom ventures outside

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.620
of their home or outside
of their own memories,

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.950
its very difficult for an urban
novel to remain quiet for long.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.175
Change can be swift
and life altering.

00:18:41.175 --> 00:18:43.300
A character's only window
is blocked off by a newer

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.340
construction next door.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.542
A pickpocket steals
the love letter

00:18:47.542 --> 00:18:49.750
that an aging man had finally
mustered up the courage

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.670
to deliver to his paramour.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.370
Each interaction on the
street, in the grocery store,

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.160
at a concert, is an
opportunity for intersection,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.560
for one reality to
collide with another.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.990
Such collisions can
drive the plot forward.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.550
These unplanned
interactions are also

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.370
why the urban
novel, at its core,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.890
is one that must grapple
with multiple types of change

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:09.954
at once.

00:19:09.954 --> 00:19:11.370
Over the last
century, novels have

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.900
helped shape our
associations with urbanism

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.630
as a catalyst for
change, as a sensibility,

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.930
and as a sociological
phenomenon.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.700
In the early industrial
years of the 19th century,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.540
Charles Dickens via the travails
of Oliver Twist, the Dorrit

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.270
family, and others, highlighted
the inequalities of life

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:32.110
in London under an
indifferent capitalist system.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.940
The moral lines were
more or less clear.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.170
And readers were
encouraged to consider

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.820
how this new leap
into industry was

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.584
changing their sensibilities.

00:19:38.584 --> 00:19:40.750
There's a through line from
Dickens to the muckraker

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.360
Upton Sinclair, who used a
heavier hand in his novel

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.000
The Jungle but with a similar
focus on how modernity might

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.460
be leaving so many behind.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.340
At the turn of the
century in this country,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.010
two novels exemplify the
questions American urban novels

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.820
would continue to grapple with
into the post-industrial era.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.700
What do we sacrifice by
moving into urban spaces

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.500
and who do we become?

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.590
Theodore Dreiser's Sister
Carrie published in 1900

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.300
is the story of one
woman's coming of age

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.610
as well as the story
of a man's undoing.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.550
Carrie, bright, timid, and full
of the illusions of ignorance

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.940
in youth, as Dreiser writes,
escapes her humdrum town

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.790
in Wisconsin by
migrating to Chicago

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.170
to live with her sister.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.790
She soon finds her
sister and brother

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.540
in law's flat full
of joyless toil

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.210
and takes up with a dandy
who clothes and houses her

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.410
as his mistress.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.680
After another illicit romance
and a brief escape to Montreal,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.270
Carrie lands in New York.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.400
By the novels end,
she gains a measure

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.280
of independence and acclaim
in New York theater.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.070
But she isn't
necessarily any happier.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.985
Throughout the novel,
Dreiser takes care

00:20:43.985 --> 00:20:45.610
to make connections
between the changes

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.430
afoot in the urban spaces Carrie
inhabits and those nascent

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.430
within Carrie herself.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.580
He describes 1889 Chicago
as a city of over 500,000

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.150
with the ambition, the
daring, and the activity

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.100
of a metropolis of a million.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.550
Carrie is similarly brimming
with ambition that surpasses

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.650
her age, gender, and station.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.810
This is an additional
charge of urban novelists,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.730
to find ways to fold
impertinent city

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.670
data and historical
information into the storyline

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.830
without lapsing
into the academic.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.870
No offense to all
of you academics.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.870
Dreiser presents the city
as a place of lax morality,

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.630
particularly for
single women, but also

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.900
a place for self actualization.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.560
And he accomplishes this via
a starker form of realism

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.110
than the literary world at
the time thought appropriate.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.910
The book was panned
and then rediscovered

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.620
and celebrated
several years later.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.480
Sister Carrie, with
its depiction of class

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.550
jumping, bed hopping,
and generally doing

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.550
what it takes to make it
in the 20th century city,

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.590
is the forebearer of a
particular and persistent

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.710
strain of American urban novels,
from F. Scott Fitzgerald's

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.810
The Great Gatsby to Claire
Messud's The Emperor's

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.080
Children.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.440
I even stumbled upon a
quiz online the other day

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.180
which asks readers
to differentiate

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.520
between the words of sister
Carrie and those of Sex

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.460
and the City's Carrie Bradshaw
and it is very, very difficult

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.320
to do.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.970
Meanwhile, The Sport of the
Gods, Paul Laurence Dunbar's

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.080
1902 novel tackled the impact
of the shift to urban living

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.080
on the ultimate
outsider, the low income,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.170
rural, southern African
American family.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.330
After Berry, the patriarch
of the Hamilton family

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.670
is wrongfully
convicted of robbing

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.637
his white boss, the remaining
family flees to New York.

00:22:18.637 --> 00:22:21.220
The Hamiltons imagine the city
similar to how Dreiser's Sister

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.639
Carrie imagines it.

00:22:22.639 --> 00:22:24.430
They had heard of New
York as a place vague

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.350
and far away, Dunbar writes.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.120
A city that like
heaven to them had

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.726
existed by faith alone all
the days of their lives

00:22:30.726 --> 00:22:31.600
they had heard of it.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.880
And it seemed to them the
entire of all the glory,

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.490
all the wealth, and all
the freedom of the world.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.069
The Hamiltons take
a train north.

00:22:38.069 --> 00:22:39.610
They inquire about
the boarding house

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.350
at the depot when they arrive.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.162
And they make their
way bit by bit.

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:44.620
They ultimately
find that the North

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.040
can be just as inhospitable
to Blacks as the South.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.590
And their disillusionment
is bitter and permanent.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.160
But before that, Dunbar gives us
a perfect poetic encapsulation

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.920
of the newly minted
city slickers burden.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.450
After it is all
over, after he has

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.000
passed through the first
pangs of strangeness

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.830
and homesickness,
yes, even after he

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.430
has got beyond the stranger's
enthusiasm for the metropolis,

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:07.930
the real fever of
love for the place

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.400
will begin to take
hold upon him.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.320
The subtle insidious
whine of New York

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.910
will begin to intoxicate him.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.070
Then if he be wise, he
will go away, any place,

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.580
yes, even over to New Jersey.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.950
But if he be a fool,
he will stay and stay

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.974
until the town becomes
all in all to him,

00:23:22.974 --> 00:23:25.390
until the very streets are his
chums and certain buildings

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.730
and corners his best friends.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:28.930
Then he is hopeless.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.630
And to live elsewhere
would be death.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.210
The Barrow will be his
romance, Broadway his lyric,

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.770
and the park his pastoral.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.250
The river and the glory
of it all, his epic.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.300
And he will look down pityingly
on all the rest of humanity.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.390
I myself try not to be that
sort of navel gazing urbanite.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.040
But it's hard sometimes.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.080
Battered and broken by
the city, the Hamiltons

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.707
moved back South, thereby making
the novel a tenuous early entry

00:23:53.707 --> 00:23:56.290
into what would become the canon
of great migration literature

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.530
and art.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.530
In urban novels that encompass
this period of migration,

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.030
the typical changes
afoot in a city

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.740
are compounded by
the changes tied

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.290
to the precarious relationship
of Black characters

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.294
to White characters.

00:24:08.294 --> 00:24:09.960
For Black characters
without the ability

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.510
to pass as White, as Nella
Larsen's character sometimes

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.020
do, class ascension and true
assimilation are distant goals.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.244
Survival comes first.

00:24:17.244 --> 00:24:18.660
And just when that
bar is cleared,

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.310
another might be raised.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.390
The city is an imperfect
refuge in these works of art.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.790
From Richard Wright's Native Son
Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:31.800
in the Sun, a place where
one might comfortably

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.960
be a little bit more
their truer self but

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.120
where the price of
such freedom is often

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.060
backbreaking work and sometimes
a forfeiture of dignity,

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.890
and, yes, even sanity.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.710
My first novel The Turner House
is a great migration novel.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.790
This is because I had no choice.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.956
I didn't set out to write
a great migration novel.

00:24:47.956 --> 00:24:49.830
The more I learned about
the city of Detroit,

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.720
the more it became
clear that a core issue

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.690
was how the city, both
individuals and leadership,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.780
refused to welcome migrants
from the South, first by denying

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.970
them housing for as long
as possible then fleeing

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.450
the city altogether rather
than co-habitate with them.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.910
It's an old story, but
it feels quite fresh

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.610
when I read about politicians
across the country attempting

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.440
to prevent this or
that sort of migrant

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.980
from establishing a toehold
in their cities and towns.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.470
Today we live in a time of
big cities as generations

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:17.940
before us have lived.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.710
But we're also
living in a period

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.280
of unusual change in regards
to what it means to be urban.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.810
Now the issue
isn't so much, what

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.750
do we lose by migrating
from small town to large.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.700
But it centers on
what we lose or how

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.040
we change by other sorts
of movement in relation

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.170
to urban life; like
forced migration

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.500
to cities and new countries due
to conflict, drought, rising

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.611
sea levels, or a search
for economic opportunity;

00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:42.360
migration out of cities
to the surrounding

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.240
suburbs due to a scarcity
of affordable housing;

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.490
the increasing
role of technology

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.920
in influencing housing
markets, state surveillance,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.570
and patterns of movement.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.195
How will cities welcome us.

00:25:53.195 --> 00:25:55.320
How can we manage to continue
to live in the cities

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.640
that we know and love?

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.010
Who is the city for?

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.870
For my own work, I come
back to the idea of change

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.840
itself as a useful vehicle
for getting stories going

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.297
and for engaging my reader.

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:07.380
As a descendant of the
great migration who grew up

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.060
in a town full of
recent immigrants,

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.850
I can't help but think that
conversations about urbanism

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.520
must continue to include
a discussion of migration,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.010
inclusion, and
shifting identities,

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.660
which brings me to the novel
I'm currently working on.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.690
This is currently
on my cork board.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.790
"The act of migration puts
into crisis everything

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.740
about the migrating
individual or group,

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.410
everything about
identity and selfhood

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.380
and culture and belief.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.240
So if this is a novel
about migration,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.160
it must be the act of
putting in question.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.770
It must perform the
crisis it describes."

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.040
Salman Rushdie was referring
to his own novel The Satanic

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.150
Verses.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.820
For my next novel I'm interested
in where black people live

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.280
in the city and where
they migrated from

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.130
and where they appear
to be moving to next.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.240
In his November 2014 article,
"The Suburbs, Not Just for

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.460
White People Anymore"
in The New Republic,

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.390
William H. Frey reports that in
the first decades of the 2000s,

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.030
the central cities of the 100
largest metropolitan areas

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.640
saw a total decline
of 300,000 blacks,

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.530
the first absolute
population decrease

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.790
among blacks for these
cities as a group.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.790
Black folks are on the
move in ways they haven't

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.590
been since the great migration.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.770
Some back South, like Dunbar's
Hamilton family, perhaps

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.930
completing a 100 year loop.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.695
Some further away from city
centers to suburbs and exurbs

00:27:20.695 --> 00:27:22.820
that were previously the
providence of middle class

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.110
and working class whites.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.610
The rest of the
country is beginning

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.794
to get a taste of the
ethnoburbs of my youth.

00:27:27.794 --> 00:27:29.960
Except they are not being
formed as places of refuge

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.450
from city life, so much as
communities of necessity.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.840
My second novel takes
place mostly in Los Angeles

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.420
and follows a group of
African American women,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.490
as Liz pointed out,
from 2015 to 2035.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.260
And they begin at 30 years old
and at the end of the novel

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.370
they will be in their 50s.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.620
I've been thinking about
both the spatial changes that

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.620
are already underway, what
Los Angeles looks like,

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.556
as well as the demographic
changes, who lives where,

00:27:54.556 --> 00:27:56.180
and the cultural
ones-- how do we live?

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.579
What are we preoccupied with?

00:27:57.579 --> 00:27:59.120
What will be the
quinoa of the future

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.330
that we'll all be
begrudgingly eating?

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.710
I'm not a science
fiction writer.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.043
So the first thing I decided
was to make some parameters

00:28:06.043 --> 00:28:09.050
for myself and for the reader
to manage their expectations.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.510
One reason I chose the
age span that I chose

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.670
is because, with the
exception of one character,

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:16.940
I don't envision these women
as early adopters of radically

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.296
new technology into their 50s.

00:28:19.296 --> 00:28:21.920
This means that I do not intend
to wade too far into the waters

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.320
of technological speculation.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.080
People might be letting Google
or its parent company Alphabet

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.129
implant chips into
their brains by 2035,

00:28:29.129 --> 00:28:30.920
but none of my characters
will be lining up

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.360
for such a procedure.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.640
They will however
probably be willing to be

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.780
driven in self-driving cards.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.820
I plan to depict incremental
shifts rather than

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.486
drastic ones.

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:41.860
So I really think
of this project

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.050
in terms of several periods
of change instead of one

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.490
leap from now into the future.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.510
For the spatial changes I'm
focusing on the transportation

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.134
and housing broadly.

00:28:51.134 --> 00:28:53.050
And so far I've spent
most of my time thinking

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.000
about Los Angeles
in this respect.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.004
In order to think about
our present moment

00:28:57.004 --> 00:28:58.420
as well as to
imagine future ones,

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.050
I start my research in the past.

00:29:02.869 --> 00:29:04.910
The story of Black and
Latino life in Los Angeles

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.743
has been tied to the
story of transportation

00:29:06.743 --> 00:29:08.000
in the city for some time.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.940
As is the story of every
category of Angeleno.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.785
The 10 and 60 freeways bisected
the Latino communities east

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:15.410
of downtown, creating
new neighborhoods

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.920
and irreparably altering
the dynamic of old ones.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.860
So this is, they are
building the freeway here.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.040
And these neighborhoods
here, parts

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.470
of East LA that
basically just were

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.960
decimated by the
construction of the freeway.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.940
The extension of the harbor
freeway south to San Pedro

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.280
decimated the Central Avenue
African American business

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.530
district in a way that
made my grandfather bitter

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.410
when he talked about
it, even into his 80s.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.880
But fiction obsessed
person that I

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.280
am, hearing my grandfather
reminisce about the area

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.230
did not do much to
cement it in my mind

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.981
as reading Chester Himes' urban
novel If He Hollers Let Him Go.

00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:55.480
Wherein in the main
character speeds

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.610
up and down central
avenue for night life,

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.460
for sex, and to
escape police pursuit.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.570
So here you have the Colosseum.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.120
And this is USC, my Alma mater.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.740
And right here where the 110
freeway extension is happening,

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.020
and this is where it's not
complete, right behind the 110

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.780
is Central Avenue.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.940
And Central Avenue
used to be home

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:24.810
to a wide variety of African
American businesses including

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:25.970
hotels.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.920
And really in the city,
after those hotels went away,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.170
there was a period of time
where it was very difficult

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.420
if you were not a
well-to-do black person

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.790
to find some place
where you could stay.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.210
And this is
something that is not

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.990
unusual in other parts of
the country as we all know.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.710
One of the things that compelled
me to make my first novel

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.134
The Turner House broader--

00:30:48.134 --> 00:30:50.550
I thought it was just going
to be set in the present day--

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.920
was that the more that I learned
about these past neighborhoods,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.560
these neighborhoods that
really fostered African

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.680
American self-reliance and
trade and community, that they

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.500
were the first things that were
decimated when the city decided

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.450
that for urban renewal
to add new parks,

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.636
like Lafayette Park in
Detroit, or new freeways.

00:31:12.636 --> 00:31:14.010
And they basically
just went down

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.750
the middle of those
neighborhoods.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.510
And one thing that
happens is that even

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.379
though a city will continue
and the black population will

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:22.920
migrate away from
those neighborhoods

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.710
and build new communities,
they never forget.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.840
It's something that my
grandfather never forgot.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.370
He never forgot Central Avenue.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:36.390
And it changed the way that he
felt as a member of the city

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.060
altogether.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.340
So even though the city
helped kill central avenue,

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.120
I mean excuse me, even
though the freeways

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.700
helped kill central
avenue, the freeways also

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.490
made it easier for people
living in segregated pockets

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.130
of the city to explore
other neighborhoods,

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.110
facilitating the movement
of new waves of Black

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.870
and Latino migrants further
east into the San Gabriel

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.459
Valley, where I grew up.

00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:01.500
And into the Inland Empire
and north into the San

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.054
Fernando Valley.

00:32:04.054 --> 00:32:05.720
I think about these
past changes and how

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.330
they impacted individual
movement, collective gathering,

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.470
and culture.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.420
For the first four decades
of the 20th century

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.550
LA was crisscrossed
with streetcars, as were

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.110
many cities in the country.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.900
Track miles peaked
in LA around 1925.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.330
And ridership peaked during
World War II, in large part

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:25.910
due to gas and rubber rationing
as well as war industry

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.020
employment.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.667
By the late '40s the street cars
were replaced with bus lines

00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:31.250
with the exception
of a few lines that

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:35.610
became the basis of the
LA Metrolink system.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.190
This is the current
LA metro system.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:43.250
So if you go back
here and look at this

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.510
as more than one system.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:49.700
This is three systems
overlapping, maybe more,

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.420
these dotted lines here.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.090
And basically, a
streetcar went down all

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.510
of the main arteries
of Los Angeles.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.910
And that means that there
was an affordable option

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:06.051
for most people to venture
out into parts of the county,

00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:06.550
really.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.880
Because they went all the way to
Pasadena and down to South Gate

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.790
that otherwise they
wouldn't have access to.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.480
So when those lines
were inactive,

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.270
this is what we were
left with, which

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.110
if you compare it to before,
basically at most places

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.860
where black people live
or Latino people live,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.590
they have to drive to get there.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.370
And they are geographically
separated from other parts

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:36.120
of the city.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.250
So it's a clear
inhibitor to integration.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:46.830
So you end up with these
really homogeneous areas all

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.880
over the metro area.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.070
So one thing that I'm
excited for in the future

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:02.940
is the Crenshaw LAX
line which is currently

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.530
underway in Los Angeles.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.750
It's expected to be
complete in 2019.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.989
More than the Expo line, which
recently opened and connected

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.449
downtown to Santa
Monica beach, I've

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.030
been actually anxiously
awaiting this extension

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.699
because what it will mean
for tens of thousands

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:23.929
of Black Angelenos
and Latino Angelenos.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:26.270
So this is like a
zoomed in, this is just

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.520
a portion of the map
that I showed you before.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.710
But this is a
predominantly Black part

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.280
of LA, which if anyone
is familiar with LA,

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.330
it's not all really LA.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.070
It's other small cities as well.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.400
Culver City is its own city.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.710
Englewood is its own city.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.120
But this is what
people generally

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.100
are thinking about when
they refer to South Los

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.820
Angeles, which is kind of a
new handy euphemism of where

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.900
the brown people live.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:55.270
And right now there is
no connector between,

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.460
this is the new expo
line that takes you west.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.940
It takes you from downtown
where more affluent people are

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.130
starting to live and USC is.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:06.340
It takes you straight
through these neighborhoods

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.339
out to the beach.

00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:09.880
But it really doesn't provide
any way for these neighborhoods

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.915
to communicate and
travel within themselves.

00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:16.180
And so this Crenshaw line--

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.540
which in the short term
has displaced businesses

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.760
on Crenshaw Boulevard,
which is one

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.630
of the African American
business centers in the city--

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:29.740
long term, I'm interested to see
how it will affect where people

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.699
live, where people shop--
because right now you

00:35:31.699 --> 00:35:33.489
don't really shop in
this part of the city,

00:35:33.489 --> 00:35:34.960
you have to go
elsewhere to shop--

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.970
and who lives there.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.530
And I'm also
interested to see how

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.690
that changes the
demographics of these areas.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.720
So for instance, Baldwin
Hills and Ladera Heights,

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.740
they are intentionally
segregated.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.380
These are upper middle class
African American enclaves.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.600
They're not necessarily
interested in lower

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.700
middle class or
working class African

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.520
American having easy access
to their neighborhoods.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.870
So that is one change
that is outside of just--

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:03.700
when we think about
justification,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.790
we often think about
people of means

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.492
getting access or
having their eyes

00:36:08.492 --> 00:36:10.450
opened to the neighborhoods
that they otherwise

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.890
wouldn't have found desirable.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.220
But the reverse is
also possible where

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:18.400
you have people of means who
one of the things that they have

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.470
enjoyed is a geographical
separation from people

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.720
with less money than them
is one of the reasons why

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.886
during the riots these
neighborhoods were relatively

00:36:27.886 --> 00:36:28.870
unscathed.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.527
Because they were on hills.

00:36:30.527 --> 00:36:31.360
And they were above.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.318
And they were separate.

00:36:32.318 --> 00:36:34.900
There was no easy
transportation to get there.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.460
How that might impact the way
that these communities grow

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.670
and change, especially
as these populations age

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.780
that own these homes here.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.070
If you would have told me 10
years ago that there might

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:51.920
be a future Los Angeles without
heavy dependency on freeways

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.530
and automobiles, I
wouldn't have believed you.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.300
And I still kind of don't.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.320
But I've come across a few
proposed projects that made

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.690
me think it might be possible.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:05.000
Park 101 is a
proposed freeway cap

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.520
that would connect the north
and south sections of downtown

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.470
to either side of the 101.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:12.560
So basically if you
remember the first slide

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.820
I showed which was the
10 freeway and the 101

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.120
freeway bisecting these
traditionally Latino

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.160
communities East LA.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:30.940
Park 101 would restore a lot
of what was geographically

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.150
broken up 60 years ago.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.550
Of course these
populations in this area

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.440
are not necessarily--
will they still are,

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:42.640
but they're quickly sort of
changing-- as predominantly

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.660
Latino as they once were.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.320
But it's interesting
to see now how

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.160
a lot of the same things
that were considered

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.340
in the public good and
part of urban renewal

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.440
are now being reversed
in one way or the other,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.600
whether that is the
metro lines returning

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.560
or whether that is physically
building land where the land

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.887
was purposefully taken away.

00:38:05.887 --> 00:38:07.470
There have been many
projects proposed

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:09.390
to restore the LA
river and making

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.490
it a recreational destination.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.460
People kayak in the
LA river, I would not.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.060
But perhaps in the future
my characters will.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.860
The California
high speed rail is

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.270
expected to be completed by 2029
barring governmental impediment

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.750
and will connect LA to the
Bay Area in 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.460
Many of these projects
focus on downtown.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.100
But one that I am
particularly interested in

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.890
is the city of champions,
Englewood new sports

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:40.260
and entertainment complex at
the former Hollywood Bowl site,

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.230
excuse me, the
Hollywood Park site,

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:47.590
which will house the LA Rams and
the San Diego Chargers in 2019.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.539
So this area here, this is not
something that is proposed.

00:38:51.539 --> 00:38:53.830
This is something that is
actually happening right now.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.371
The Rams are playing
in the Colosseum

00:38:55.371 --> 00:38:58.990
and the poor Chargers are going
to be playing in the Home Depot

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:04.537
center in Carson, which
only has 30,000 seats.

00:39:04.537 --> 00:39:06.370
But when this is built,
this will completely

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.900
change Englewood, which is
another similar to Compton.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.510
A city that people consider
urban but is actually a suburb.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:18.580
It has about 100,000 residents
and detached single family

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.420
homes.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.220
But it is a
neighborhood that has

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.200
had experienced
economic depression

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:29.410
since the moving of the
LA Lakers from the Forum

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.560
to the Staples Center, even
though the Forum is now

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.340
reopened as an
entertainment space.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.870
And so this will provide
revitalization to the area.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.010
But a question is,
who will it benefit?

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:45.820
I grew up right around,
its hard to tell here,

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.560
but I believe that
prairie is over here.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.110
I grew up right over
here off of prairie

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.940
before I moved to West Covina.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.030
And I have friends who own
homes around that area.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:59.380
And so the question
is, will they

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.230
feel that they are part
of this new development?

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.860
Or will they feel like this
new development is a new sort

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.390
of pressure to leave the area?

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.630
There's also proposed
redevelopment

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.210
of the Jordan Downs housing
projects in the works

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:15.650
to turn the area
into a mixed use

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.275
residential, commercial
district, which

00:40:17.275 --> 00:40:19.191
comes with a host of
concerns about the future

00:40:19.191 --> 00:40:21.110
of public housing in
LA and the likelihood

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.120
of sustained,
affordable housing.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.010
What novels can do
is help us imagine

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:30.250
how changes like the ones I've
outlined feel on the ground.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.200
In this moment of
partisan flame wars,

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.930
potential cuts to public
funding, unaddressed housing

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.630
shortages, and serious
environmental concerns,

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.900
simply imagining can seem
an unproductive luxury.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.040
But it isn't.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.040
It wasn't in the time of
Dickens or Dreiser or Dunbar.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.020
And it is isn't today.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.790
Urban spaces themselves
are the result

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:52.510
of people imagining
systems by which

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.120
they might be able to pool
resources, exchange goods,

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.980
and create communities.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.690
If the imaginations
of human beings

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.190
brought urbanism
to life, then it's

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.148
worthwhile to imagine
how they might get better

00:41:02.148 --> 00:41:03.260
serve us in the future.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:03.760
Thank you.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.140
- Hi, everybody.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.490
I want to thank Angela for that
wonderful talk which opened up

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:24.600
so many rich themes that we'll
explore in more detail today.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.690
Angela I think is willing
to entertain questions

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.950
from the floor.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.060
So if you'd like
to ask a question,

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.870
please approach the
central mic in the aisle.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.440
And when it's your turn
please identify yourself.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.060
And please ask a question.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.000
Don't just simply
make a comment.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.730
And although we
welcome your comments.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.580
So if you're interested
in asking questions

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.040
please approach the mic.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.820
- Thank you so much Angela.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.310
I am [INAUDIBLE] Tagiri,
a visitor from India.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:59.880
In this deep engagement with
city, history, and personhood

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.320
self.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:05.280
One of the things that I wish
to offer to think further

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.960
is the issue memory
with your grandfather.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.270
But also memory vis-a-vis
not only the human loss,

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:17.850
but it's also the
connected, ecological loss.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:22.170
For example, is there
tear for the dead river?

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:25.000
And so it is in
that spirit I just

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.560
choose to offer this theme to
think farther about the city

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.240
space as not only the
space for the human

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.820
but also it is a
living ecosystem.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.280
It is in this space
your reference

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.240
to the dog walking people,
what is the place of dog,

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.510
for example, in the
nested ecosystem.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:49.110
And how do we imagine the
city, not only for the human

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:52.500
being a kind of an
anthropocentric justice,

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:57.270
but how do we think of this city
in a post anthropocentric way.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.070
- Thank you.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.280
I think that that is one
challenge of growing up

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.060
in a smog laden,
drought ridden place

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:12.420
is that I sometimes don't think
about living things outside

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.150
of succulents and spiders
as much as I should.

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:18.930
But that is a very
important point

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.390
and it absolutely
relates to memory.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.700
My grandfather grew
up in Louisiana

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.290
before he migrated
to Los Angeles.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.600
And he always had
a garden, which

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.595
was not unusual with a lot of
first generation participants

00:43:31.595 --> 00:43:33.720
in the great migration from
the South to the North.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.330
My grandmother in Detroit
also had a garden.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:41.040
And that was not just part
of their early upbringing

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.680
and subsistence, it was
part of community building.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.660
And it was part of
like homesteading.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.830
It is just what you
did, you had a garden.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:50.910
And that is something that
especially over the drought

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:55.120
that everyone in LA thinks that
it's over but it's not over.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.630
In the past five years
of extreme drought in LA,

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:59.820
that is something that has
just not been possible.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.340
And what are the repercussions
of that culturally as well

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.080
as personally and economically.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.310
- I'm Peggy [INAUDIBLE],
from Boston,

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:16.470
and I do have a question.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.410
But I want to thank you
for your novel, which

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:21.790
is phenomenal, the first one.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:23.070
- Thank you.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:28.190
- I'm wondering what
your thoughts are

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:34.660
on privatization of public
space and public institutions

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.365
in this city.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.730
That's my question.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:43.840
And it's happening all
over, but in Boston

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:50.950
with who's buying
luxury apartments, who's

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:54.940
building privately
owned charter schools,

00:44:54.940 --> 00:45:00.670
where they're being built.
In areas in Boston there's

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:05.290
intense conflict right now in
the southern part of the city

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:12.910
in Mattapan where there was
redlining and keeping blacks

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:13.450
out.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:19.060
Then the banks
redlined and allowed

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:23.290
blacks to buy homes only
in that neighborhood.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:27.550
And now there's a rich
immigrant community.

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.449
But it's the blackest
section of Boston

00:45:29.449 --> 00:45:31.490
and that's where they're
closing a public school.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.700
- There are so many
kind of like far

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.850
reaching implications
of privatization

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:43.960
of public property,
infrastructure, et cetera.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.346
If you think about what has
happened in Flint, Michigan,

00:45:47.346 --> 00:45:48.720
part of the problem
there is when

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.330
you have people who are not
scientists being the people who

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.610
get to make a decision about
what happens to the water

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.170
supply in a city.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.800
And then they decide to
ignore the scientists.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.700
Because it is more profitable
or more affordable to divert

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.950
the water from somewhere else.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:08.320
A place that is not, it's
not safe for the residents.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.990
So if you can
extrapolate that instance

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:14.940
into all of the different
ways that the interests

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.000
of private industry might not
be the same as the interests

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.170
of like the public good.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.960
I don't like to generally
talk in slippery slopes

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.140
but a lot of bad
things could happen.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.720
So that is I think
something that whether that

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:34.040
is in education or it's
something that in Southern

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.940
California is
always a hot topic,

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.827
whether that has to
do with our beaches

00:46:37.827 --> 00:46:40.160
our state beaches which we
have miles and miles of miles

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.326
of that people are always
trying to get a referendum

00:46:42.326 --> 00:46:44.870
on a local ballot to change.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:47.180
What does that mean
for future generations?

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.400
That is something that we
all have to think about.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.200
And we all have to
vote accordingly

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.970
to the conclusions we come to.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:59.970
Because it is something that
is really under fire right now.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:04.080
- My name is Joseph Greenberg.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.430
I'm a graduate of the college
and a native of Cambridge.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:13.280
And I was particularly
struck by the question

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:19.940
that you ended with, with
regards to development,

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:25.842
whether or not
existing residents feel

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:32.960
a part of new developments or
if they feel excluded by it.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:39.170
My question is really
how do cities engage

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:46.060
with the people who will be most
impacted by the decision making

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.480
process that are usually
excluded from it.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.330
For example, I was at the
Cambridge Board of this Zoning

00:47:55.330 --> 00:48:04.630
Appeals hearing last night and
I was the youngest person there.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:11.650
The crowd skewed very
older and whiter.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:16.390
And it just seems to me that
decisions at this kind of level

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.260
are being made without
input from the people who

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:24.430
will be most affected by it.

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:32.320
So how do cities facilitate
a more inclusive conversation

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:38.769
around new developments.

00:48:38.769 --> 00:48:40.310
- That's a very good
question Joseph.

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:44.677
So I think there's
like a quick answer

00:48:44.677 --> 00:48:45.760
and there's a long answer.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.620
So the quick answer
is just do better.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.030
If it's your job to get
people to come to a thing,

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.980
whether you're a party
promoter or you're

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.510
putting on a
conference, you need

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.010
to figure out how to reach the
people that need to be there.

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:00.430
And so for them to
say, well, we posted it

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:04.960
in the community newsletter and
that was that, it is your job.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.540
If that is what your charge
is, to engage that community,

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.730
you need to figure out how
to engage that community.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:14.980
And the long answer
is that also it

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.220
has so much to do with
so many levels of just

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.580
institutionalized exclusion.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:23.020
So if you have the people
who are putting on the zoning

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.890
meetings, if everyone there is a
certain age and a certain race,

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:28.870
then of course they're
going to only reach out

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.700
to the people who are--

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.680
or they're going to have
a natural inclination

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.054
where those people
gather and how

00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:37.930
to outreach the people who are
the same demographic as them.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.320
So as with most
things in life, it's

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.720
a top down diversity issue.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.840
So if everyone in
that city office

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:50.440
is middle aged and white,
then it's really no surprise

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.060
that everyone who
comes to the meeting

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.530
is middle aged and white.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:57.580
And that has to do with
perhaps where you're

00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.820
getting your interns from.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.470
There's just like
a wealth of ways.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:04.484
It's easy to say they
need to figure out a way

00:50:04.484 --> 00:50:05.650
to outreach to these people.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.260
But they have to do the
work, a lot of the work

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.470
that people don't
want to do earlier.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.960
If this is the population
I serve, why doesn't anyone

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.600
on this board look
like this population.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.320
Thank you.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:22.252
- Thank you very much

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:23.070
- Hi, I'm Chris.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:24.903
Thank you very much for
your insightful talk

00:50:24.903 --> 00:50:27.120
I'll have to read the book now.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.850
So my question, I
worked for a publication

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:33.900
that covers data driven
policy, the use of data

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:39.180
to inform those residents to
serve and how to serve them.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.660
And it seems like
the work you do,

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.210
writing fiction
can inform policy

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:45.000
in a much more personal way.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.370
So I'm sort of wondering how
you think things like fiction

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.710
could be integrated
into policy and how

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.380
to balance the personal
connection to residents

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.220
or a city with things like
data that can inform policy.

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:04.250
- Well you know a fiction
writer doesn't ever

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.380
think their writing
is useful for anything

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.580
besides hopefully getting
people to turn the next page.

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.100
But I appreciate you saying so.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:19.000
I think that one of the things
that I try to do in my fiction

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.160
is--

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.130
and that's because I
write realist fiction,

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:24.170
even though full
disclosure there's

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:26.060
a there's a ghost in
this book in the novel

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.190
so don't be alarmed
there's a ghost,

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:31.010
but it's still realist in my
opinion like realist fiction--

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:36.230
is that I really don't
try to have the answer.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.780
I write books to answer
questions for myself.

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.392
So I have a question when
I begin to write a book

00:51:41.392 --> 00:51:42.600
or I begin to write anything.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.970
I don't have the answer.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.850
And that is why
if people do think

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:50.780
that my book is like a good
portrait of the city of Detroit

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.420
over this many years
is because I was trying

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.750
to answer the question of why
is the house that my father grew

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.960
up in, why is it in
the state that it's in.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.040
What does that mean?

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.530
And how do people feel about it?

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:04.700
And so because my
brain is not one

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.970
that was really interested
in synthesizing data

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.880
to just deliver it, I'm
interested in synthesizing data

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.710
to make a story.

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:15.620
I still go through some of
the same methods of inquiry.

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.680
They're not as linear.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.680
They're a little sloppy.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.310
They're hard to
explain to people.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:24.860
But I think that one
thing that perhaps having

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.880
some more creative people be
part of that conversation can

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:34.430
do is get to that same point
of inquiry and exploration

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:37.130
without a preconceived idea.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:41.210
I did not have a
million ideas about what

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:44.540
had happened to make
the city of Detroit

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.850
and the place my father
grew up the way that it was.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.225
I had a few ideas.

00:52:48.225 --> 00:52:50.850
And I actually found out that a
lot of those were not accurate.

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:52.779
I thought it was
really just cars.

00:52:52.779 --> 00:52:54.320
They stopped making
cars in the city.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.069
And so there was nothing
left in the city.

00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.930
And that's not true.

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:58.310
When they were
still making cars,

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.410
the seeds were already
sown for the city

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.500
to end up where it was.

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.920
And so that's something
that if I was determined

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.520
to have my answer
be the correct one,

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.900
I would have never
even been receptive

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.303
to that other information.

00:53:10.303 --> 00:53:11.010
- Thank you.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.290
- Hi, thank you for
this presentation.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.820
I'm Lily Song I'm a lecturer
in urban planning and design

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.640
here at the Harvard Graduate
School of Design also

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.270
a Native of a LA
ethnoburb, Cerritos.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.250
But I wanted to ask you about--

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.440
- Cerritos auto square.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.500
- That's right 60591.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.810
Skate depot closed down though.

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:36.550
- I know it did.

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:39.440
- For a shopping center.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:45.410
But I wanted to ask you about
the role of values and norms

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:50.630
guiding spatial remaking efforts
in your stories or especially

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:51.690
with your LA project.

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:56.570
So you talked about Central
Avenue and the highways.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:01.110
And so I see these changes,
these mid-century era changes

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.700
is really driven by modernism,
the suburban ideal, auto

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.751
mobility.

00:54:05.751 --> 00:54:08.000
And then now you're talking
about these recent changes

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.340
with rail and you know
all of these investments

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.620
by metro driven by the
sustainability ideal.

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:18.230
And urban quality of life and
connectivity and all that.

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.930
And I really appreciate
how your work

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:23.450
grapples with some of the
tensions and contradictions

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:24.800
inherent in that.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.640
And you spoke about displacement
of communities of color

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.470
from the urban core who are the
ones predominantly taking buses

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:36.090
and really not owning cars.

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:38.660
And then they're getting pushed
out to these outlying areas

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.060
where they're now
reliant on cars.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:45.440
And I wanted to
ask you if that's

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.660
a deliberate thing,
where you grapple with,

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:53.390
not just intergenerational
aspects within the characters

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.730
but almost
intergenerational aspects

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.620
within the cities themselves.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:00.710
You know how cities change
because of these new ideas

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:04.190
and the zeitgeist in some ways.

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:08.254
- I think one thing
that's important

00:55:08.254 --> 00:55:10.420
and that again is another
thing that I didn't really

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:15.160
realize probably before I became
really interested in cities

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.750
is to differentiate between
what it is a zeitgeist

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:20.960
and what is the priority
and norm at the time.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.730
And where does private corporate
interests intersect in there.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.530
So some of the things
that have happened

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:29.020
in Detroit as far as just
the way the city is laid out.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:31.210
It has these wide grand
avenues and everyone

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:33.700
is spread apart from each other
because of the automobile.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.117
Because we all
wanted to have cars

00:55:35.117 --> 00:55:36.950
and that was part of
the middle class ideal.

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:38.740
But it's also because
that was the driving

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:39.980
industry in the city.

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.760
And so they wanted everyone
to have to need a car.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:46.030
And similarly in LA,
you had families,

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:50.440
you had very influential
automobile connected families

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:55.150
that helped encourage the city
to turn their funding away

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:58.870
from the criss-cross of street
car lines they had before

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:02.950
and encouraged them more
to invest in infrastructure

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:05.300
like the highway system.

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.850
So it's not just--

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:10.150
that's one thing that I
think is hard to at the time

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.400
when it's happening especially
because we don't always

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.250
know, at the time when it
happens it does feel like we're

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:17.890
just all kind of galloping
forward as a culture.

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:19.840
But there is also
sometimes someone

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.550
who is the jockey, who's
kind of riding us forward

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:28.630
and who does not necessarily
have all of the residents best

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:29.530
interests in mind.

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:32.344
Whether that is
certain developers who

00:56:32.344 --> 00:56:34.760
have this new parcel of land
and it's out here in Cerritos

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.142
and they want people
to go live in Cerritos.

00:56:37.142 --> 00:56:39.100
And they encourage the
city to figure out a way

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.810
to get people out to Cerritos.

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:46.999
Or whether that is what does
like our bike-share system

00:56:46.999 --> 00:56:48.790
look like in a city
and who is a person who

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:51.570
influences those decisions.

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:53.680
And so I think it's
both things that

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.650
have to be kind of explored
before we can really figure out

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.720
how much of it is
just where we are

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.680
and what is the
cultural influence.

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.229
- Thank you.

00:57:04.229 --> 00:57:05.770
- Hi thank you so
much for your talk.

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:06.760
My name's Adam Tanaka.

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.410
I'm a graduate
student fellow here

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:11.770
at Radcliffe and a city
planning PhD student.

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:15.010
So I had a question about, do
you see any models of writers

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:18.100
getting involved
in policy advocacy

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.950
and how writing might play
a role in helping residents

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.920
to picture or imagine the
future of their cities.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.220
There is a nonprofit in the
UK called Urban Woods that

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:30.100
actually works with communities
facing redevelopment

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.670
to basically use fiction
and poetry to engage

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:35.775
with policymakers and
redevelopment plans.

00:57:35.775 --> 00:57:39.970
I don't know if you know of
any other similar models.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:45.070
- I don't necessarily know
of any on a policy level that

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:47.860
aren't just really
focusing on literacy

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:53.800
or funding for the arts
or working within schools.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.360
There's a lot of
organizations that do that.

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.510
The National Book Foundation
has an organization

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.430
called BookUp that does it.

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:03.190
There's an organization
called 826 that

00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:06.336
does it throughout the country.

00:58:06.336 --> 00:58:08.410
Or 826, I believe.

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:11.950
But as far as
specifically around where

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:16.420
people live in spaces, I know
there seem to be a lot more,

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.300
rather than being ran
by writers and poets,

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:24.960
they seem to be ran by other
people in the social sciences.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.000
There's certainly a movement
to collect oral histories

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.930
and to keep heritage
sites running.

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:33.520
For instance, where
I live in Brooklyn

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.144
there's the Weeksville
Heritage Center,

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:37.870
which hosts a whole bunch
of arts related programs.

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:40.384
But they don't
necessarily use art

00:58:40.384 --> 00:58:41.800
as like the forefront
of what they

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.990
do to preserve that history.

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:47.560
But I could just be
ignorant on that subject.

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.960
- Liz Cohen, Dean here.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.870
I couldn't help but
want to ask a question.

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:54.820
Thank you for a
terrific talk first.

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.660
And I felt when I read
Turner House how deeply you

00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.200
seemed to be engaging
in history and sociology

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.520
and racial politics.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.064
But hearing you I
know that was true.

00:59:06.064 --> 00:59:07.480
Because you've
shared that with us

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.300
today from transportation
policy to the way

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.830
the built environments develop.

00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:16.600
So given that Turner house
is so rooted in research

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.080
into the past, I'm quite
struck by the courage

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:24.550
you are now about to show in
looking towards the future.

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:28.150
And speculating about
what you think cities

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:30.400
are going to look like, what
people's experiences will

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.400
be like in them.

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.010
And I wondered if
you could give us

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:39.220
a peek into what the cities of
Los Angeles and New York you

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.490
think will look like for
these women in their 50s.

00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:45.280
Well, thank you.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.070
I don't know if it's
brave or foolish.

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:50.656
But maybe it's brave.

00:59:50.656 --> 00:59:52.780
And also full disclosure,
I have not read that much

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.670
since the election.

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:59.110
There are things I have to
work out first as far as,

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.920
Yeah, I just have to work
out a lot about will we

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.020
be able to breathe outside.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.460
Will there be an
atmosphere for us.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:13.500
But one thing that I
have been thinking about

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.600
is that not all of
my characters are

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.570
at the same place, class wise.

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:19.320
And that does make a
difference in the way

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.610
that their lives are lived.

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:25.110
And for instance,
one of my characters

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:30.090
moves away from LA and lives in
the Midwest and an unnamed city

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:36.190
and is trying to
start a movement

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:42.230
to create like a new kind of
Midwest urbanism that is not

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:44.090
reliant on the coasts.

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:46.040
And not in the way of
like coastal elites,

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.750
but in this is where--

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.400
I'm interested in people
who call themselves makers

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.330
and what that means.

01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:59.040
And how that's a sort of
dangerous kind of distinction

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.420
to make.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.129
And so she is a person
who is maker centric.

01:01:03.129 --> 01:01:05.170
And she's like, this is
part of the country where

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:05.910
we make things.

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.560
And these people
don't make anything.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.120
And she's sort of interested
in like a grassroots level.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.700
Not necessarily seceding from
the other parts of the country,

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.964
but really she has a blog.

01:01:17.964 --> 01:01:20.130
And she's not a good writer,
but none of her friends

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:22.480
tell her that because
they love her.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.740
Where she where she kind
of explores these things.

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:33.150
But as far as one of the
things that I'm exploring now

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:36.030
is also just how
people identify.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:39.280
So is this group
of women in 2015,

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.430
they would sort of
consider themselves black.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:47.220
And then in 2035 that is
not necessarily the case.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:53.100
And the same as how
on every census,

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.530
the options for
ethnicity change.

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.270
What are these new boxes?

01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:01.020
And how are they negotiating
these opportunities

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.897
for recategorization?

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.250
- OK.

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:11.950
Have we given Angela enough of
a workout with our questions?

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:16.350
That was very generous to
answer so many of them.

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:20.660
I'd like us to thank Angela
for a wonderful talk.
