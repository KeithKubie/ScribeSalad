00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
my early work was the breakthrough which

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610
my early work was the breakthrough which
 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.619
my early work was the breakthrough which
is probably as famous as this this was

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
is probably as famous as this this was
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.629
is probably as famous as this this was
given boy this with a magnetic resonance

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
given boy this with a magnetic resonance
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.520
given boy this with a magnetic resonance
and there's a create an equation named

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
and there's a create an equation named
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.799
and there's a create an equation named
after me is called the carpus equation

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
after me is called the carpus equation
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.349
after me is called the carpus equation
and so my life has been a combination of

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
and so my life has been a combination of
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.009
and so my life has been a combination of
breakthroughs about the might every five

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
breakthroughs about the might every five
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.870
breakthroughs about the might every five
years or so and maybe this will come up

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
years or so and maybe this will come up
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.660
years or so and maybe this will come up
later again I try to do something new

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
later again I try to do something new
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.749
later again I try to do something new
and so I've had breakthroughs at various

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
and so I've had breakthroughs at various
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.420
and so I've had breakthroughs at various
times during my life and what was

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
times during my life and what was
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.670
times during my life and what was
selected for the Nobel Prize is pretty

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
selected for the Nobel Prize is pretty
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.580
selected for the Nobel Prize is pretty
arbitrary and so it's a little hard to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
arbitrary and so it's a little hard to
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.700
arbitrary and so it's a little hard to
say that what was the breakthrough I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
say that what was the breakthrough I
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.709
say that what was the breakthrough I
mean what they cite actually is

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
mean what they cite actually is
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.889
mean what they cite actually is
something that I personally don't think

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
something that I personally don't think
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.410
something that I personally don't think
with a breakthrough but it's sort of a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
with a breakthrough but it's sort of a
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.610
with a breakthrough but it's sort of a
little part of the important aspect of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
little part of the important aspect of
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.450
little part of the important aspect of
what I and now many thousands of people

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
what I and now many thousands of people
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.200
what I and now many thousands of people
who use the same methods have done
