00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The first thing we did in order to model the zigzagging oscillation of the brake pressure

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
was to create this perimeter called brake change.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Just for simplicity,we set the initial value of brake change to zero.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you move down to the far loop, you can see that brake change

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
alternates between having a value of 1 and -1.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If the wheel slip falls below the constant low slip, then the brake change value switches to 1.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And as soon as the wheel slip passes high slip, they change, switches signs, and becomes -1.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
An expression for b after the next times step

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We've ensure that b will not drop below zero

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
by setting zero as the minimum value that it can take on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Then using this min method right here, we are assuring

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that its magnitude will not exceed max brake.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
However, anywhere in between zero and max brake, it will take on this value right here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We take the value of b at the previous step and add it to the step size times brake change,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
which is either you're going to make this a positive or negative quantity

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and multiply that by the hydraulics speed.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Remember that hydraulic speed is just the rate of change of the strength of the brake.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
To visualize what we've done, let's look at our plots.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This bottom graph shows how the brake strength changes with time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Just as we hoped, we see that our line either has a negative slope or a positive slope,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but of the same magnitude just alternating signs.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
These changes in sign correspond to the flip in the sign of brake change.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The crest of the brake strength curve are points at which brake change

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
switches from being positive to being negative.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We see that the brake change switches to -1 if the wheel slip exceeds the value of high slip

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and if you look at the corresponding values in wheel slip, you see that these points of transition

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in brake strength corresponds to the highest values in wheel slip

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and the lowest value in wheel slip which we can see signals a switch in brake change to +1

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
correspond to a change in the sign of the slope of brake strength from negative to positive.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Zooming out and looking at these plots as a whole, they say that the wheel slip is controlled very nicely

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but the value of b does oscillate very strongly

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and this would look pretty stressful for the brake mechanism.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What we would want instead would be a value of b that will be close to the correct value.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
One option for this would be to limit the range of b by holding the pressure constant

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
or keeping the value of b constant then b gets either too large or too small.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's try that out by making a small change in our code for just a second

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm going to comment out this line and instead infinite this line.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Our original line of code kept the value of b between 0 and max brake.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We are now going to replace those respectively with 100 and 150

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so b is going to be within a much smaller range of values.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now, let's see what happens with this change.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The first thing that I noticed when I looked at this is that as you would expect

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the graph of the brake strength, it doesn't look like it will

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
put much strain and stress in the braking system as our previous system did.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The wheel slip also still stays within a very nice range and their car does come to a complete stop.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Despite the improvement that this would allow, it will require some additional knowledge

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that may be difficult to find.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We have to be able to project a reasonable range for b depending on current road conditions

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and we also have to measure the hydraulic pressure of the brake.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
There are cheaper options that we could consider such as looking at the deceleration of the wheel

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to decide when to stop increasing or decreasing the pressure and to hold the pressure constant instead.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I hoped you enjoyed this brief introduction into the intricacies of actuators with the speed dynamics.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Unfortunately, this is the end of our work for now with cars and braking systems.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We're moving on to something very exciting, wild fires.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I know that playing with fire is risky, but luckily we are doing all that on computers

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
so we don't really have much to worry about.

00:03:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Get ready for some very interesting problems and great job on this unit.
