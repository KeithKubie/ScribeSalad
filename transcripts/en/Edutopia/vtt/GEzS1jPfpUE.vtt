00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:18.376
&gt;&gt;Craig: When I first started
here 11 years ago, we were slated

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:21.246
to be closed, because we were not
meeting our annual yearly progress

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.396
that was expected of us by
the District and the State.

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:27.306
&gt;&gt;Amrita: We had some of the
lowest-performing test scores

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:30.516
in the City, and declining
enrollment.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.586
&gt;&gt;Craig: So we knew something
had to be done, and the staff

00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:36.586
and the administration got
together and we decided to put

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:38.956
in place an extended
learning time program.

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:52.836
It was really all about
giving children

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:55.766
that extra time on their academics.

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.596
We wanted to see what
the students can do

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.626
if they could experience
extra-curriculars

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:01.876
that were really important to them.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.966
So we gave them a whole bunch of
things to buy-into in an effort

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.956
to really attend to
these test scores.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.776
And in the end, we saw our test
scores really start to skyrocket.

00:01:41.616 --> 00:01:43.566
&gt;&gt;Amrita: A student at the
Edwards Middle School goes

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.836
through several classes within
the course of our day here.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:50.006
On Monday through Thursdays our
school is from 7:00 to 4:30.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:51.956
And on Friday's, it's a half-day,

00:01:51.956 --> 00:01:54.966
and we have professional
development every Friday afternoon.

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:59.426
Through the normal day, a child would
have four core 60-minute classes

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:04.656
in ELA, Math, Science and Social
Studies, and one specialty class.

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:07.856
And then when we launched the
expanded learning part of the day,

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:11.256
the student will go through a
one-hour academic intervention

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:15.586
course, follow by a two-hour
enrichment or electives program.

00:02:16.576 --> 00:02:18.916
What we do is we look at
student data very carefully.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:21.276
We get teacher input as
well as student input.

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:25.496
And we look at what is it that is
going to help drive this student

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:28.936
to the next level within
ELA, Math or Science.

00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:33.136
&gt;&gt;Doc: In my Academic League,

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:38.746
which is part of the extended
learning time, I work with core group

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:41.856
of students who are
there for remediation.

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:47.816
And here this is where I
pay individual attention

00:02:48.086 --> 00:02:49.706
to specific students.

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:54.306
I have done this for the
last six years with kids,

00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:59.236
and I have seen growth in these kids,
because I have them in the morning,

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:02.176
and I have them in the afternoon.

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:04.926
&gt;&gt;Amrita: Our students have
a unique opportunity here,

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:08.506
where we give them the choice
to drive the enrichment classes

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:11.256
that they want in the afternoons.

00:03:11.706 --> 00:03:15.606
And so we believe that the
enrichment classes support students

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:20.016
in finding their talents,
working with peers, and being able

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:21.846
to express themselves creatively.

00:03:23.076 --> 00:03:27.606
Our Enrichment to Time includes
electives, such as ballet,

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:30.156
step, musical theater, chorus.

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:32.846
And we have several
arts-based classes.

00:03:32.936 --> 00:03:34.116
A lot of athletics.

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:44.046
&gt;&gt;Sasha: I joined Stepping
and I love it,

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:47.526
'cause it gives me the
opportunity to express myself.

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:53.476
In a way, I do feel a connection
between my stepping and learning

00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:54.756
in class with Doctor Mansaray.

00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:58.056
Because I'm having fun while
doing stepping, and I'm learning,

00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:01.896
and then in class with
"Doc," I am having fun

00:04:01.896 --> 00:04:03.986
and learning at the same time, too.

00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:08.346
&gt;&gt;Doc: Extended learning
time is essential.

00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:15.006
It builds a school community that
will excel, not only in academics,

00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:19.066
but also socially the kids feel safe.

00:04:19.336 --> 00:04:21.666
They know that the
adults care about them.

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:26.376
&gt;&gt;Felix: Before I transferred here,
I used to get in trouble a lot.

00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:29.646
But like when I came to
Edwards, it was different

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:33.446
because everybody was focused,
and more serious about their work.

00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:36.426
So I found that there was
no point of acting out,

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:39.796
and to take the work seriously
so you can be successful in life.
