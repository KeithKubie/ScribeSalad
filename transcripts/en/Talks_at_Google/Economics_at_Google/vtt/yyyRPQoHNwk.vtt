00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.340
DAVID BARRY: Heather Boushey
is executive director and chief

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.520
economist at the Washington
Center for equitable growth.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.320
Her research focuses
on economic inequality

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.390
in public policy, specifically
employment, social policy,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.990
and family economic well-being.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.520
And her latest book, from
Harvard University Press,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.230
"Finding Time The Economics
of Work Life Conflict."

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.570
The New York Times
has called Boushey one

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.790
of the most vibrant
voices in the field.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.250
And Politico twice named her
one of the top 50 thinkers,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.110
doers, and visionaries
transforming American politics.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.640
Boushey writes regularly
for popular media,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.120
including "The New York
Times," Room for Debate,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.130
"The Atlantic," and Democracy.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.230
And she makes frequent
television appearances

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.270
on Bloomberg, MSNBC,
CNBC, and PBS.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.460
She previously served
as chief economist

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.830
for Hillary Clinton's
transition team,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.370

and Policy Research,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.020
and the Economic
Policy Institute.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.450
She sits on the board of
The Opportunity Institute,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.600
and is an associate editor
of Feminist Economics.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.030
She took her PhD in
Economics from The New School

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.690
for Social Research and her
BA from Hampshire College.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.047
Please join me in
welcoming Heather Boushey.

00:01:26.047 --> 00:01:30.171
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:31.420
Heather, thank you for coming.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.545
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Thank you.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:34.842
I always hate the bio
reading part at the event.

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:35.800
DAVID BARRY: I'm sorry.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.800
HEATHER BOUSHEY: No, no.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.740
It's always so like, oh golly.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.990
DAVID BARRY: Well, I thought
would jump Right into it.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.300
So you discussed
throughout the book,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.540
that the success of our economy
involves more than just success

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.450
in the business sector, which is
a little different than the way

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.720
most people, both in the
business community and outside

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.420
of it, think of the economy.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.400
Could you describe
for us your vision

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.010
of who the important
actors in the economy are,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.000
and what this more
comprehensive picture means

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.627
for how we should think about
assessing a successful economy?

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.460
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Yeah,
happy to start there.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.918
First of all, thank you so much
for inviting me here today.

00:02:11.918 --> 00:02:14.940
This is really fun and just
it's a pleasure to be here.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.420
And welcome to all of you.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.926
And so in the book, I
talk a lot about thinking

00:02:20.926 --> 00:02:22.300
about what's good
for the economy

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.090
and what we think actually
makes the economy grow.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.440
And a lot of times when
you talk to people,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.045
it really sort of transcends
political ideology.

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:34.420
When you talk to people about
what they think is actually

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.560
good for the economy,
you get this story

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.120
that is very much a
supply side story.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.580
It's about well, when costs
are low for businesses.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.890
When you know wages are low,
they can hire more people.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.715
Or if there's less regulations
that mean that businesses

00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:49.840
have to jump through hoops.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.480
These are all things that
allow businesses to grow

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.870
and that therefore is what we
need to do as policymakers,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.930
because that's what's
good for the economy.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.040
And that all may
be totally true.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.060
In fact, for any
individual business owner,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.894
those are actually very
important questions.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.601
You have to think
about your bottom line.

00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:10.100
You have to think about how
you're running your business.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.190
But when you step back
and think of the role

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.650
of what policymakers
need to be thinking about

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.540
or what economists
think about, you

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.710
have to think of not just that
narrow business perspective.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.510
That's just one slice
of the bigger picture.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.190
Right?

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.190
And so even sort of
thinking about the business,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.010
it's like, an employer has to
think about where they're going

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.450
to get talented people to hire.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.300
Those people don't just
emerge out of nothing.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.160
They're created by
families, they're

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.640
educated in schools, there's
all of these institutions that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.420
have to create that talented
labor pool for that employer,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.360
so that they can actually have
somebody whose wages they don't

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.627
want to go too high to pay.

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:50.460
They also have to think
about whether or not

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.794
there's consumers for
whatever it is they're making.

00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:55.210
And part of what businesses
do is try to figure out things

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.100
that people want to
buy, but they also

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.700
need people who
actually have money,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.783
they can buy those things.

00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:03.490
They need to have that
consumer base available.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.040
And that we're talking
a lot these days

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.940
about the role of
trade in consumption.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.902
So a one role a policy
has is whether or not

00:04:11.902 --> 00:04:14.110
we allow people from other
countries to buy our goods

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.500
or whether or not
we import them.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.829
That's a policy question
around consumption.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.920
But it's also around the
well-being of families,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.230
because families comprise
the vast majority

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.620
of end users of any of most
products produced in the United

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.810
States.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.149
So, when you kind of step
back and look at this bigger

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:33.565
picture, there's a lot of
things that firms don't control,

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.470
but that are about
the institutions,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.040
and the supply of people, and
consumer demand that sit around

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.290
what individual businesses do.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.831
So if you want to
understand actually

00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.390
what's good for the
economy, you have

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.190
to take that larger picture.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.450
So in the book I talk about it.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.420
That we need to think of
both families and firms.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.420
And both of their
roles in the economy.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.630
And the book is called Finding
Time, a lot of what it's about

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.290
is thinking about the conditions
under which people sell

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.020
their time to employers, and
the conditions under which

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.730
employers buy that time.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.825
How those two interact that
it's not just the business

00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:11.950
perspective, but that you
have to put both together

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.280
to really understand
what's happening.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.440
DAVID BARRY: So if we,
up until this point,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.160
haven't really considered the
family aspect of the economy,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.300
it seems as though our picture,
or our understanding of how

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.990
the economy actually
works, is pretty skewed.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.630
So what does this say about the
measures we're currently using

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.290
to judge our economy's health?

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.100
HEATHER BOUSHEY: That's
a great question.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.080
So there's two points I
want to focus on in that.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.310
One is that--

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.560
One of the things I really
struggled in with the book,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.330
and struggled in,
in terms of thinking

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.700
about how to advise
policymakers,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.846
is that when you
think about what

00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:55.720
we learn in economics,
what economic teaches,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.210
is so often the models,
I mean almost universally

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.010
the models start by thinking
about an individual's actions.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.570
How is it that an individual
will act in the economy.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.840
And that's an important
place to start.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.640
But the reality
is, that most of us

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.460
actually do the majority
of our consuming,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.100
and educating the
next generation,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.900
and even thinking
about labor supply,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.927
these decisions happen
inside families.

00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:21.510
And there's certainly economists
that have thought about that,

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.580
but that sort of hasn't
infiltrated everything

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.880
in terms of how we think about
what's good for the economy.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.980
So one, sort of starting place
for the question you asked

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.900
is that thinking about not
just for the individual,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.640
but opening it up to really
think about the family

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.110
side of the equation.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.540
To take a step back,
one of the things

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.320
that we watch every
quarter is the nation's

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.380
gross domestic product.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.880
Right?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.960
So that's the big
number that comes out.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.000
One of the most numbers in terms
of measuring our economy along

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.159
with, I would argue,
the employment rate

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.200
that comes out on the
first Friday of each month,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.630
and how our wages are doing,
and the income data that

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.920
comes out once a year.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.750
But we watch this
GDP data and we

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.710
think it means something
about our economy.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.210
Right?

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.080
So we know now that the US
economy produced $18 trillion

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.109
worth of goods and
services in 2016,

00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:18.150
which is the largest of
any country in the world,

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.566
and is probably
actually therefore

00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:22.350
the largest of any
country in any world ever,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.360
right, because we're
growing over time.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.680
But one question that
that doesn't answer,

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.410
that aggregate doesn't answer,
is, what does that actually

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.730
look like across families.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.730
What does that actually
look like across America?

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.640
And there are scholars who are
digging into this question,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.357
and sort of trying to understand
the connection between how

00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:43.440
well the economy is faring,
and what that actually

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.160
looks like inside families
all across the United States.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.250
And they're finding
that if you look

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.940
at economic growth
between 1980 and 2014,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.810
the US economy grew
by 61% for every adult

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.010
in the United States.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:04.590
So 1980 to 2014, 61% per
adult. But when you actually

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.110
match the data up
and look at what

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.320
that looks like inside
families, what you find

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.440
is that translates
into a 1% growth

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.910
rate for all adults living in
families making less than--

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.120
in the bottom 50% of
the income distribution.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.110
So the economy grew
by 61%, but families

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.290
in the bottom half,
people in the bottom half

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.970
saw a 1% gain over
that time period.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.070
While those at the top
saw these enormous gains.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.190
The top 1% saw
gains of about 204%.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.190
So when you open up and
you're not just thinking

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.240
about the business case.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.380
You're not just thinking
about the traditional measures

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.242
we use.

00:08:44.242 --> 00:08:46.200
You can get a deeper
understanding of what this

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.930
looks like across families.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.590
That number on what growth
looks like across income

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.090
distribution, is
very important when

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.520
you think about what that
means for consumer demand.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.120
So the economy is growing, but
most people aren't actually

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.050
gaining from growth.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.800
We can't expect them to be
increasing their consumption

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.930
year after year after year
unless they are taking

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.230
on more debt, which is something
I talk about, how that affects

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.420
family economic security.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.300
It also has implications for
the capacity for families

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.210
across the income
distribution, to be

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.610
able to educate the
next generation,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.014
to be able to provide the
health and well-being and all

00:09:24.014 --> 00:09:25.680
that we need that is
actually supporting

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.020
not only people, which
is certainly important,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.430
but supporting our
future labor supply.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.730
DAVID BARRY: Great, thank you.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.220
So yeah, so that leads kind
of to the next question which

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.300
is, one thing you make
clear throughout the book,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.300
is that the economics
of work life conflict

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.710
is not just a women's issue.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.400
It's not just an issue
for professional workers,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.510
or for low wage workers, really
it's an issue for everyone.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.704
What led you to that insight?

00:09:53.704 --> 00:09:55.620
And could you please
describe for the audience

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.470
briefly how you
segmented your analysis.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:04.580
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Yeah, so
you know for a long time--

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.930
I started out--

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.580
I'm an economist and
I came to these issues

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.850
because my primary research
interest is understanding

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.360
the well-being of America's
families, economic well-being.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.850
And so that's what I've
studied and sort of thought

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.640
about and over time one of
the most important trends

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.116
that we've noticed since
the 1970s that has affected

00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:26.490
American families, is a movement
of women out of the home

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.860
and into the labor force.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.670
It's had huge effects
on family income.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.597
It's affected the
time families had.

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:32.930
So that was sort of my initial--

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.415
it's like, oh wow, this
is the important thing.

00:10:35.415 --> 00:10:37.860
But when you think
about what that means,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.040
to have people change how
they spend their days,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.460
from spending it at home and to
spending it in the labor force,

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.340
that isn't just something
that affects women.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:46.840
Right?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.590
Certainly they're the person of
taking that different action.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.090
Right?

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.990
They're actually changing
what they're doing.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.360
But that actually then
affects everyone around them.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.190
It affects their partners.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.430
It affects their children.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.770
It affects their communities.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.970
It affects PTAs, League of
Women Voters, all the volunteer

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.910
things that women used to do.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.480
So it affects
community institutions.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.030
And it also affects care for
the aging and the elderly.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.410
So all the different
activities that American women

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.470
used to do when they were unem--

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.490
not being paid in the
labor force, but at home.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.930
As they've shifted their time.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.580
It has these broader effects.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.810
So that's, in a nutshell, why
this isn't a women's issue.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.210
I mean it just so happens
that women are the people that

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.180
change what they do.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.420
But it affects everyone.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.720
And understanding why they've
changed their employment

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.850
patterns, and what that
means for men, and children

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.266
and for families
and their income,

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:43.560
is really the focus of the book.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.010
I look at families.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.480
I divide them into three groups.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.130
I look at low income
families, families

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.950
in the bottom 30% of
the income distribution,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.980
professional families
which I define as families

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.770
in the top 20%, where at
least one person has a college

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:58.640
degree.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.180
So it's sort of
taking out families

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.060
that may be high
incomes but maybe

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.380
sort of either a self-made
or just a different kind

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.390
of professional experience.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.820
And then the middle is
sort of the middle 50%.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.644
So I talk about
what the economics

00:12:17.644 --> 00:12:18.560
are of those families.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.430
How they've shifted over time.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.519
And then look at them as
three different groups.

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:25.310
DAVID BARRY: Great.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:30.560
So I wanted to drill down a
little on each of the groups.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.500
So first, take for instance,
the group at the top.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.540
So what you call the
professional class,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.780
that is soaring above
and sounding the alarm.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.630
You, and I, and many
of us at Google,

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.310
are probably in
this category trying

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.760
to juggle work, family,
friends, and wondering

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.260
where fun fits in.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.890
But that's not really the
whole story for this group.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.960
Could you please describe
why the situation

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.890
for this group at the top,
indicates a larger problem?

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:03.182
HEATHER BOUSHEY:
Yeah, so yes I can.

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:05.390
So I also want to explain
the metaphor about soaring,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.098
but I'm going to get
to that in a minute.

00:13:07.098 --> 00:13:09.410
So just ping that and we'll
come back to that one.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.110
So when you look at what's
changed for families over time

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.014
and this transformation of
how women spend their days.

00:13:15.014 --> 00:13:17.180
What you see is, of course,
in professional families

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.780
and I'm guessing
many of us in here

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.960
have a sense of this, is that
families at the top typically

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.620
now have both men and
women in the workplace,

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.090
and no one at home full time.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.290
So they have these two incomes
but still no one at home

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.750
to provide all the things
that families need.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.901
You know, care for
children, the elderly,

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.400
waiting home for the cable guy,
whatever it is that families

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.990
need somebody to do.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.070
And we hear a lot about
these families in the media,

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.180
more so than I think the middle
and the low income families,

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.580
because that way of living
can be incredibly stressful.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.940
Our world isn't really set
up to have no one at home.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.650
And so we hear a lot in,
especially on the style pages,

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.380
or in not necessarily always
on the business pages which

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.940
is where I think
it should often be,

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.370
but we hear about the
struggles that families face.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.180
And fundamentally, it's that
there's a squeeze on time.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.640
And so I think once you sort
of think about it that way,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.340
and you start sort of
watching this conversation

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.690
that we're having as a country.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.970
So much of it is that
families are really

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.430
stressed out because they're
squeezed for time, even

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.050
at the top.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.160
Because money can
purchase some things.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.620
It can purchase prepared meals.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.240
It can purchase childcare.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.870
But what it can't purchase,
is that family meal together.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.370
Right?

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.700
If you actually
want to spend time

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.741
with your children, or
your spouse, or your loved

00:14:36.741 --> 00:14:39.350
one, or your ailing mom,
like you actually still need

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.340
that time to do that.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.400
And how to juggle that, when
you have two careers that

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.389
often take up very long hours.

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:47.930
So I talk a lot in
the book about how

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:54.290
we need to recognize what
long hours do to families,

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.010
and what the lack of access
to paid time off, paid family

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.970
leave, paid both parental
and family caregiving

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.740
leave, and access to high
quality affordable care means.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.910
And that even for
families at the top who

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.050
can afford to outsource child
care, elder care whatever it is

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.960
that they need, there's
still that stress and anxiety

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.890
around it.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:17.390
Yeah.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.370
DAVID BARRY: Sure.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.040
So then yeah.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.000
Like take a look at the
lower end of the spectrum

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.820
now, the stuck low
income families.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.960
So this group has
struggled for some time.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.490
Have you noticed that something
has changed for this group?

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.860
And compared to the
group at the top,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.810
is there something that's not
getting enough attention here?

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:40.922
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Yeah.

00:15:40.922 --> 00:15:42.380
Well, in the book
I try to actually

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.559
lay out some parallels
between how we think

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:46.850
about the challenges for
professional families, and how

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.570
that also--

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.892
how you see similar challenges
for low income families.

00:15:49.892 --> 00:15:51.350
Of course, they
look very different

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.350
because of resource constraints,
in low income families.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.890
But one commonality is that
low income families also

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.920
don't have a full time
stay at home caregiver.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.850
Just like families at the top.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.540
But they're doing it
typically with one--

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.509
disproportionately they have
one caregiver, one parent.

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:10.800
If it's a family with children.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.520
So they have one parent
and that parent also works.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.610
So they also were struggling
with the time constraints,

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.350
that families at the
top are, but they're

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.420
doing it on one
earnings, you know,

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.700
rather than two, which
families at the top have.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.830
So that's sort of one
commonality, where

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.040
I think we could be thinking
about the challenges

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.530
that low income families
face, and how that--

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.610
other solutions that might
hit both kinds of families.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.985
Is sort of one of the things
that I'm always looking for.

00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:38.737
How can we actually get
to some sort of action.

00:16:38.737 --> 00:16:40.820
So one of the things that's
changed for low income

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.210
families, of course, over
the past half century,

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:51.360
has been this movement away
from stable family structures.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.190
So it used to be that
the probability of having

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.140
two parents and a
stay at home mom

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.150
was much more similar
across families top, middle,

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.460
and bottom.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.700
Certainly when we laid out
the basics of our nation's

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.619
social insurance and labor
protections in the 1930s,

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.410
It was a case that the
majority of families

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.050
looked like that, sort of
that traditional family,

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.227
even if they were
low income families.

00:17:14.227 --> 00:17:16.310
And one of the things
that's been well documented,

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.750
is that alongside
rising inequality,

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.910
you've seen this rising
disparity in family structure.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.859
And so families at the
bottom, increasingly

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.599
have unstable families.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.910
Families that are mixed,
divorce, remarriage,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.600
and the like.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:36.350
And that is both chaotic, but
too often leaves families still

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.200
with no one at home
to provide care,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.070
but still having
insufficient income.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.760
So that's one big change.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.227
The second of course, is
that jobs are changing.

00:17:46.227 --> 00:17:47.810
And what you've been
seeing especially

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.730
among low income
families, is an increase

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.830
in scheduling unpredictability.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.600
So alongside the fact that
incomes for low income families

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.990
pretty much haven't
grown since 1979,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:04.610
you've seen this increase in
scheduling unpredictability.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.176
Which makes it
hard to figure out

00:18:06.176 --> 00:18:07.550
how you're going
to go to school,

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.190
or juggle childcare, any of
the things that you need to do,

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.398
if you actually don't know
what your schedule is more

00:18:12.398 --> 00:18:14.090
than a few days in advance.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.894
So that's one thing, and
then third, of course,

00:18:16.894 --> 00:18:18.560
is the lack of income
growth that you've

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.300
seen for families at the bottom,
even though they have they

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.190
typically have this earner.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.400
And in fact, for
low income families,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.460
if you hadn't had that
increase in women's labor force

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.180
participation rates, and
the added wages of women,

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.000
family income would have fallen
much further than it actually

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.880
did between 1979 and 2014.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.010
DAVID BARRY: Your last
group is the middle class.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.800
You used stalled middle class
the way that you describe it.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.310
What struck you most about this
group when you looked at them?

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.410
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Well,
it's the biggest group.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.140
In the-- and this is sort of
the sword stuck and stalled

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.760
kind of metaphor.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.890
In the book, I talk
about the middle class.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.940
And I'm from Washington state.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.460
I grew up near Seattle.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.660
And in 1980-- and a lot of my
data started in 1979 so about

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.070
the same time--

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.600
Mount St. Helens blew up.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.300
And that's a fact, we all
know that that's true.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.652
But as an economist, one of
the most important charts

00:19:22.652 --> 00:19:24.110
that you look at
if you're thinking

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.651
about the well-being
of family income

00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:28.830
is this rise in family
income over time.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.660
And if you look at it
between 1947 and 1979,

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.020
you see this straight up
increase in family income.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.930
Just kind of like rising up at a
45 degree, it's not 45 degrees,

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.600
but rising up pretty
sharply, very nicely.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.240
Kind of like moving up the
side of a beautiful mountain.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.170
Right?

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.595
And then after 1980,
the chart changes.

00:19:48.595 --> 00:19:51.699
So instead of going up, it sort
of kind of has this flatness,

00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:53.240
and it's kind of a
little bit craggy.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.230
And basically, every time
I look at that chart,

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.780
I think of Mount St.
Helens blowing up.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.000
It looks like the top is
just blown, been blown right

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.830
off America's middle class.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:06.200
And so that's what I think
is basically happened.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.110
And one thing I talk about in
the book was an analysis that I

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:14.360
did, is that were it not for the
increase in women's labor force

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.540
participation and the
increasing women's earnings,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.610
that family income which
for the middle class

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.930
has grown by about 12% between
1979 and 2013 or 2014--

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.270
I can't remember actually
what year the data stops--

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.590
but about then, about 12%.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:36.050
Had it not been for the added
hours and earnings of women,

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.110
that small increase that
middle class families saw

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.510
would have actually
been a decline.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.930
So it's only because of the
added labor force participation

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.480
of women, that you actually
see any increase at all

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.540
in middle class
incomes, since 1979.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.487
So those families,
just like families

00:20:52.487 --> 00:20:55.070
at the top and the bottom, are
struggling with the same issues

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.420
with the lack of time.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.470
Women are working more.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.900
Families don't have that full
time stay at home caregiver

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.890
anymore.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.490
But the world has not
really adapted to this.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:08.180
So crazily, we live in a
country where schools still

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.670
shut down for months at
a time, leaving families

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.896
having to negotiate summer care
and all these sorts of things,

00:21:13.896 --> 00:21:16.520
even though you don't have-- we
don't sort of live in a farming

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.220
community, more where
that makes a lot of sense.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.470
But that's just sort of one
kind of tip of the iceberg

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.660
example of all the ways that--

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.505
the fact that families
need the income of women,

00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:28.130
at the top, the
middle, and the bottom.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.580
That they're struggling
with this lack of time.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.210
That we haven't really
integrated into our thinking,

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.406
well how do we help
families cope with this.

00:21:37.406 --> 00:21:39.030
And then of course
throughout the book,

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.740
I talk about well, there
are economic implications

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.460
of not addressing this.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:44.960
Right?

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.750
Because even though
families are working more,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:52.490
they're doing so in a way that
they're really struggling.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.840
And there are potential
downsides to the economy,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.050
the lack of income growth
affects consumption and demand,

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.730
and the way that
we're failing to think

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.000
about the full gamut
of labor supply issues

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.060
means that we are actually
suppressing labor supply more

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.800
than we need to be, both
now and really risking

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.310
the next generation.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.180
DAVID BARRY: Great, thank you.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.540
And so you propose a
number of policy ideas

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.310
to address these
challenges, and you

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.160
point to states or cities
that have already implemented

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.010
and laid the foundation
for these policies.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.040
Are any of these policy ideas
in particular, gaining momentum

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.150
either at the state and local
level, or at the federal level?

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.840
And are there any other policy
ideas that you didn't mention,

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.350
that you hope a state or local
area might experiment with?

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.630
HEATHER BOUSHEY: I love the
focus on state and local.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.370
That's fantastic.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.520
When I started
working in this area,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.410
I started doing the
work around work life

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.350
issues in the mid
aughts, and at that time

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.900
we had to look a
lot abroad for ideas

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.220
and for what was happening.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.040
By the time I finished the
book, there isn't a single idea

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.080
that I talked about in
there that isn't actually

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.024
in place somewhere in America.

00:23:03.024 --> 00:23:04.440
Which every time
I think about it,

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.580
kind of gives me chills, because
it's an area of policy where

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.640
we've made a lot of progress
over the past decade in states

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.440
and communities.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.410
And I think it's one
bright spot where

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.836
we've really pushed forward.

00:23:17.836 --> 00:23:19.710
And I don't think that
gets enough attention.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.344
So I'll talk about--

00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:23.010
I'll get to some of
the state and local.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.190
Let me sort of lay out
just that the big vision.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.970
I divide the policies
into four groups.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.570
And they're easy to
remember because it rhymes.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.017
So there are policies for
here, there, care, and fair.

00:23:36.017 --> 00:23:37.350
It's kind of cute, but whatever.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.850
It helps me remember
it, so I know I

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.330
can like organize my thoughts.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.550
So we need policies for
when we're here at home.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.690
So policies around paid
family and medical leave

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.652
and paid sick days,
in particular.

00:23:47.652 --> 00:23:49.110
You all are very
lucky, because you

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.570
live in the state of California,
which is the first state

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.590
to have implemented statewide
paid parental and family

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.370
leave, on top of a long standing
individual disability insurance

00:23:59.370 --> 00:23:59.920
program.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.700
There are now four states that
have paid family medical leave.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.410
District of Columbia
has just passed it

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.240
and now we have to wait,
because we are not a state,

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.980
we have to wait for Congress
to determine whether or not

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.870
we can actually go
forward with the law

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.800
that we democratically passed.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.162
But that's a different
lecture on states' rights.

00:24:16.162 --> 00:24:18.120
And so there are places
that are moving forward

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.745
on paid family medical
leave, and there

00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:23.400
are dozens of places that have
implemented paid sick days.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.010
I know you all here at Google
have access to paid sick days,

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.426
when you get sick
and have the flu

00:24:27.426 --> 00:24:30.084
and you can't come into
work, but the majority of,

00:24:30.084 --> 00:24:32.250
especially of low wage
workers in the United States,

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.130
do not have access to
any paid time off at all,

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.730
let alone the right to stay
home when they have the flu.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.110
So that's the
first area, and one

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.810
where we've seen a lot of
really exciting movement

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:44.160
at the state and local level.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.430
And in fact in
November, two states

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.840
move forward on paid sick
days for their states,

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.500
requiring that employers provide
five to seven days of paid

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.480
sick days.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.070
The second, is that
we need policies

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.430
for when we need to be
there at work, not at home.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.650
And to make that
work for families--

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.450
and here in that
bucket I put things

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:07.860
like predictable
scheduling, making sure

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.640
that we have adequate overtime
protections, and protections

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.280
for part time workers,
and also the right

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.180
to request flexibility.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.340
So in the United States
today, less than one

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.010
in ten, far less than one in
ten private sector workers

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.810
are represented by a union.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.370
And millions of
people don't even

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.650
have the right to ask
their employer if they want

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.221
to have a flexible schedule.

00:25:30.221 --> 00:25:32.220
And millions of people
don't know their schedule

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.140
more than a few days in advance.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.685
Now I often don't know my
schedule more than a few days

00:25:36.685 --> 00:25:39.060
in advance, so this also
happens to professional workers,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.102
but we're paid a lot more money
than folks that work in retail

00:25:42.102 --> 00:25:43.560
or in food service
you have to deal

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.143
with unpredictable
schedules, but have

00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:47.650
to do it on a lot less income.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.700
So these are places where
the legislation that we

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.310
have at the federal level,
the Fair Labor Standards Act,

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.810
it says nothing
about these issues.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.130
I mean it says something
about overtime,

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.880
but it doesn't say
anything about overtime

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.940
for people that
are not production

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.550
workers, or salaried
workers, that you know,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:06.240
which is a lot of us that
have no protections at all.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.930
So we need to rethink what does
the economy look like today,

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.780
and how can we support families.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.240
We need policies
around care, that

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.800
provide safe, affordable,
and enriching options

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.110
for care for children,
but also increasingly

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.510
the aging of the elderly.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.790
There are very few
options for people

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.850
barring selling down
all of your assets

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.120
when you get older, to
provide some of the services

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.854
that many older folks need,
so that they can age in place.

00:26:38.854 --> 00:26:41.520
And we haven't spent enough time
as a nation really figuring out

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.500
actually how to
address that, let alone

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.260
making sure that folks
have access to health care.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.200
And then finally,
the fourth bucket

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.590
is issues around fairness.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.695
Really making sure that as
we think about this basket,

00:26:52.695 --> 00:26:55.070
making sure that these policies
are available to both men

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.750
and women.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.950
That we're not discriminating
along the lines of gender

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.450
or anything else, because it's
the case that in a world where

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:05.000
most women are in
the workplace, that

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.850
means almost every employee
at some point in time

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.850
will have some reason that they
need flexibility or time off,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:11.720
to provide care.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.710
Be it for a child, or for a
friend, or for an aging parent.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:20.180
And it's really important
to remember that for men,

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.090
not only is it really
important that they're there

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.430
in the early days of
having a new child.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.217
Be it that through adoption
or becoming a new parent,

00:27:28.217 --> 00:27:30.800
that there's a lot of evidence
just how important that time is

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.090
not just for moms but for dads.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.820
But it used to be that if
a man's mom or dad fell

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.710
ill and somebody needed
to take care of her,

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.680
he had a stay at home
wife that could do that.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.230
And of course now that's not
the case in most families.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.240
And so both men and
women are having

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.540
to deal with needing
the flexibility to care

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.770
for an aging population.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:55.730
And so really making
sure that we're not--

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.280
that we're recognizing that
this is a universal problem, not

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.640
just a problem for some people,
when they have new children

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.620
is really an important
piece of the puzzle.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.430
So, a little bit
on state and local.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.190
So as I said, there's been some
great work around family leave

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.059
and paid sick days.

00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:13.850
You know California
has also been a leader.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.000
San Francisco has been a
leader, especially in issues

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.250
around predictable scheduling.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.150
So there's some
legislation that's

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.640
now in place in San
Francisco, around that

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.890
and a number of other
places in the country that

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.430
requires employers to give
notice on what an employee

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.480
schedule is.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.280
There's also a lot
of economic evidence

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.990
that policies like
that are actually not

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:37.260
just good for the employee, but
they're also good for business.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.770
So in much of the book as I
talk about this policy agenda,

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.250
I spent a lot of time digging
through the economic evidence,

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:46.850
to show that these policies
can improve labor supply, they

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.210
reduce employee turnover,
they increase retention,

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.110
they can stabilize demand.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.920
That all of this is a
part of this conversation.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.860
So it's not just
about the family piece

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.440
and how this is a nice
thing to do for people,

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.230
but that this basket
of policies, there

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.210
is just reams of
economic evidence

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.000
that would fill this
room, that makes the case,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.512
that there are strong
economic benefits to doing so.

00:29:10.512 --> 00:29:11.970
DAVID BARRY: I
think we can open up

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.684
to the audience for questions.

00:29:13.684 --> 00:29:16.100
AUDIENCE: So I think there was
a lot of interesting policy

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.430
advice but what about individual
professionals such as ourselves

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.770
for balancing work and life.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.960
What advice would you give us?

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.520
HEATHER BOUSHEY:
Oh, OK Well golly.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.540
That's a tough one.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.270
I assume that you
put in long hours

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:33.650
I think that for individuals--

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.950
I mean so-- it was the
for ourselves part, that's

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.450
kind of tripping
me up a little bit,

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.810
right, because there's people
who work for good employers

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.999
where they have good benefits
and feel that they can ask you

00:29:44.999 --> 00:29:47.040
know-- they can go to
their manager and say, hey,

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.530
I need a little
bit of flexibility,

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.320
or I'd like to rotate
my schedule a little bit

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.390
and leave you know early
on Thursday afternoons

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.130
because I've got my kids'
soccer games or whatever.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.980
But the reality is
it's so you know

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.530
the majority of American
workers actually don't even

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.930
have the right to do that
without fearing for their job,

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.090
that it's hard to give
advice sort of generally,

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.673
when I know that there's people
that may be watching this that

00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:10.260
don't actually work at Google.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.890
But I think to kind
of flip the script

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.690
and go and think about from
the manager's perspective,

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.790
I think one of the
most important things,

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:20.900
if you are a manager and
thinking about these issues is

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.710
recognizing that ultimately,
at the of the day,

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:27.950
your goal presumably is to get
productive work out of these--

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.480
out of your employees.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.930
And there's just a lot of
evidence that providing people

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.430
with the flexibility
that they need,

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.554
and the time off they need
to recover, to make sure

00:30:36.554 --> 00:30:38.780
that their kid
recovers from the flu,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.370
all can be
productivity enhancing.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.960
And all can do a lot
to reduce job turnover

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.210
and increase retention.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.720
A number of years ago a
colleague of mine and I

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.430
looked at all the
good studies we

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.790
could find on the
cost of job turnover,

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.390
and what that looks like
across the wage spectrum.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.200
Because you hear
like, oh yeah well,

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.760
job turnover can
be very expensive

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.640
if you have a very
important employee that you

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.500
have to replace
but for those line

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.970
workers, or those
retail workers,

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.178
it's nothing, it doesn't
matter like cost of turnover

00:31:10.178 --> 00:31:11.630
is really low or something.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.640
You sort of here that
in the common discourse.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.931
So at any rate, we looked at
every study we could find,

00:31:15.931 --> 00:31:18.314
and this was maybe almost
like eight years ago

00:31:18.314 --> 00:31:20.480
that I did this so I'm sure
there's new studies that

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.730
have come out but, of all
the studies we could find,

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.850
we found that if you
look across people--

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.700
and again this was a while ago--
but people were paid from like

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.949
$20-$30,000 a year all the way
up to about $75,000 a year,

00:31:31.949 --> 00:31:34.490
which in today's dollars would
probably be closer to about 80

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.320
or 90.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.630
The cost of
replacing an employee

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.950
was about a fifth of that
employee's annual salary.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.970
So as a manager, really
thinking about the fact that,

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:50.210
hey this person just wants
a little bit of flexibility,

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.030
and maybe they won't be
more productive this week,

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.940
but if the difference
between keeping

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.330
that employee for another
year or six months and not.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.940
That actually has enormous
savings for the corporation.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.250
And you know, too often,
that calculus of those costs

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.860
don't seem to be sort
of worked in to some

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.087
of these line manager
thinking, at least

00:32:13.087 --> 00:32:14.170
according to the evidence.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.010
So yeah, so that's some
advice I have for you

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.190
AUDIENCE: Can you also
talk about how expectations

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:27.670
of Americans in terms
of possessions, wealth,

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.940
average house size, which
has gone up I think something

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.050
like 1,000 square feet
in the last 30 years,

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:40.000
ownership of stuff
has also fueled this.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.550
I feel like at times we're
putting this on ourselves

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.910
with the expectations we
now have collectively.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.500
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Yeah
it's a great question.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.940
So there's an economist from
Cornell named Robert Frank has

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.969
written a lot on consumption.

00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:55.510
And so some of what
I am going to say

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.750
is stuff that I guess
that I learned from him.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.930
It's a really important point.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.270
One of the things
that economists

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:07.000
are learning about inequality,
like what does inequality

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.920
do to our economy
and our society.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.080
One of them is
that you see people

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.540
trying to keep up with the
next rung just above them.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.530
So there is this sort of these
consumption patterns start

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.840
to get ratcheted up because
there's this catching up

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.710
kind of phenomena that happens.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.650
And then there's also
of course especially

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.140
over the past few decades,
an increased availability

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.540
of debt instruments that
are available to anyone,

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.340
that just were not available
30, 40, 50 years ago.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:34.840
Right?

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.020
So we all have credit cards, but
also just the ability to get--

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:42.550
to have access to so
much ways of getting debt

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.860
that can boost consumption.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.720
And debt's really interesting
because if your income keeps

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.680
rising, super easy to pay off.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.270
Right?

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.400
And so if you're optimistic,
well in five or 10 years,

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.840
I'm going to be making
more so I can pay off

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.464
that mortgage or I
can pay off that car

00:33:57.464 --> 00:33:59.930
or whatever, then that can
be a good way of closing

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:01.510
a short term gap.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:06.490
But in a world where people
are trying to sort of keep up,

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:09.639
or where they feel that
they need to get that better

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:12.310
home no matter what size
it is in that better school

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.560
district because the
United States has this,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.900
I'm sorry but
completely wacky way

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.360
of funding education,
public education, where

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.070
it's based on tax
dollars in communities,

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.480
so that richer communities
have better schools.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:26.980
Right?

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.800
That creates enormous
pressure especially

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.320
in an era where it's
harder and harder

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.732
to get into the best colleges.

00:34:33.732 --> 00:34:35.440
It creates enormous
pressure for families

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.710
to spend more than they need, to
kind of get to that next place

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.199
and then you've got these
debt instruments, mortgages,

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:44.840
and other that make it a lot
easier for families to do so.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.540
Of course we've
learned, and we're

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.750
all I believe older
than the age of eight

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.199
so we all lived through
the financial crisis

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:57.280
and know the vast, horrible
repercussions of the nation's

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.430
where too many families have
been relying on debt in order

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.590
to make ends meet.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.556
So I mean, embedded
in your question

00:35:04.556 --> 00:35:06.430
is how to change people's
perceptions of what

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:07.750
the good life is.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:11.500
And I think that's a
really important question.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.950
One sort of, one caveat I
want to go back to a stat

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.810
that I said at the near the
beginning of the conversation,

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:21.220
which is that between
1980 and 2014,

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.190
the US economy has grown
by 61% for every adult.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.460
That's a pretty nice
increase in growth.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.530
But the bottom half of
the income distribution

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.870
saw a 1% increase.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.720
So I hear you that
there's a lot of folks

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.730
and I think certainly
in the middle

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:40.190
to very top that are in this
escalation of consumption,

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.810
that for the vast majority
of American families,

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:45.370
I think they are
probably rightfully

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.770
frustrated that
somebody is getting

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.540
the money from the
gains at growth

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.430
and it certainly is not them.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.040
And so, how much are
people using debt

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.180
as a way to compensate?

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.450
Like oh, I'm sure I'll get
that pay out next year.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.010
I don't know and I
can't speak to that.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:03.730
But I do think that
these are twin problems.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:09.580
And one certainly that it would
be good to keep talking about

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.010
AUDIENCE: Question
on the policy on pay

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.680
for care and other things.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.190
How do you prevent people
from abusing the system?

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.070
HEATHER BOUSHEY: For
like paid family leave?

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.053
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Yeah, so
that's a great question.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:28.210
So first off, what you
have here in California

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:31.210
is this longstanding temporary
disability insurance program

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.280
and there is a agency
that administers that

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.640
and you know ensures that if
somebody says that they're

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.040
sick, it has to be verified.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.660
So there's rules in
place to verify it.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.580
And when you add the paid
family and parental leave,

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.800
I mean it's super easy
to verify whether or not

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.980
somebody has a child, has a new
child coming into their family

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.992
through adoption or birth.

00:36:52.992 --> 00:36:55.500
But for the care, like
care for the elderly,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.510
or care for someone
who is seriously ill,

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:02.076
it can be a little bit more
difficult to verify that.

00:37:02.076 --> 00:37:03.450
The federal law
that we have that

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.970
provides unpaid leave, which
is the Family and Medical Leave

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:11.005
Act, has a verification
process in it.

00:37:11.005 --> 00:37:13.410
And the way that they do
it, is that your employer

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.970
is because you are
absent from work,

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:19.034
so the employer is the one that
knows that you're not there.

00:37:19.034 --> 00:37:21.450
The employer has the right to
ask you for a doctor's note,

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.680
ask for some verification.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.600
They don't have to, but they
have the right to do that,

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.470
to insure.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:34.360
So if we moved to a federal
paid family leave, family

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.080
medical leave
program, we can learn

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.099
from what's happened in the
States that already do that.

00:37:40.099 --> 00:37:41.640
So we could learn
from what, you know

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.730
how they make sure that people
comply here in California,

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.200
and in the other states
that have that program.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.140
New Jersey, New York,
and Rhode Island.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.223
And we can learn from what
we know from the Family

00:37:51.223 --> 00:37:53.130
and Medical Leave Act.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:56.520
I will say also, there's
a lot of incentive

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.920
on the part of
employees to not lie

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.740
to their employer
about important things.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.710
Again, the vast majority-- the
share of private sector workers

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.470
that are represented by a
union that have job protection,

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.890
is 7%.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.400
So the vast majority
of American workers

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.310
don't have the right
to keep their job.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.920
And while they may get
the right to this benefit,

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.190
employers certainly
have a lot of leeway.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:22.770
Somebody is going to lie to you
about this is probably not--

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.450
there may be other
performance issues,

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.820
so I actually have a high
degree of confidence,

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.740
that the research
that we've seen

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.330
that shows that there isn't
a great degree of lying about

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.610
the-- around issues
like around leave,

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.430
is because most people are
honest with their employers,

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:40.680
because they know that if
they aren't a good employee,

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.280
that they can lose their job.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.540
So I think that, in and of
itself, is probably the best--

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.690
we already have this really
great defense against people

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:51.460
abusing the system.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.090
AUDIENCE: I know the
universal basic income

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.600
is a big thing globally
and potentially locally

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.760
as well, I mean does that change
the equation of the groups

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.360
or any of these circumstances?

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.060
HEATHER BOUSHEY:
It's a good question.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.790
I always hear a lot about
universal basic income

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:09.730
when I'm in California.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:10.688
It's fun to talk about.

00:39:13.064 --> 00:39:14.730
So it depends, I mean
so I think there's

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:15.840
a lot of different
ideas, like when

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.370
you say that it's like
one of these tests.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.260
What do you mean when
you say that, right?

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:24.140
So one vision is that we
would give every American

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.580
a check for some amount of
money and so it wouldn't really

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.290
be really we're
placing any benefits,

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.420
it would just be some sort
of dividend for everyone.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.000
Another vision
and it's certainly

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.200
what the United States thought
about, the Nixon's family

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.100
assistance program
from the 1970s,

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.980
which was a basic
income guarantee,

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:46.350
was a way of really providing
a basic income so that everyone

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.290
in America would not fall
below some threshold levels.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.590
So you could set some level
and say OK if you're poor,

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.450
you know here's
this basic income.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.480
So I think that might more
interact with policies

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.032
around welfare, or food stamps,
or the Earned Income Tax

00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:03.990
Credit, probably actually
the Earned Income Tax

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.170
Credit, mostly would I
think be mostly affected

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.720
if we started to think about
a universal basic income

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.990
as a basic income for folks
that don't have a lot of income.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:18.780
And so I don't know so I
think it really-- that to

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:23.010
me really is more about that
basic standard of living,

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.830
whereas a lot of these policies
aren't so much about folks

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.930
that don't have enough
to make ends meet

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.090
or who aren't working.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.710
This is an agenda
for how does it

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.317
that you make sure that you can
actually get people to work,

00:40:34.317 --> 00:40:36.150
and get them to work
in a way that's healthy

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.220
and they're productive
and they're ready to go.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.970
And so conceptually, I think
it belongs in a different box.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:42.470
Right?

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.136
Because even if you
have a basic income,

00:40:44.136 --> 00:40:47.880
that's not going to solve some
of your work life conflicts.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.249
So, yeah.

00:40:49.249 --> 00:40:50.790
AUDIENCE: So I was
interested to hear

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.250
that a lot of the policies
that you describe in your book

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.210
are being tried
in various states.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.510
So it's nice to have lots
of little experiments.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:00.000
What would you say about
the strength of the evidence

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.220
for the different policies?

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.689
And for the ones that have
really strong evidence, what

00:41:04.689 --> 00:41:06.480
are the big things that
are preventing them

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.160
from being more widely adopted?

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.620
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Yeah,
that's a fun question.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.640
Some of them don't
have any evidence,

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.790
very much yet because the
policies are very new.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.520
So I would say on the stable
schedules legislation,

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.970
we don't have evidence yet.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.620
And in fact my organization
the Washington Center

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.441
for Equitable Growth, we
give grants to scholars.

00:41:24.441 --> 00:41:26.940
And we've been thinking a lot
about the scheduling stability

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.430
piece, and how we can study
that and learn more about it.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:34.410
And we've funded a pilot study
that a couple of our scholars

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.930
did with the gap, to
understand their move

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.040
toward stable scheduling.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.040
And we've learned a lot.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.664
We're learning a lot from that.

00:41:41.664 --> 00:41:43.080
The gap is actually
felt that it's

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.147
been quite effective, in
good for profitability,

00:41:46.147 --> 00:41:47.230
and good for productivity.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.620
And they've actually moved
forward on the policy.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.510
So we have some evidence
from some employers,

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.850
but we don't have
evidence from a policy,

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:58.329
from a state or local
government yet on that issue.

00:41:58.329 --> 00:41:59.620
There's two I want to touch on.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.240
One is on the child early
childhood development,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.730
and one on paid leave.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.380
And so on paid
family medical leave,

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.230
we actually know quite
a bit about California.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:14.340
There were some in-depth
studies done in California

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.210
around the implementation of
the paid family medical leave

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.710
program here.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:25.020
And so we know, for example,
that 90% of employers

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:29.610
in this survey reported that the
implementation of paid family

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:31.350
medical leave here
in California,

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.870
actually had no effect
or a positive effect

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:36.252
on profitability
and productivity.

00:42:36.252 --> 00:42:36.960
That they didn't.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.900
So only 10% reported
any downside at all

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.640
to the implementation.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.120
We also have good evidence on
what it did on the effects--

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.280
on how it boosted
family incomes.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.530
We also know from that
research that a lot

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.230
of people who are eligible for
paid leave here in California,

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.520
haven't taken it.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.470
Disproportionately those
are low income folks

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.330
who don't have job protection.

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:01.410
So the paid-- so the federal
Family Medical Leave Act,

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.220
gives you job protection to
take up to 12 weeks of leave

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.410
to care for a new
child, an ailing loved

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.880
one, or your own illness.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.620
Only about 60% of
the labor force

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.590
is covered, however, because
if you haven't been at your job

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.650
long enough, or if you work
for a very small employer

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.877
you're not covered,
among other reasons.

00:43:18.877 --> 00:43:21.210
So a lot of the folks that
didn't take it in California,

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:22.230
they didn't do it
because they were

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.580
afraid of losing
their jobs or being

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.820
punished by their employer.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.580
So that's a really
important data point.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.030
So we know a lot from
California and Equitable Growth

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:35.562
has also funded some work
looking at other states.

00:43:35.562 --> 00:43:37.020
So we're learning
a lot from what's

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.311
happening in Rhode Island,
New York and New Jersey that

00:43:39.311 --> 00:43:41.867
have implemented that program.

00:43:41.867 --> 00:43:43.950
Paid sick days, which I
wasn't going to talk about

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:45.780
but since I'm here
in California.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.910
San Francisco was one
of the first places

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:49.560
to implement paid sick days.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.230
And economists
went in and looked

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:56.942
at what the outcome was on
employment, in San Francisco

00:43:56.942 --> 00:43:58.150
and the surrounding counties.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.800
Because one of the
arguments was, OK,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.734
if you give people the
right to earn up to,

00:44:02.734 --> 00:44:04.900
I believe it was seven days
of paid sick days in San

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.620
Francisco, then that'll
be a job killer.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.120
Right?

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.950
Obviously, people are going
to get laid off for that.

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.491
That was the argument
that you heard.

00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:12.670
And in the book I
have some great quotes

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:17.090
from employers who said that
before the legislation passed.

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.660
But what these
economists found was

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.750
that actually after the
legislation was put in place,

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:26.770
employment in San Francisco
grew faster than the surrounding

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:28.990
five counties in
like a year or two

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.030
after the implementation
of the policy.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.610
And I am in no way saying that
the implementation of paid

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:37.240
sick days caused the
greater employment gains.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.580
But it's a very difficult
threshold then to make

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.340
the argument-- and this has been
replicated in other places--

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.798
it's very difficult to make
the argument that giving people

00:44:44.798 --> 00:44:47.800
paid sick days pulled down jobs.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.914
When in fact, what
happened was the opposite.

00:44:49.914 --> 00:44:51.830
And this has happened
in other places as well.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:55.840
We have a similar study
in Seattle and in DC.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.930
And then on early
childhood, there

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.780
is overwhelming
evidence at this point

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:07.030
that not attending to
the years between 0 and 5

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:11.260
has lifetime implications
for children.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.290
And again going to the economic
angle to our future labor

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:15.260
supply.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.400
So we knew that the skills that
children enter kindergarten

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.585
with, and the gaps
between children

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:22.210
that have skills and
don't have skills,

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.690
stay with them over a lifetime.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:25.970
And it's very difficult,
if not impossible,

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.810
for later educational
interventions to really make up

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:31.600
for those this early gaps.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.850
And yet we live in a
world where most women

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.054
have their first child
before the age of 26.

00:45:36.054 --> 00:45:37.720
Young people don't
have a lot of income.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.160
They don't have access
to high quality care.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.832
And we do virtually nothing.

00:45:41.832 --> 00:45:43.540
We do some things for
very poor families,

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.760
but we're not doing anything
for the vast majority

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.640
of middle class families who
are really struggling to provide

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.170
that high quality care.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.729
There is probably
no other investment

00:45:52.729 --> 00:45:54.520
that we could make in
America's future that

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.500
would have as big a
bang for the buck,

00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.072
as investing in universal
child care and universal Pre-K.

00:46:00.072 --> 00:46:01.780
AUDIENCE: The second
part of the question

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:08.110
was for policies like child
care policies, what's preventing

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.456
their adoption more widely?

00:46:10.456 --> 00:46:11.830
HEATHER BOUSHEY:
Right of course.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.210
The grumpy part of the question.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.160
Where, you know, the why
isn't that happening?

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.004
So yeah, of course this is so
great, why isn't it happening?

00:46:18.004 --> 00:46:19.420
So I mean I will
say a few things.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:23.192
I mean one is that you've seen a
lot of employers moving forward

00:46:23.192 --> 00:46:25.150
in implementing these
policies, where they can.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:28.660
So that's a sign that people
are getting the message on this.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.280
Not nearly enough
and not across all

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.640
of their workers, which
I think is a problem.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.870
Second, I do want to stress that
this is one area where you've

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:42.110
seen really remarkable social
change over the past decade.

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:48.162
So even amidst a lot of
lack of progressive movement

00:46:48.162 --> 00:46:49.870
in places around the
country on policies,

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.190
this is really a bright spot.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:55.420
We've implemented universal
social insurance programs

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.730
in four states, in
the past decade, which

00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:59.170
is an amazing accomplishment.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:03.490
So, and then it's passed
and a couple of others

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:04.960
but hasn't been implemented yet.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.390
So I think that there is
a lot of forward momentum.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:08.590
And then all the
places that have done

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:09.800
paid sick days and the like.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.950
And places like DC
and other places that

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.650
have universal Pre-K. We
have free universal Pre-K

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.490
in the District of Columbia.

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.920
So I think that's positive.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.230
At the federal level,
I mean certainly what

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:23.240
you see is these
issues, like all issues,

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.240
have been affected by the
continued polarization

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.320
and gridlock.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.290
But what I will say is that
the 2016 campaign cycle

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:32.950
was the first one where you saw
presidential candidates on both

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.200
the left and the right
come out in favor

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.950
of pieces of this agenda.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:41.085
So you had Marco Rubio,
Republican Marco Rubio,

00:47:41.085 --> 00:47:42.710
who came out with a
paid leave program.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:46.750
You had Secretary Clinton
who had a full agenda on all

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:47.890
of these issues.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.350
You had Bernie Sanders who
signed onto the Family Act,

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.360
to provide paid
family medical leave.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.970
And you had now
President Trump who

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.280
came out with policies
around child care

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.560
and maternity leave
during the campaign.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.930
And then on Tuesday in
his speech to Congress,

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.670
actually talked about
paid family leave

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:04.780
and paid parental leave.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.560
So and he-- and I actually
can't remember if he--

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.620
I believe he also mentioned
childcare is a part of his tax

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.560
program as well.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.580
So you're actually seeing
these bubbling up and getting

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.200
traction across the aisle.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.980
So I actually think of all
of the different policy areas

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.525
that I can work on
as an economist.

00:48:22.525 --> 00:48:23.900
I actually think
this is probably

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.680
one of the most hopeful ones,
where there is a greater,

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.080
the greatest potential
to really see

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.960
the kind of transformational
change over the next decade,

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.330
because you've seen
it in so many places.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:38.340
So, and then why hasn't
it moved as quickly.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.860
I actually think that
it's been good to see

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.620
these policies implemented
at the state and local level,

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.470
so folks like myself and people
I work with could actually

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:50.350
take the time to study
it, and know what works

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:53.050
and what doesn't, at the
laboratories of democracy

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.370
kind of idea.

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:55.870
And I think we're
getting to a place

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.880
where we know so much
about some of these,

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.590
that we really are ready to
move those at the federal level.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:02.320
So we will see.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.986
I'm not terribly
optimistic that these

00:49:04.986 --> 00:49:06.860
are going to be prioritized
by this Congress,

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.710
but hope springs eternal.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.280
AUDIENCE: Have you studied the
opposite phenomena of families

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:21.560
trying to combine a quality care
and more time for the family

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:26.510
by moving out of
the salaried work

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:30.835
place into consulting or
even into to home child care.

00:49:30.835 --> 00:49:32.210
HEATHER BOUSHEY:
So when you look

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.800
at the overall trends
in labor supply,

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.640
you see a flattening off since
the late 1990s for both men

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.140
and women.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.514
Of course there
was the deep dive

00:49:40.514 --> 00:49:43.000
during the Great Recession,
and then bubbling back up.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.400
But the United States now
has lower labor supply

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.627
than most of our economic
competitors in the OECD.

00:49:49.627 --> 00:49:50.960
We used to be among the highest.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.590
Now we're among the lowest
for both men and women.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:57.380
So that may be kind of
connected to your question,

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:01.430
that folks are unable to sort
of deal with the conflicts

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.080
around work and life, you know.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.100
I tell in the book a lot of
stories of people in their 50s,

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.680
in later life who end up
dropping out of the labor force

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.720
to care for an ailing
parent, and then

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.654
find it really difficult
to get back in.

00:50:13.654 --> 00:50:15.320
So maybe they do part
time work, or they

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.320
take on some consulting,
or some bits and pieces.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.342
The stories-- I
mean I think what

00:50:20.342 --> 00:50:22.550
I see because a lot of that
is happening at the lower

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:26.840
end, at the middle to
bottom, it's less about, oh,

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.190
this is great for me.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.530
It's more about, oh well,
this is really all I can do,

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.260
given my situation.

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.090
And because I can't find an
employer that will be flexible.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.730
So I think there's a
negative story there.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.230
But I think certainly,
and this gets

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.390
to the question over
here about consumption,

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.460
you certainly see
some conversations

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.470
at the top about how
much families need,

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:48.230
and can they downsize, and
can they kind of pare back

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:51.740
to deal with some of
these care issues.

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.370
And I don't think you--
so you don't see a pulling

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.930
back in labor force
participation,

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.480
but you see a leveling
off of the increase.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.250
So it may be that
those folks that,

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.040
were we to have this
kind of policy agenda,

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.020
might actually increase
their labor supply,

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.100
aren't actually doing so.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.420
So that's an effect as well.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.539
But it's not actually a
pulling back, but a flattening.

00:51:11.539 --> 00:51:12.830
DAVID BARRY: Right, well great.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:14.560
Thank you everyone for coming.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.450
Thank you, Heather.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:15.740
HEATHER BOUSHEY: Thank you.

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:16.640
DAVID BARRY: For coming
to Google, great.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.348
HEATHER BOUSHEY: This
is very fun thanks.

00:51:18.348 --> 00:51:21.920
