TRAVIS KALANICK: Uber is
everyone's private driver.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.490
So get out your
smartphone, push a button,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.360
and in just a couple minutes
a car arrives and takes you

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360
wherever you want to go.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.470
Taking the physical analog world
and turning it into digital

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.170
is really, really interesting,
And turning the digital world

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.190
into physical, where you're
pushing a button and a car

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.500
moves also has its challenges.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.440
We like to say
Uber, at its core,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.230
is sort of atoms
and bits, right?

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.210
Or maybe sometimes we
say bits and asphalt.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.820
And where a lot of the
interesting technology

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.670
we have and interesting
operations we have

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.510
is in translating those bits
into atoms or vice versa.

00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:03.230
First, you have to have taste.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.670
You to know what it is you want.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.210
But then you have to be
incredibly fierce to make sure

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.550
that a company of hundreds or
sometimes thousands of people

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.250
doesn't start taking the
vision off of the tracks.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.200
I mean, everybody means well,
but there are so many ideas,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.150
and you have to refine
into the best ones.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.360
And there has to be a
product vision behind it.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.400
And there has to be
a strong aesthetic.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.890
And then you have to just
be hard core sometimes.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.690
You have to be fierce
and you have to say no.
