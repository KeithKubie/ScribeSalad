[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.510
I've always been fascinated by
movie and TV show directors.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.380
Frankly, shooting movies
seems like a lot of fun.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.740
The idea that you're in
control of your camera,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.380
framing each shot, and
creating an evocative scene

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.320
really inspires me.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170
I'm Ankur Kotwal, and
I'm going to show you

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.300
that as Maps Developers, we
have the same creative direction

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.696
over UI.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:31.720
We get to build our map scenes
and create evocative user

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.860
experiences.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.940
The Maps API provides a
very sophisticated camera

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.420
that enables you to frame
your maps in three dimensions.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.250
It's got the capabilities you'd
expect, such as projection,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.770
zooming, and panning.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.120
But additionally, you can
rotate, tilt, and animate

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.240
the camera.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.400
Now imagine if your
favorite TV show was filmed

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.530
using only panning and zooming.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.370
The impact of the scene would
be significantly reduced.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.560
The director just wouldn't
have used their full tool set.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.940
So here's a map.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.550
It's what you've seen many
times before, top down,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.260
projecting a certain region,
at a predetermined zoom level.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.520
Boring.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.120
Now let's take a
look at the same map

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.740
and adjust its
rotation and its tilt.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.250
Now it feels like much
more of a real place.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.150
We get a greater sense
of depth, like there's

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.950
a bigger world out there.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.490
This map evokes a
much stronger emotion.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.480
For me, it's a
sense of curiosity,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.685
to explore what
else is out there.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:27.310
When directing the camera for a
house hunting app, for example,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.530
the map can be presented
in a way that shows

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.002
more of the surrounding area.

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.960
There's a beach out there,
some hills this way,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.910
and a national
park out that way.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.760
Let's go to the next house.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.780
You'll notice that the camera is
animating to the next location.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.580
During this journey,
we're effectively

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.300
flying over the area.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.490
The position isn't the
only thing that's changing.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.520
There are subtle changes to
zoom, to rotation, to tilt.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.180
And once again, we get
a strong sense of depth,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.890
and a feeling of exploration.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.880
This is crucial in
house hunting scenarios,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.970
since it's all about location.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.800
Camera projections and
animations are powerful tools,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.900
and you should consider
using them for your tool set.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.300
Be sure to check out the
bearing and tilt methods

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.169
on the camera position
builder in your code.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.910
Transitions from one
camera position to another

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.670
should be animated,
not snapped to place.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.750
So remember, as a
camera director,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.620
it's important to frame
your shot in order

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.670
to evoke the desired emotion.
