[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.570
&gt;&gt; President Clinton, I'm campaigning against
female genital

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.570
mutilation.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.570
&gt;&gt; Good for you.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.570
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.689
&gt;&gt; I won the Davos Debates to get into --

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:18.689
&gt;&gt; You did?

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.689
&gt;&gt; I did.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:20.689
&gt;&gt; Where are you from?

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.509
&gt;&gt; I'm from London. I was out in Ethiopia
last year so --

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.449
&gt;&gt; You know, when I was President and Hillary
went on a terror against

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.220
this -- it's very interesting, when I went
to Africa in '98 I went

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.600
around to meet all these people that she had
helped to mobilize, and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.840
one of the most interesting things was going
to the villages and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.170
countries where she had worked to meet with
the women and the few men

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.140
who had supported the women and campaigning
against female genital

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.149
mutilation.
It's a great cause.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.149
I'll follow up.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.149
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.090
&gt;&gt; Bless you.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.260
&gt;&gt; My heart is going.
That was fantastic.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.739
He's promised to follow up.
He said it's a fantastic cause.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.420
If I can get into the Clinton initiative,
that would be wonderful.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.660
And I think had will follow up, so that's
great.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.660
