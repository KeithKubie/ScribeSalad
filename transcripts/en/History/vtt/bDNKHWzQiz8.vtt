00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.880
NARRATOR: An estimated
40% of Americans

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.330
are descended from
immigrants that

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.540
passed through Ellis Island.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.790
That's a lot of Americans.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.210
The first Ellis Island
immigration station

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.040
opened on January 1,
1892 in New York Harbor

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.170
to manage the increasing number
of migrants coming to America.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.000
In that first year, a record
number of nearly 450,000 people

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.250
passed through to enter
the United States.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.330
By the time Ellis
Island closed in 1954,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.080
that number had
reached 12 million,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.500
although most of those
people arrived by 1924.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.080
Migrants fleeing
poverty and persecution

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.040
or just looking to
start a new life

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.380
traveled by private
steamship from Eastern

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.580
and Southern Europe.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.250
Voyages could take
one to two weeks.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.920
Ships divided passengers
by wealth and class.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.670
First- and
second-class passengers

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.170
slept in state rooms and
cabins while everyone

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.880
else stayed in a
space at the bottom

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.710
of the ship called steerage.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.790
Steerage passengers paid
around $30 per ticket,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.380
but steamship companies
would sell as many tickets

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.880
as they could.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.790
First- and second-class
passengers paid even more.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.620
Because of this,
steerage was often

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.380
overcrowded and unsanitary
with shared sleeping

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710
compartments and no privacy.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.790
But hopeful immigrants
stuck it out,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.620
believing it would be
worth it for a chance

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.460
to live in the United States.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.960
When ships finally arrived
in New York Harbor,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.710
health officers boarded and
looked for signs of disease

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.620
before anyone was
allowed to disembark.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.790
Healthy first- and
second-class passengers

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.790
were processed on
the spot and allowed

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.790
to enter the United
States without setting

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.080
foot on Ellis Island.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.500
Everyone else waited,
sometimes for days,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.830
for small ferries to take
them to the immigration

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.000
station for processing.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.790
Migrants walked
down the gangplank

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.500
with all of their
belongings and dropped

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.790
their bags in the baggage
room on the ground floor.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.170
They then continued
up a winding staircase

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.170
to the Registry Room, which
was upstairs for a reason.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.830
Doctors stood on
the second floor

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.000
and watched each
person climb the stairs

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.330
for signs of health problems.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.170
The Registry Room,
nearly 20,000 square feet

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.500
with 56-foot-tall
vaulted ceilings,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.500
was nicknamed the Great
Hall for its size.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.380
It was here that most migrants'
fate would be decided.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.170
The first step to entry was
a six-second physical exam

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.330
by a uniformed doctor.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.380
Anyone considered a
risk to public health

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.040
was marked with a piece of
chalk and taken out of the line

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.000
to be examined further.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.880
Marks were given for everything
from signs of mental illness

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.380
to trachoma, a
contagious eye infection

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.000
that could eventually blind
up to 3/4 of those infected.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.880
Those who cleared
the medical exam

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.710
went on to a legal inspection.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.500
Passengers were checked against
a manifest from the ship they

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.040
arrived on and
asked 29 identifying

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.040
questions, often with the
help of an interpreter.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.120
If their answers didn't
match the information

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.790
on the manifest, things
like their name, occupation,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.580
and country of origin,
they could be detained.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.750
The legal interviews could
take as little as two minutes,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.500
and the vast majority of
people passed through with ease

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.040
and were allowed to enter the
country after being issued

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.080
landing cards with their
name, often misspelled,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.830
and destination.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.830
For others, the stay on Ellis
Island was considerably longer.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.210
The few who were detained for
either medical or legal reasons

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.500
could be on the island
overnight or for months.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.880
Once their records
were finally reviewed,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.750
they would either be
admitted to the US

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.750
or sent back to the country
they came from free of charge.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.210
But only 2% of the
12 million immigrants

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.750
processed at Ellis Island
were deported in this way.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.120
After inspection,
everyone continued down

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.920
a staircase with three aisles.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.380
Those being detained walked
down the center aisle.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.420
Those entering New York
City or headed north

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.380
walked down the left, and
those traveling west or south

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.960
walked down the right.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.620
At the bottom was a post
office, a rail ticket office,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.210
and a place to change money--

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.620
for some, family
waiting to greet them,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.080
and for all a new
life in America.
