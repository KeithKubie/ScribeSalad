00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.019
The correct answer is that a non-parametric test does not assume the data is not

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.770
drawn from any particular probability distribution. There's not

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.780
really any such thing as a non-parametric probability

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.360
distribution. This terminology non parametric really describes test

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.690
types or statistical methods. Assuming a non-Gaussian probability

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.400
distribution would still assume some probability distribution. And

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.340
finally, Welch's t-test is definitely not a non-parametric

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.100
test, since it assumes a certain underlying probability distribution so there's

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.120
no way that the non-parametric test is the same as Welch's t-test.
