00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.400
Here's an example component diagram.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.320
The rectangles with the two sub-rectangles on their side indicate components.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.450
This is one of Bouche's contributions to UML. He had

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.880
a diagramming type called Bouchegrams in which these particular icons were used.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.950
The stick figures represent in this case people or actors of the system, and

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.250
the dashed line indicates where components plug into other components.
