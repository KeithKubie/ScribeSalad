[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:43.990
AKMAL ABDELFATAH: Developing
sustainable cities

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.000
is one of the major concerns
for planners around the world.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090
Sustainable
transportation systems

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.180
add vital elements of
a sustainable city.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.040
Transportation planners
considered the [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.250
for public transportation
such as buses and light rail.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.270
And growth of private
transportation,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.080
such as passenger cars and
motorcycles as measures

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.630
of the level of sustainability
for a transportation system.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.060
Developing countries
that experience increases

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.040
in income level are also
witnessing high increase

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.550
in population and vehicle
restoration rates.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.590
For example, in Malaysia
there is an increase

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.370
of about one passenger car and
one motorcycle for each person

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.190
added to the population.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.480
Such an increase in
private transportation,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.580
is there a matching
in rate of increase

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.590
in public transportation system?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.280
In Malaysia, there
have been no additions

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.110
to the rail system over
the past few years,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.170
and only a very small
increase in bus registration

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.140
over the same period.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.020
For each 1000 persons
increase in population,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.280
there is an increase of
less than four buses,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.390
including private
buses and public buses,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.360
about 1000 passenger cars
and about 1000 motorcycles

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.630
added to the road network.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.070
So why should
transportation planners

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.050
worry about such a situation?

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.180
Because there are several
negative impacts, including,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.280
higher traffic congestion
levels, more air pollution,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.320
greater noise levels, and
increase in accident rates.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.120
The increase in
accident rates often

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.540
results in higher
fatality rates,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.820
which is the focus
of this presentation.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.220
What is a fatality rate,
and how it can be used?

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.800
The traffic fatality rate
represents the number

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.450
of deaths due to traffic
accidents put each 100,000

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.945
of population in any country.

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:33.360
It's one of the
major indicators used

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.290
to measure the level of traffic
safety on a road network.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.020
Most developing countries
have higher fatality rates

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.570
than developed countries.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.700
Malaysia has set its goal to be
among the developed countries

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.470
by the year 2020.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.740
However, the current
fatality rate in Malaysia

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.760
is much higher than all
developed countries.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.720
As shown in the illustration,
the fatality rate

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.670
in most of the
developing countries

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.880
is in the range of about three
to seven deaths per 100,000

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.560
people.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.050
In Malaysia the rate jumps
to approximately 25 deaths

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.670
per 100,000 population.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.430
Considering the countries
around Malaysia,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.630
it's clear that some
countries like Singapore,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.820
and Brunei have
fatalities rates that

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.670
are within the same range
as developed countries.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.420
On the other hand,
as you can see here,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.910
the fatality rate in
Malaysia is among the highest

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.280
in Southeast Asia.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.620
In fact, the fatality
rate in Malaysia

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.510
is about five times
the fatality rate

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.780
in the closest neighboring
country, Singapore.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.070
So, taking a closer look
at Malaysia's accidents,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.130
it shows that the percentage
of motorcycles involved

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.120
in accidents is about
1.5%, while the percentage

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.320
of fatalities among
motorcyclists is about 60%

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.960
of the total fatalities.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.790
What might be some reasons
for this high fatality

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.080
rate among the motorcyclists?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.490
One of the major problems
with motorcyclists

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.300
in developing countries
is that they often

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.500
do not follow traffic laws.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.760
They may ride between
traffic lanes,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.270
a stop on pedestrian
crossing area,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.540
or run a red light
at intersections,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.540
as you can see from the video.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.340
Such a behavior is an indication
of two main issues-- lack

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.019
of enforcement, and
lack of awareness.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.070
So what do
motorcyclists say when

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.050
they are asked about their
view regarding wearing safety

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.240
helmets, and their perception
of high rate of fatalities

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.870
among motorcyclists?

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.250
It appears from the
presented information

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.790
that most motorcyclists
in Malaysia

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.510
are not aware of traffic
and safety regulations.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.000
However, according to a traffic
safety expert, in Malaysia,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.950
the main causes of accidents
are-- road user incompetence

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.660
and driver fatigue.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.580
Road environment and vehicle
conditions are also mentioned.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.050
The driver's awareness of
traffic safety regulations

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.890
are not given
enough consideration

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.090
in the expert's opinion.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.381
MOHAMED SHAHARUDIN BIN LADEN:
During the implementation

00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:04.847
of a system, they found out that
50% of traffic offenders that

00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:09.842
are caught under the system
couldn't be [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:15.324
So this 50% is serious
loopholes in the implementation

00:05:15.324 --> 00:05:16.296
of the system.

00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:21.160
That's why, in November--
last November they

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.270
tried to enforce the
number of plates regulation

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.490
to ensure that the ES
system can work properly.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.440
AKMAL ABDELFATAH: So,
what are the efforts

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.770
by the Malaysian government
to reduce traffic accidents?

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.470
According to one
of the officials

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.220
in the Malaysian Institute of
Road Safety Research, MIROS,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.320
the following are
examples of the studies

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.350
to reduce traffic accidents
over the past 10 years.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.950
Automated enforcement
system implementation,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.910
such as using cameras
at intersections

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.190
to report traffic violations.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.600
Implementation of community
based program on safety helmet.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.890
Implementation of road
safety education in schools.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.760
New driver training curriculum
based on learning outcomes.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.800
However, these efforts to
reduce traffic accidents

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.160
and improve awareness
have not been

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.020
very successful at
achieving their objectives.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.250
The last two Malaysian national
plans, covering the period

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.840
from 2006 to 2015, do
emphasize the development

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.740
of the public
transportation system.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.220
However, these plans are
still being implemented.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.340
Officials have indicated that
there are studies regarding

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.950
fatalities and some
recommendations for reducing

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.130
accidents, especially
for motorcyclists.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.490
However, it seems that these
recommendations have not

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.730
had significant
impact in reducing

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.757
the motorcyclists fatality rate.

00:06:42.757 --> 00:06:45.090
MOHAMED SHAHARUDIN BIN LADEN:
Why I changed my workplace

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:53.780
probably because there's no
public transport mode that

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.790
can move me from
home to my workplace,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.030
so that my personal
experience why

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.930
I'm changing mode of transport.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:08.030
As for right now, as
speaking of our land

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.700
transport especially
in the big cities,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.240
I believe, yes,
they do have buses,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.670
but most of public
in big cities depends

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.572
on-- and that the commuter.

00:07:22.572 --> 00:07:28.030
The [INAUDIBLE] commuter is,
I believe it's overloaded.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.430
They cannot fulfill the
public demands on it.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.470
So the demand is sped up.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.710
So the sped up choice,
either mode of transport,

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.040
and I believe that
motorcyclists is

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.820
some of the most very
popular choice for motor

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.640
transport among big
cities commuter compared

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.961
to [INAUDIBLE] of course.

00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:53.960
AKMAL ABDELFATAH: The
following video shows part

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.600
of an interview with the
assistant director of the Road

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.260
Safety Department for Malaysia,
indicating some of the causes

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.064
of accidents and
suggested solutions.

00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:04.480
MOHAMED SHAHARUDIN
BIN OSMIN: It's

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.800
an offence for drivers under
the influence of drugs to drive.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.110
Even to sit in the
car is an offense.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:18.320
But there's a difference between
when the police enforce it.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.234
When the police find
out that drivers driving

00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:23.650
under the influence
of drugs, they

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:28.820
will be charged under something
related to drug possession.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:35.210
It's not road traffic
offences, but it's

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.570
related to drug offences.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.740
So it's a big difference
in terms of enforcement.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:47.030
And currently, there's
no region type of policy

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.780
to tackle this thing.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.560
For example, we do have
a continuous meeting

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.760
with the Ministry of
Works on the importance

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.620
of having dedicated motorcycle
lane to separate motorcyclists

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.270
from other road users.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.320
But the main issue,
whenever it came

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.910
to bid up the new dedicated
motorcycle lane, it's lost.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:17.004
So whatever causes the
obstacle, then it never can--

00:09:17.004 --> 00:09:21.463
as we are the Road Safety
Panel, so we cannot do anything,

00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:25.250
because it falls under the
Ministry of Work jurisdiction

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:32.410
that can build the
dedicated motorcycle lane.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.000
AKMAL ABDELFATAH: The following
are some short-term strategies

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.420
that can reduce the number
of traffic fatalities

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.300
among the motorcyclists.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.220
Enforcing stricter
licensing procedure

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.790
for motorcycles-- for
example, increasing

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.290
the age of receiving a
motorcycle driving license,

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.060
canceling some of the old
models of motorcycles,

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.280
and increasing
registration fees.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.850
Implementing higher
levels of enforcement

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.840
through the use of
technology-- for example,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.450
by using automated
systems at traffic signals

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.870
and for speed control.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.410
Such systems can reduce
the traffic violations

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.690
shown in the videos
in this presentation.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.340
Apply tougher penalties
for traffic violations,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.330
especially for motorcyclists.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.210
improve awareness
through campaigns

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:18.140
that educate motorcyclists about
traffic and safety regulations.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.930
In addition to these
short-term strategies targeted

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.510
at reducing
motorcycle fatalities,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.960
cities should also
make a concerted effort

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.270
to improve the public
transportation infrastructure,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.240
to ensure long-term
sustainability.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.690
What are the benefits of
having a higher [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.510
for public transportation?

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:42.540
It can result in lower delays,
less pollution, fewer accidents

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.850
and fatalities, and a more
sustainable transportation

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.670
system.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.160
What are the main deficiencies
in the public transportation

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160
system in Malaysia that
deter people from using it?

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.160
Primary drawbacks are the lack
of connectivity, low frequency,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.140
and less flexibility as
compared to motorcycles.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.282
INTERVIEWER: If there
is a good bus and rates

00:11:05.282 --> 00:11:07.410
that would provide
reasonable flexibility

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.386
and reasonably priced-- compared
with the price [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:12.386 --> 00:11:13.530
would he use that?

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.270
We know it's not
there in JB now,

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.630
but if that system would exist,
would that change his mind,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.462
or would he use it?

00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:24.883
INTERPRETER:
[SPEAKING MALAYSIAN]

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:34.710
MAN ON STREET:
[SPEAKING MALAYSIAN]

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.038
INTERPRETER: He would
choose-- yes, he

00:11:37.038 --> 00:11:39.040
says if the system is
there, he would just

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.430
use that [INAUDIBLE] system.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.780
INTERVIEWER: So what is the
most important thing for him

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.500
to see on that system to use?

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.440
What would be his
[INAUDIBLE] priority?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.230
Is it the cost or
the flexibility?

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.470
Is it the timing, the frequency?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.250
What is his most
important element

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.750
to use the public transport?

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.910
INTERPRETER:
[SPEAKING MALAYSIAN]?

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.170
MAN ON STREET:
[SPEAKING MALAYSIAN].

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.745
INTERPRETER: Time would be
his most priority-- time.

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:04.495
INTERVIEWER: Thank you
very much for that.

00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:04.850
MAN ON STREET: Thank you.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.391
INTERVIEWER: Appreciate
it very much.

00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:07.540
Thank you.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.498
MOHAMED SHAHARUDIN BIN
OSMIN: Under the purview

00:12:09.498 --> 00:12:13.830
of [INAUDIBLE] area, which
is under the jurisdiction

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.380
of Ministry of Transport,
Ministry of [INAUDIBLE],

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.150
and also Land Public
Transport Commission,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:27.510
there's a target of increasing
the number of public transport

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:32.530
in the market, where they
are promoting increasing

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.700
numbers of service--
for example, the taxi

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.030
numbers, the drivers numbers,
for example, this, for example.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:45.310
Right now, the focus is
increasing the service

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.480
to meet the demand.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.030
Because right now, the challenge
is that the public is eager.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.910
We believe that the
public's are willing to use

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.820
the public transport, but
the option is not there.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.560
AKMAL ABDELFATAH: In
light of that fact--

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.530
that the majority of
traffic fatalities

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.420
are occurring among
motorcyclists-- what

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.520
are some possible
long-term strategies that

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.250
can increase the use of
public transportation?

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.590
Which, in turn, may
reduce the fatality rate

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.340
among the motorcyclists
in Malaysia

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.530
and other developing countries
facing similar problems.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.330
Providing sufficient funds
can allow local authorities

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.270
to develop the public
transportation system,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.295
improving the
connectivity, frequency,

00:13:27.295 --> 00:13:31.140
and punctuality of public
transportation system.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.210
Utilizing intelligent
transportation systems

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.810
applications, such as
transit signal priority,

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.170
implementing an attractive
and fair pricing system

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.570
that can encourage people to
use public transportation,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.450
considering transit
oriented development

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.810
concepts for new developments.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.180
In conclusion, rapidly growing
cities in developing countries

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.810
have populations
that are growing

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.940
at a much higher rate than
their public transportation

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.820
infrastructure.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.930
This leads to an increase in the
use of private transportation.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.260
In cases where the percentage
of motorcycles is high,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.730
the cities witness a high
traffic fatality rate.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.120
The proposal strategies
in this presentation

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.390
can benefit these cities.
