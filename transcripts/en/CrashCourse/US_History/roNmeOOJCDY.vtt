00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.260
Hi I’m John Green; this is Crash Course US History
and today we discuss one of the most confusing
questions in American history:

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.020
What caused the Civil War?

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.640
Just kidding it’s not a confusing question at all:
Slavery caused the Civil War.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.920
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, but what about, like, 
states rights and nationalism, economics –

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.760
Me from the Past, your senior year of high school you will be taught American Government by Mr. Fleming, a white Southerner who will seem to you to be about 182 years old,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.200
and you will say something to him in
class about states rights.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.390
And Mr. Fleming will turn to
you and he will say,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.300
“A state’s rights to what, sir?” And
for the first time in your snotty little life,
you will be well and truly speechless

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.260
[Theme Music]

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.720
The road to the Civil War leads to
discussions of states rights...to slavery,
and differing economic systems...

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.700
Specifically whether those economic systems should involve slavery, and the election of Abraham Lincoln.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.860
Specifically how his election impacted slavery, but none  of those things would have been issues without slavery.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.260
So let’s pick up with the most controversial section
of the Compromise of 1850, the fugitive slave law.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:15.400
Now, longtime Crash Course viewers will remember that there was already a Fugitive Slave Law written into the United States Constitution, so what made this one so controversial?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.740
Under this new law, any citizen was required to turn
in anyone he or she knew to be a slave to authorities.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.660
And that made, like, every person in New England
into a sheriff, and it also required them to enforce
a law they found abhorrent.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.460
So, they had to be sheriffs and they didn’t
even get little gold badges.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.440
Thought Bubble, can I have a gold badge?
Oh. Awesome. Thank you.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.920
This law was also terrifying to people of
color in the North, because even if you’d
been, say, born free in Massachusetts,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.060
the courts could send you into slavery if
even one person swore before a judge that
you were a specific slave.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.540
And many people of color responded to the
fugitive slave law by moving to Canada,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.400
which at the time was still technically
an English colony,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.520
thereby further problematizing the whole
idea that England was all about tyranny and
the United States was all about freedom.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.540
But anyway the most important result of the fugitive slave law was that it convinced some Northerners that the government was in thehands of a sinister “slave power.”

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.100
Sadly, slave power was not a heavy metal
band or Britney Spears’s new single or even
a secret cabal of powerful slaves,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.400
but rather a conspiracy theory about a
secret cabal of pro-slavery congressmen.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.940
That conspiracy theory is going to grow in importance,
but before we get to that let us discuss Railroads.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.340
Underrated in Monopoly and underrated in
the Civil War. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.440
Railroads made shipping cheaper and more efficient
and allowed people to move around the country quickly,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.100
and they had a huge backer (also a tiny backer)
in the form of Illinois congressman Stephen Douglas,
who wanted a transcontinental railroad because

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.420
1. he felt it would bind  the union together at
a time when it could use some binding,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.460
and 2. he figured it would go through Illinois,
which would be good for his home state.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.860
But there was a problem: To build a railroad,
the territory through which it ran needed
to be organized, ideally as states,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.020
and if the railroad was going to run through
Illinois, then the Kansas and Nebraska territories
would need to become state-like.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.140
So Douglas pushed forward the
Kansas Nebraska Act in 1854.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.080
The Kansas-Nebraska Act formalized the
idea of popular sovereignty,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.840
which basically meant that (white)
residents of states could decide for themselves
whether the state should allow slavery.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.820
Douglas felt this was a nice way of avoiding saying whether he favored slavery;

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.660
instead, he could just be in favor of letting
other people be in favor of it.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.300
Now you’ll remember that the previously
bartered Missouri Compromise banned slavery
in new states north of this here line.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:36.620
And since in theory Kansas or Nebraska could have slavery if people there decided they wanted it under the Kansas-Nebraska Act despite being north of that there line,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.000
this in practice repealed the Missouri Compromise.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.680
As a result, there was quite a lot of violence
in Kansas, so much so that some people say
the Civil War really started there in 1857.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.440
Also, the Kansas Nebraska Act led to the
creation of a new political party: The Republicans.
Yes, those Republicans.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.580
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.340
So, Douglas’s law helped to create a new coalition
party dedicated to stopping the extension of slavery.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.940
It was made of former Free-Soilers, Northern
anti-slavery Whigs and some Know-Nothings.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.800
It was also a completely sectional party,
meaning that it drew supporters almost exclusively
from the free states in the North and West,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.020
which, you’ll remember from like, two minutes
ago, were tied together by common economic
interests, and the railroad.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.220
I’m telling you, don’t underestimate railroads.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.820
By the way, we are getting to you, Dred Scott.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.420
And now we return at last to “slave power.”

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.220
For many northerners, the Kansas Nebraska
Act which repealed the Missouri Compromise,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.340
was yet more evidence that Congress was
controlled by a sinister “slave power” group doing
the bidding of rich plantation owners.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.580
Which, as conspiracy theories go,
wasn’t the most far-fetched.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.800
In fact, by 1854, the North was far more populous
than the South – it had almost double the South’s
congressional representation –

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.360
but in spite of this advantage, Congress had just
passed a law extending the power of slave states,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.740
and potentially – because two new states
meant four new senators – making the federal
government even more pro-slavery.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.560
And to abolitionists, that didn’t really
seem like democracy.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.800
The other reason that many northerners cared
enough about Kansas and Nebraska to abandon
their old party loyalties

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.120
was that having them become slave states was seen
as a threat to northerner’s economic self-interest.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.360
Remember the west was seen as a place
where individuals – specifically white individuals –
could become self-sufficient farmers.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.840
As Lincoln wrote: “The whole nation is interested
that the best use be made of these territories.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.580
We want them for the homes of free white people.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.320
They cannot be, to any considerable extent,
if slavery is planted within them.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.640
New Free States are places for poor people
to go to and better their condition.”

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.520
So, the real question was: Would these
western territories have big slave-based
plantations like happened in Mississippi?

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.380
Or small family farms full of frolicking
free white people, like happened in Thomas
Jefferson’s imagination?

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.400
So the new Republican party ran its first presidential
candidate in 1856 and did remarkably well.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.140
John C. Fremont from California picked up 39%
of the vote, all of it from the North and West, and
lost to the Democrat James Buchanan,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.180
who had the virtue of having spent much of
the previous decade in Europe and thus not
having a position on slavery.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.620
I mean, let me take this opportunity to
remind you that James Buchanan’s nickname
was The Old Public Functionary.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.280
Meanwhile, Kansas was trying to become a state
by holding elections in 1854 and 1855.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.080
I say trying because these elections were
so fraudulent that they would be funny,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.040
except that everything stops being funny like
12 years before the Civil War and doesn’t get really
funny again until Charlie Chaplin.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:30.640
Ah, Charlie Chaplin, thank you for being in the public domain and giving us a much-needed break from a nation divided against itself, discovering that it cannot stand.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.760
Right so part of the Kansas problem was that hundreds of so called border ruffians flocked to Kansas from pro-slavery Missouri to cast ballots in Kansas elections,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.060
which led to people coming in from free states
and setting up their own rival governments.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.960
Fighting eventually broke out and more
than 200 people were killed.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.080
In fact, in 1856, pro-slavery forces laid siege
to anti-slavery Lawrence, Kansas with cannons.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.640
One particularly violent incident involved the
murder of an entire family by an anti-slavery
zealot from New York named John Brown.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.580
He got away with that murder but hold on
a minute, we’ll get to him.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.100
Anyway, in the end Kansas passed two
constitutions because, you know, that’s a
good way to get started as a government.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:14.100
The pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution was the first that went to the U.S. Congress and it was supported by Stephen Douglas as an example of popular sovereignty at work,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.560
except that the man who oversaw the
voting in Kansas called it a “vile fraud.”

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.740
Congress delayed Kansas’ entry into the Union
(because Congress’s primary business is delay)
until another, more fair referendum took place.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:32.540
And after that vote, Kansas eventually
did join the U.S. as a free state in 1861,
by which time it was frankly too late.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:40.500
All right so while all this craziness was going on
in Kansas and Congress, the Supreme Court was
busy rendering the worst decision in its history.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.920
Oh, hi there, Dred Scott.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.720
Dred Scott had been a slave whose master had taken him to live in Illinois and Wisconsin, both of which barred slavery.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.820
So, Scott sued, arguing that if slavery was
illegal in Illinois, then living in Illinois made
him definitionally not a slave.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.340
The case took years to find its way to
the Supreme Court

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.580
and eventually, in 1857, Chief Justice
Roger B. Taney, from Maryland, handed
down his decision.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:08.600
The Court held that Scott was still a slave, 
but it went even further, attempting to settle
the slavery issue once and for all.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:15.320
Taney ruled that black people “had for
more than a century before been regarded
as beings of an inferior order,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.660
and altogether unfit to associate with the
white race, either in social or political relations;

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.700
and so far inferior that they had no rights
which the white man was bound to respect;

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.740
and that the negro might justly and lawfully
be reduced to slavery for his benefit.”

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:40.940
So...that is an actual quote from an actual
decision by the Supreme Court of the United
States of America. Wow.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.740
I mean, Taney’s ruling basically said that
all black people anywhere in the United States
could be considered property,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.920
and that the court was in the business
of protecting that property.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.720
This meant a slave owner could take
his slaves from Mississippi to Massachusetts
and they would still be slaves.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.340
Which meant that technically, there was
no such thing as a free state.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.820
At least that’s how people in the north,
especially Republicans saw it.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.280
The Dred Scott decision helped convince
even more people that the entire government,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.560
Congress, President Buchanan, and now
the Supreme Court, were in the hands of the
dreaded “Slave Power.”

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.100
Oh, we’re going to do the
Mystery Document now?

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:21.060
Stan, I am so confident about today’s Mystery Document that I am going to write down my guess right now.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.240
And I’m going to put it in this envelope
and then when I’m right I want a prize.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.540
All I ever get is punishment,
I want prizes.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.000
OK. The rules here are simple. I guess the
author of the Mystery Document.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.940
I already did that. And then I get
rewarded for being right.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:42.400
Alright total confidence. Let’s just read
this thing. And then I get my reward.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.560
“I look forward to the days when there shall
be a servile insurrection in the South,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.120
when the black man … shall assert his freedom
and wage a war of extermination against his master;

00:09:52.120 --> 00:10:00.560
when the torch of the incendiary shall
light up the towns and cities of the South,
and blot out the last vestige of slavery.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:10.160
And though I may not mock at their calamity,
nor laugh when their fear cometh, yet I will
hail it as the dawn of a political millennium.”

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.720
I was right! Right here.
Guessed in advance. John Brown.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.460
[buzzing] What? STAN!

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.860
Ohio Congressman Joshua Giddings?
Seriously, Stan? AH!

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.720
Whatever. I’m gonna talk about John Brown anyway.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.440
In 1859, John Brown led a disastrous
raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:35.170
hoping to capture guns and then give
them to slaves who would rise up and use
those guns against their masters.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:41.500
But, Brown was an awful military commander,
and not a terribly clear thinker in general,
and the raid was an abject failure.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.100
Many of the party were killed
and he was captured.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.120
He stood trial and was sentenced to death.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.400
Thus he became a martyr to the abolitionist
cause, which is probably what he wanted anyway.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.180
On the morning of his hanging, he wrote,

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:59.420
“I, John Brown, am now quite certain that
the crimes of this guilty land will never be
purged away but with blood.”

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.960
Well, he was right about that, but in general, any statement that begins “I-comma-my-name” Meh.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.340
And, so the stage was set for one of the
most important Presidential elections in
American history.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.100
Dun dun dun dun dun dahhhhh.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.240
In 1860, the Republican Party chose as its
candidate Abraham Lincoln, whose hair and
upper forehead you can see here.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:26.060
He’d proved his eloquence, if not his electability,
in a series of debates with Stephen Douglas when
the two were running for the Senate in 1858.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.900
Lincoln lost that election, but the debates
made him famous,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.000
and he could appeal to immigrant voters, because
he wasn’t associated with the Know Nothings.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.200
The Democrats, on the other hand, were
– to use a historian term – a hot mess.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.160
The Northern wing of the party favored
Stephen Douglas, but he was unacceptable
to voters in the deep South.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:51.740
So Southern Democrats nominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, making the Democrats, the last remaining truly national party, no longer truly a national party.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:12:01.300
A third party, the Constitutional Union Party, dedicated
to preserving the Constitution “as it is” i.e. including
slavery, nominated John Bell of Tennessee.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.080
Abraham Lincoln received 0 votes in
nine American states.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:14.320
But he won 40% of the overall popular vote,
including majorities in many of the most populous
states, thereby winning the electoral college.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.560
So, anytime a guy becomes President who
literally did not appear on your ballot, there is
likely to be a problem.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.160
And indeed, Lincoln’s election led to a number
of Southern states seceding from the Union.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.160
Lincoln himself hated slavery, but he repeatedly said that he would leave it alone in the states where it existed.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:37.900
But the demographics of Lincoln’s election showed
Southerners and Northerners alike that slave power
– to whatever extent it had existed –was over.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:44.720
By the time he took office on March 1, 1861,
seven states had seceded and formed the
Confederate States of America.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:54.360
And the stage was set for the fighting to begin, which it did, when Southern troops fired upon the Union garrison at Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor on April 12, 1861.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:02.200
So, that’s when the Civil War started, but it
became inevitable earlier – maybe in 1857,
or maybe in 1850, or maybe in 1776.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.460
Or maybe in 1619, when the first African
slaves arrived in Virginia.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:14.720
Because here’s the thing: In the Dred Scott decision,
Chief Justice Taney said that black Americans had
“no rights which the white man was bound to respect.”

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.000
But this was demonstrably false.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.020
Black men had voted in elections and
held property, including even slaves.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.540
They’d appeared in court on their own
behalf. They had rights.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.260
They’d expressed those rights when given
the opportunity.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:37.400
And the failure of the United States to understand that the rights of black Americans were as inalienable as those of white Americans is ultimately what made the Civil War inevitable.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.500
So next week, it’s off to war we go.
Thanks for watching.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.700

Our associate producer is Danica Johnson.
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:58.400
Usually every week there’s a libertage with
a caption, but there wasn’t one this week
because of stupid Chief Justice Roger Taney.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:04.400
However, please suggest captions in comments where you can also ask questions about today’s video that will be answered by our team of historians.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.820
Thanks for watching Crash Course US History
and as we say in my hometown of Nerdfighteria,
don’t forget to be awesome.
