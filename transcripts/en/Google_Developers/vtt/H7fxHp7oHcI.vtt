00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:03.334
Nurik:
So my name is Roman Nurik.

00:00:03.334 --> 00:00:04.968
I'm a Developer
Programs Engineer

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:08.834
for the Google Earth API
and KML.

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:11.834
So what that means
is I help developers--

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:13.534
third-party developers
such as yourselves--

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.634
use our geodeveloper products,

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:19.100
such as the Earth API,
KML, Maps, et cetera.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.167
And I help you use it
by kind of creating

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:27.434
samples, demos, updating
the reference once in a while,

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:31.734
taking feature requests,
bugs, things like that.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:33.133
So I kind of triage
a lot of that

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.634
and I communicate that
back to the software engineers

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.701
that work on the product
and we kind--

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:40.667
I'm kind of your liaison
to the software engineers.

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.167
So I like to think of myself
in that way.

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:47.267
So one thing I wanted to say
also before I start

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:50.601
is there's a URL
that you can go to--

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:53.834
that if you have any questions
during the talk,

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:56.267
you can, you know,
write them down there,

00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:57.667
and at the very end
of the talk

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:01.801
we'll go through and try
to answer all those questions.

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.868
All right.
So...

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:06.167
Oh, another thing,
again, before I start

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:09.801
is I'm going to be talking a lot
and doing a lot of demos.

00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:12.133
If you guys want to follow along
on your own computers

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.200
then go ahead
to this URL:

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.834
tinyurl.com/
earthapi-io2009-links

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:20.767
And for those of you
on YouTube, hello.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:22.634
Or wherever
the camera is.

00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:25.033
I'll keep this link up
for as long as possible

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:28.534
as long as tinyurl
doesn't decide to delete it.

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:31.701
So...happy first birthday,
Earth API.

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.234
Let's get
a round of applause.

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:36.300
[applause]

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.701
So last year
at Google I/O in 2008,

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:41.567
Paul Rademacher,
our tech lead--

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.167
who's sitting
in the front row--

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:44.667
introduced
the Google Earth API,

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.968
and I'll talk a little bit
about what the Earth API is.

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:50.000
And we've had a lot of,
well, a lot of success.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.834
And a lot of people, a lot
of third-party developers

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:54.734
have started using this API.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:57.801
And as you can see,
it's a 3D environment.

00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:59.534
Right? And it's right
in your browser.

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:00.901
It's great.

00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.000
And that--that is a birthday
cake, so happy birthday.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That's just
my quick shout-out.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.634
What are we going to be
talking about today?

00:02:07.634 --> 00:02:09.200
We're going to do
a quick refresher.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.767
What is the Earth API?

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:12.601
What is
the Google Earth Plugin?

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:15.834
After that, we'll go into
a new demo application

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.100
that I want to show
to you today

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.434
called "My Earth."

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:22.234
And we're going to talk about
some new utility libraries

00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:24.367
that I'm releasing today,

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:27.567
and how those are used
by My Earth

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:29.534
to make it so cool.

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:31.133
Then we're going to talk
about some animation,

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.000
effects,
and user interaction--

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.968
how that, again,
plays into My Earth

00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:36.367
and the new
utility libraries.

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:38.300
And then we'll talk about
some really interesting

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.734
other recent developments.

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.067
And these are really,
really important

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:44.634
for Maps API developers.

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:46.033
So if you're
a Maps API developer

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.000
that's been using
the Maps API

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.033
and also the,
like, the Earth Plugin,

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:53.033
by using the--
what's it called?

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:54.767
The Map type,
the Earth Map type.

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:56.300
Then you want to stick around
for that definitely

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.801
'cause we have
some good news for you.

00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:59.767
After that we'll take Q&amp;A
from Moderator

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:01.834
and from the mics
in front.

00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:03.300
So quick refresher--

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.667
I'm assuming that all of you

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:05.868
kind of know
what the Earth API is.

00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:07.167
But just in case,

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:08.667
for the one or two people
that don't know,

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.667
let's go through what the Earth
API and the Earth Plugin are.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:16.234
So better than talking about it
is showing a real demo.

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:18.200
So this is Google Chrome,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.767
and we now support
Google Chrome.

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:21.300
When we launched,
Google Chrome wasn't around,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.434
but we now support
Google Chrome.

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:25.701
And this is
the Google Earth Plugin.

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:28.167
Well, it's currently loading,
but when it loads,

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:31.934
it'll be...
one second.

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:37.734
[chuckles]

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.701
Ah, the Internet.
[laughs]

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.200
Well, luckily I have
another version here.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.734
So here's Google Earth--

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:45.300
the full power
of Google Earth, right?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.934
In your web browser.

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:48.901
So there's no left panel
that has, like,

00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:50.467
your "my places" and such,

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:51.734
and there's no layers.

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:53.801
But there are, you know,

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:55.868
the core fundamentals
of Google Earth--

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.234
that is, the rendering system,

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:59.234
all the imagery--
all the vast imagery,

00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:00.634
the 3D buildings
and everything--

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:02.567
is available
in your web browser.

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:03.868
Right?

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.167
So--and then you can
access that with JavaScript.

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:09.300
You can make your own
mash-up on top of that.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.167
So that's the quick,
you know, Hello Earth demo.

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:16.701
So the Google Earth API
is a JavaScript API

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:19.634
that allows developers
to create their own mash-ups

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.501
that use Google Earth

00:04:21.501 --> 00:04:24.601
and do it all
on the web.

00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.467
The Google Earth Plugin
is kind of the consumer,

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.167
the end user
side of this equation.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.767
And it takes--
it's a browser plugin

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:34.267
that takes
the power of Google Earth

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:36.067
and brings it
into the web

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:39.801
so that users can interact
with your application

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:41.067
as if they were
in Google Earth

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:43.067
but looking
at your content

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:46.334
and whatever
you want to show them.

00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:49.133
So here's a quick
kind of system diagram

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:52.300
of how this whole
equation works, right?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.767
You have your own
web application,

00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:56.501
your own client-side
JavaScript on the left.

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.701
That interacts with the Google
Earth API in JavaScript,

00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:02.400
and then the Google Earth API

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.167
takes care of dealing
with all the kind of...

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:07.934
inner, you know,
plugin-related stuff

00:05:07.934 --> 00:05:09.400
with the Google Earth Plugin.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.968
So those--so you never really
directly deal with the plugin.

00:05:11.968 --> 00:05:14.167
You only really deal
with the JavaScript API.

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:16.100
So everything you do
is JavaScript--

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.701
and a little bit of HTML,
a sprinkle of HTML.

00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:21.667
So I just want to talk
about some of the things

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:24.567
that we've accomplished
over the past--

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:27.234
the past year
that we've been around.

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:29.701
We've launched Mac support
back in December.

00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.400
So when we first--
[applause]

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.133
round of applause for
the Mac users, yeah, yeah.

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:38.334
We've launched--
so we've launched Mac support.

00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:41.067
We originally only launched
with Windows support,

00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:44.200
so now we support the Mac,
Safari and Firefox.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.767
We also now support
KML Tour playback.

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:49.400
Now, let me talk about
that for a second.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.734
For those of you
who don't know what that is

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:54.901
KML Tours were launched
with Google Earth 5

00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:56.467
back in February.

00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:59.634
And they allow--they allow
KML content authors

00:05:59.634 --> 00:06:04.634
to create a beautiful,
movie-like experience

00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:07.234
right in Google Earth and
now in the Google Earth Plugin.

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.033
So if you have some...

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:12.634
some narration that you
want to kind of put together

00:06:12.634 --> 00:06:15.033
that kind of explains
your KML content,

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:17.167
and you want to do it
in a dynamic,

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:19.367
interactive,
kind of animated way,

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:22.200
KML Tours
are the way to go.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.567
We've also launched support
for underwater terrain

00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:29.400
AKA ocean,
as many people have called it.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.000
Mars mode, so you can--
instead of loading Earth,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
you can load Mars.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.033
And Enterprise
server connectivity--

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:39.334
so those of you who have--
who have worked with

00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:41.000
our Enterprise sales folks

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.467
to get an Enterprise server,

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:45.000
you can now use
the Google Earth Plugin

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.534
to connect
to your Enterprise server.

00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:49.400
And the demo gallery

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.601
has grown to over
80 samples and demos,

00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:53.667
so you've got a lot of good
resources out there,

00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:55.834
you know,
to get started.

00:06:55.834 --> 00:06:57.467
So that's--
that's the old.

00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:59.200
I wanted to spend
as little time

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.634
as possible on the old.

00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:03.367
Let's talk about the new.

00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:06.267
So previously
we've only really seen

00:07:06.267 --> 00:07:08.767
basic forms
of interaction,

00:07:08.767 --> 00:07:10.501
basic visualizations.

00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:13.467
But there hasn't been,
really, a killer--

00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:16.400
a killer
3D interactive environment

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.334
where the user feels
like they're in control

00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:21.667
and they can, like, modify,
you know, the planet.

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:22.901
Right?

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.734
So this is--what I want
to present to you today

00:07:24.734 --> 00:07:26.167
is kind of a new paradigm,

00:07:26.167 --> 00:07:30.434
a new type of application
for the Google Earth API.

00:07:30.434 --> 00:07:32.868
And that's going to be
called "My Earth."

00:07:32.868 --> 00:07:34.601
This is kind of manifested
in this one demo

00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:36.000
called "My Earth."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.501
And I'll do
a quick demo of it,

00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:40.534
and then I'll explain
what it is,

00:07:40.534 --> 00:07:41.968
how it works,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:44.934 --> 00:07:48.267
So My Earth...
when it loads.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:51.000
So My Earth
is a 3D My Maps client

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.400
that uses
the Google Earth API.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.033
It's a mash-up between
the Google Earth API

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:56.167
and the Google Maps
Data API was--

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.634
which was launched
only a few weeks ago.

00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:02.334
So I'm going
to go ahead and log in.

00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:05.100
I'm not Peter.
I'm going to sign out as Peter.

00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:15.434
So I'm going to go ahead
and sign in.

00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:17.334
That's not it.
[chuckles]

00:08:17.334 --> 00:08:18.601
One second.

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:28.267
So it's going to ask me
to log in once more.

00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:32.367
Yes. Yes.
Sign in.

00:08:32.367 --> 00:08:35.501
So I'm going to grant access
to access my Google My Maps.

00:08:39.734 --> 00:08:42.534
And once the Earth loads,

00:08:42.534 --> 00:08:44.767
you'll see a list of--
a list of My Maps.

00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:47.000
I only opened up
Maps at Google.com on the side

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.434
just so I could
show you 2D versus 3D.

00:08:49.434 --> 00:08:51.601
So here's--
here's an example map,

00:08:51.601 --> 00:08:54.434
the example map
I'm going to use right now.

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:56.701
It's pretty much a polygon,

00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.834
a polyline,
and two placemarks.

00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:00.567
So here's My Earth.
So I have the same thing.

00:09:00.567 --> 00:09:03.400
So I'm going to go ahead
and click on "sandbox".

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.033
And here's the same content,
but in 3D.

00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:10.534
All right? So this
is cool and all, right?

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:13.734
So I can, you know,
click on stuff,

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:14.868
and--oh, it's a volcano.

00:09:14.868 --> 00:09:16.300
Great, "The Fishes."

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.801
No, that one doesn't have
a description.

00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:19.400
"Cordoning off the area,"
blah, blah, blah.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.000
So, you know,
it's very simple.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.701
It's just polygons
and basic features in Earth.

00:09:24.701 --> 00:09:26.968
But the kicker--
the kicker is now

00:09:26.968 --> 00:09:29.367
allowing users
to interact with that content.

00:09:29.367 --> 00:09:32.133
So if I go in
and press this "Edit" button,

00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:34.701
I'm going to see some cool stuff
start appearing.

00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:36.934
First I'm going to see
this geometry toolbox

00:09:36.934 --> 00:09:38.400
at the top,
just like as--

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.634
just like My Maps has--

00:09:40.634 --> 00:09:46.000
which allows you
to create placemarks.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.801
Right?
And draw line strings.

00:09:50.801 --> 00:09:52.801
And if I zoom out
a little bit,

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.434
you could see that I can
keep dragging this around

00:09:56.434 --> 00:09:57.767
however I want.

00:09:57.767 --> 00:09:59.467
I can even customize it.

00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:01.868
Now, this is kind of overkill,
I mean, for a demo,

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:04.567
but anyway.

00:10:04.567 --> 00:10:06.133
"Hello,"
and you can see it change--

00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:08.234
it should change
in the left side there.

00:10:08.234 --> 00:10:11.701
"Blah."
Right.

00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:13.300
Great.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.434
And then I could even
create polygons...

00:10:16.434 --> 00:10:18.934
and it's much the same way.

00:10:18.934 --> 00:10:21.067
And if you notice,

00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:23.133
if you'll notice,
once I've created a polygon,

00:10:23.133 --> 00:10:24.801
I can then edit
the polygon.

00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:26.534
And much like
with My Maps,

00:10:26.534 --> 00:10:30.934
I can actually, you know,
create new vertices

00:10:30.934 --> 00:10:34.167
right on the fly,
right there in there.

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:37.100
And I could delete
vertices if I want.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.601
And et cetera, et cetera.
You get the picture.

00:10:40.601 --> 00:10:42.467
So I'm going to go ahead
and press "Save,"

00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:45.567
or actually,
I'm going to press "Done".

00:10:45.567 --> 00:10:48.234
And it's going
to save all that.

00:10:48.234 --> 00:10:53.267
And I'm going
to refresh Google Maps.

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:56.167
And...
drumroll, please.

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:57.701
There's all my new content.

00:10:57.701 --> 00:11:00.601
So 2D and 3D married,
right?

00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:03.534
[applause]
Thank you.

00:11:03.534 --> 00:11:07.167
So there are a few things
that are kind of new

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.667
about this demo.

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:11.100
And this talk, a lot of--
a large part of this talk

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.100
is going to be talking
about these new things

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.200
and kind of how you can bring
a part of this

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.334
into your own applications.

00:11:20.334 --> 00:11:22.334
All right, so that was--
that was My Earth.

00:11:22.334 --> 00:11:24.667
What does it do?
So you just saw.

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:27.000
It allows you
to edit your My Maps data

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.767
in the--
in a 3D environment.

00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:32.767
So this is great for, like,
when there's mountainous areas

00:11:32.767 --> 00:11:36.767
and Maps maybe quite doesn't--
doesn't quite cut it

00:11:36.767 --> 00:11:38.767
but Earth is kind of
a better experience

00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:40.400
for users to work in.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.067
So this is--this is
kind of what it does.

00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:45.167
It allows you to work in 3D,
basic creation,

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:47.300
reading, updating,
and deletion of features,

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.467
drag and drop placemarks,

00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:51.767
edit polygon, vertices,
and, you know,

00:11:51.767 --> 00:11:54.968
screwing around with colors,
fill colors...

00:11:54.968 --> 00:11:58.234
sorry, styles,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:58.234 --> 00:11:59.701
How does it work?

00:11:59.701 --> 00:12:02.901
A lot--a lot
of the back end stuff

00:12:02.901 --> 00:12:07.834
is handled by
the Google Maps Data API.

00:12:07.834 --> 00:12:09.434
But all the front end stuff

00:12:09.434 --> 00:12:11.200
is powered by
the Google Earth API

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.701
and some new open source
utility libraries

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:17.033
that we're releasing today.

00:12:17.033 --> 00:12:18.901
And those open source
utility libraries

00:12:18.901 --> 00:12:21.133
allow you to do,
very easily,

00:12:21.133 --> 00:12:24.834
animation and effects,
creation of placemarks,

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:26.834
creation of all sorts
of DOM objects

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:29.567
very easily,
very concisely.

00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:32.033
And it also lets you--
lets you do feature editing

00:12:32.033 --> 00:12:35.834
as you saw with line string
and polygon editing.

00:12:35.834 --> 00:12:39.033
It also--it also
works by creating

00:12:39.033 --> 00:12:40.801
those controls that you saw
at the very top.

00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.300
Let me just go back
a few slides.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.834
These controls up here.

00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:47.434
These are actually
fake screen overlays

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.200
that, you know,
that you can, you know,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.200
listen to event handlers
on the window

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.267
to kind of guess
at interaction with them.

00:12:55.267 --> 00:12:57.234
And that's--we'll talk about
that a little more in a second.

00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:59.133
It also uses jQuery

00:12:59.133 --> 00:13:00.901
for a lot of the front end
HTML stuff--

00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:05.033
specifically,
the left-hand panel.

00:13:05.033 --> 00:13:08.133
So the open source
utility libraries.

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:11.000
There's two libraries
that we're releasing today.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.567
The--I'm going to talk
mostly about the second one.

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:16.267
Let me just talk a little bit
about geojs,

00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:17.801
which is the first one.

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:21.801
Geojs allows you to do--
allows you to work with

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.400
3D geometries
in JavaScript.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.501
So you can work with
points, lines, and polygons.

00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:29.667
You could do math on them--

00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:31.667
like get the distance
between two points,

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:33.767
calculate
the initial bearing

00:13:33.767 --> 00:13:35.501
to get from point "A"
to point "B",

00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:38.200
calculate if a point
is in a polygon or not,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.834
calculate the area
of a polygon.

00:13:39.834 --> 00:13:41.634
You could also work
with things like

00:13:41.634 --> 00:13:43.534
latitude/longitude bounds.

00:13:43.534 --> 00:13:46.434
A lot of this is actually
repeated from the Maps API

00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:48.634
but this is kind of
open-sourced.

00:13:48.634 --> 00:13:50.801
It's not--it's not
the same code as the map is,

00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:52.267
as the Maps API stuff.

00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:55.033
But it accomplishes
much of the same goals.

00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:57.868
So that's geojs, in a--
in a split second.

00:13:57.868 --> 00:14:01.868
The earth-api-utility-library
or GEarthExtensions

00:14:01.868 --> 00:14:04.968
is kind of
what you just saw.

00:14:04.968 --> 00:14:07.567
A lot of the editing
and, you know,

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:09.701
animation and effects stuff--
that's handled by that.

00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:12.133
So it allows you
to create KML objects

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:13.767
in a very JSONic way.

00:14:13.767 --> 00:14:15.400
So if you're
a JavaScript developer

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.934
and not really
a KML developer,

00:14:16.934 --> 00:14:18.400
and you want to use
the Earth API,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.868
this--this utility library
may be for you.

00:14:21.868 --> 00:14:24.434
You can--it also takes the pain
out of common operations

00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:26.300
such as walking the DOM--

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.501
and I'll explain that
in a second--

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:30.267
walking the DOM
and, like, getting features

00:14:30.267 --> 00:14:31.901
by the--
clearing features.

00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:34.033
A lot of--
a lot of developers

00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:36.100
have requested these things
from the Earth API,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.501
and we haven't
implemented them.

00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:40.300
But we now have a space

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.968
where we can implement
these common things

00:14:41.968 --> 00:14:44.434
in an open source way.

00:14:44.434 --> 00:14:47.367
It also has a very complex
animation and effects framework,

00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:50.400
and again,
one-liner draggable placemarks

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.033
and editable line strings
and polygons.

00:14:53.033 --> 00:14:55.400
And all this stuff is
open source under Apache 2.0,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.133
so feel free to take it,

00:14:57.133 --> 00:14:59.534
screw around with it,
do what you will.

00:14:59.534 --> 00:15:01.334
It's pretty much, you know,

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:02.868
as long as you
abide by that license,

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:05.534
it's your code.

00:15:05.534 --> 00:15:08.501
So how do you use
GEarthExtensions?

00:15:08.501 --> 00:15:10.334
I skipped all the kind of
boilerplate

00:15:10.334 --> 00:15:11.968
Google Earth API stuff,

00:15:11.968 --> 00:15:15.167
just so that I could focus
on utility library stuff.

00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:18.534
So all you do is you
include a script tag

00:15:18.534 --> 00:15:21.534
that points to
the GEarthExtension's...

00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:23.701
distribution JS file.

00:15:23.701 --> 00:15:26.067
Then, inside of your
success callback

00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:28.167
for createinstance,

00:15:28.167 --> 00:15:32.067
after you get an instance
of the GE plugin interface,

00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:34.567
all you need to do
is just create a new instance

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:36.167
of GEarthExtensions,

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:38.701
and you have all of that power
and capability

00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:42.200
ready for you right there.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.367
So let's talk about
one use case--

00:15:44.367 --> 00:15:46.334
creating a placemark.

00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:48.601
It's a very simple
use case,

00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:51.167
but the old kind of--
in the Earth API,

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:54.000
it takes a lot of code,
and let me explain why.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.601
The earth API
is modeled very much--

00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:59.033
very much after KML.

00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:00.968
So in KML,
to create a placemark,

00:16:00.968 --> 00:16:02.934
you have a placemark
and then inside of that

00:16:02.934 --> 00:16:05.334
you have a style
and then an icon style

00:16:05.334 --> 00:16:07.367
and then an icon
with an href

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:10.033
that points to some icon
or some image file.

00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:11.868
And then you have a point
with coordinates

00:16:11.868 --> 00:16:13.234
set to the latitude
and longitude

00:16:13.234 --> 00:16:14.968
of the location
of the placemark.

00:16:14.968 --> 00:16:16.467
You also have name
and description,

00:16:16.467 --> 00:16:17.701
this and that.

00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:20.334
So if you look
at the code,

00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:22.200
the Earth API,
you pretty much--

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.467
in the Earth API,
you pretty much build

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:26.234
a KML DOM.

00:16:26.234 --> 00:16:28.601
So you create that icon,
you create that style,

00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:30.767
you get that icon style
and you set the icon.

00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:33.167
And this stuff is kind of

00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:34.734
you know,
not really KML-related.

00:16:34.734 --> 00:16:36.367
But then you do stuff
like setNames,

00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:37.634
setDescription,
and setGeometry.

00:16:37.634 --> 00:16:38.901
So it's modeled after KML.

00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:40.834
So if you know KML,
then some of these things

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.634
will make a lot of sense
to you.

00:16:43.634 --> 00:16:46.467
So that's the--that's
the Earth API way of doing it.

00:16:46.467 --> 00:16:48.467
The GEarthExtensions
way of doing it

00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:50.934
is much simpler and shorter.

00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:54.934
So to create
a placemark, you call gex.

00:16:54.934 --> 00:16:56.501
And remember,
gex is that instance

00:16:56.501 --> 00:16:57.701
of GEarthExtensions.

00:16:57.701 --> 00:17:01.234
You call
gex.dom.addPointPlacemark.

00:17:01.234 --> 00:17:03.634
You give it
a point-like object

00:17:03.634 --> 00:17:06.367
so you can give it
a look at a point,

00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:08.868
you can give it an array
with a latitude and longitude--

00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:11.934
pretty much anything
that may resemble a point

00:17:11.934 --> 00:17:13.567
you can throw at it.

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:14.868
So you give it that.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.200
You give it a name description
and a stock icon.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.567
You can even just use icon
and give it a full URL.

00:17:19.567 --> 00:17:21.300
But this is much shorter,
right?

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.934
This is much more
JSONic, or--

00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:25.133
I don't even know
if that's a word.

00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:29.000
It's much more like JSON
as opposed to KML.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.968
So it really
helps for people

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:32.467
that don't know KML
that well.

00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:35.200
It really helps
to kind of use this

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.801
and start off
with a much simpler

00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:39.701
kind of piece of code.

00:17:39.701 --> 00:17:41.000
Let's talk about
something else.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.234
So I was talking about
walking the DOM, right?

00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:45.067
So walking the DOM is...

00:17:45.067 --> 00:17:48.434
it's an important--it's
important for various reasons.

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:51.000
Let me give you kind of
a use case.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.100
Let's say you're trying
to play a tour

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.000
in the Google Earth API.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.200
The way you do that
is you first use

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.667
something called Fetch KML

00:17:58.667 --> 00:18:02.067
to load a KML file
that has a tour inside of it.

00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:04.868
You then have to find
the actual tour object

00:18:04.868 --> 00:18:06.734
within that loaded KML.

00:18:06.734 --> 00:18:08.968
So the way to do that is

00:18:08.968 --> 00:18:12.934
you would have to walk
through each document folder--

00:18:12.934 --> 00:18:15.200
each--maybe, like,
look through all the features

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.400
looking for a tour

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.334
and then passing that
to the tour player.

00:18:19.334 --> 00:18:22.734
So in order to kind of
make that easier,

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:26.667
I created a function
called gex.dom.walk,

00:18:26.667 --> 00:18:30.133
which all it does
is it takes a function--

00:18:30.133 --> 00:18:31.767
Where's the cursor?
There it is.

00:18:31.767 --> 00:18:34.200
So it takes a function
and then it calls that function

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.834
for every object
in the DOM.

00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:39.234
And as soon as--
and like for--

00:18:39.234 --> 00:18:40.767
this example
is a little simpler.

00:18:40.767 --> 00:18:42.167
It's just trying to find
the feature

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:43.367
with the given I.D.

00:18:43.367 --> 00:18:44.701
As soon as you find--

00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:46.601
as soon as this function
gets called with the feature

00:18:46.601 --> 00:18:49.067
with the given I.D.--
or in the tour case,

00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:51.400
as soon as the function
gets called

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.534
with the feature
of the KML tour type--

00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:56.901
then you can kind of
end the walk

00:18:56.901 --> 00:18:58.067
and say you're done.

00:18:58.067 --> 00:19:01.267
So this is--gex.dom.walk
is effectively

00:19:01.267 --> 00:19:04.133
a depth-first search
into the KML DOM tree.

00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:06.067
So previously,
a lot of things

00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:09.067
that required
that type of algorithm

00:19:09.067 --> 00:19:11.167
were--were kind of painful.

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:15.400
And this aims to make it
a lot easier.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.200
So that's that.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.300
Let's talk about
some of the cool stuff--

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.167
animation, effects,
and user interaction

00:19:22.167 --> 00:19:24.934
as you just saw in My Earth.

00:19:24.934 --> 00:19:26.767
So the first thing
I want to show is--

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:27.767
the first thing I want
to talk about

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:29.367
is draggable placemarks.

00:19:29.367 --> 00:19:32.534
That was kind of the very
simplest thing in the demo.

00:19:32.534 --> 00:19:36.200
Go ahead and close this.
Close that.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.734
All right, so...

00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:42.033
here's the code
for a draggable placemark.

00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:43.501
It's actually
much simpler than this.

00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:46.100
I kind of overcomplicated this
a little bit.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.467
It's really just that.

00:19:48.467 --> 00:19:52.767
But anyway, so if I go ahead
and run this code,

00:19:52.767 --> 00:19:56.467
creates a placemark,
can drag it around, right?

00:19:56.467 --> 00:19:59.234
Even shows a target--that's
a screen overlay over there.

00:19:59.234 --> 00:20:01.133
Shows a place--
like, the point at which

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.501
that point will land.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:04.801
And then if I let go,
it bounces it.

00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:08.300
So the dragging
is kind of simple.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.400
The dragging is,
you know,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.701
it's just a bunch
of mouse events.

00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:14.868
But the bounce is actually
pretty complex

00:20:14.868 --> 00:20:17.300
on the--I mean,
to actually use bounce

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.701
is very simple.

00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:22.267
But the actual things that go--
that go behind the scenes

00:20:22.267 --> 00:20:23.934
to make bounce work
are pretty interesting.

00:20:23.934 --> 00:20:26.434
I'm gonna talk about that.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:27.767
So actually,
before I do that,

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:30.934
here's the code for
making something draggable.

00:20:30.934 --> 00:20:32.968
I'm just going to give it
a dropCallback,

00:20:32.968 --> 00:20:35.667
so when I'm done,
when the drop is complete,

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:37.167
I'm going to do an alert.

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:41.000
The dragging style is,
again, a JSON-like object,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.734
and again, this is going
to be a theme throughout--

00:20:42.734 --> 00:20:44.834
that everything
is JSON-like.

00:20:44.834 --> 00:20:47.234
It's a JSON-like object

00:20:47.234 --> 00:20:50.400
that kind of shows--
that kind of tells

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.067
the style that the placemark
should take on

00:20:53.067 --> 00:20:55.968
while it's being dragged.

00:20:55.968 --> 00:20:58.234
Then there's also
a target screen overlay

00:20:58.234 --> 00:21:00.968
so this--this screen overlay
right here

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:02.467
you can describe
in this way.

00:21:02.467 --> 00:21:04.334
And all this stuff
is kind of corrupt.

00:21:04.334 --> 00:21:05.667
You don't--
you don't really need that.

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:08.968
The most important thing
is just that icon.

00:21:08.968 --> 00:21:10.234
So as you can see,
it's pretty simple,

00:21:10.234 --> 00:21:12.467
and this whole thing here
is optional.

00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:15.033
So you could've--you could've
completely omitted

00:21:15.033 --> 00:21:17.801
about 99% of this code

00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:20.701
and just said,
"gex.edit.makeDraggable,"

00:21:20.701 --> 00:21:24.067
and give it a placemark,
and you're done.

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:25.801
So let's talk about bounce.

00:21:25.801 --> 00:21:27.300
Like I said,
bounce is pretty interesting,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.033
so I want to talk about it
in detail.

00:21:30.033 --> 00:21:34.868
Bounce works behind the
animation and effects framework

00:21:34.868 --> 00:21:36.567
in GEarthExtensions,

00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:39.334
which is grouped under
the "fx" name space

00:21:39.334 --> 00:21:40.567
as you see at the top.

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:42.767
So when you call bounce
on a placemark,

00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:44.000
what that really is--

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.567
it's just
a property animation

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:49.167
on that placemark's
point's altitude.

00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:52.067
So I'm just saying,

00:21:52.067 --> 00:21:55.267
you know,
when I say "bounce,"

00:21:55.267 --> 00:21:57.667
pretty much
this animateProperty

00:21:57.667 --> 00:21:59.801
will take the placemark,
take its point,

00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:01.167
and just create

00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:04.133
kind of a property animation
on its altitude

00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:05.801
with some extra code.

00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:09.167
And let's talk about
animateProperty a little more,

00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:11.234
because that's--
that's pretty interesting.

00:22:11.234 --> 00:22:14.300
So this is what
animateProperty looks like.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.067
So I'm gonna--so this is
actually not bounce,

00:22:18.067 --> 00:22:19.434
this is something else.

00:22:19.434 --> 00:22:21.701
I want you guys to take
a quick ten seconds

00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:23.567
to look at this
and try to figure out

00:22:23.567 --> 00:22:24.767
what it would do.

00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:26.467
And then I'll explain
what it does.

00:22:26.467 --> 00:22:29.234
Actually, if anybody
has any ideas,

00:22:29.234 --> 00:22:30.467
then you can raise your hand,

00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:32.634
and come up
to the speaker...

00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:36.300
No? All right.
Okay.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.200
So...so what this does

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.601
is it takes this placemark

00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:43.400
and it animates
its point's latitude.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.868
So it takes this latitude,

00:22:45.868 --> 00:22:47.634
increases it
over a course of--

00:22:47.634 --> 00:22:49.534
over the course
of 250 milliseconds,

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:54.200
increases its latitude
by 0.05 degrees of latitude,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.534
and this easing: 'out'
thing just means

00:22:56.534 --> 00:23:00.133
that it kind of slows down
when it nears its destination.

00:23:00.133 --> 00:23:03.434
When this--when the first
animateProperty is complete,

00:23:03.434 --> 00:23:05.067
it calls
a second animateProperty

00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:07.601
to do the reverse action.

00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:10.067
And it does
the reverse easing too.

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:11.601
So what this looks like--

00:23:11.601 --> 00:23:13.300
and unfortunately I don't
have a demo of this,

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.167
but you could just
copy and paste it.

00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:17.234
What this looks like
is it takes a point

00:23:17.234 --> 00:23:22.534
and it slingshots it kind of
0.05 degrees north in latitude

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.367
and then slingshots it
back when it's done,

00:23:24.367 --> 00:23:27.300
and then throws up an alert
saying done.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.734
Not a very useful thing
to do in your real application,

00:23:30.734 --> 00:23:32.534
but just as an example

00:23:32.534 --> 00:23:36.033
it kind of makes some sense.

00:23:36.033 --> 00:23:37.300
So that's animateProperty.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.501
Now, animateProperty

00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:41.501
is based on an even
lower level construct

00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:43.634
called TimedAnimation.

00:23:43.634 --> 00:23:46.834
And let me get into
some details about that.

00:23:46.834 --> 00:23:48.100
So TimedAnimation--

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.367
you can forget about
some of this first stuff.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:53.200
TimedAnimation
takes a duration--

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.033
like for example,
in that sample,

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:57.901
it's 5,000 milliseconds
or 5 seconds.

00:23:57.901 --> 00:23:59.968
Takes a duration
and a--a function,

00:23:59.968 --> 00:24:01.400
like a render function,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.834
and it calls
that render function

00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:05.901
repeatedly,
as fast as possible,

00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:08.300
over the course
of that duration.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.901
So, like, for 5 seconds,
that function,

00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:12.901
as you see there, is going
to be called repeatedly.

00:24:12.901 --> 00:24:14.667
And it passes in
at the time

00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:16.901
at which the animation
is currently at.

00:24:16.901 --> 00:24:20.801
So you'll get things
like 0, 100 milliseconds,

00:24:20.801 --> 00:24:22.234
200 milliseconds,
300 milliseconds,

00:24:22.234 --> 00:24:25.234
and the idea is that you do
whatever animation you want,

00:24:25.234 --> 00:24:27.667
you do--
you update the scene

00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:29.367
which--
in whichever way you want

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:31.501
based on that time T.

00:24:31.501 --> 00:24:33.601
So the--this actually
has the effect

00:24:33.601 --> 00:24:35.000
of creating
a very smooth animation.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.534
So as soon
as you can draw the--

00:24:37.534 --> 00:24:40.801
like, update the scene with
the next frame of the animation,

00:24:40.801 --> 00:24:42.067
that function
will be called.

00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:43.968
You'll--
you'll make your changes.

00:24:43.968 --> 00:24:48.501
And it will be propagated
to the view.

00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:49.834
So that's TimedAnimation,

00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:51.734
and there's an even
lower level construct

00:24:51.734 --> 00:24:53.667
called Animation, which I'm
not going to talk about.

00:24:53.667 --> 00:24:57.000
That's just
an indefinite animation.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.367
So let's change gears
a little bit

00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:02.200
and talk about
the line string editing--

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.000
the line string
and polygon editing.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.667
To--to edit a line string
or a polygon,

00:25:07.667 --> 00:25:09.000
that's all you do.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.200
One line of code.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.634
So gex.edit.editLineString--

00:25:12.634 --> 00:25:15.100
you give it either a line string
or a linear ring,

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.267
a linear ring in the case
of a polygon's outer boundaries.

00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:21.467
For those that know KML,

00:25:21.467 --> 00:25:24.667
a polygon is simply just
kind of like an encapsulation

00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:26.234
of linear rings.

00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:30.267
So it works the same way
for line strings and polygons.

00:25:30.267 --> 00:25:32.734
That's pretty simple.

00:25:32.734 --> 00:25:34.601
And here's what it looks like.

00:25:34.601 --> 00:25:38.534
So each coordinate is
actually a draggable placemark.

00:25:38.534 --> 00:25:41.367
So if you remember,
I was talking about

00:25:41.367 --> 00:25:43.234
draggable placemarks
and how--

00:25:43.234 --> 00:25:45.467
how it's really easy
to make them draggable, right?

00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:47.567
How to make a placemark
draggable--one line of code.

00:25:47.567 --> 00:25:51.467
So line string editing
just uses

00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:54.334
placemark draggability,
I guess.

00:25:54.334 --> 00:25:58.000
And if you--
if you look a little closer,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.033
you'll see that--
that there is--

00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:03.267
that there's the--
the main vertices

00:26:03.267 --> 00:26:05.234
and then that kind of
ghost vertex,

00:26:05.234 --> 00:26:07.467
the vertex that users
want to click on

00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:10.267
to create a new vertex.

00:26:10.267 --> 00:26:12.834
And if you use My Maps,

00:26:12.834 --> 00:26:15.200
you'll know that this is
kind of very much

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.234
in the same--
in the same spirit

00:26:17.234 --> 00:26:19.200
and it works in much
the same way.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.033
So again, I just want
to emphasize

00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:23.334
that this is all handled
by the utility library.

00:26:23.334 --> 00:26:25.734
You never have
to deal with, you know,

00:26:25.734 --> 00:26:27.667
dealing with these middle--
midpoint placemarks.

00:26:27.667 --> 00:26:29.801
You just say, "Make this
line string editable,"

00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:33.033
and everything just works.

00:26:33.033 --> 00:26:35.100
So that's--that's a--

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.100
that's a big part
of the utility library.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.367
What I want to talk about
now is a little different.

00:26:40.367 --> 00:26:43.200
It's about these controls.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.234
So custom controls
have been a--

00:26:45.234 --> 00:26:47.901
probably the number one
or number two feature request

00:26:47.901 --> 00:26:49.300
for the Earth API
in a very long--

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.400
for a very long time.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.801
Unfortunately, it's--it's
kind of a hard problem to solve.

00:26:54.801 --> 00:26:56.200
The thing is, though,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.334
there are--there are kind of
workarounds or solutions.

00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:02.067
And the two solutions
listed up here

00:27:02.067 --> 00:27:04.267
are kind of--they have
different use cases,

00:27:04.267 --> 00:27:05.567
so I'll go through
each of them.

00:27:05.567 --> 00:27:07.300
So screen overlays--

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.033
in My Earth,
the controls at the top

00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:11.300
are screen overlays.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.167
So what happens in
the screen overlay scenario

00:27:13.167 --> 00:27:14.400
is if you want
to make a button

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.467
on top of the--
on top of Google Earth

00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:18.100
and on top of the plugin,

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.467
you create a screen overlay

00:27:19.467 --> 00:27:21.968
in a certain area of the--
of the window

00:27:21.968 --> 00:27:25.100
and then you add an event
listener on the window

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.367
for--well, actually,
you just add an event listener

00:27:28.367 --> 00:27:31.067
on the window and then
when that--well, no, sorry--

00:27:31.067 --> 00:27:33.767
a mouse click event listener
on the window.

00:27:33.767 --> 00:27:36.200
And then when you
get that event,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.567
you just look
for the "X" and "Y"s

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:39.834
and if they're
within the range

00:27:39.834 --> 00:27:41.200
of that screen overlay,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.667
if they're in that rectangle,

00:27:42.667 --> 00:27:44.334
then you just do
what you need.

00:27:44.334 --> 00:27:47.534
So you can do mouse over for a--
for, like, a hover state.

00:27:47.534 --> 00:27:49.400
You can do mouse out
for the normal state.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.868
And click for the--
for the actual click handler.

00:27:53.868 --> 00:27:55.601
So that's pretty simple to do.

00:27:55.601 --> 00:27:58.033
It's--I want to--I want
to say one thing, though, is--

00:27:58.033 --> 00:27:59.601
that's not in
the utility library yet,

00:27:59.601 --> 00:28:02.801
but it will be
probably pretty soon.

00:28:02.801 --> 00:28:04.701
So, you guys,
if that's really important,

00:28:04.701 --> 00:28:08.501
then definitely vote it up
in the feature requests.

00:28:08.501 --> 00:28:10.901
And one other thing I'll say
about screen overlays

00:28:10.901 --> 00:28:13.234
is that since--
since you can--

00:28:13.234 --> 00:28:15.234
you can have
transparent PNGs,

00:28:15.234 --> 00:28:17.601
you can actually make it
look really nice, right?

00:28:17.601 --> 00:28:20.033
You can make it
flow into your--

00:28:20.033 --> 00:28:22.467
into your overall UI design
very well.

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.934
So if you see here,
kind of the corners around it,

00:28:24.934 --> 00:28:27.133
and it's--
it blends in very well.

00:28:27.133 --> 00:28:29.167
So that's--that's
the screen overlay technique.

00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:31.567
It has its--
it has its downfalls.

00:28:31.567 --> 00:28:34.400
For example, you can't really
do dynamic text

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.667
inside of it

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:40.334
because screen overlays--
you can only use images.

00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:43.567
And that's why--
that's why IFRAME shims

00:28:43.567 --> 00:28:45.567
can be a better technique.

00:28:48.534 --> 00:28:50.434
So IFRAME shims.

00:28:50.434 --> 00:28:53.267
For a more complex UI,
not just buttons,

00:28:53.267 --> 00:28:55.634
you want to use
the IFRAME shim technique.

00:28:55.634 --> 00:28:58.968
What that is
is you create your HTML

00:28:58.968 --> 00:29:00.968
for your controls--

00:29:00.968 --> 00:29:02.267
so, like, let's say
you have a text box.

00:29:02.267 --> 00:29:04.100
So you just have, like,
an input button

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.100
or a div or something
with an input inside of it.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.334
And what you do is you overlay
that on top of the plugin.

00:29:10.334 --> 00:29:13.834
But the problem is,
in the browser space,

00:29:13.834 --> 00:29:18.434
plugins naturally always appear
on top of custom controls.

00:29:18.434 --> 00:29:24.167
So even if you set
the CSS z-index of the control

00:29:24.167 --> 00:29:26.367
to something
very, very high,

00:29:26.367 --> 00:29:27.868
it still won't show
because--

00:29:27.868 --> 00:29:29.901
because of this native
kind of browser thing

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:32.300
that all browsers do.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.801
So the way around that

00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:36.133
is to use something
called an IFRAME shim.

00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:38.267
So what you do is this:

00:29:38.267 --> 00:29:39.701
you have the plugin, right?

00:29:39.701 --> 00:29:40.934
This is the--the div.

00:29:40.934 --> 00:29:42.868
Imagine this as the div
with the plugin.

00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:45.100
You create your control
and you set its z-index.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.367
You then create
an IFRAME, an empty IFRAME,

00:29:49.367 --> 00:29:52.067
that's right in between--
that fits right in between,

00:29:52.067 --> 00:29:53.334
z-index-wise.

00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:55.133
So let's say the z-index
of this is 0.

00:29:55.133 --> 00:29:58.167
The z-index of your control
can be, like, 2, for example.

00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:01.934
And then you set the z-index
of this empty IFRAME to 1.

00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:03.701
And then you take that IFRAME

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.968
and you set
its coordinates to--

00:30:05.968 --> 00:30:07.667
to be the exact same
coordinates

00:30:07.667 --> 00:30:09.601
as the kind of
custom control.

00:30:09.601 --> 00:30:12.734
What this ha--
the effect of this

00:30:12.734 --> 00:30:15.734
is to make the browser
kind of be like,

00:30:15.734 --> 00:30:19.167
"Oh, this area should be
its own window."

00:30:19.167 --> 00:30:21.367
And then the IFRAME doesn't
actually show anything

00:30:21.367 --> 00:30:23.701
so your HTML shows through it.

00:30:23.701 --> 00:30:26.601
It's--it's a really
messy browser quirk,

00:30:26.601 --> 00:30:27.934
the way--
the way it works.

00:30:27.934 --> 00:30:31.501
And hopefully in the future
this won't be necessary

00:30:31.501 --> 00:30:34.334
and browsers will be kind of
like a first-class HTML

00:30:34.334 --> 00:30:36.534
and browser element.

00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:38.734
But this is kind of
the way it works now.

00:30:38.734 --> 00:30:42.400
So IFRAME shims are--
are good for several things.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.234
They're good if you have
a really complex UI,

00:30:44.234 --> 00:30:45.501
like I said.

00:30:45.501 --> 00:30:46.868
But one problem
with IFRAME shims

00:30:46.868 --> 00:30:48.167
is that they're,
first of all,

00:30:48.167 --> 00:30:51.567
kind of cumbersome
to work with in--in code.

00:30:51.567 --> 00:30:54.868
They're also--they also
look cumbersome visually,

00:30:54.868 --> 00:30:57.133
and they kind of tend
to flicker once in a while.

00:30:57.133 --> 00:31:00.067
So bottom line,
after all of this,

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:02.634
is if you just want to show
some buttons

00:31:02.634 --> 00:31:04.434
and you want to make them
look good,

00:31:04.434 --> 00:31:05.801
and that's all you need,
just buttons,

00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:07.200
use screen overlays.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.067
For anything more complex,
like, for example, text input,

00:31:12.067 --> 00:31:14.467
or anything else, pretty much,
you want to use IFRAME shims.

00:31:14.467 --> 00:31:16.334
And one last thing
is that balloons--

00:31:16.334 --> 00:31:18.267
info windows,
actually,

00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:22.133
in--in the plugin--
in the Google Earth Plugin

00:31:22.133 --> 00:31:23.734
uses IFRAME shim technique.

00:31:23.734 --> 00:31:26.667
So that's
how you can actually--

00:31:26.667 --> 00:31:28.868
well, let's--
let's do a quick...

00:31:28.868 --> 00:31:30.200
let me just show you
really quickly.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.667
And this doesn't
have a description.

00:31:31.667 --> 00:31:33.567
This will be a good time
to show how easy it is

00:31:33.567 --> 00:31:38.000
to change gex code.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.567
So if I just go ahead and set
this description to "hey".

00:31:43.567 --> 00:31:47.100
And add a comma...

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.701
So you'll see there
if I...

00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:53.767
if I select here, I'm selecting
everything, right?

00:31:53.767 --> 00:31:56.567
So here, this is
the IFRAME shim right here.

00:31:56.567 --> 00:31:58.300
You can't see it
because it blends in

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.067
with the--with the balloon
background pretty well.

00:32:00.067 --> 00:32:01.801
But that's actually
an IFRAME shim.

00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:03.934
So there's an IFRAME
under there if you look at--

00:32:03.934 --> 00:32:05.834
if you inspect the code,
you'll see an IFRAME.

00:32:05.834 --> 00:32:08.033
So that's--that's kind of
the same thing

00:32:08.033 --> 00:32:09.701
that you could do in--
in your code

00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:11.501
to accomplish this effect.

00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:13.834
And there's also a demo
in the demo gallery

00:32:13.834 --> 00:32:15.267
showing how to use
this technique

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:18.400
if--if you all
want to try that.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.400
All right, so that's...

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.067
that's pretty much
how My Earth works.

00:32:23.067 --> 00:32:24.634
And then there's--
again, there's a lot of--

00:32:24.634 --> 00:32:28.000
there's a lot of back end stuff
with the Maps Data API,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.667
the JS client library
for that,

00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:32.667
and I'd gladly take questions
on that if you'd like.

00:32:32.667 --> 00:32:34.200
But that's pretty much it.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.767
There is--
there's nothing else

00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:37.400
that's really seriously new

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.234
besides those kind of
new concepts.

00:32:39.234 --> 00:32:42.734
So feel free to look up
the code for My Earth.

00:32:42.734 --> 00:32:44.067
It's--again,
it's open-sourced.

00:32:44.067 --> 00:32:45.801
It's--it's not
in the demo gallery yet

00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:47.701
but I'll probably put it
up there pretty soon.

00:32:47.701 --> 00:32:50.100
So...yeah.
Enjoy.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:55.701
So...thanks.
[applause]

00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:57.901
Thank you.

00:32:57.901 --> 00:33:00.000
All right, so other
recent developments--

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.501
and here's where
Maps API folks

00:33:02.501 --> 00:33:05.901
will want to play
very close attention.

00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:09.234
Back in May 2008,

00:33:09.234 --> 00:33:12.701
we released the Google Earth
API, as you all know, right?

00:33:12.701 --> 00:33:14.467
We also released,
concurrently,

00:33:14.467 --> 00:33:16.834
a Maps API
compatibility layer

00:33:16.834 --> 00:33:19.100
called GSatellite 3D Map.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.434
And what that means is that

00:33:20.434 --> 00:33:22.467
in your existing
Maps API application,

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:24.834
you'd be able to,
in one line of code--

00:33:24.834 --> 00:33:26.767
I mean, that's our kind of
common theme throughout

00:33:26.767 --> 00:33:28.901
every--every developer
product we have--

00:33:28.901 --> 00:33:31.067
with one line of code,
you can add

00:33:31.067 --> 00:33:33.033
the Earth,
the Google Earth,

00:33:33.033 --> 00:33:35.167
as a map type for your map.

00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:37.067
So you'd be able to just...

00:33:37.067 --> 00:33:40.901
say map.addMapType
GSatellite 3D Map,

00:33:40.901 --> 00:33:43.767
and when users
click on the Earth,

00:33:43.767 --> 00:33:45.834
a lot of things
would be synchronized.

00:33:45.834 --> 00:33:47.934
So, like, it would switch
from Maps to Earth,

00:33:47.934 --> 00:33:49.701
and you'd see your markers
and polygons

00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:51.267
transferred automatically.

00:33:51.267 --> 00:33:53.901
However,
and this is a big caveat,

00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:57.868
the integration wasn't as good
as it could have been.

00:33:57.868 --> 00:34:00.834
There was--kind of the
transition between 2D and 3D

00:34:00.834 --> 00:34:03.200
wasn't as seamless
as it could have been.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.868
Polygons, ground overlays,
a bun--

00:34:05.868 --> 00:34:07.100
a whole bunch
of other features

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.334
simply weren't
transferred over.

00:34:08.334 --> 00:34:10.934
They were
pretty much forgotten.

00:34:10.934 --> 00:34:13.267
And a lot of developers
have struggled

00:34:13.267 --> 00:34:15.067
to kind of get that
working recently.

00:34:15.067 --> 00:34:18.234
And--and there have been
a lot of workarounds

00:34:18.234 --> 00:34:20.801
and it's just--
there's no great solution.

00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:22.667
However, today,
I want to announce

00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:24.534
that we finally
have a solution

00:34:24.534 --> 00:34:28.667
and everything works just
whole--whole ton better.

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:31.200
So...

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.801
the left guy is the old--

00:34:34.801 --> 00:34:38.534
the old kind of version
of GSatellite 3D Map.

00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:41.701
The guy on the right
is the new version.

00:34:41.701 --> 00:34:43.100
He's beefier.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.234
And if you look at the bottom,
I have some demos for you.

00:34:45.234 --> 00:34:47.200
And the first one
is the beefy demo.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.000
Actually, first
I'll show you a video,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.968
'cause the video is pretty--
pretty stunning.

00:34:50.968 --> 00:34:53.901
And then I'll show you
the--the live version.

00:34:58.634 --> 00:35:00.734
Oh. I have to press play,
of course.

00:35:00.734 --> 00:35:04.667
Oh, okay.
So this is Maps, right?

00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:07.267
Press "Earth."
Instant Earth.

00:35:07.267 --> 00:35:09.367
You didn't--
did you guys even notice--

00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:11.734
oh, let me--
let me play that again.

00:35:11.734 --> 00:35:14.601
2D...blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:17.267
2D, panning around.

00:35:17.267 --> 00:35:20.067
Done.
Earth.

00:35:20.067 --> 00:35:22.400
So you can't even tell,
right?

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.033
And you can also see
the ground overlays and polygons

00:35:25.033 --> 00:35:27.934
and--are transferred over
as well.

00:35:27.934 --> 00:35:30.434
And you can do the same thing,
you know,

00:35:30.434 --> 00:35:33.033
same thing you would
normally do in Earth.

00:35:33.033 --> 00:35:34.801
And it's kind of laggy there

00:35:34.801 --> 00:35:36.834
because of that
Golden Gate Bridge.

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:39.901
And when you click back to--
let me play that again.

00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:42.467
When you click back
to Satellite,

00:35:42.467 --> 00:35:44.200
it takes the 3D viewport

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.634
and kind of
seamlessly animates

00:35:46.634 --> 00:35:48.734
to what--exactly what it
would be in 2D

00:35:48.734 --> 00:35:50.934
so that users can barely tell

00:35:50.934 --> 00:35:54.067
they're--they're
in 2D and 3D.

00:35:54.067 --> 00:35:57.000
So let's see this live.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.300
[chuckles]

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.501
Wow, right, exactly.

00:35:59.501 --> 00:36:00.767
And I--by the way,

00:36:00.767 --> 00:36:02.434
shout-out to the engineers
that worked on this.

00:36:02.434 --> 00:36:06.400
You guys are brilliant.
[applause]

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.934
So...let's go ahead and--

00:36:08.934 --> 00:36:11.434
man: ...crossover
from the Map API?

00:36:11.434 --> 00:36:12.968
Nurik: Yes, same.
It's the--

00:36:12.968 --> 00:36:16.133
it's the same--same--
it's almost the same tiles.

00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:20.067
So let's--let's look at
this actual demo in progress.

00:36:20.067 --> 00:36:23.234
I got little beefy man
over there.

00:36:23.234 --> 00:36:24.534
So this is--
so let me just point out

00:36:24.534 --> 00:36:25.801
what--what's on the screen.

00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:27.667
There is a polyline,
this orange thing.

00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:29.634
There is a marker.

00:36:29.634 --> 00:36:31.167
Then there is a marker
with a custom--

00:36:31.167 --> 00:36:33.901
and that's not working
for some reason.

00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:35.868
That's supposed to be a marker
with a custom event handler,

00:36:35.868 --> 00:36:37.067
but something is broken.

00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:38.667
Anyway...

00:36:38.667 --> 00:36:40.133
So you have a ground overlay.

00:36:40.133 --> 00:36:42.734
It's--I couldn't find
a better image to use, sorry.

00:36:42.734 --> 00:36:44.334
And a polygon.

00:36:44.334 --> 00:36:47.467
So screen overlay,
polyline, marker,

00:36:47.467 --> 00:36:48.667
and pretty much everything
you could think of.

00:36:48.667 --> 00:36:50.334
The kitchen sink
is in this demo.

00:36:50.334 --> 00:36:53.000
So if we click on "Earth,"

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.968
it d--it still does take
a little bit to load the plugin.

00:36:55.968 --> 00:36:57.167
But when it does load,

00:36:57.167 --> 00:36:59.133
everything
is transferred over.

00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:04.434
And if I go ahead
and press "Satellite"...

00:37:04.434 --> 00:37:09.033
and I can click back
to "Earth" and "Satellite".

00:37:09.033 --> 00:37:11.367
And "Earth".
[audience chuckles]

00:37:11.367 --> 00:37:12.567
I ca--
I'm telling you.

00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:14.400
I honestly sometimes
have a hard time

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.667
figuring out where I am--
like, 2D or 3D?

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:20.000
I try to tilt in Maps
and it just doesn't work.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.534
[laughs]

00:37:21.534 --> 00:37:23.667
So that's--
that's one demo.

00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:25.367
One other thing
I want to point out

00:37:25.367 --> 00:37:28.267
is that
for KML content authors,

00:37:28.267 --> 00:37:32.667
you've had to use kind of
really crazy hacks

00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:34.334
to get Maps and Earth
working together.

00:37:34.334 --> 00:37:36.667
So that's, again,
no longer the case.

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:38.801
With this new version,

00:37:38.801 --> 00:37:42.534
GGeoXml, which is the--
kind of the Maps API version--

00:37:42.534 --> 00:37:45.901
way of looking at KML files,

00:37:45.901 --> 00:37:49.067
is now fully transferred over
between 2D and 3D.

00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:53.033
And not only are polygons
and polylines transferred,

00:37:53.033 --> 00:37:55.834
but let's say you
have a 3D model in your KML,

00:37:55.834 --> 00:37:57.767
and you load it
using GGeoXml.

00:37:57.767 --> 00:37:59.968
Although Maps
won't display it,

00:37:59.968 --> 00:38:03.167
when you switch to Earth,
that model will appear.

00:38:03.167 --> 00:38:05.200
So everything
is just fully synchronized.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.667
So if a user
decides to see, you know,

00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:09.601
the full, full,
rich extent

00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:11.534
of 3D--of your KML,

00:38:11.534 --> 00:38:12.701
they could just switch
to the Earth tab

00:38:12.701 --> 00:38:15.467
and it's--it's done.

00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:18.100
So let's look at a quick demo,
the GGeoXml demo.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.934
By the way, these links
are all available

00:38:20.934 --> 00:38:22.934
on your computers now.

00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:25.100
And I'll--I'll show you
that tinyurl again

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.234
in a second.

00:38:26.234 --> 00:38:31.334
So...very basic KML.

00:38:31.334 --> 00:38:33.901
And it's going to load
the plugin really quickly.

00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:37.400
Hopefully quicker...
in the next couple of months.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.734
We'll see.
[laughs]

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:49.434
I need to do one of those Lars
song and dances right now.

00:38:49.434 --> 00:38:52.033
Eh...hello?

00:38:52.033 --> 00:38:56.567
Let's try refreshing
the page.

00:38:56.567 --> 00:39:02.200
So I'm going to go ahead
and load and press "Earth".

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.801
Okay, so everything
gets transferred over, right?

00:39:04.801 --> 00:39:07.968
Same--
same little good stuff.

00:39:07.968 --> 00:39:10.033
You know, barely
tell the difference.

00:39:10.033 --> 00:39:12.734
If we load--well,
that's the Basic KML.

00:39:12.734 --> 00:39:15.400
Let's load
a more complex KML

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.000
in Satellite.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.067
This is actually still loading.
It's pretty complex.

00:39:19.067 --> 00:39:23.467
So Earth.

00:39:23.467 --> 00:39:25.501
So you see the--
that screen over there, right?

00:39:25.501 --> 00:39:29.701
So Satellite.

00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:31.667
And--oh, actually,
I guess Maps didn't

00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:33.000
show that screen overlay;
I wonder why.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.868
We'll have to ping
the Maps team about that.

00:39:34.868 --> 00:39:36.234
[laughs]

00:39:36.234 --> 00:39:37.567
But it works, again.

00:39:37.567 --> 00:39:39.701
And this is GGeoXml.

00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:43.567
So this is--the code for this
is actually incredibly simple.

00:39:43.567 --> 00:39:45.100
That's pretty much it--

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.734
GGeoXml--
map.addOverlay(GGeoXml)

00:39:47.734 --> 00:39:50.767
So you--your URL, your
KML URL would go right here.

00:39:50.767 --> 00:39:53.100
And you'd add this
GGeoXml object.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.968
And then you add
that Earth map type,

00:39:55.968 --> 00:39:58.067
and when users
switch to Earth,

00:39:58.067 --> 00:39:59.501
they see Earth--

00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:01.234
3D KML.

00:40:01.234 --> 00:40:03.601
And just one last one,
just for the road.

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:05.300
This one's pretty complex,
right?

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.100
Maps has some--
the Maps API has some

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.601
kind of complexity
limitations

00:40:09.601 --> 00:40:12.267
when viewing KML files
in them.

00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:15.400
So...but Earth doesn't.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.834
So this is kind of
an optimal solution

00:40:17.834 --> 00:40:19.300
for everyone.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.133
So Satellite if you want
or Earth.

00:40:22.133 --> 00:40:24.868
And again--I can't get over
that effect, sorry.

00:40:24.868 --> 00:40:26.200
[laughs]

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.534
Okay, so that's--
so that's that.

00:40:27.534 --> 00:40:30.400
So now that's--
that's available today.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.834
All you need to do
is use the version 2.160

00:40:34.834 --> 00:40:36.434
of the Maps API

00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:38.300
or version 2.X.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.167
In--maybe
in a few weeks or so,

00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:43.567
eventually,
all this new code--

00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:45.601
this new version of
GSatellite 3D Map

00:40:45.601 --> 00:40:47.868
will be available in the--
in the Maps API,

00:40:47.868 --> 00:40:49.901
the regular Maps API.

00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:53.400
So...yeah.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.434
Next thing I want
to talk about really quickly

00:40:55.434 --> 00:40:56.734
before we finish off

00:40:56.734 --> 00:41:00.033
is embeddable KML.

00:41:00.033 --> 00:41:02.367
And this, again, we're done
with the utility library.

00:41:02.367 --> 00:41:05.067
Now we're just talking
about other cool stuff.

00:41:05.067 --> 00:41:07.567
So let's say you don't
like working with JavaScript,

00:41:07.567 --> 00:41:09.400
but you do like KML.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.200
But you do have a website.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.634
So originally you would
have to use the Earth API,

00:41:14.634 --> 00:41:16.734
you know,
figure out how to--

00:41:16.734 --> 00:41:18.267
how to u--
what JavaScript calls to make

00:41:18.267 --> 00:41:20.767
to load your KML
into the browser.

00:41:20.767 --> 00:41:23.267
Now, with--
this is actually--

00:41:23.267 --> 00:41:25.634
a few months ago,
we released this.

00:41:25.634 --> 00:41:27.200
You can--instead of,
you know,

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.367
working with JavaScript,

00:41:28.367 --> 00:41:30.801
you can just use
a Google gadget

00:41:30.801 --> 00:41:32.567
that takes a KML URL

00:41:32.567 --> 00:41:34.300
and spits out
some HTML code.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.501
You copy that HTML code
into your page,

00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:37.968
and you're done.

00:41:37.968 --> 00:41:39.901
So let's just show
a quick demo.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.501
So this is a demo of...

00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:51.133
world oil consump--this is
a KML of world oil consumption.

00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:53.067
I believe it's a--
it's a thematic map.

00:41:53.067 --> 00:41:55.601
It's still loading.
There it is, right?

00:41:55.601 --> 00:41:57.834
So it's a thematic map,

00:41:57.834 --> 00:42:00.033
and this is, again,
Google Earth in the browser.

00:42:00.033 --> 00:42:03.467
But there's zero JavaScript
on this page.

00:42:03.467 --> 00:42:05.267
It is--
see, there's no JavaScript.

00:42:05.267 --> 00:42:06.434
There's no Script tag.

00:42:06.434 --> 00:42:07.834
Actually,
there is one Script tag,

00:42:07.834 --> 00:42:10.667
but this was copy and pasted
from the gadget wizard.

00:42:10.667 --> 00:42:12.400
So let me show you
what this looks like.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:17.100
If I go to--go ahead
and go to the wizard...

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.968
All you need to do
on this page--

00:42:18.968 --> 00:42:21.901
well, this is going
to load the plugin again.

00:42:21.901 --> 00:42:23.634
All you need to do
on this page

00:42:23.634 --> 00:42:26.467
is enter a KML URL

00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:30.901
or a My Maps URL.

00:42:30.901 --> 00:42:34.200
Let's see.
I need a KML URL.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.634
I'm not very good with--
hold on.

00:42:37.634 --> 00:42:42.467
What better than Google
to look for KML?

00:42:42.467 --> 00:42:44.400
Here, that's fine.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.734
I don't even know
what that is.

00:42:45.734 --> 00:42:48.334
Hopefully
it's not something bad.

00:42:48.334 --> 00:42:49.801
[quietly chuckles]

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:51.133
[laughs]

00:42:51.133 --> 00:42:53.267
Yeah, I--I will not
be held liable.

00:42:53.267 --> 00:42:55.534
I'm just kidding.
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:42:55.534 --> 00:42:57.601
Yeah, let me get something
that I know, just in case.

00:42:57.601 --> 00:42:59.300
[audience laughs]

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.000
[Nurik laughs]

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.534
Here...trunk/examples...

00:43:05.534 --> 00:43:07.000
yeah, hold on, I'll--
I'll get it in here.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.334
Static...red.kml.

00:43:09.334 --> 00:43:13.000
Here, I know this one
'cause I made it.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.300
My plugin is still loading.
One second.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.300
Okay, so let's--
let's--I--

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.067
all I need to do
is paste the KML in here,

00:43:19.067 --> 00:43:20.901
paste the URL--
there it is.

00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:22.133
And now it's
going to preview.

00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:23.968
This is what
the KML looks like.

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.434
All right.

00:43:25.434 --> 00:43:28.834
And I'm going to press
"Get the Code" and that's it.

00:43:28.834 --> 00:43:30.601
I just copy this
into my page, and I'm done.

00:43:30.601 --> 00:43:32.100
I don't need to worry
about any JavaScript

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.868
or anything.

00:43:34.868 --> 00:43:36.934
And--and...

00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:38.467
this--this is actually,
again,

00:43:38.467 --> 00:43:40.934
linked to
from that set of links.

00:43:40.934 --> 00:43:42.501
For--for those on YouTube,

00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:45.200
let--you know, God forbid
that the thing goes down--

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.567
it's tr.im/embedkml.

00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:50.701
And this--this will
get you to this page.

00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:52.601
So embeddable KML is cool.

00:43:52.601 --> 00:43:55.901
But as I mentioned before,
what about touring?

00:43:55.901 --> 00:43:57.701
What about
Google Earth Tours--

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:59.434
those movie-like experiences,

00:43:59.434 --> 00:44:03.434
those movie-like
interactive experiences

00:44:03.434 --> 00:44:06.234
that--that you can
make in Google Earth 5?

00:44:06.234 --> 00:44:10.033
Well, you can now play that
in the plugin pretty simply,

00:44:10.033 --> 00:44:11.834
and again,
without any JavaScript.

00:44:11.834 --> 00:44:13.868
So you just go
to a different wizard--

00:44:13.868 --> 00:44:15.667
this is the touring wizard.

00:44:15.667 --> 00:44:18.701
Give it a KML
that has a tour in it.

00:44:18.701 --> 00:44:21.234
It'll automatically
find your tour inside that KML

00:44:21.234 --> 00:44:23.167
so it can pretty much
be anywhere.

00:44:23.167 --> 00:44:24.567
And again,
press "Get the Code"

00:44:24.567 --> 00:44:26.234
and just copy that
and you're set.

00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:27.801
So here's what that
looks like.

00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:31.434
And I chose
the Jimmy Buffett Hawaii Tour,

00:44:31.434 --> 00:44:32.601
and a lot
of the engineers here

00:44:32.601 --> 00:44:33.968
are gonna be
sick of hearing this

00:44:33.968 --> 00:44:35.767
'cause we--we do
a lot of testing

00:44:35.767 --> 00:44:37.167
specifically on this one.

00:44:37.167 --> 00:44:39.701
But...oh, actually,
you can't hear the--

00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:41.367
you can't hear the voice,

00:44:41.367 --> 00:44:43.234
but that's fine.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.734
So again, all-interactive,

00:44:51.734 --> 00:44:54.167
and I can, like,
pan around while everything's--

00:44:54.167 --> 00:44:55.734
say I want to look
at that house.

00:44:55.734 --> 00:44:57.901
Whoa, that's weird.
[laughs]

00:44:57.901 --> 00:45:01.467
Yeah. So...and again,
zero lines of JavaScript.

00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:03.734
So that's embeddable KML
in a nutshell.

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.901
So for--for people
that don't like JavaScript

00:45:05.901 --> 00:45:07.100
or don't know JavaScript

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.300
and just want to have
KML on their page,

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.667
this is the tool for you.

00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:14.200
Right.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.434
So that's pretty much
the talk.

00:45:17.434 --> 00:45:19.100
Before I--
before we take questions,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.868
I want to kind of
do a quick shout-out

00:45:20.868 --> 00:45:23.133
to developer qualification.

00:45:23.133 --> 00:45:27.501
We have a new program called
the Qualified Developer Program

00:45:27.501 --> 00:45:30.067
and this is
for Maps API developers,

00:45:30.067 --> 00:45:31.701
not yet for
Earth API developers.

00:45:31.701 --> 00:45:34.367
But this is
for Maps API developers.

00:45:34.367 --> 00:45:36.234
Just go ahead
and visit this URL

00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:37.601
if you feel like
you're qualified,

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:40.300
if you want to kind--
kind of some Google cred

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.133
for your skills
in the Maps API.

00:45:42.133 --> 00:45:43.567
Go ahead to this URL

00:45:43.567 --> 00:45:45.801
and get yourself qualified.

00:45:45.801 --> 00:45:47.667
So that's--that's the talk,

00:45:47.667 --> 00:45:49.534
and let's take questions.

00:45:49.534 --> 00:45:51.534
And that's--that the URL
where you find everything.

00:45:51.534 --> 00:45:58.300
[applause]
Thank you.

00:45:59.901 --> 00:46:02.033
So we'll take questions
either at the microphone,

00:46:02.033 --> 00:46:04.767
and let me go ahead
and open up the...

00:46:04.767 --> 00:46:09.334
the I/O Moderator page.

00:46:09.334 --> 00:46:12.834
Any questions?

00:46:12.834 --> 00:46:17.868
man: The Google--
Google Earth Extensions...

00:46:17.868 --> 00:46:20.267
the--the walk functions.

00:46:20.267 --> 00:46:21.434
Nurik:
Right.

00:46:21.434 --> 00:46:23.868
man: Does it actually
walk through the...

00:46:23.868 --> 00:46:27.167
the XML or KML...

00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:29.634
Nurik: Yeah, it does.
man: The structures?

00:46:29.634 --> 00:46:31.133
Nurik: Say it again.
What was the last thing?

00:46:31.133 --> 00:46:33.467
man: So...

00:46:33.467 --> 00:46:35.267
would there be
a performance penalty

00:46:35.267 --> 00:46:37.267
if it has to walk through
to find something?

00:46:37.267 --> 00:46:38.534
Nurik: Okay,
so that's a good point,

00:46:38.534 --> 00:46:39.834
and I'm glad
you brought that up.

00:46:39.834 --> 00:46:43.601
So when you do
a Fetch KML,

00:46:43.601 --> 00:46:45.968
the only thing that
gets put into JavaScript

00:46:45.968 --> 00:46:47.601
is the root level item.

00:46:47.601 --> 00:46:50.667
As soon as you do
a KML DOM walk,

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:52.067
each of those items
is getting

00:46:52.067 --> 00:46:54.000
a JavaScript kind of
equivalent object.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.601
So there is a pretty large
performance penalty

00:46:56.601 --> 00:46:58.968
if--if your KML
is very large

00:46:58.968 --> 00:47:00.400
and if the last thing--

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.701
and if the actual thing
you're looking for

00:47:01.701 --> 00:47:02.968
is at the very end.

00:47:02.968 --> 00:47:04.968
man: Last placemark.
Nurik: Right, exactly.

00:47:04.968 --> 00:47:06.367
So there are edge--
there are cases

00:47:06.367 --> 00:47:08.934
where that can incur a pretty
large performance penalty,

00:47:08.934 --> 00:47:11.501
and for that reason,
a lot of...

00:47:11.501 --> 00:47:15.200
a lot of pretty simple things
like getting a feature by I.D.--

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.868
man: Or maybe support of XPAT,
I don't know if there's--

00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:19.434
Nurik: Right, so, like,
something like XPAT.

00:47:19.434 --> 00:47:21.133
That, I mean--
those things

00:47:21.133 --> 00:47:22.968
can be supported
in this utility library,

00:47:22.968 --> 00:47:25.367
but there--there are other
kind of ways of doing that.

00:47:25.367 --> 00:47:27.167
For example...

00:47:27.167 --> 00:47:29.067
a lot of people
have requested

00:47:29.067 --> 00:47:31.133
this to be natively part
of the Earth API.

00:47:31.133 --> 00:47:33.567
And that's--that's
an ongoing feature request.

00:47:33.567 --> 00:47:35.801
So it would be a lot faster,
of course,

00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:38.367
if--if "get feature by I.D."
or something like that

00:47:38.367 --> 00:47:39.667
was in the Earth API.

00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:40.934
And that's probably something

00:47:40.934 --> 00:47:42.634
that I'll work with
the software engineers

00:47:42.634 --> 00:47:43.934
to--to try to include.

00:47:43.934 --> 00:47:45.334
But there--
no guarantees,

00:47:45.334 --> 00:47:48.167
but that's--that's a pretty
honest feature request.

00:47:48.167 --> 00:47:51.567
man: So by I.D. just--
it has...

00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:52.934
Nurik:
Say it again.

00:47:52.934 --> 00:47:56.067
man: By I.D. just it has--
it's a lot faster.

00:47:56.067 --> 00:47:57.634
Nurik: Right.
Right, exactly.

00:47:57.634 --> 00:48:00.167
Exactly.
Yeah.

00:48:00.167 --> 00:48:03.167
man: The My Earth plugin stuff
looks pretty cool.

00:48:03.167 --> 00:48:04.267
Nurik:
Thanks.

00:48:04.267 --> 00:48:05.601
man: Is there some plans
to bring that

00:48:05.601 --> 00:48:07.267
to Firefox on Linux?

00:48:07.267 --> 00:48:08.801
Nurik:
Firefox on Linux?

00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:11.367
So support
for the Google Earth--

00:48:11.367 --> 00:48:13.968
so Google Earth plugin support
on Linux--

00:48:13.968 --> 00:48:16.367
I can't really
comment to that effect.

00:48:16.367 --> 00:48:18.501
Our product manager
is sitting right there

00:48:18.501 --> 00:48:22.300
so he'll be able to take
Linux-related questions and--

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.367
I absolutely knew I was going
to get that question, but--

00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:25.901
Peter: So I'm the one
who has to answer your questions

00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:28.133
when I have to not really
give you an answer.

00:48:28.133 --> 00:48:29.834
So we don't have anything
to announce right now.

00:48:29.834 --> 00:48:31.434
Obviously, we're very
interested in, you know,

00:48:31.434 --> 00:48:32.901
cross-platform support.

00:48:32.901 --> 00:48:37.701
But right now we just have
PC and Mac, so...

00:48:37.701 --> 00:48:39.501
man: But we do support Firefox
on those platforms.

00:48:39.501 --> 00:48:41.501
Nurik: Yeah, so Firefox
and Mac are supported,

00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:43.300
but Linux, again,
it's still questions--

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.567
up in the air.

00:48:45.567 --> 00:48:48.300
Any other questions?
Oh, yep.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.767
woman: When I last looked
at Google's sites,

00:48:50.767 --> 00:48:52.367
it didn't take IFRAMES.

00:48:52.367 --> 00:48:55.267
Do your IFRAME shims
go into Google sites

00:48:55.267 --> 00:48:57.400
and does this go--
go into Google sites,

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.067
or are there difficulties?

00:48:59.067 --> 00:49:02.133
Nurik: Right.
So usually, you can just--

00:49:02.133 --> 00:49:05.601
since it's a Google gadget
and sites support gadgets,

00:49:05.601 --> 00:49:06.934
arbitrary gadgets...
woman: Yes.

00:49:06.934 --> 00:49:08.734
Nurik: There usually is
no problem.

00:49:08.734 --> 00:49:11.467
Only recently
there's been a problem

00:49:11.467 --> 00:49:13.400
with API keys.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.167
woman: I think there was
a problem with Maps--

00:49:15.167 --> 00:49:16.634
yeah, that I came across.

00:49:16.634 --> 00:49:18.400
Nurik: Right,
so last I checked,

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.200
that problem was fixed.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.400
If it's not fixed,
then that's definitely

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.467
something that
we should look into further.

00:49:24.467 --> 00:49:26.033
But last I checked,
it was fixed.

00:49:26.033 --> 00:49:27.300
So what you would do--

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.200
let me just clarify
for everybody.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.334
There is a gadget URL,
right?

00:49:31.334 --> 00:49:34.467
So if you could do--
if you go to tr.im/embedkml,

00:49:34.467 --> 00:49:36.334
there's a gadget URL.

00:49:36.334 --> 00:49:37.767
It's actually just
an XML file.

00:49:37.767 --> 00:49:41.467
If you take that XML file
and give it to sites,

00:49:41.467 --> 00:49:44.100
like do, I think,
"add gadget by URL,"

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.968
and give that URL to sites,

00:49:45.968 --> 00:49:48.167
it should just work.

00:49:48.167 --> 00:49:49.434
Again, the only reason
it wouldn't work,

00:49:49.434 --> 00:49:50.667
to my knowledge,

00:49:50.667 --> 00:49:53.000
is if there's still
that API key problem.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
woman: Right.
Thanks.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.701
man: When you were drawing
the polygon on the Google Earth,

00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:03.000
you were setting
your vertices...

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.133
Nurik: Mm-hmm.

00:50:04.133 --> 00:50:05.534
man: Can you get
the latitude and longitude

00:50:05.534 --> 00:50:06.934
out of the vertices,

00:50:06.934 --> 00:50:09.501
or are they (x,y) coordinates
based on the map location?

00:50:09.501 --> 00:50:11.000
Nurik:
So...

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.701
they're all latitudes
and longitudes.

00:50:12.701 --> 00:50:14.501
I'm assuming
you're referring to, like,

00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:16.467
the editable line strings
and polygons--right.

00:50:16.467 --> 00:50:20.033
So...so you give it
a placemark

00:50:20.033 --> 00:50:22.033
that has a line string.

00:50:22.033 --> 00:50:24.567
The utility library
will notify you

00:50:24.567 --> 00:50:25.901
as soon as
there's any changes

00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:27.934
to that--to the--
to the vertices.

00:50:27.934 --> 00:50:29.267
man: Mm-hmm.

00:50:29.267 --> 00:50:30.734
Nurik: Right now,
it doesn't tell you

00:50:30.734 --> 00:50:32.501
which ver-vertex
was modified,

00:50:32.501 --> 00:50:35.200
so you won't--like,
you'll have to kind of...

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.000
kind of figure it out,
I guess.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.400
But that's--that's a pretty
simple thing to implement.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.601
So if that were
a feature request,

00:50:39.601 --> 00:50:40.801
that could be pretty simple.

00:50:40.801 --> 00:50:42.167
man: So given 12 vertices,
I would know--

00:50:42.167 --> 00:50:43.968
I'd have the latitude
and longitude of each point.

00:50:43.968 --> 00:50:46.434
Nurik: So if that feature
was implemented

00:50:46.434 --> 00:50:47.868
and it gave you
the vertex index,

00:50:47.868 --> 00:50:50.100
you'd just look
in your coordinates,

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.300
get that coordinate
at that index,

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.501
and get the latitude
and longitude

00:50:52.501 --> 00:50:53.634
and it'd be pretty simple.

00:50:53.634 --> 00:50:56.067
man: Thanks.
Nurik: Yeah.

00:50:56.067 --> 00:50:59.067
Any other questions?

00:50:59.067 --> 00:51:01.167
No. Okay.
Thanks, everybody, for coming.

00:51:01.167 --> 00:51:02.400
Oh, yep.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.234
man: Can we use
the same libraries

00:51:04.234 --> 00:51:06.000
for the Google Earth
Enterprise?

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.200
Nurik:
Google Earth Enterprise--

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.400
you should be able to.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.934
It's just JavaScript.

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:13.667
It's pure JavaScript,
so you should be able to, yeah,

00:51:13.667 --> 00:51:15.200
without a problem.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.434
man: Maps API 3,
it doesn't support--

00:51:18.434 --> 00:51:20.067
Nurik:
Oh, Maps API v3

00:51:20.067 --> 00:51:22.634
support for--support for
GSatellite 3D Map?

00:51:22.634 --> 00:51:25.968
It doesn't support that yet.

00:51:25.968 --> 00:51:28.634
But again, I can't comment
to whether or not it will,

00:51:28.634 --> 00:51:30.367
or any road map for that.

00:51:30.367 --> 00:51:33.434
But it doesn't support it
as of now.

00:51:33.434 --> 00:51:36.000
man: That
extensions library--

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.667
can you--
does it come packaged

00:51:37.667 --> 00:51:39.701
or does it reference
a lot of external URLs?

00:51:39.701 --> 00:51:43.033
Nurik: It comes
completely standalone.

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.934
And it's completely,
like, minified,

00:51:44.934 --> 00:51:46.667
so the--the full library--

00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:48.334
by the way,
the extensions library

00:51:48.334 --> 00:51:50.534
includes the geojs library

00:51:50.534 --> 00:51:53.767
and the exten--and the Earth API
extensions library.

00:51:53.767 --> 00:51:55.334
That library altogether
is 40K.

00:51:55.334 --> 00:51:56.901
It has
no external dependencies.

00:51:56.901 --> 00:51:59.234
man: I meant, like, for all
the images on the place...

00:51:59.234 --> 00:52:00.834
Nurik:
Oh, images?

00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:03.734
So it doesn't--so the only
images it works with

00:52:03.734 --> 00:52:06.300
are stock images.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.634
Images like the--
like the blue paddle,

00:52:08.634 --> 00:52:10.601
the red paddle,
things like that.

00:52:10.601 --> 00:52:12.534
The images for
the geometry toolbox

00:52:12.534 --> 00:52:13.868
that you saw in My Earth,

00:52:13.868 --> 00:52:16.934
those actually aren't part
of the utility library.

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:19.367
So those were just custom
for My Earth.

00:52:19.367 --> 00:52:20.734
But the utility library

00:52:20.734 --> 00:52:24.234
doesn't have any
image dependencies.

00:52:24.234 --> 00:52:25.767
Make sense?

00:52:25.767 --> 00:52:27.701
man: Yeah, kind of.
[chuckles]

00:52:27.701 --> 00:52:30.234
man: Do you know
of any techniques

00:52:30.234 --> 00:52:33.901
to capture thumbnails
and/or video of Google Earth?

00:52:33.901 --> 00:52:35.834
Nurik: That's--
again, that's been

00:52:35.834 --> 00:52:37.834
a very often
requested feature,

00:52:37.834 --> 00:52:39.734
specifically thumbnails
and screenshots

00:52:39.734 --> 00:52:42.901
for the use case
of printing, right?

00:52:42.901 --> 00:52:45.000
That's--in general,
it's kind of difficult.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.367
Just the simple way of--
the simple problem

00:52:48.367 --> 00:52:51.934
of how does
a client-side plugin

00:52:51.934 --> 00:52:55.367
create a stream that
the browser can access, right?

00:52:55.367 --> 00:52:57.834
One idea would be to use,
like, data URLs or something.

00:52:57.834 --> 00:52:59.367
It's just--
it's a technolog--

00:52:59.367 --> 00:53:01.467
it's a technical problem that's
pretty difficult to solve,

00:53:01.467 --> 00:53:04.167
and we are thinking about it,

00:53:04.167 --> 00:53:06.601
but we haven't had--
made any progress on that.

00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:08.334
One thing you can do--

00:53:08.334 --> 00:53:10.601
and again,
I don't know if this is...

00:53:10.601 --> 00:53:12.934
legal in terms
of imagery capture,

00:53:12.934 --> 00:53:15.868
but one thing
people have been able to do

00:53:15.868 --> 00:53:17.667
was to take the plugin,

00:53:17.667 --> 00:53:21.133
embed it in
a web browser control

00:53:21.133 --> 00:53:23.300
inside of, like,
a desktop application,

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.901
and then have
the desktop application

00:53:25.901 --> 00:53:27.167
take a screenshot of that.

00:53:27.167 --> 00:53:29.033
And I'm not sure if that--

00:53:29.033 --> 00:53:31.734
if that violates
any terms of service,

00:53:31.734 --> 00:53:33.133
and Peter
would probably know,

00:53:33.133 --> 00:53:35.167
but that's the technical way
of doing that.

00:53:35.167 --> 00:53:36.634
Peter: I'm always the bad guy
who has to come up here.

00:53:36.634 --> 00:53:38.767
So, yeah, I mean,
in general, within the terms,

00:53:38.767 --> 00:53:41.033
you're not allowed
to pull content

00:53:41.033 --> 00:53:42.901
out of the context
of Google Earth,

00:53:42.901 --> 00:53:45.200
so you can't like, you know,
take a screenshot

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.834
and bring that into
another application or something

00:53:46.834 --> 00:53:50.434
because that's
a violation of the terms.

00:53:50.434 --> 00:53:52.200
But we're also looking
at ways--are there, you know,

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.968
additional things
we can put into the API that--

00:53:53.968 --> 00:53:55.334
you know,
we have, for example,

00:53:55.334 --> 00:53:57.267
a static Maps API

00:53:57.267 --> 00:53:59.901
that allows you to embed images
from satellite imageries.

00:53:59.901 --> 00:54:06.300
That's one way that
you can bring that in, so...

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.467
Nurik:
All right.

00:54:07.467 --> 00:54:08.868
So it looks like
there's no more questions.

00:54:08.868 --> 00:54:10.267
Thanks, everybody,
for coming.

00:54:10.267 --> 00:54:13.367
And I just want to throw up
that URL again

00:54:13.367 --> 00:54:16.868
for anybody
that wants to...

00:54:16.868 --> 00:54:19.067
wait--there we go.

00:54:19.067 --> 00:54:21.033
So this URL
will have all the links

00:54:21.033 --> 00:54:23.400
to all the demos
that I've done today and--

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.934
as well as the links
to the utility libraries

00:54:25.934 --> 00:54:27.367
that we've just released.

00:54:27.367 --> 00:54:28.701
Thanks, everybody,
for coming.

00:54:28.701 --> 00:54:30.634
[applause]
