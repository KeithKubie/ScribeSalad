00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.790
Let's see if we can
learn a thing or

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.189
two about Sn2 reactions.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.790
And you're going to see a lot of
these in organic chemistry.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.880
This sounds like a
very fancy term.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.100
But it really just stands
for-- the S stands for

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.350
substitution.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.600
The n stands for nucleophilic.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.810
And then the 2, and this is
probably maybe the least

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.040
obvious part of Sn2, the 2 comes
from the fact that the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.570
rate-determining step
in this reaction

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.230
involves both reactants.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.595
And I'm going to show
you what we mean.

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:47.970
And it'll actually be probably
more clear when we compare it

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.800
to Sn1 reactions.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.740
So let me show you
an Sn2 reaction.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.840
Let's say we have
bromomethane.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.270
And let me draw it in
three dimensions.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.190
You have a hydrogen
sticking out.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.980
Maybe the bromine is
right over there.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.900
And then you have another
hydrogen in the back.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.080
And then you have a hydrogen
that comes up just like that.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.570
And here, the three dimensions
won't matter that much.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.160
This is not a chiral carbon.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.800
There's no handedness here.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.560
But in the future, we'll think
about chiral carbons and what

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.640
might happen to them as they
undergo Sn2 reactions.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.440
So I have this bromomethane
here.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.920
And let's say we also have
some hydroxide in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.810
solution with it.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.640
So it's a hydroxide,
and this oxygen has

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.590
seven valence electrons.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.070
You could imagine that the way
that you get a hydroxide is if

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.620
you start off with water,
that looks like this.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.160
And maybe there's another water
someplace else that

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.630
looks like that.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.860
And maybe in one step, this
water right here takes this

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.509
guy's hydrogen.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390
Remember, there's a partially
positive charge on the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.220
hydrogen, partially negative
charge on the oxygen.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.070
So maybe he gives one of his
electrons to the hydrogen,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.850
which will end up with
a positive charge.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.190
It'll be a hydronium cation.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.740
And then this electron takes
back that extra electron from

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.560
the hydrogen.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.180
And so now, he's going to have
seven valence electrons.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.220
He's going to have this one.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.970
That was at this end of the
bond of the one that he's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.870
taking back.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.560
And then that's two, three,
four, five, six, and then this

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.680
electron right there, seven.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.440
So he's going to have one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.740
seven valence electrons.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.250
And he's going to have
a negative charge.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.610
It's neutral when it's water.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.060
When he takes an extra electron,
it's going to have a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.670
negative charge.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.600
And you could imagine this is in
a solution with water, that

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.570
water is our solvent.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.390
So let me put a negative
charge right here.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.010
I can write minus 1 if I want.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.850
And in this reaction, just so
we know what's what, this

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.610
hydroxide molecule, or this
hydroxide anion, is our

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.240
nucleophile.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.900
It is the nucleophile
right there.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.430
And the best way to think about
a nucleophile is it

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.970
likes other people's
nucleuses.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.600
It likes them because nucleuses
are positive.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.040
It has extra electrons.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.300
In this case, it has a negative
charge, so it is

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.020
attracted to other nucleuses.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.530
Nucleuses of atoms are positive,
so it is attracted

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.800
to electrons.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.950
Phile, I'm not a Greek scholar,
but it means to be

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.230
attracted or to like

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.670
something, so it likes nucleuses.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.320
And if you want to compare it
to acids or bases, you'd

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.520
classify this actually as a
Lewis base, something that

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.180
gives electrons.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.910
But we're not going to go
into that right now.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.990
This is a nucleophile.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.700
It is attracted to nucleuses,
to positive things.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.390
It wants to give
away electrons.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.780
Now, what's going to happen is
that this is going to give an

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.580
electron to this carbon.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.980
This carbon's going to say,
oh, I got an electron.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.775
Let me give away an electron to
somebody who probably wants

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:19.620
it really badly.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.470
And in this case, it's going
to be the bromine because

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.820
we've seen multiple times
that the bromine is very

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.710
electronegative.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.770
It already is starting to hog
the electrons, and it would

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.830
like to take an electron
altogether.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.700
And so let me show
you the reaction.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.630
It's going to happen
very quickly.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.172
Or it's actually going to happen
very quickly the way I

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:39.630
drew it, because it's really
a one-step reaction.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.780
So you're going to have one of
these electrons right here

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.310
will attack the carbon.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.310
Or I shouldn't say attack.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.670
It sounds very aggressive.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.070
It will be given
to the carbon.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.430
And then the carbon says, oh,
I'm getting an electron from

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.980
this direction.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.840
It actually has a slightly
positive charge at this end,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.960
because the bromine is hogging
some of the electrons, so

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.410
they'll be attracted
to each other.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.080
They're going to bump into each
other just the right way.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.820
And then at the exact same time,
this all has to happen

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.800
kind of simultaneously.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.310
At the exact same time, this
electron, sitting at that end

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.110
of the bond, is going to
go to the bromine.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.680
And so what is it going to look
like when this reaction

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.120
has actually occurred?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.630
So it's literally a
one-step reaction.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.220
So you have your carbon.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.480
You have the hydrogen
that is pointing up.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.710
Now, let me color code this.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.860
So that'll make it
interesting.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.750
So you have this hydrogen,
that is

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.253
coming out of the screen.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.960
And it's still just coming
straight out of the screen,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.070
but I'm going to draw it to the
down right, because this

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.010
hydroxide's attacking
from behind.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.290
And this bromine, which we call
the leaving group, or

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.420
actually, it's going to be a
bromide anion once it leaves,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.800
that's going to leave
from the right.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.330
Attack from the left, leave
from the right,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.890
from different sides.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.090
So then this is that hydrogen
that's sticking out.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.830
The hydrogen in the back--
well, we know it's in the

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.960
back, so I'll just continue to
draw it in the back like that.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.570
And now this hydroxide
is going to be

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.100
attached to the carbon.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:29.140
So this carbon now gets one of
those electrons, and it is

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.530
bonded now to the oxygen.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.620
Let me draw the oxygen.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.640
So you have the oxygen.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.960
Let me see the best way
that I could do this.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.710
So you have the oxygen here
bonded to a hydrogen.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.150
And let me draw its
valence electrons.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:50.930
So it had one, two, three, four,
five, six, and then it

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.520
had a seventh electron, but
it just gave it away.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.890
So its seventh electron is going
to bond with this one.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.480
They were already a
pair over here.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.800
Let me make it very clear
what the color is.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.030
This electron right over
there is this electron.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.800
But it was already paired with
this guy, so when he gives it

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.150
away to the carbon, it forms
this covalent bond right here.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.500
So now you have this OH group,
this hydroxyl group, off of

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.450
the carbon now.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.850
And now the bromine, you had a
negatively charged group here.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.150
Now, what I've drawn so far,
everything is neutral.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.630
So something has to be
negatively charged.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.850
It's going to be the bromine
because that's what getting

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.180
the electron.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.940
So now the bromine, if I wanted
to draw bromine's

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.750
valence shell, before it would
have seven electrons, so one,

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.910
two, three, four, five,
six, seven.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.040
Now that it's taking that
electron from carbon, it's

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.710
going to have eight: one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.220
and let me color
code it again.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.880
So this electron right here,
when it goes to the bromine,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.850
is going to be that electron
right there, and we're going

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.630
to have a negative charge.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.510
And so here, in this situation,
just to make sure,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.950
this is the nucleophile.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:09.030
The bromine right here, this
is the leaving group.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.200
And then the carbon, I guess
the thing that is reacting,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.850
that's getting substituted,
where the bromine leaves it

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.370
and the hydroxide joins it,
that's called the substrate.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.610
So I could draw it like this.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.860
This is the substrate.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.470
And the whole reason why
I did it, this was

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.720
not a chiral carbon.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.630
But you could imagine, once we
deal with chiral carbons, when

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.760
they undergo an Sn2 reaction
like this, their chirality

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.039
will actually change.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.340
So I'll leave you
there right now.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.490
That'll give you something to
think about, Sn2 reactions.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.270
And then in the next video,
we'll think a

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.220
little bit about Sn1.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.810
Oh, and before I leave you, I
left you hanging on the 2.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.210
I said this is called
substitution.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.740
You saw that the bromine was
substituted by the hydroxide.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.710
It's nucleophilic.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.460
It involved this hydroxide,
which likes nucleuses.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.610
And then I said the
rate-determining step involves

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.440
both reactants.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.030
And here, it might not be
completely clear, but the

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.570
rate-determining step
was actually what's

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.690
going on right here.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.900
And if I were to draw an
intermediate, you could

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:24.242
actually draw an intermediate
step here.

00:09:24.242 --> 00:09:30.100
Let me copy and paste
this down here.

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:35.210
So you could actually draw an
intermediate step, so let me

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.210
copy the other one.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.880
Let me copy this.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.540
Copy and paste.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.300
This all happens over one step,
but if we wanted to show

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:54.290
what happens in between, for a
small amount of time, you have

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.400
this transition state, where the
carbon is going to have a

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.740
partial bond, so it has
this hydrogen in blue.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.790
Let me draw this hydrogen
in blue sticking out.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.020
And it has another hydrogen
behind it.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.960
I'll draw it like it's
right behind it.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.600
And then for some small fraction
of time, it is bonded

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.415
to both the bromine-- so I'll
draw it with a dotted line.

00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:21.450
It is bonded to both the
bromine, which now will have a

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.450
partial negative charge because
it's starting to get

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:35.170
an electron, and it's also
bonded to the hydroxide, which

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.360
also has a partial
negative charge.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.230
You can imagine this negative
charge is now getting split

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.730
between the two.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.320
This is a transition state.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.360
And the notation for a
transition state, you put

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.830
brackets around it, or
parentheses, in some cultures,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.020
they call them, and you write
this little symbol up here.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.020
This tells us this is
a transition state.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.100
This is not one of the
semi-stable intermediates.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.890
This is something that
we're going through.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.680
This is an Sn2 reaction because
this transition state

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.460
is actually what determines
the rate of the reaction.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.490
This requires the highest energy
state of this reaction.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.300
This is what's going to-- well,
I said it already--

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.500
determine its rate.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.000
And in this transition state,
this rate-determining step,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.270
you have all of the reactants.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.830
You have your hydroxide right
there, and you also have your

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.070
bromomethane that we
started with, so it

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.860
has two of the reactants.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.560
That's why it's called
an Sn2 reaction.
