00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.370
Now I'm sure you were a pro at what you just did,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.560
so let's try to make things a little more complicated. Now the nice

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.476
thing in genetics is if we want to make things complicated, all we

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:12.167
have to do is add one more gene. And boom, we've increased our

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:15.740
complication factor exponentially here. So we are starting kind of slow, we're

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.890
just going to try to do two genes at once now instead of one.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.070
Let's try to look at the trait of lactose intolerance and dwarfism at

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.560
the same time. Now, the lactase gene is on chromosome two. And the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.890
FGFR3 gene, which, controls the trait of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.130
achondroplasia, which causes dwarfism, is on chromosome four.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.610
And let's say we have an individual who's

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.340
heterozygous for both conditions. They're heterozygous For lactase

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.460
persistence, so they are lactose tolerant, and they're

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.310
also heterozygous for the dominant allele that causes

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.390
dwarfism. Which means that they're also going to

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.570
be a little person. Now, to help us

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.010
know which plus and minus symbol goes with

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.311
which trait. I'm going to put in L next to

00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:00.351
the alleles for lactose intolerance and a D next

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:03.900
to the alleles for dwarfism. Now instead of trying

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.940
to figure out all the probabilities of what

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.480
the next generation would be. Let's just focus in

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.220
on how this one person is heterozygous for both

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.720
of these traits is actually going to make their gametes.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.520
And what are the possible allelle combinations for them to make

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.790
their gametes? So after meiosis, how many different allelic combinations or

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.360
genotypes can there possibly be for this individual? They're heterozygous for

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.670
the lactase gene and they're heterozygous for the gene causing dwarfism.
