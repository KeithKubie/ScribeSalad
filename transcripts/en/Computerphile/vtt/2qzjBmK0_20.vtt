00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
Let's start by drawing a diagram of what
we might call the eternal triangle

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.670
really, There's Charles Babbage but then
there's this other well-known person

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.840
that we need to include in our story
Ada Lovelace. And in the end among

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:28.800
Charles Babbage's many proposed designs
there was one for what really is the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
world's first, stored-program,
Turing-complete computer. It's the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.730
Analytical Engine. The only problem is
it's totally mechanical. Let me link these

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.579
with double-headed arrows and we'll move
about this diagram - sort of keep it in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.149
view most of the time. The sources of
material?  Really I became aware of these

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.180
when I went to an Ada Lovelace symposium,
last December. And, yes, it's taken me

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.879
almost a year to digest it all and to
prepare these talks. Let's begin at the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.610
beginning and let's begin at the top left of
my diagram.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.470
Some of you may recall that actually I did
mention Charles Babbage - in a video I did

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.490
on "Why Binary", trying to explain why the
binary system came to dominate in computers:

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.390
[video insert]  "Large scale automation of
manufacture wasn't quite there in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.120
Babbage's time and he moaned like mad at
the invoices - the bills - he had to pay to ..."

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.860
We're talking about the 1820s,
roughly, where the story starts and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.680
saying that he was a very celebrated
mathematician, but his big forte was that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.550
he wanted to actually be able to
automate the production, initially, of log

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.290
tables. Now those of you at the older end
of the audience may well, at high school,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.770
have been taught - before, y'know, hand
calculators even came in - that the way to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.860
do multiplications was to turn them into
additions by using things called

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.239
'logarithms'. So tabulating log tables was
the most enormously important thing to

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.500
do. I've got here the log tables I used

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.420
at school and Stephen Wolfram in his blog
says that even he, who was rather younger

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.720
than me, did do multiplication by 
adding together

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.250
logarithms and then taking the so-called
'antilog' of themm when he was at High

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.760
School. Those are four-figure precision
log tables. Here - very ancient book I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.810
bought second-hand ages ago -
these are seven-figure log tables.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.920
So, therefore, yeah, you looked up logs, you
added the logs, you turned them backwards

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.200
with things called 'antilogs' and that  was
the only [faster] way, for years, of doing

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.900
complicated multiplications. So Charles
Babbage actually did supervise the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.700
production of log tables - as it were 'by
hand' -  before he ever got interested in

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.030
mechanizing it. So, a lot of the early Victorian log

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.220
tables have got Charles Babbage's name on
them. But it drove him mad, because first

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.930
of all there was the problem of computing
these log tables. Worst of all, and he saw

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.610
very clearly, another big problem was
getting them printed. The mathematicians

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.390
who drew them up might well have got
them perfectly right but they handed

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.980
them over to the typesetters for
printing. And the typesetters, of course, tried

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.239
their darnedest,  couldn't read the
handwriting, and made typo mistakes all

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.459
through. And just checking them was a pain !
He came from a sort of gentlemanly

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.310
background - was not fabulously wealthy -
but well enough off to afford a good

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.389
lifestyle. During his career at Cambridge
he eventually became the Lucasian

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.010
Professor of Mathematics. Those of you
into the history of maths - keen followers

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.480
of 'Numberphile' - will know that perhaps
the most famous Lucasian Professor was

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.970
Isaac Newton himself. And more recently
- until very recently I think - when he's

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.500
given up, it's Stephen Hawking [who is] the
Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.660
Charles Babbage was not in my view as 
illustrious as those two,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.549
I mean Newton and Gauss and people [like that] 
were just at a level of genius way beyond

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.880
most mortals but you know he was a
perfectly creditable appointment. And like

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.000
his predecessor, Newton, oh boy! was he
thin-skinned! He couldn't take criticism

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.470
and what's more, if he was around
today, he would have been banned from

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.169
Email, Facebook and Twitter already! He
loved flaming people - people who were

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.840
stupid not to realize the value of what
he wanted to do and even more the stupid

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.860
grant givers. Because he did get grants
to build these engines they were so

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.150
penny-pinching and  stupid and lacking in
foresight. And when people said to him

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.090
"Look Babbage, you are your own worst enemy!
Why do you do this?",  he had a bright idea:

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.900
he would continue to flame but he would
write anonymously. Of course his writing

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.780
style and the fact that nobody else would rant on

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.910
immediately gave the game away. Yes it's
Babbage again! So this was the backdrop

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.990
then, but he did actually draw up designs
for a very general kind of

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.080
hand-cranked engine that could do more
than just log tables. From the mathematical

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.290
point of view it could be set up to do
any mathematical problem that could be

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:44.820
represented as a function of polynomials.
Those of you who have done this stuff will know

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.990
Taylor series, Maclaurin series - all this kind of
stuff. Yes, a big class of problems

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.760
including producing sine tables or cosine
tables, and lots of others. So you could

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.340
say that this these so-called Difference
Engines of Babbage's were, if you like,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.320
Special Purpose computers. People at the
time thought they were totally

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.880
wonderful - but do remember they are special
purpose; they can do calculations but

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.230
only things that can be expressed
as sums of polynomials. Think if you like

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.280
- for those of you who have watched the Bletchley 
Park series - a bit like programming the Bombe

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.900
for whatever is the settings on Enigma
today. That electro- mechanical

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.490
calculator, the Bombe, is a special purpose
computer. It can do wonderful things but

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.170
they have to be related to the settings
for Enigma machines. The Difference

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.160
Engines could do wonderful things but
only to things that could, in the end, be

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.970
reduced to the Method of Differences. So
don't think these are general-purpose

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:45.030
computers they're not. There you were in
the 1820s - which was before precision

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.690
machinery became available - driven by
electricity. That couldn't happen until the

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.670
end of the 19th century. And yet you needed
not a few dozen cogwheels, that you

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.660
might need for a clock - you know
a typical clock, maybe a dozen [or] two dozen

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.960
cogwheels, highly carefully done by
precision engineers and all this

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.610
kind of stuff. You needed hundreds and
thousands of these wretched things! And

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.700
so the bills from the gear cutting
technicians, to Babbage, sent him into a

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.849
rage. He then passed these on to the
government who were funding him

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:23.589
And despite all of this only little bits
of Difference Engines I and II 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:28.990
were built which he kept to give people
demos and the yells came from the

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:35.259
funders: "When are we ever going to see this
with these machines realized?  You want

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:38.050
more money? Babbage you are joking we have 
now given

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:43.479
you at the end of Difference Engine II,
first stage - we've given you 17,000

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:49.659
pounds! Babbage, that is enough to build
two battleships. Two of Lord Nelson's

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:55.119
'Victory's could be built for 17,000
pounds". Babbage had not delivered, but

00:07:55.119 --> 00:08:00.849
like every bad software supplier you've
ever known Babbage had the perfect answer

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:05.559
to these critics. Whenever they
said: "But you haven't delivered!" it was

00:08:05.559 --> 00:08:11.619
always: "Tell you what, let's forget about
the Mark I. It was not good anyway. I've had

00:08:11.619 --> 00:08:15.699
a far better idea. Here's my set of plans for 
Mark II. And of 

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:19.719
course they bought it between Difference
Engine I and Difference Engine II. Maybe a

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:25.479
little bit more money would cause it to
happen? But when he started getting a

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:31.360
whole load of flak about not being able
to deliver Difference Engine II, he had an

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.269
even better idea: "Let's forget Difference
Engine II. I've had a far better idea for

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:43.569
a machine that will far transcend only
what can be done by Sums of Polynomials

00:08:43.569 --> 00:08:49.360
or the Method of Differences. This will be
able to do, basically, an infinitely wide

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.029
range of computations - not just different
variants on the same thing.

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:58.750
It's wonderful and I'm going to call it the
Analytical Engine. Of course, it will need

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.709
at least ten, or a hundred, times the
number of cogs than the ones I haven't

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:06.880
built, that never mind! It would be silly
to waste more money on Difference Engine

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.290
II when I've had this great vision for
the Analytical Engine". Did Difference

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.680
Engine II ever get built?
Yes it did, in the early 1990s

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.740
His drawings and his technology
were absolutely spot-on and the curator -

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.540
one of the heroes of our story here - is a
guy called Doron Swade.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.550
He got the Difference Engine built at
the [UK] Science Museum.  Once you've built one

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.300
of them for the Science Museum, which you
can see ...  After a request from Bill Gates

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.310
and Nathan Myhrvold, respectively of
course, CEO and Chief Technical Officer

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.529
of Microsoft at the time, they built
another Difference Engine, shipped out to

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:51.100
Microsoft headquarters in Seattle. Then I
think sent out to the Museum of

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.870
Computing History in Mountain View. But the
last I heard is it's migrated back to

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.949
Seattle. Whether back to Microsoft, or
somewhere else, I don't know. Maybe to some

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:06.850
other museum. So, anyway, it did get built.
And what Doron Swade proved was that the

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:13.269
tolerances that Babbage set on those
gearwheels - how far apart the teeth

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:19.089
were apart and all that - were perfectly 
do-able. And I think it was built in the

00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:23.800
precision workshops down in the basement of 
the Science Museum but basically here's the

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.730
wonderful thing, you know: "What did you
need to do this properly?"  Answer:

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:35.019
"A computer-controlled gear-cutting machine 
in orderto get this early technology working".

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:39.190
Which really wasn't the technology of
choice for doing this kind of thing.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.490
&gt;&gt; Sean: I've just been wondering if it's 
possible, maybe, to do that with 3D printing now?"

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.319
&gt;&gt; DFB: "You probably could you know! I've never
thought of that" 
&gt;&gt; Sean: "But if people could 3D print ..."

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:52.540
&gt;&gt; DFB: I wonder if you could 3D print ...? So anyway
&gt;&gt; Sean: There's a challenge to the viewers!

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:58.569
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yeah! So here we are then here is somebody 
who could

00:10:58.569 --> 00:11:02.860
never finish things. The next release
would always solve it. The next release

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.730
would always cost ten times more to
develop than the present one - which was

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.649
already way over budget.
He did have the vision and his massive

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:18.310
number of drawings, diagrams and so on
were vital. And they did work. However,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:22.120
reverting back to the guru, Doron Swade,
again let's just finish with the

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.970
following observations:  Charles Babbage
adorned his drawings with all sorts of

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.550
his own short-hand. It was called the Mechanical

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:35.410
Notation. He never wrote a user manual
for it. So you had to, more or less, work

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.839
out from the circumstances what these
little squiggles meant. And as Doron

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:44.589
explained to me it didn't matter too much
when he was building Difference Engine II

00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:50.079
because that was so close to other
calculators - which go all the way back to

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:55.420
Blaise Pascal in 1642 - you didn't need to
understand every single squiggle. You

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.050
just could get the idea straight away of
what to do.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.670
Not so with the Analytical Engine, which
is far more complicated.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.940
Is there going to be an attempt to
rebuild the Analytical Engine?

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:13.630
Yes, and it's under way and Doron Swade is in charge 
of the BCS [British Computer Society] specialist

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.620
little group looking at this. And if it ever
gets built it'll be built at Bletchley

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.959
Park - I think is the current idea. So I
asked Doron and I said: "Well, if I understand

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:25.899
rightly the Analytical Engine has got
so many cogs you can't hand-crank it -

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:30.160
it's out of the question?"  Babbage was going to
drive it by steam. "I do hope, if you ever

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.940
built a replica ..." And his face went ...
and he said: "You can forget

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:39.670
any idea, if we ever get this thing built
 - and we're talking decades not

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:47.470
single years, right - we're not going to
drive it by steam! And also we really

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.029
cannot make progress until we understand
Babbage's notation". So, that's the

00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:57.040
state-of-the-art at the moment. They're trying
to understand some of the really obscure

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.570
things in the Analytic [Engine] design which just
have to be understood before they can

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:07.379
make real progress.
