ARUN NAGARAJAN: Hello,
and welcome.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.280
My name's Arun Nagarajan, and in
this video tutorial, we're

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.860
going to talk about building
your very first Script.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.450
So this is a great tutorial
that we have in our

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.230
developer's site.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.535
You can find it very easily.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:18.327
So if you go to developers.googl

00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:23.360
e.com/apps-script, it's the
very first 5-minute

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.040
Quickstart.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.730
So very first script,
and here it is.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.570
And you should actually look
through the tutorial a little

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.369
bit to get the sense for all the
different requirements and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.370
some of the background
information you need.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.320
The important things are having
some familiarity with

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.120
JavaScript.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.790
You don't have to be an
expert in JavaScript.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.910
And also, of course, you need
to have a Google account of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.920
some sort, a Gmail account, or
if your work is on Google, you

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.440
can use that account as well.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.570
And the goal is at the end of
this, we'll have a functioning

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.950
script that does a couple of
interesting things that you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.140
could then take and extend it
as you please or use it as a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.455
starting ground to understand
how Apps Script works, and you

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:00.470
can start from scratch
from there on.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.510
And yes, so this kind of
introductory information about

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.570
what a Script is, I think a lot
of it is worthwhile for

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.610
you to peruse through.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060
In this particular video, we'll
just kind of roll right

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.450
ahead and start coding
pretty quickly here.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.530
And the very first thing you
want to do is open up a tab

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.780
and go to script.google.com.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260
And you can do this in
any modern browser.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.670
I'm using a Chromebook here,
and it could be Internet

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.610
Explorer 9, 10, or Safari,
or Firefox as well.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.010
The very first time you go
to this URL you may be

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.380
prompted to log in.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.870
You may even get a
welcome screen.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.260
Just make sure you find the
Start Scripting button and go

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.830
right into it.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.610
And here it is.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.120
This is our Script Editor.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.410
And for this particular
tutorial, I'm just going to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.860
copy and paste the code from the
tutorial document itself.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.710
So we'll go back to this tab,
and you can see that the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.560
screenshots kind of show
you what the Script

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.010
Editor looks like.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.800
And here's the function
that we care for.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.260
You can see that.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.170
It's a very few set
of lines here.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.910
Even with spacing, I think we're
talking about just about

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.340
two dozen lines of code with a
lot of comments and spacing.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.500
And you can see that the
function itself is called

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.070
Create And Send Document.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.890
So you can suspect what
this is about to do.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.190
So I'll go ahead and hit Save.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.790
So the keyboard shortcut for
that is Control-S, or you can

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.030
hit the little Save
button as well.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.740
And I'll call this my first
script, save that.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.860
And you notice that the dropdown
here, populated with

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.760
the set of functions
that we had here.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.110
And the only function we have
here, of course, is Create And

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.410
Send Document.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.010
And that's it.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.680
I think we're ready
to run the script.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.390
We'll talk about what's in the
script itself in a little bit.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.370
Let's see it in action first.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.725
I'm going to hit this
Run button.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.900
Now, this is very important.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.610
So when you run a script,
you have to give it some

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.400
authorization.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.050
And when you run it from the
Script Editor itself, it has

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.510
to take the authorization
of the script owner, the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.180
developer here, which
is yourself.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.560
So you have to authorize it.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.380
This does take a couple
of clicks.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.070
But it's important to ensure
that we get the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.330
security part right.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.420
So the very first time
you run it, it just

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.660
authorizes the script.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.860
You have to run it once more in
order for you to actually

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.620
get the script to do what
you want it to do.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.230
So I'm going to hit the Run
button, which is the play

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.960
button that you're used to from
other script environments

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.240
or coding environments.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.020
And that's it.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.060
In this particular
script, we're

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.160
not showing an interface.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.450
We're not actually displaying
anything back.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.270
We're just running behind
the scenes.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.470
So let's go take a
look at my Gmail.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.880
So you'll notice that I have
a new email in my inbox.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.030
The number one popped
up there.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.570
When I click into it,
here's what it says.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.550
It says "Hello for my first
Google Apps Script," and it

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.440
sends me a link to a document.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.710
I'll click into it, and I'll see
that it is just a regular

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.320
Google document populated
with some content.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.580
And just to confirm, if I go to
my drive, I see a document

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.290
populated there as well
when I ran this.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.370
So let's now go take a look
at the script itself.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.752
So you can see that just in the
few lines of code, what we

00:03:59.752 --> 00:04:02.990
were able to do is create a
Google document, add some

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.280
contents to it, get its link,
and then send it as an email

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.920
to a person that I want
to send an email to.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.210
I think in this case it's
sending it to myself.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.149
So very succinct set of code
here to get you started.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.640
Create a document, append some
content in a paragraph, close

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.030
it, get the URL, get the email
address of the person that's

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.620
running the script, and then
using Gmail app, send them the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.810
link to that document.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.240
There's the email address.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.210
There's the subject, and
there's the body.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.300
So hopefully, this kind
of got you started.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.790
This was probably your very
first Google Apps Script.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.110
There's a lot more of what
Apps Script can do.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.990
Go take a look at our
documentation.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.710
Go walk through other tutorials
that we have.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.930
And we're very excited to
see what you can build.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.220
Thank you very much.
