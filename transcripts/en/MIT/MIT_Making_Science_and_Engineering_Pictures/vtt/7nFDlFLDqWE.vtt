00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.650
PROFESSOR: Here's a case
study of five devices.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.310
Once again, I
really encourage you

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.590
to see who the researchers
are in the visual index

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.000
at the end of this material.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.550
This is pretty wonderful stuff.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.480
So we have five devices,
three on the right

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.890
and two on the left.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.780
Notice the composition-- not
boringly lined up in a row.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.350
So this image was taken in
let's call it the default mode,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.970
as most of the others.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.410
So to remind you, this
is with reflected light

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.040
coming from below the glass.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.270
The light bounces
off the device and is

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.800
read by the sensor below, again.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.470
Pretty standard setting
on your flatbed scanner,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.090
as if you were
scanning a document.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.350
Now look what
happens when we use

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.250
transmitted light, that
is, light from above,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.160
where the information is
still captured from beneath.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.870
You'll see that the left two
are just rectangles of black.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.460
And that's because, of
course, that the light

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.880
is prevented from
being transmitted

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.770
through the solid silicon chip.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.670
No light is reaching the sensor.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.700
Whereas the others on the
right are showing some detail,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.380
since they are
somewhat transparent.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.210
Remember, the sensor
is beneath the glass.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.520
So as we zoom in, the
slides on the right

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.760
show some pretty
interesting detail--

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.420
detail that we would not
see with reflected light.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.342
You might want to
pause the video here

00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:42.300
to see the differences.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.720
The luxury here is
having the ability

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.500
to transmit light
through your sample.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.970
My flatbed scanner has a
light source in the cover.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.980
I set my scanner in the
transmitted light mode,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.640
as if we were scanning film
or other transparent material.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.000
But you should play around
with your own setups.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.330
For example, here I just opened
the cover of the scanner.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.840
This sitting in
the scanner is set

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.320
to scan with reflected light.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.530
This is one of those examples
when experimenting can give us

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.035
an unusual result-- something
new and possibly useful.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.720
OK.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.680
Let's take a look
at biological growth

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.280
in a Petri dish for
another case study.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.300
This is showing E. coli
growing under four conditions.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.510
I put the Petri
dish on the scanner,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.050
and once again use the
default reflected light.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.030
Capture it at a pretty high
resolution, around 400 megs

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.660
for the whole image.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.520
Looks good.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.970
But as we zoom in, we're
getting some dust and dirt

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.710
on the surface of
the Petri dish.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.630
I'm not happy about that.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.470
So I decided to try
transmitted light,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.590
as we just saw before in
our previous case study.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.600
My scanner, remember, has a
light source in its cover,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.750
giving me transmitted
light, that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.450
is a light coming from above.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.100
Using this transmitted
light approach

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.460
make sense for bacterial
and biological growth

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.000
in Petri dishes.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.620
If you don't have a scanner
that has the light in its cover,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.900
then you might have some
luck with reflected light.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.270
But I wanted to make a
particular point here.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.090
Here, I'm using a mobile phone
camera, making a picture that

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.400
is pretty OK, just
quickly showing what's

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.920
going on here in the
Petri dish, but compared

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.300
to this high-resolution scanned
image using transmitted light,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.390
and it's a whole
different world.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.220
I'm overlapping
here the phone image

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.610
over the transmitted
scanned image

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.480
so that you can see the
important point here.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.450
The phone image is
considerably smaller

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.300
in terms of its file size,
so that when we zoom in

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.970
closely on the computer screen
with each of these images

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.680
we see pretty significant
differences in resolution.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.110
In this scanned image
of about 400 megs,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.570
you can see remarkable detail
as we move into the image.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.760
But the phone image,
well, let's just

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.880
say is not totally remarkable.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.630
So it depends on what you'll
be using these images for.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.930
I really do want
to encourage you

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.970
to get the very best image you
can from the very beginning.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.460
It's the difference
between spending one minute

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.080
on an image and six
minutes, let's say.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.900
My hope is that you see that
spending the additional five

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.250
minutes is pretty
much worth the time.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.090
Don't you think?
