game theory is a strategic theory in
 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.420
game theory is a strategic theory in
which there are generally two or more

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430
which there are generally two or more
 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.080
which there are generally two or more
players so-called or actors and the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090
players so-called or actors and the
 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.359
players so-called or actors and the
outcome of their game depends on the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369
outcome of their game depends on the
 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.750
outcome of their game depends on the
choices of all the players so it's an

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760
choices of all the players so it's an
 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.109
choices of all the players so it's an
interdependent decision situation and a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119
interdependent decision situation and a
 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.740

I've also done applications to sports a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050
I've also done applications to sports a
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.680

selection of draft players for example
 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.900
selection of draft players for example
in professional sports leagues so those

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910
in professional sports leagues so those
 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.500

take it walk us through a biblical
 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.520
take it walk us through a biblical
example of that okay i could try take

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530
example of that okay i could try take
 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.550
example of that okay i could try take

being harassed all the time for the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
being harassed all the time for the
 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.960
being harassed all the time for the
secret of strength but he refuses in the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970
secret of strength but he refuses in the
 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.760

first two attempts at the Iowa has

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770
first two attempts at the Iowa has
 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.830
first two attempts at the Iowa has
finally he succumbs and he tells the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840
finally he succumbs and he tells the
 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.020
finally he succumbs and he tells the
secret of his strength and then bad

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
secret of his strength and then bad
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.510
secret of his strength and then bad
things happen afterwards so Samson gets

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520
things happen afterwards so Samson gets
 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.850
things happen afterwards so Samson gets
his revenge in the end and I think the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860
his revenge in the end and I think the
 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.440
his revenge in the end and I think the
interesting question you can ask about

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450
interesting question you can ask about
 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.840
interesting question you can ask about
this story is how could somebody like

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850
this story is how could somebody like
 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.860
this story is how could somebody like
Samson be so stupid as to ignore several

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
Samson be so stupid as to ignore several
 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.640
Samson be so stupid as to ignore several
warnings and my answer is that if you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650
warnings and my answer is that if you
 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.710
warnings and my answer is that if you
look at Samson's previous career he

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720
look at Samson's previous career he
 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.630
look at Samson's previous career he
lusted after almost every woman he met

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640
lusted after almost every woman he met
 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.479
lusted after almost every woman he met
every beautiful woman anyway and Delilah

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489
every beautiful woman anyway and Delilah
 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.060
every beautiful woman anyway and Delilah
was the latest so you can explain his

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070
was the latest so you can explain his
 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.390
was the latest so you can explain his
behavior is rational in terms of this

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400
behavior is rational in terms of this
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.720
behavior is rational in terms of this
interest in women allowing him to think

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730
interest in women allowing him to think
 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.540
interest in women allowing him to think
that he was taking a risk maybe in

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550
that he was taking a risk maybe in
 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.979
that he was taking a risk maybe in
telling the secret of his strength is

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989
telling the secret of his strength is
 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.520
telling the secret of his strength is
going here which of course was cut off

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530
going here which of course was cut off
 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.010
going here which of course was cut off
but it might not be disastrous in the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020
but it might not be disastrous in the
 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.040
but it might not be disastrous in the
end it was disastrous Samson was

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050
end it was disastrous Samson was
 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.660
end it was disastrous Samson was
mutilated he was treated with derision

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670
mutilated he was treated with derision
 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.729
mutilated he was treated with derision
but he got his revenge he was placed

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739
but he got his revenge he was placed
 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.180
but he got his revenge he was placed
between two pillars his hair had grown

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190
between two pillars his hair had grown
 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.240
between two pillars his hair had grown
back at that time and he collapsed this

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250
back at that time and he collapsed this
 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.729
back at that time and he collapsed this
big stadium killing thousands of

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739
big stadium killing thousands of
 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.740
big stadium killing thousands of
Philistines so in games bad things can

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750
Philistines so in games bad things can
 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.650
Philistines so in games bad things can
happen and one can explain this in terms

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660
happen and one can explain this in terms
 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.470
happen and one can explain this in terms
of the rationality of the player's

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480
of the rationality of the player's
 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.250
of the rationality of the player's
actions and i define rationality simply

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260
actions and i define rationality simply
 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.700
actions and i define rationality simply
to mean that you make better you can

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710
to mean that you make better you can
 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.409
to mean that you make better you can
rank alternatives and you choose the

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419
rank alternatives and you choose the
 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.700
rank alternatives and you choose the
best alternative

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710
best alternative
 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.470
best alternative
but in a game it's more complicated

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480
but in a game it's more complicated
 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.090
but in a game it's more complicated
because you have to choose the best

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100
because you have to choose the best
 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.620
because you have to choose the best
alternative in light of what other

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630
alternative in light of what other
 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.450
alternative in light of what other
players may choose and that affects the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460
players may choose and that affects the
 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.660
players may choose and that affects the
outcome but it doesn't depend on your

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670
outcome but it doesn't depend on your
 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.490
outcome but it doesn't depend on your
goals whatever your goals if you do the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500
goals whatever your goals if you do the
 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500
goals whatever your goals if you do the
best to achieve them I argue you're

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510
best to achieve them I argue you're
 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.040
