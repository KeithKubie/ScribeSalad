00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.451
SPEAKER: I'm pleased to
introduce Leonard Mlodinow

00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:07.950
today.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.510
He's a theoretical
physicist who is

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.880
good at making complex
scientific topics

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.740
interesting and
easy to understand.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.930
He has five "New York
Times" bestsellers,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.970
including "Subliminal
and the Grand Design,"

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.040
which he wrote together
with Stephen Hawking.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.800
Among other TV shows, he
wrote for "Star Trek: The Next

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.790
Generation."

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.470
He's had numerous contributions
to various publications,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.470
including "The New York
Times," "The Wall Street

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.270
Journal," "Scientific
American," as well as

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.120
appearances on a range of
TV shows from "Morning Joe"

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.560
to "Through the Wormhole."

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.550
Please join me in giving
him a warm welcome.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:44.350
LEONARD MLODINOW: Thanks for
taking your time to come here,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.580
because I had a little tour.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.750
And I know you
could be at the gym,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.458
you could be having
sushi with everybody,

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:51.512
you could be out walking
around the nice campus.

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:52.436
So wow.

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:55.190
This better be good, David.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.600
It all depends on the moderator,
so if he's good, it'll be good.

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:03.550
SPEAKER: No pressure.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.780
So your book is about
elastic thinking.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.630
What do you mean by
elastic thinking?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.171
LEONARD MLODINOW:
Well, I distinguish

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:11.580
between two different types
of thinking-- analytical,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.780
or logical thinking,
which computers are really

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.190
good at, which you can
use to execute algorithms,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.960
and it's very valued in society.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.110
The SAT tests for it.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899
The employers, your
employers-- maybe not

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.440
Google because they know better,
but your employers generally

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.010
just look for that.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.550
And then there is
elastic thinking, which

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.995
is more of a bottom-up process.

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:35.090
It's where ideas come from.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.900
It's not how you
follow rules but it's

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
how you come up with
rules, how you get ideas.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.970
Imagination, creativity, how you
integrate different knowledge

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.750
from different areas,
make new associations.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.180
And so we need both
in most of what we do.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.320
And my book is about
how elastic thinking

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.390
arises in your brain and
the psychology of it,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.710
how you nurture it.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.610
And so you can use your
rational, logical thinking

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.790
to figure out the best way to
drive to the grocery store.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.490
But it's the elastic
thinking that

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.300
got someone to invent a car.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.020
So that's how I describe it.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.116
SPEAKER: Also in addition
to elastic thinking

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:18.490
and analytical
thinking, you talk

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.292
about autopilot and how some of
our lives we do on autopilot.

00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:23.750
Can you give some
examples of this?

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.836
LEONARD MLODINOW: Yeah.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:24.980
And I say it's not thinking.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.354
It's just a matter
of definition.

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:29.590
But when I looked in
various dictionaries

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.900
and neuroscience
books, this kind

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.105
of information processing
that the brain does

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:36.880
did not seem to be
qualified as thinking.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.269
And it's really a very
simple rule-based algorithm,

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.060
where there's a trigger
in your environment

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.726
that causes you to
do something and then

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:48.430
you execute that without even
processing it very deeply,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.060
having any novelty or any kind
of flexibility in your brain.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.690
One example is when you
drive to work on autopilot.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.720
Your body and your mind
are just following the path

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.580
that you follow every day.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.830
With me sometimes, if
I'm going somewhere,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.760
I'll be driving somewhere
that was near Caltech,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.182
I would start on
my way to Caltech

00:03:09.182 --> 00:03:11.390
and pretty soon I realize,
I'm in Caltech, but that's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.820
not where I was
going, because I'm

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.270
on autopilot and these
triggers, this stop sign

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.640
means turn left, that red
light means turn right.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.800
And then I'm at the wrong place.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.830
And it's been shown,
though, by psychologists

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.290
that these kinds of automatic
scripts or fixed action

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.450
patterns, as
psychologists call them,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.940
aren't just for trivial
things like driving to work.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.480
We actually engage in a lot of
our social and interpersonal

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.290
reactions that way.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.280
For instance, people with
their significant other

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.450
or their spouse, sometimes
one says something

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.450
which triggers the other,
and pretty soon you're

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.400
on the same kind of
an argument pathway

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.760
that you have done
way too many times

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.690
and you know you don't want
to do but you keep doing it.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.820
One other less emotional
example was a very famous study

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.115
done by Helen Langer, who is
one of my hero psychologists

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.350
at Harvard.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.050
She stationed someone
near a Xerox machine.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.280
And when someone came
up to use the copier,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.190
this confederate would
walk up to the machine

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.750
and say one of three
different things.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.600
So one thing that some of
them said was, excuse me,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.500
can I get in front of you?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.050
I have to Xerox five
pages, and I'm in a hurry.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.194
Another way to say
it was, excuse me,

00:04:31.194 --> 00:04:33.360
can I get in front of you
and use the Xerox machine?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.729
And then she compared the
compliance rates of the two.

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.020
And people who gave the reason
that they're in a hurry,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.000
they got 95% of people who
allowed them to do that.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.770
And the people who didn't
give a reason, it was 60%.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.309
Pretty agreeable, but
it was a big difference.

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:50.850
And then she had it
done another way.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.935
The person would
walk up to the--

00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:55.710
well, what she was asking
was, are these people

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.860
taking into account this reason
that this person is in a hurry,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.410
processing it intelligently,
and then deciding,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.940
OK, they're in a hurry,
I'm not, I'll let them in?

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.960
Or are they just following
some kind of social script?

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.950
Well, she had the person go
out and ask it in another way.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.140
They would say, excuse me,
can I get in front of you?

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.810
Can I get in front
of you because I

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.760
have five pages to Xerox?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.460
So now they're giving
a reason but it's

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.380
adding no more information.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.144
So mathematically speaking,
or in terms of information

00:05:26.144 --> 00:05:28.560
content, it's just like the
first way, where you just say,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.840
can I get in front of you
without giving a reason?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.640
So you should get
60% compliance.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.620
But if people are automatically
following a script

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.550
and they'll let someone
in because the script says

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.060
if they give a
reason, let them in,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.110
then you'll have 90% compliance.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.884
And sure enough, they had
actually 93% compliance.

00:05:45.884 --> 00:05:48.300
All you had to say is, because
I have five pages to Xerox,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.560
rather than not say anything.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.310
So this is an example
of people not realizing

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.151
that they're following a
script in a social interaction.

00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:57.900
SPEAKER: So there's a
pro tip that you all

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.240
can walk away with if you want
to get in front of people.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.880
LEONARD MLODINOW: I
find that's very useful.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.430
SPEAKER: Because it's sunny.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.490
LEONARD MLODINOW: [INAUDIBLE]
for a good reason,

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.198
we don't have to.

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:07.410
Just say "because."

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.290
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.210
So with respect to generating
new ideas and so on,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.250
you talked about
concept neurons.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.900
What are those?

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.064
LEONARD MLODINOW: So that
has to do with the way

00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:20.130
you store information
in your brain.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.260
And around 2005, there are some
very interesting experiments

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.370
done with people who
had electrodes implanted

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.890
because they had intractable
epilepsy, so they had

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.520
to take readings
of the brain to see

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.730
what kind of surgical
procedure to do.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.460
And these neuroscientists
piggybacked on those people

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.730
and did experiments on them, and
they would show them pictures

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.950
or tell them names.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.030
And they would see what it
stimulated within the brain.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.640
And they found that the neural
patterns for certain concepts--

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.740
or for concepts, period--

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.060
are very sparse in the brain.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.150
It's not distributed over
millions and millions

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.150
of neurons, but there are very
specific neurons that respond

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.040
to very specific concepts.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.315
And they respond not
just to the stimulus of--

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:13.380
let's say it's a person-- of the
person's face or their image.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.639
But the same neuron would--

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.680
that's why they're called
concept neurons-- would

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.790
respond to the very
idea of that person.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.070
So Halle Berry was one.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.340
You could see Halle Berry
straight on, they would fire.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.950
From the side, they would fire.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.980
Dressed up in some
weird superhero outfit,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.150
it would fire.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.500
Just her name written
out, it would fire.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.450
So that's why they named
them concept neurons.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.116
They found that
concepts are represented

00:07:36.116 --> 00:07:38.915
sparsely by different sets
of neurons in the brain.

00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:40.290
And why that's
important is, when

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.115
we make associations to get
imaginative and creative ideas,

00:07:44.115 --> 00:07:46.699
it's when different
networks of concept neurons

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.240
interact with each
other, and you get

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.472
combined to form a new concept.

00:07:51.472 --> 00:07:53.430
SPEAKER: OK, that makes
sense in how it relates

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.719
to elasticity and so on.

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:56.760
Also, later on in the
book, you talk a little bit

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.670
how sentences are like puzzles.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.340
How are sentences like puzzles?

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.130
LEONARD MLODINOW: Well,
when you hear language,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.910
you're hearing a
string of words.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.040
But each word can have
many different meanings

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.030
depending on the context.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:17.270
So when you are
decoding what I say,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.730
your brain is not
translating giving you

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.970
the idea of what each word means
as I go through the sentence.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.219
It's actually waiting for
the sentence to get finished.

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:28.760
Or if it's a long
sentence, somewhere

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.040
along the way when it
has the right context,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.230
it's doing a calculation
to figure out

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.400
for each word which of
its possible meanings

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.100
is the correct meaning.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.030
So let's see if I get
this sentence right.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.988
I have one in the book.

00:08:38.988 --> 00:08:43.020
It said, the
cooking teacher said

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.700
the children made good snacks.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.640
OK?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.050
So that intro
line, you guys know

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.300
what I'm going to say next.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.770
The other sentence
is, the cannibal said

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.900
the children made good snacks.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.450
So if I hadn't given
you that intro, when

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.510
you heard the sentence
the cooking teacher said

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.050
the children made good snacks,
as your mind goes along,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.014
the word made came along, it
would interpret it one way.

00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:11.680
And if I said "the cannibal," it
would interpret it another way.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.595
So every sentence like
that is a puzzle where

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:19.095
you have a number of words
that have some order.

00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:21.220
And each word can have
different possible meanings.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.884
And your brain has
to figure out what

00:09:22.884 --> 00:09:25.050
set of meanings for these
words did you put together

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.850
to make that sentence.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.920
And should I let you
ask another question,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.620
or should I tell [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.620
SPEAKER: Oh, go ahead.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.150
No, just--

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.740
LEONARD MLODINOW:
So, the reason that's

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.480
important is two language
researchers were looking

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.690
at what happens when
people have strokes

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.870
on the right side of the brain.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.565
And people had
traditionally thought

00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:50.440
that the left side of
the brain is important.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.750
This is back through the
1950s and the early '60s.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.919
And the right side, they would
say, it's just a throwaway.

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:57.960
You don't really need it.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.849
It's just there.

00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:00.390
I don't know what
they were thinking,

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.370
but basically that's
what they said.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.770
And Roger Sperry, who
you may have heard of,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.400
thought that that
would be ridiculous.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.140
And he wanted to know what
the real difference was

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.720
between them.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.330
And he realized
that by observing

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.869
people with strokes or other
brain damage [INAUDIBLE] other,

00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:16.660
it wasn't controlled
enough to really tell.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.840
He started cutting through the
corpus callosum of the animals

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.100
to separate the right
and the left brain.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.280
And then he designed
experiments that

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.740
would address just
the right side or just

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.750
the left side of the brain.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.670
And you can do that
because your senses also

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.544
go through the right.

00:10:32.544 --> 00:10:37.790
[INAUDIBLE] so you can
present either auditory

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.120
signals or visual signals
to one side or the other,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.930
and then you can
make tests to see,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.030
if I teach the right side
of the brain something,

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.222
does the left side know it?

00:10:45.222 --> 00:10:46.680
And he found that
they're basically

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.780
two independent information
processors, which

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.270
was very controversial
because you might imagine,

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.370
if you believe in
the soul, does that

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.070
mean you're two
souls or two people?

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.640
Or what does that mean?

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.300
But he ended up getting
a Nobel Prize for it.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.620
And it didn't have quite
the impact that maybe it

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.870
should have through the years.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.190
And people still were
kind of tending to dismiss

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.669
the right side of the brain.

00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:10.960
And the left side is the one
that's known for language.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.524
But these two researchers,
Kounios and Beeman,

00:11:14.524 --> 00:11:16.190
were looking at the
deficits that people

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.000
had who had right side strokes,
and they were very interesting.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.010
They had trouble
understanding metaphors,

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.720
and they had trouble
understanding jokes.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.805
You would tell them
a joke, and they

00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:26.120
wouldn't think it was funny.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.210
Which usually if I tell
a joke, people think--

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.800
some fraction of the time.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.940
If not, they have brain damage.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.170
So think about that when you
choose whether or not to laugh.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.740
So what they were
saying was, OK, well,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.240
how does this relate--

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.970
if language is like a
puzzle, what does this mean?

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.820
And they eventually, through
a lot of experimentation

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.910
and thought, they
came to the conclusion

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:55.980
that when you hear a sentence
or when you see a puzzle,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.030
or when you're at work
and you run into a problem

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.260
you have to solve, your
brain starts throwing out

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.610
ideas, associations as to how
we might approach it or solve

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.510
the problem.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.975
And these are all being first
done on a subconscious level,

00:12:09.975 --> 00:12:12.990
and not all of them
enter your consciousness.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.660
Then there are various
filter circuits in your brain

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.220
that work together
to determine what

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.990
reaches your consciousness.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.250
This is also the same
way that you have

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.670
inhibition of your behavior.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.100
So if you walk by the
cafeteria and you're hungry

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.600
and you see a French
fry, your brain

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.719
is giving you the idea
to grab the French fry.

00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:32.510
And your brain is also
censoring that idea,

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.350
because it's probably
not a good idea

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.300
to walk by and grab food from
other people's tables, right?

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.480
And in the book, I
tell a story about--

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.590
my dad had a stroke in
that part of his brain,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.500
and he would grab
the French fry.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.420
He would get the idea
and he would do it.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.976
Well, that's bad because
we need these filters.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.100
We need them to keep us
from doing stuff like that,

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.260
or if you're on
the second floor,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.810
don't just jump out the
window, take the stairs.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.000
And you don't want crazy
ideas when you're trying

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.810
to solve a problem either.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.060
Or you get too many crazy
ideas, and you get nowhere.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.220
On the other hand,
sometimes the crazy idea

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.144
is the one that
solves the problem.

00:13:07.144 --> 00:13:08.685
And if your brain
is too conventional

00:13:08.685 --> 00:13:12.589
and filters out all
those ideas, then you're

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:13.880
not going to solve the problem.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.240
You're never going to
have a creative thought.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.780
You're never going to innovate.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.760
So it's all a balance.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.830
And the idea in
elastic thinking is

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.920
how to tune this
balance for yourself.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.570
So what Kounios
and Beeman realized

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.300
was that the right
side of your brain,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.790
a certain structure on the
right side of your brain,

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.292
is producing these
more odd ideas.

00:13:32.292 --> 00:13:34.500
And your left side of the
brain is producing the more

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.320
conventional ideas.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.180
And then these different
structures in your brain

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.030
are choosing what to bring
to your consciousness.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:48.660
And so a metaphor is based on
an odd interpretation of a word.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.790
You are the light
of my life-- well,

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:55.230
I don't really mean that I can't
see unless you're in the room.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.230
Or if you tell a
joke, it usually

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.874
does not depend on the literal
meaning of what's going on.

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.290
It depends upon
making some jumps.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.914
So your right side of your brain
is understanding and proposing

00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:08.290
these ideas, and your left side
the more conventional ones.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.590
So the people who have the
brain damage on the right side

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.820
were not getting
these more, they

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.817
call them, remote associations--
only the more usual

00:14:17.817 --> 00:14:20.400
associations, so they couldn't
understand jokes and metaphors.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.700
But they realized that this is
part of a much broader theme,

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.500
which is that your
ideas in general

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.140
come that way, when you're
solving any puzzle in life,

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.140
not just the sentence
and the language.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.270
Your right side of
your brain is proposing

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.180
the more odd solutions
or ideas or thoughts,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.720
and the left side the
more conventional ones.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.460
And your filters and your
different brain structures

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.295
are sorting through them.

00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:45.390
SPEAKER: Yeah, related
to the word associations,

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.730
you brought up this instance
of these researchers who

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.594
had compound remote
association problems, which

00:14:50.594 --> 00:14:52.510
they didn't quite
abbreviate like that, right?

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.580
LEONARD MLODINOW: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.410
SPEAKER: Compound remote
association problems.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.990
LEONARD MLODINOW:
They didn't want--

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.519
I mean, a lot of scientific
papers have that in them,

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:04.560
but no scientist wants to
actually use that word,

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.350
so they called them CRAs.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.230
SPEAKER: Probably a wise move.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.775
I think one example you gave
was pine, crab, and sauce

00:15:13.775 --> 00:15:14.970
was one of the examples.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:15.930
LEONARD MLODINOW: OK.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.720
So here's the puzzle.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.200
There's another word that
goes with each of those.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.660
So if think of
cone, for instance,

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:27.210
it's the wrong one-- because
pine cone, but not sauce cone.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.244
So it's pine, crab, and sauce.

00:15:30.244 --> 00:15:31.410
That's one of their puzzles.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.810
So there's two ways
to solve that puzzle,

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.910
just like there's
two ways of thinking.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.966
You could analytically
start running

00:15:37.966 --> 00:15:39.090
through words in your mind.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.980
You may have some heuristic
about what kind of words

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.640
to run through.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.350
Or you may start
with one of them,

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.290
like pine, and do
those words, and then

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.833
check each one
with the next word,

00:15:47.833 --> 00:15:49.457
and then check that
with the next word.

00:15:49.457 --> 00:15:52.694
Or you sit there and you go,
ah, and then it comes to you.

00:15:52.694 --> 00:15:53.610
That's called insight.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.485
They call it insight.

00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:57.420
So what they were studying
was the different ways

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.360
that our brain works doing
one versus the other.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.244
And one of the ways
that they could

00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:04.410
tell what parts of your
brain are doing what is they

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.260
would image your brain
while you were doing that.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.110
And sometimes they
would use something

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.820
called transcranial
stimulation, which

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.820
disrupts part of your
brain, so you can actually

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.700
electronically disrupt certain
structures in your brain.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.280
And suddenly people are solving
these problems a lot better

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.150
than they were.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:27.150
In one case, there was a
very experienced meditator

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.450
who was so good at
focus that he couldn't

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:33.560
solve any of these problems,
and he was kind of embarrassed.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.480
And then he-- this is
a very important lesson

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.860
in the book-- he was able to see
that and change his thinking,

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.580
change his approach, relax,
and let his filters go away

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.820
and open up his mind.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.980
And then he did [INAUDIBLE]
better than other people

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.997
generally did.

00:16:50.997 --> 00:16:52.830
And these researchers
said, in all the years

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.480
of presenting these
problems, no one ever

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.440
had a switch like that.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.670
So it's possible to take charge
of your brain and the way

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.680
you think.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.680
And to throw in one more
random comment on that,

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.240
it's very interesting that they
could see in their subjects

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.900
brains through the--

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.810
they had to use
both, FMRI and EEG--

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.339
they could tell about
five or six seconds

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:20.416
before the subject even
solved the problem,

00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:23.065
and even before they knew
what the problem was,

00:17:23.065 --> 00:17:24.690
which way they would
do it-- whether it

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.079
was analytic or elastic.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.951
And the subjects didn't
realize that they

00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:32.450
had predetermined in their brain
what they were going to do.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.377
But they were in one
mindset or another.

00:17:34.377 --> 00:17:36.210
So they were either in
an analytical mindset

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.270
or an elastic mindset.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.050
By reading their brains,
the experimenters

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.370
could tell which one it was.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.870
And when they asked
them afterwards,

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.328
how did you solve
the problem, they

00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:46.020
were right about
whether it was just

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.180
letting the thing come to you
or the analytical thinking.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.583
Has anyone, by the way,
solved-- so it was--

00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:54.020
the words were--

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.950
I don't want to
say-- crab, pine--

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.570
SPEAKER: To be clear, you
have to come up with one word

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.070
that pairs with each
of these other words.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.861
LEONARD MLODINOW: Could
be before or after.

00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:04.576
So pine, crab, and sauce.

00:18:04.576 --> 00:18:05.339
AUDIENCE: Apple.

00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:06.922
LEONARD MLODINOW:
Apple, there you go.

00:18:06.922 --> 00:18:09.605
And did you get that by
logically reasoning it out,

00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:10.730
or did it just come to you?

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.170
AUDIENCE: It just came to me.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.045
LEONARD MLODINOW: OK.

00:18:12.045 --> 00:18:13.700
Well, that's a
good way to get it.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.330
So I talk a lot in
the book about ways

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.910
that you can help that.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.530
And I think that
Google having a gym

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.880
here is a great thing
because that's one way.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.790
You know, when you're thinking
in a very focused matter,

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.880
that's good to do if
you analyze the problem.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.580
Then you want to let that go
and start thinking about it,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.850
get on the treadmill, do
something that really takes you

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.970
away and doesn't let you
think about your grocery list

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.070
or what you have to do
at home or that problem,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.445
and then things
will come to you.

00:18:40.445 --> 00:18:42.490
Or taking the nap-- you
have little nap rooms,

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.140
that's a great thing.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.307
They understand this here.

00:18:47.307 --> 00:18:48.640
SPEAKER: I like how you do that.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.330
You talk about, I guess, these
different modes of thinking

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.629
and how they can apply
to different situations.

00:18:54.629 --> 00:18:56.170
And I think even in
the book you talk

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.610
about how you take advantage
of that during the day.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.860
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.235
LEONARD MLODINOW:
Well, one thing

00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:07.450
is that your filters tend to
relax when you are exhausted,

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.160
or mentally exhausted.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.290
So you might be a morning
person or an evening person.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.920
But whatever it is,
one of the best times

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.500
if you need to find
creative solutions

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.080
is to do it when your analytic
mind just can't do any more.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.910
So they do experiments
where they'd

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:29.590
have people solve these really
boring analytic thinking

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:35.290
problems, little arithmetic
problems or puzzles.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.600
And afterwards, they'd
give them a problem that

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.100
requires some
creativity, and they'd

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.880
do better than the
people who were relaxed

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.760
and just go in to attack
the problem that way.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.400
So that's one thing you can do.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.140
I mean, another thing
is to realize that--

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.140
well, it's to realize that
it's good to stop and just take

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:53.680
a break.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.920
And when you're taking a break
or you're laying on the couch

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.760
staring at the ceiling, you're
not necessarily goofing off.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.380
You're legitimately
letting your mind work.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.800
So you can legitimately be
working and consider yourself

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.752
at work when you're
laying down and you're

00:20:06.752 --> 00:20:07.710
staring at the ceiling.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.075
That's good to know.

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:13.362
And I found this great story
about Leonardo da Vinci.

00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:15.939
He had his patrons who
would see him take a break.

00:20:15.939 --> 00:20:17.980
And they would go, I'm
paying you all this money.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.000
I want you to keep working.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.125
I want you to keep working.

00:20:20.125 --> 00:20:21.340
And he argued with them, no.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.480
When I take a break,
that is working.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.590
So that's good-- you know, if
your supervisor doesn't know

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.970
that, just--

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.830
hey, [INAUDIBLE]
working for you now.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.490
SPEAKER: And remember to use
"because," just like earlier.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.115
LEONARD MLODINOW:
Use "because," right.

00:20:35.115 --> 00:20:38.010
I'm laying on the couch because
I need to solve this problem,

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.772
not because I'm taking a nap.

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.730
SPEAKER: So I'm going to
keep asking questions.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.980
But if any of you have
questions related to elasticity

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.591
or maybe how to
activate it and so on,

00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:48.340
feel free to line up
at the mic, and we'll

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.365
start to mix those
in as time goes on.

00:20:51.365 --> 00:20:53.740
And if not, you'll just get
to hear my prepared questions

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.920
the whole time, and put
all the pressure on me.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.170
LEONARD MLODINOW: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.590
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.926
LEONARD MLODINOW: Pressure
is bad for elastic thinking.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:03.092
SPEAKER: Well, fortunately
I have them written down,

00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:05.480
so we've already
activated that part.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.780
In the book, you also
mention your collaboration

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.460
with the late Stephen Hawking.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.160
What did he teach you
about elastic thinking?

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.890
LEONARD MLODINOW: Well,
he taught many things.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.850
And I think one of the
most unusual things

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.700
was because of the
way he communicated,

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.490
we had to interact in
a very unusual manner.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:28.819
So to compose his
sentences, first he would--

00:21:28.819 --> 00:21:30.402
when I first started
working with him,

00:21:30.402 --> 00:21:32.770
he would use his thumb
to click a mouse,

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.395
and later he had a motion
sensor on his glasses

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:37.750
that would read when
his cheek twitched.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.460
And that would be
like a mouse click.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.927
And on his computer screen,
a cursor was flying around.

00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:45.385
And there would be
rows of letters.

00:21:45.385 --> 00:21:47.680
So first row, second row--
so he'd capture, let's say,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.390
the second row.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.350
Then it would start
moving across each letter.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.520
He'd capture a letter.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.869
Once he had a letter, it
gave him a choice of words.

00:21:54.869 --> 00:21:56.660
Or he could do a second
letter, and then he

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.035
gets a choice of words with
those two letters, et cetera.

00:21:59.035 --> 00:22:00.680
And it was about
six words a minute

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.960
that he could do that way.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.034
So we were working together
even closer than this,

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.450
but there would
be no table there.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.750
And he would be typing
out his sentences.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.210
and at first, I'm zoning out.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.970
I'm going, oh wow, OK, I'm--

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.320
I don't know, I'm daydreaming.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.195
But then I actually realized--

00:22:19.195 --> 00:22:22.669
I very soon realized that I
could see on his screen what

00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:23.210
he's writing.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.140
It would show.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.790
And at the end, he
would click something

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.590
and the computer voice
would pronounce it.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.220
But you could watch him
composing his sentences,

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.500
and I would look
over his shoulder

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.810
and I would start thinking
about what he was saying.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.934
So it's really interesting.

00:22:38.934 --> 00:22:41.510
And sometimes if I knew
what he was saying,

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.720
I would say, oh, you're
saying, blah blah blah.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.094
But sometimes I
would just let it

00:22:45.094 --> 00:22:46.810
go, even though I
knew what it was,

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.800
because I could think about it.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.350
So as we're talking, I'm
not thinking very much.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.050
It's probably pretty automatic.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.290
When you say something--
it's a fixed action pattern.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.719
You say something that
triggers my brain to something

00:22:57.719 --> 00:23:00.010
in the book, and I'm just
reading the book to you guys.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.080
But in most conversations
it's pretty immediate.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.038
You don't talk to somebody,
and then you're not

00:23:07.038 --> 00:23:08.310
going to wait four minutes--

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.760
if your friend's waiting
four minutes for you

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.530
to say something--

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.520
I mean, if you're stoned
maybe, but not generally.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.890
So this was different.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.880
Our Conversations, then,
at least from my side,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.785
were very different
because I could

00:23:19.785 --> 00:23:21.910
think more deeply about
what we were talking about.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.270
I also had the time to figure
out what he was talking about

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.590
because his mind
could go pretty fast.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:31.930
But it's a very important
thing because quite often we

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.519
don't think deeply enough,
or you take the first answer

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:37.060
that you get at
something, and that's

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.690
not the creative answer--
that's, let's say,

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.170
it gets to their answer
but not the best answer.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.600
And if you would
only stop and say,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.020
no, I want something better and
not just accept that answer,

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.210
then you would get better ideas.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.200
And there's a good
experiment in the book

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.410
that they talk about
with chess players.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:02.020
And they give-- so
who here plays chess?

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.630
Is this a chess-playing crowd?

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.720
Well, you know they these
magazines or websites

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.960
that give you chess puzzles.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.540
It's a board position
and they say,

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.351
how do you force a checkmate
in three moves or five moves?

00:24:14.351 --> 00:24:15.850
So they give you
the board position,

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.150
and your problem is to
figure out how you--

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.590
given you're white, let's
say, and it's your move,

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.250
force your opponent
into a checkmate

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.020
in a given number of moves.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.300
So they designed
a nice situation

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.590
where there was
an easy solution.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.770
It took five moves.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.040
And there was a very clever
solution that took three moves.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.320
So that's considered better.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.120
And they gave this to a lot
of different chess players

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:49.830
to solve, and they
correlated how good

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.830
the chess player was according
to their master points--

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.230
so that's a rating system
they have in chess--

00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:00.430
to whether they could
solve this problem.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.810
And then to some
of the people, they

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.310
would show the easy
solution first.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.100
No, I'm sorry.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.770
Some people would be given the
board where the easy solution

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.440
was not present.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.740
And others would be given
the board, the problem,

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.280
where an easy and a hard
one were both present.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.030
And what they found was
that they were really

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.100
good, the experts, at
solving the hard problem

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:23.974
when the easy--

00:25:23.974 --> 00:25:25.515
would start getting
the hard solution

00:25:25.515 --> 00:25:26.837
when the easy one wasn't there.

00:25:26.837 --> 00:25:28.920
But when the easy one was
there and they of course

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.530
would immediately answer
it, they were a lot worse.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.770
They would not
find the hard one.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.040
And they did some
statistical correlations

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.790
and found that it was
like the equivalent,

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.490
I think, to 300 master
points or something.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.104
So I mean, that's a huge
difference in chess.

00:25:44.104 --> 00:25:45.895
And I forgot-- I said
it in the book-- it's

00:25:45.895 --> 00:25:48.752
like an IQ difference
between 90 and 120,

00:25:48.752 --> 00:25:49.710
or something like that.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.680
I mean, really knowing
the easy answer

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.780
made people a lot dumber
at finding the more

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.690
creative answer.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.290
So just something
to think about.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.880
I really like that
aspect of the book

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.380
that you had various
problems there.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.320
We talked about one of them
with the crab, the pine,

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.010
and the sauce.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.270
We talked about the chess one.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.769
You also have various
little quizzes

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:14.847
where you can measure how open
you are to new experiences,

00:26:14.847 --> 00:26:16.430
and there are other
quizzes like that.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.020
I like that aspect
of it a lot, that you

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.570
have these various
interactive things.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.545
I think we have a question.

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:21.086
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:21.086 --> 00:26:22.220
Can you hear me?

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:22.860
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:23.485
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:26:23.485 --> 00:26:27.740
I have a question about how
to reward elastic thinking,

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.480
because humans are kind
of a reward-driven animal.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.840
But most of our reward
system is trying

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.350
to be really analytical-- so
they track your performance

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.260
over time, you can
have a metric about it,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.360
and that's how you can
get a reward for it,

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.880
because the metric
shows that you did well.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.090
But for creativity
or elasticity,

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.610
it doesn't seem there's--

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.240
at least I don't know a good way
of saying, oh, you did good in,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.800
and therefore I can reward you
and hope that you'll continue

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.990
to do more elastic thinking.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.740
LEONARD MLODINOW:
That's a great question,

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.950
and we could do a
whole hour on that.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.306
And as you can tell, my
mouth tends to keep going.

00:27:08.306 --> 00:27:14.950
But-- so there are two kinds of
rewards that people who study

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.710
this talk about--

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.530
extrinsic rewards and
intrinsic rewards.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.390
So your brain has
a reward system

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.530
that I talk about in the
book that rewards you

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.650
when you do certain things.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.821
And those are, by definition,
the things you like.

00:27:27.821 --> 00:27:29.945
I don't see, it does certain
things you like to do,

00:27:29.945 --> 00:27:32.028
but you like to do them
because it's rewarding you

00:27:32.028 --> 00:27:33.770
and kind of works together.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:40.880
And then there's money
and money-related things--

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.670
you know, gifts or--

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.440
I don't want to say
praise because praise

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.750
is kind of in between.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.240
But what psychologists
have found

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.560
is that the extrinsic
rewards are not really good.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.870
They can be quite
counterproductive.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.940
Now, if they tell you
you have to finish

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.541
writing this code
by Monday and it's

00:28:04.541 --> 00:28:07.040
really important to the company,
and we'll give you 10 grand

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.620
if you do it, you'll
probably do it.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:15.470
So for short term, very
well-defined things, you know,

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.270
it tends to work.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:20.660
People, their conscious mind
takes over, and they do it.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.410
More long term and
less define things

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.270
like, are you, for
instance, going

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.770
to be a better employee if
you're rewarded monetarily,

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.740
that doesn't really follow.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.750
And the more creative
the task you're doing

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.510
is the less important or
even the more negative

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.910
the monetary reward is.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.360
I actually quote Dostoevsky
who wasn't a psychologist,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:49.220
but he was complaining about
this hellish assignment

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.840
he had to write this novel.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.720
And I forgot what novel it
was, but what a torture it was.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.104
And when you hear
that, you don't

00:28:58.104 --> 00:29:00.020
realize that he wrote
on spec like that, where

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.110
someone says write about--

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.640
you know.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.520
And it wasn't at all.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.890
It was just to write a novel.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.100
The assignment was
just to write a novel.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.862
But he was being paid--

00:29:07.862 --> 00:29:09.320
he had a contract
to write a novel.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.666
And for him, that totally
killed his creativity.

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:13.290
And so that's maybe
an extreme example,

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.920
but that's the tendency
of what happens.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.490
Researchers have found that when
you pay people and give them

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.490
this extrinsic motivation,
it tends to interfere

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.812
with their creativity.

00:29:22.812 --> 00:29:24.270
But the intrinsic
motivation, which

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.720
comes from you, which
is Google saying to you,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.760
what do you like?

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.130
Let's assign you to do that.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.350
Let's put you in the
area that you like to do.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:36.580
And if you later on want to
change, to be open to say,

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.810
oh, you want to move over
there and do that, that's

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.120
intrinsic motivation that
comes deeper within you

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.060
from within your own brain,
and that is very important

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.342
and very effective.

00:29:48.174 --> 00:29:49.594
SPEAKER: I'm going to call back.

00:29:49.594 --> 00:29:51.260
Just a moment ago you
mentioned somebody

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.874
potentially being stoned.

00:29:53.874 --> 00:29:55.790
It came up in your book
as well, being stoned.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.560
It's legal in this state.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.422
How does being stoned
relate to elastic thinking?

00:30:00.422 --> 00:30:02.922
LEONARD MLODINOW: That's the
cure for everything, duct tape.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:12.820
So marijuana-- well, OK, alcohol
also and marijuana and certain

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.848
psychedelic drugs--

00:30:15.848 --> 00:30:20.350
I always have trouble
pronouncing, ayahuasca,

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.830
they act on those filters
I was talking about.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:28.310
So that's just a chemical way
of loosening those filters

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.590
and allowing more creative
ideas to go through.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.510
Now, I should say,
which I do in the book,

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.440
that they all have
their own downsides.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.850
I don't just mean
you get drunk and you

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.210
could walk through a window.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:45.010
I mean more objectively
that marijuana

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.140
has other effects on your
brain, your short-term memory,

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.170
how to keep things in
your working memory.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.690
I don't know if you've ever
had that experience where

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.745
you're stoned and you
forget what you were saying.

00:30:55.745 --> 00:30:57.764
I mean, I get that even
when I'm not stoned.

00:30:57.764 --> 00:31:00.874
But more often when I am, I
guess-- not that I ever am.

00:31:00.874 --> 00:31:03.244
If you're doing this outside
of California, never do it.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.070
So that can impede--

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.592
also for a lot of things, you
need that executive function

00:31:11.592 --> 00:31:12.550
to guide your thinking.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.910
And so thoughts are coming,
but there's no guidance.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.640
And so you're
detached from reality.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:24.300
And so there are
these different aids

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.790
that you might try that many
artists and musicians swear by.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.160
They have their plus signs
and their minus signs,

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.540
and you have to use
them intelligently

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.260
if you're using them
for that purpose.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.235
If you're not, use
them any way you want.

00:31:39.235 --> 00:31:41.806
SPEAKER: Yeah, using
drinking to help

00:31:41.806 --> 00:31:43.680
the elastic thinking
reminds me of that quote

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.390
from that character
in "Game of Thrones."

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.139
That's what I do--

00:31:46.139 --> 00:31:47.400
I drink and I know things.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.410
And it seems--

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.580
LEONARD MLODINOW: There you go.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.080
Anyway, do we have
another question?

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.896
AUDIENCE: I'm curious kind of
the difference between the--

00:31:54.896 --> 00:31:57.270
I've heard it talked about as
the subconscious background

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.360
processing thinking
versus elastic thinking.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.602
Like, you read a riddle
right before you go to bed.

00:32:03.602 --> 00:32:06.060
And then you wake up and you
either dream about the answer,

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.850
or just the answer hit
you out of nowhere.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:12.387
Or is this the same thing
as the shower epiphany

00:32:12.387 --> 00:32:13.470
that a lot of people have?

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.510
LEONARD MLODINOW: Right.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.850
They're all related--
when you have a problem

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:21.270
that you set up
analytically in your head.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:26.220
But the answer is not the
product of an algorithm.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.210
The answer is,
let's say, changing

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.150
the way you solved a
problem, for instance--

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.560
changing your assumptions,
or changing the paradigm.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.066
It's more like you
guys are started

00:32:39.066 --> 00:32:40.440
to use these neural
nets, which I

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:45.086
think is the key to success
in computer science.

00:32:45.086 --> 00:32:49.200
And I wrote a paper
in the '80s about it.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.836
So that's elastic thinking.

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:53.460
The neural nets--
with the neural nets,

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.080
though, you don't know how
it got to the answer, right?

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.940
You set it up so
that the computer is

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.770
doing this crazy stuff
and it's learning.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:01.880
And at the end,
you don't know what

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.357
algorithm it used in its
brain to get the answer.

00:33:04.357 --> 00:33:05.940
And that's the same
thing with humans.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.880
And so when you get these
ideas, it's from the bottom up.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.344
It's your neural nets in your
brain doing some calculation,

00:33:12.344 --> 00:33:13.260
giving you the answer.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.476
It's not some algorithm
saying, do this then do this

00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:16.860
and then do that.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.302
So yes, that's really the
big difference, is that--

00:33:21.302 --> 00:33:23.760
or one of the big differences--
is that analytical thinking

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.640
tends to be top down,
and elastic thinking

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.763
tends to be bottom
up calculation.

00:33:32.234 --> 00:33:34.400
SPEAKER: I don't know,
talking about the neural nets

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.220
and so on, it's kind of
interesting because it

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.930
was mentioned that the season--

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.180
or the time that you wrote
for "The Next Generation,"

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.850
you all were exploring
some things around Data

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:44.450
and how much he
was thinking also.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:47.910
And that kind of is a
similar idea, I suppose.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.340
LEONARD MLODINOW: Yeah.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.750
Because we had the very
naive concept of Data--

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.170
or Spock was half
of [INAUDIBLE],,

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.400
so it's kind of the
same role, where this is

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.650
totally logical and rational.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:04.520
But in reality,
somebody who is total--

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.550
or a thing that is totally
rational or logical

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.080
is never going to
solve anything or do--

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.010
I mean, first of all
they won't even get

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:16.210
started because if something
is rational and logical,

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.021
it usually needs to be
told to do something

00:34:18.021 --> 00:34:19.229
and then it can do that task.

00:34:19.229 --> 00:34:24.170
But something that
is bottom up thinking

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.351
or has emotional
content, which is

00:34:26.351 --> 00:34:28.100
why you have a reward
center in your brain

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.725
and you have emotions, is to get
you to realize that you should

00:34:30.725 --> 00:34:32.389
even start doing something.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:36.267
So in reality, if Data
was purely a computer,

00:34:36.267 --> 00:34:38.350
it would sit there and
wait to be given a problem,

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.559
and then he would answer it.

00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:41.400
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.860
I think that plays in a little
bit to some of the other topics

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.860
you talk about-- when you
mentioned choice overload,

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.580
for example.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.870
What is choice overload?

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:55.020
LEONARD MLODINOW: Well,
so in today's society,

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.690
we have a lot of
options for everything.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.200
You go to the grocery store,
and there's 40 different kinds

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.390
of ketchup or cereal.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:10.490
One researcher I talked
about did a survey, reported

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.610
how many of each different
products were in the grocery

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.550
store, and it was bad.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.250
And these are the
kinds of things

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.790
that can exhaust your brain
and get you on these loops that

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.250
are not productive.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:28.237
And what psychologists have
found was that there's--

00:35:28.237 --> 00:35:30.820
I don't want to say two kinds
of people, because that's always

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.025
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:32.025 --> 00:35:35.240
But there's two ends of a
one-dimensional spectrum.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.420
And one end, they
call them maximizers.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.060
These are miserable people--

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.260
I'm often one of them--

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.705
who want to optimize
and maximize the utility

00:35:44.705 --> 00:35:46.910
and economics of everything.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:50.600
So when I'm presented with 40
different kinds of mayonnaise,

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.260
I will spend an hour
analyzing each one

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.210
and trying to figure
out which one is better

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.660
than the other one, even
though it really doesn't matter

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.070
or doesn't matter much.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.752
At the other end
are the satisficers,

00:36:03.752 --> 00:36:05.210
they call them,
who as soon as they

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.762
find the first one that works,
take that one and they go

00:36:08.762 --> 00:36:10.500
along very happily.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:16.130
So that's what I recommend.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:17.950
Well, let's think
about that again.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.350
Is that really the best answer?

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.390
SPEAKER: I find it
interesting when

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.460
you were talking about
the creative thinking

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.250
and you related
to schizophrenic--

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.350
schizotypic personality traits.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.850
How are those two intertwined?

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.200
LEONARD MLODINOW: So--
people pronounce it

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.160
both schizotypies, or
schizo-tip-ees, is a trait that

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.429
is related to schizophrenia.

00:36:42.429 --> 00:36:43.970
So again, if you
think of a spectrum,

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.190
there would be people
who are far to one

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.240
end are schizophrenic,
and then there

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.090
are people with
different traits,

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.050
different degrees of that.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.560
And that has to do with how
attached you are to reality,

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.360
and do you have a tendency
toward odd and magical

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:00.860
thinking?

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.160
So based on what
I've said so far,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.701
you can imagine
that this has to do

00:37:03.701 --> 00:37:06.980
with some of the filters in your
brain and to getting new ideas.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.290
So people who are near
the schizophrenic side

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.240
can often be extremely creative.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.780
Well, it's not very
creative but extremely good

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.160
at idea generation
and generating

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.860
novel, divergent ideas.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.770
They're not really often very
creative, because that also

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.290
takes some analytical thinking
to channel and figure out

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.580
what you need and put
everything together.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.080
So this is an interesting trait
to look at, because in a way

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.784
it's a measure of your filters.

00:37:30.784 --> 00:37:32.200
And when your
filters are too low,

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.830
then you're detached
from reality.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.610
But if your filters
are too high,

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.600
then you're so conventional that
you'll never have a new idea.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.330
And that still has
its place more so

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.650
than the other side in society.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:47.930
But it's a very important
aspect of elastic thinking.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.310
SPEAKER: Yeah, it struck
me as kind of tragic.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.520
I mean, some people are
right on the border.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.055
I think you referenced--

00:37:54.055 --> 00:37:55.013
LEONARD MLODINOW: Nash.

00:37:55.013 --> 00:37:56.480
SPEAKER: Yeah, John Nash.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.480
LEONARD MLODINOW: He was
on the border for years

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.220
and was enough reality
based to do the work that

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.180
got him the Nobel Prize, and
then he went over the edge

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.810
and he schizophrenic for some
years, and then he recovered.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:11.720
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.090
We have another question.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:17.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I'm
actually an improviser as well

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.590
as somebody here.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.890
And so it seems to
me, in that role

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.860
I get my own way to practice
some of this creative thinking

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.040
that I wouldn't get
if I just did work.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.970
Are there other ways that
you have seen that work

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:35.960
to help people get this more
creative aspect of themselves

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.952
or train their brain to
be more elastic thinking?

00:38:39.952 --> 00:38:40.910
LEONARD MLODINOW: Yeah.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.970
So I talk about different
things you can do.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:48.650
One is meditation and often
meditation related exercises

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.150
that make you more mindful.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:53.180
So one of important things
to be is mindful and how

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.010
are you attacking a problem.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:56.510
And when you're
getting to a barrier

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.680
and when it's good to stop
and take another approach

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.640
and to be mindful of yourself
and to know what it is that you

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.471
do that can help do that.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.380
Another thing is, it's
very important to overcome

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.460
the fear of failure.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.355
I don't know how Google is
about that, but some companies,

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.510
if you screw up, they--

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.200
whatever, bad review
or your project

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.570
failed or you did
something that didn't work

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:29.520
and you get criticized
for it, and they

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.166
make you afraid to
fail, which is a very--

00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:36.360
it's a creativity killer.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.320
As a theoretical physicist,
I know that almost every idea

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.410
I have sucks.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.230
And sometimes the
only question is,

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.490
does it take me five
minutes or 50 days

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.770
to figure out that it sucks?

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.800
And then you go
through a lot of those

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.800
and eventually you get
one that doesn't, and you

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.860
publish something.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.749
But if you're afraid
to make that jump--

00:39:54.749 --> 00:39:56.540
or even when I'm writing
it's the same way.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.700
I write a lot of
stuff that's stupid.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.500
And I just hope that I notice
that before I publish the book

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.429
and take it out and
somebody tells me.

00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:05.720
But if I was afraid to write
something that was stupid,

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.500
I would never write anything
that was interesting either.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.910
I would just write a textbook.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:12.090
So I think that's another thing.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.350
Work on your fear of failure.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.660
And if you have a
problem, I think

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.910
it's very important to fail,
talk about when you fail,

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:23.090
think about when you fail, think
about when other people fail,

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.590
open up about it
and get used to it.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.006
Like, when I learned
how to ski, I

00:40:26.006 --> 00:40:28.467
realized soon that
the first thing

00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:30.050
I would do when I
got to the ski slope

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:33.170
is fall over because I was
skiing really stiff because I

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:34.350
didn't want to fall over.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:37.790
And I was skiing badly
because I was afraid to fall.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.540
But if I fall immediately,
I get that over

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.580
with, oh, it's not so bad.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.196
I'm going to fall today.

00:40:41.196 --> 00:40:43.050
I'm not Going to
have a fall-free day.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.220
And then I could really ski.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.610
And it's the same
thing with failure.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.560
So it's good to fail.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.580
Get used to it,
embrace it, enjoy it.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.580
The more you fail, the
more success you'll have.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.670
Just keep doing it.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.870
Or the more--
consistently speaking.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.230
I'm not saying that
failure is a success.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:02.550
So that's another
thing you can do.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.770
Oh.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:05.670
Argue with people.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.560
Arguing is very good.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.900
Talk to people who
totally disagree with you,

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.860
who are very different.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.010
If you're a very
conventional eater,

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.840
go to the weirdest
restaurant you can.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.990
Travel-- I mean, all these
things, they've shown,

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.151
have increased your
elastic thinking.

00:41:20.151 --> 00:41:22.400
They've even shown-- it was
an interesting experiment.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.110
They had people in a room, and
they had these paint chips.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:31.250
And some were red, some were
green, and some were blue.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.900
And they'd have 10
people in the room.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.480
One of them was a confederate,
an associate of the researcher,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.220
because if you're
ever in a experiment,

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.232
you'll know that it's
never what they tell you.

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:42.940
And everyone says, is
this green or blue.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.600
And they say, blue, blue, blue.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.360
And then this
confederate said, green.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.140
The thing was obviously
blue, but he would say green.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.140
That was the experiment.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.630
So then they told
people, you're going

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:56.880
to be in an
unrelated experiment.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.614
Well, if a psychologist
ever tells you that, no.

00:42:00.614 --> 00:42:04.182
Just laugh in their face.

00:42:04.182 --> 00:42:06.140
So the second experiment,
supposedly unrelated,

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.930
was they'd give you these
paint chips to categorize.

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.570
Now, they're all on the
spectrum between blue and green.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:17.222
So there's a continuous
spectrum of frequency

00:42:17.222 --> 00:42:19.680
between blue and green, and
they would give you these paint

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.950
chips and you had to say which
are blue and which are green.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:22.658
Well, guess what.

00:42:22.658 --> 00:42:25.620
Even though the
people who saw the guy

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.270
in that other
experiment, he called--

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.141
whatever I said, he called
the blue chip green--

00:42:31.141 --> 00:42:33.390
and they thought that was
stupid, it was really blue--

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.010
when they are now
categorizing these chips,

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.980
it all depends on
where you draw the line

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.570
between green and blue.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.630
Well, the ones who saw that guy
who said that green was blue

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.490
drew the line much
closer to blue--

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:48.070
I mean made the blue
section much bigger

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.470
than the ones who
weren't in that.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.812
So even though this person's
ridiculous statement

00:42:52.812 --> 00:42:54.270
didn't seem to
influence them, they

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:57.342
were influenced subtly
later on in their judgment.

00:42:57.342 --> 00:42:58.800
So even when someone
says something

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.550
that you totally
disagree with and you go,

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.255
that's really stupid,
it can actually

00:43:02.255 --> 00:43:03.630
have an effect on
your thinking--

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:04.690
but I mean a positive effect.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.106
It can expand your thinking
and the kinds of possibilities

00:43:07.106 --> 00:43:09.000
that you think about.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.130
So yeah.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:16.246
We'll have some more of
this raspberry juice.

00:43:16.246 --> 00:43:18.780
SPEAKER: Now I have
that in my head.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.745
LEONARD MLODINOW:
You're right, it's head.

00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:23.370
SPEAKER: Well, we'll
wrap up with this.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.860
You have various bits of wisdom
from your parents in the book.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.776
I read something about
a worm and horseradish.

00:43:27.776 --> 00:43:30.700
You'll have to read the book
to know more about that.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.710
And from your mother, you
have the phrase, where

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:33.960
there's a will, there's a way.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.730
How does this relate
to being elastic?

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.230
LEONARD MLODINOW:
Well, it has to do

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.100
with what I was
talking about failure

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:46.090
and about how sometimes the
best elastic thinking comes

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.622
from when you don't
accept what you see,

00:43:48.622 --> 00:43:51.080
or when you don't accept that
you're not going to get there

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.580
and you just keep trying.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.760
So the idea is that if you
broaden your perspective

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.350
and the amount that--

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:03.295
broaden the range of ideas that
you find that you'll consider

00:44:03.295 --> 00:44:05.230
or that your brain
proposes to you,

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.410
you have a much greater
chance of solving a problem,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.900
even though you think that
it can't possibly be solved.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.180
SPEAKER: Well,
thank you very much.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.530
[APPLAUSE]
