00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.530
Now TCP serves many applications well, but others want

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.240
to handle the problems of liability and flow control in

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.420
their own way. For this, they often use the

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.930
User Datagram Protocol or UDP, which is much simpler. The

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.059
header that gets attached to the payload includes only

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.180
the source and destination ports, the length of the data,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.365
and a check sum to help detect data corruption.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.370
There's no initial handshake or enforced mechanism for the order

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.740
of packets, they're just fired across the network. When

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.770
is UDP used? Well, if you have a very reliable

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.655
local network, then there's no need for the reliability or

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:38.805
out-of-order protections of TCP. All those acknowledgements would just be

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.090
wasted bandwidth. You would rather have the lower overhead

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.670
of the smaller UDP header and protocol. Streaming applications, where

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.300
it is more important to be on time than to

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.210
be right, prefer UDP. Think of voice over IP. A

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.320
user would much prefer a temporary degradation in the quality

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.710
of sound to incurring a delay, which makes conversation difficult.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.500
If a packet is dropped, we might want to simply

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.550
say that it is too late and not bother trying

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.560
to incorporate its data. Similarly for video, a user would

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.620
much prefer an occasional low quality frame to having the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.120
video intermittently start and stop, but with a perfect picture.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.790
UDP tends to be more popular for these types of applications.
