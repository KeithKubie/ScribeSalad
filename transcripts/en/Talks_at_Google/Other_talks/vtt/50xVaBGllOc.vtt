00:00:00.692 --> 00:00:03.970
MALE SPEAKER: Get ready for
the incredible hypnotist

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.420
Richard Barker live on stage.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.620
Originating from
the United Kingdom,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.240
he has hypnotized thousands of
people from all over the world,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.580
from the Cayman Islands and
Bermuda to London and Las

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.670
Vegas.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.110
He is considered one of
Europe's number one hypnotists

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.610
and is moments away from
dazzling and intriguing

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.850
you with the mystifying
phenomenon called hypnosis.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.020
Richard Barker has been featured
on television and radio, as

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.570
well as magazines,
and has also published

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.180
a book explaining the
secrets of the stage you're

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.860
about to witness right now.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.840
Ladies and gentlemen,
sit back and relax,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.760
and be taken on a journey
of mesmerizing hypnosis.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.260
Laugh harder than
ever before, and be

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.470
amazed beyond your
wildest imagination.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.420
This is a once in a
lifetime opportunity

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.040
where you can be in
the show, giving you

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.960
the best seat in the house,
or watch it from the audience.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.790
Either way, the
journey is ready.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.555
Please put your hands
together and welcome

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:09.302
the incredible hypnotist
Richard Barker.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:11.260
RICHARD BARKER: All right
ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.176
how are you all doing?

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:13.800
Good to see each and
every one of you.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.400
My name is Richard Barker,
the Incredible Hypnotist.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.080
Now how many of you
guys seen a hypnosis

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.445
show before, or actually
experienced hypnosis?

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:21.560
A few of you guys?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.146
How many of you guys have
been hypnotized before?

00:01:25.146 --> 00:01:25.645
OK.

00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:27.478
See, I would argue each
and every one of you

00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:28.930
probably have been hypnotized.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.750
Maybe you just
don't know it yet.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.700
Hypnosis is a phenomenon
that actually is just as

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.980
unique as the air you breathe.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.900
It's all around us.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.670
Now as a professional
hypnotist, I travel pretty much

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.640
across the country and in fact
the world hypnotizing people.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670
And my biggest
hurdle is actually

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.072
getting people the sense that
hypnosis is actually real.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.530
So how many of you
guys-- you won't

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.120
hurt my feeling--
how many of you

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.470
guys think hypnosis
might be fake?

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.280
Couple of you guys.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.222
See, I've been faking this
about 20 years successfully

00:01:55.222 --> 00:01:56.680
and I've been
getting away with it.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.080
In fact nobody's caught me yet.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.480
Of course hypnosis is real.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.720
In my day job, I help people
for weight loss, stop smoking,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.380
removing fears and phobias.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.360
I help athletes
improve their game,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.946
whether it's golf,
tennis, basketball.

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:11.710
And when I work on
the cruise ships,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.130
I turn ordinary people
into extraordinary people

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.430
through using the
power of the mind.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.990
Now all hypnosis is-- there's
a whole ton of definitions

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.760
out there.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.210
But honestly, the
best definition

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.470
I can give you for
what hypnosis is it's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.277
a heightened sense
of suggestibility.

00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:29.860
In other words, when you see an
advert or you see a billboard,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.530
you have a normal
level of suggestion.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.560
You go oh, that's pretty cool.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.518
I might check that out.

00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:36.030
Under hypnosis though, you
have a heightened sense

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.140
of suggestibility.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.770
It's not a case of saying well
I might just check that out.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.590
You have a natural
desire and an impulse

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.430
to buy whatever it is on that
billboard through hypnosis.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.330
That's why they use
hypnosis in infomercials.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.874
Now what we're
going to do today is

00:02:47.874 --> 00:02:50.040
we're going to debunk some
of the myths of hypnosis.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.706
We're going to
demonstrate it right here

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:52.623
with a few volunteers.

00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:54.372
I know there's a few
of you eager and very

00:02:54.372 --> 00:02:55.360
keen to get up on here.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.240
And we'll get you up on
stage in just a few moments.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.640
And when I do so, I'll
be using your imagination

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.370
to give the presentation.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.980
So just before I do so, some
of the misconceptions for

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.970
hypnosis.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.200
Now sometimes people
think you just

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.470
have to be flat out
dumber than a box of rocks

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.920
to be hypnotized.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.835
How many of you guys
might think that?

00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:16.900
One or two of you.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.390
But in fact the
opposite is true.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.830
It's been proven that those that
make the best hypnotic subjects

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.840
actually have an above
average level of intelligence.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.570
Stands to reason.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.070
I'm going to be asking you to
focus, relax, and concentrate.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.280
Listen to the sound of my
voice and my voice only.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.320
Shut off all other suggestions
coming into your brain

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.400
and just listen to mine
for about 45 minutes.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.070
Which believe it or
not is very tough to do

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.570
if you're the kind of person
that can't concentrate for more

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.670
than two or three minutes.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.591
It's difficult.

00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:44.840
So you could have above
average level of intelligence.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.760
Some people think that
when I hypnotise them,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.524
I just go out of my way to
make them look flat out stupid.

00:03:50.524 --> 00:03:51.190
I don't do that.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.370
Some of you guys
don't need my help.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.230
And those that do--
and I'm just kidding.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.939
I'm just kidding.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.479
I don't go out of my way to make
you look stupid or embarrass

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.920
you or ridicule you in any way.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.160
But when I do demonstrate
the power of the mind,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.810
you will feel a level of
hypnosis or relaxation

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.710
that you've probably
never experienced

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.390
before in your
life, I promise you,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.320
unless of course
you've been hypnotized.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.030
Now one hour of hypnosis
feels like four to six hours

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.680
of uninterrupted sleep.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.181
I know some of you
guys in this room

00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:17.888
probably want a good
power nap right now,

00:04:17.888 --> 00:04:19.168
and this is the place to come.

00:04:19.168 --> 00:04:19.959
I promise you that.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.120
Now, also I want to let you
know that you won't do anything

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.510
that you don't want to do.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.470
There is a critical factor in
your brain that protects you

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.844
from any suggestions that I give
you that go against the grain.

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:34.260
For example, if I all of a
sudden get you sat in the chair

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.718
and tell you to
wet your pants, you

00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:37.475
won't wet your
pants because there

00:04:37.475 --> 00:04:39.720
will be a moral
protector in your brain.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.120
You will only follow natural
decisions and suggestions

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.220
that I give you that
you can comply to.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.960
So some people ask me,
can I hypnotize you

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.562
against your will?

00:04:49.562 --> 00:04:52.415
Can I sneak up behind you and
just zap you into hypnosis?

00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:54.040
If I could do that,
I wouldn't be here,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.839
I'd be hanging around the
banks, extracting PIN numbers

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:57.380
all day long.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.629
But it doesn't work like that.

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.610
So I can't hypnotize you unless
you actually really and truly

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.850
want to be hypnotized.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.300
So you must will it
and want it to happen.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.080
And when you do
become hypnotized,

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.580
normally there is an 80-20 rule.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.570
80% can and will be hypnotized.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.130
20% for whatever
reason just means

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.360
they were not focused, relaxed,
or concentrated on what I said.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.925
So we're going to
have some fun here.

00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:20.300
We are going to
have a good time.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.130
I'm going to get some
volunteers up on here.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.270
But like I said before, we are
looking for above average level

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.080
of intelligence.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.586
And I know you
guys are very smart

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:27.710
and that's why you're here.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.180
But let me just
test it real quick.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.980
Everybody put your hand up
like this, do me a favor.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.313
Just put your hand up like this.

00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:34.959
Make a perfect circle like this,
just a perfect circle with all

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.000
the tops of your fingers.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.997
Look at my circle.

00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:37.830
Look at your circle.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.330
Good.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.050
Make a gun.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.610
Make a perfect circle with
the tops of your fingers.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.520
Make the peace sign to
make a perfect circle.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.519
Look right at my circle.

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:48.060
Look at yours, and just place
it right there on your chin.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.230
That's right, it's here sir.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.652
Your chin is down there.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:52.801
Oh my word.

00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:54.800
It's just a level of
suggestibility, that's all.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.550
That's not hypnosis
or anything like that.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.000
But it just demonstrates
people do follow suggestions

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.970
uncritically thinking.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.356
Now what hypnosis is,
just very quickly, there

00:06:03.356 --> 00:06:04.480
are two parts to the brain.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.760
There's the conscious mind
and the subconscious mind.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.950
What I get into is
the subconscious mind,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.650
and that's where a lot
of creative juices flow.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.260
It's where you operate.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.270
It's where your DNA is.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.400
It's where your habits,
behaviors, beliefs are.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.952
Your conscious
mind is just simply

00:06:17.952 --> 00:06:19.410
what am I going to
have for dinner,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.930
what time am I
going to leave work,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.388
and what am I going
to do tomorrow.

00:06:22.388 --> 00:06:25.540
That's critical short term
memory decision making.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.100
But the subconscious mind
accepts truth as behavior

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.720
if I give you a
direct suggestion

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.180
to believe it to be true.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.160
In other words, if I say my
jacket is green, under hypnosis

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.780
you will see a green jacket.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.690
In other words, in
the subconscious mind,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.010
you're programmed,
just like the computer,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.450
to react to certain trigger
words that I would give you.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.440
And the best explanation I can
give you is the conscious mind

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.810
just simply opens
and closes programs.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.710
It's a mouse click.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.720
It's a mouse click here.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.761
It's a mouse click there.

00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:55.040
And then you open
and close programs.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.460
But hypnosis, in operating
in the subconscious mind,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.540
actually records every single
keystroke you make since

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.920
inception of the build of the
computer until pretty much

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.010
it's crushed, which is why law
enforcement immediately take

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.150
the computer away and start
analyzing the hard drive

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.970
for all the keystrokes that
you just cannot get rid of.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.070
And the subconscious
mind operates exactly

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.230
in the same way.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.870
It records everything you
do in life from birth,

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.390
some would argue
even beforehand.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.810
And it records
everything you do,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.700
almost like a camera is just
completely on all the time.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.750
Which means in your naught to
seven years, whatever typically

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.970
happened in that impressionable
part of your life

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.855
carries through into adult life.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.420
Now what hypnosis can
do, it can actually

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.500
intervene if you have a nasty
habit or behavior that you

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.100
picked up along the way
along life's journey,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.640
it can actually erase
it and scrub the scene.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.460
It can also add
something to the scene.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.560
So if you want to
improve performance,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.170
it can add that to the scene.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.397
so that's kind of
quickly what hypnosis is.

00:07:56.397 --> 00:07:57.730
There was another demonstration.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.480
I just want you to look
at the screens real quick.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.896
Look at either
side of the screen.

00:08:00.896 --> 00:08:03.157
You'll see in a few
moments a hypnotic spiral.

00:08:03.157 --> 00:08:05.240
And I want you to look at
that screen in a second.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.070
And when you focus
on the spiral,

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.870
I just want you to
stare completely

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.950
in the center of the spiral.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.040
We'll just get Foster
up and running.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.164
And then when you do look
at that, what you'll find

00:08:15.164 --> 00:08:17.420
is you'll find a
laser focus effect.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.490
We got it?

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.770
So what hypnosis-- here we go.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.120
So what hypnosis does, it
gives you a guided level

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.030
of concentration.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.760
So for example if you
ever tried to stream

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.420
two movies at the same time,
normally your bandwidth

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.170
can't take it.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.740
Well the mind is the same way.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.900
If you try and stream multiple
information into the brain,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.340
eventually all the streaming
and all the multiple monitors

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.380
or the multiple
approaches fail, which

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.010
is why hypnosis is used
for laser targeted focus.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.540
If you focus on just one
object in particular,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.340
your mind will accept it
and perform far better than

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.970
if you tried to multitask.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.120
So what I want you to do
is stare at the center

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.167
of the spiral.

00:08:56.167 --> 00:08:58.250
And the more you stare,
the more tired you become.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.499
The more tired you become,
the more in fact you stare.

00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:03.230
As you stare at that spiral,
at some point soon when you

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.450
begin to see a tunnel effect,
I'll count from one up to five.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.602
Keep staring at the spiral.

00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:09.310
When I do ask you to
stare at the spiral,

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.850
just look at the
center of the bullseye.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.266
I'll count up from
one up to five.

00:09:12.266 --> 00:09:12.802
And focus.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.260
Don't look around,
fidget, or fuss.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.000
Just stare at the spiral.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.380
One, feeling relaxed.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.510
Two, looking at the spiral.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.930
Three, looking at the
bullseye drifting in and out

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:21.760
of your mind.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.926
Four, the deeper you
go, the better you feel.

00:09:23.926 --> 00:09:25.550
The better you feel,
the deeper you go.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.320
And in a few
moments but not yet,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.430
you'll look away from
the monitor, but not yet.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.096
Now when you look
away from the monitor,

00:09:31.096 --> 00:09:32.610
stare straight at my face.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.674
Five, stare at my face.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.410
Yeah.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.580
Sometimes you'll see
the swirling effect that

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.880
translates and actually
moves from one item

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.090
or one object
directly to the other.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.690
Which is no different to how
you guys operate at work.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.940
Sometimes you take that
baggage to that situation

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.510
or that problem to
another problem.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.660
And what the mind actually
is better off doing

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.580
is putting them into
compartments, dealing with them

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.450
and moving them out.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.240
So in your professional
lives, what we teach through

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.380
hypnosis is the power
of self-hypnosis.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.280
All hypnosis actually
is self-hypnosis

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.070
with a level of
guided meditation,

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.574
but with suggestions.

00:10:11.574 --> 00:10:12.990
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.642
going to demonstrate hypnosis
right here, right now.

00:10:15.642 --> 00:10:17.600
And I'm going to be asking
for some volunteers.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.840
And when I do so, just
a couple of things.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.640
Please come up here without any
injuries, illnesses, ailments,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.480
or complaints that
you can blame on me.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.050
Please do not come
up here if you

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.490
want to test hypnosis and
battle of the hypnotist,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.060
because you will
win and I will lose.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.820
I just don't have time
to really convince you

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.164
that you want to be hypnotized.

00:10:34.164 --> 00:10:36.830
In other words, you must want to
be hypnotized to be hypnotized.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.970
So if we do have some
willing volunteers that

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.830
would like to feel the
effects of hypnosis,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.890
then let's have you up on
stage and occupy a seat

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.305
right here, right now.

00:10:45.305 --> 00:10:47.430
We want a full nine seats,
every one of you filled.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.880
Come on up.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.546
Give a round of
applause as they come up

00:10:49.546 --> 00:10:51.610
and volunteer to be hypnotized.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.810
Can turn away the
spiral there Foster.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.220
All right, good.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.981
We've got nine people.

00:10:56.981 --> 00:10:58.980
If we can get nine people,
the more the merrier.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.200
Come on up if you
want to be hypnotized.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.770
Good, good, keep coming up.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.640
Perfect.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.630
Couple more chairs,
maybe a couple more guys.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.940
If you're thinking about it
and feeling it, come on up.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.480
Come on up.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.900
Come on up.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.321
All right, we've got one
more seat, one more seat.

00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:12.820
Come on.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.819
All right, we've got it.

00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:14.900
Brilliant.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.030
Excellent.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.100
Give me a round of applause
ladies and gentlemen.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.612
They're going to be sharing
their personalities with you.

00:11:20.612 --> 00:11:21.640
All right.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.390
Now I'm assuming each
and every one of you

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.820
have not been hypnotized before.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.770
RICHARD BARKER: Oh wonderful.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.020
So you know you're more
likely to be hypnotized again.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.960
It's probably
about 80% actually.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.030
So you're going to drop
like a rock probably first.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.110
Makes my job easy cause
I've got one already.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.859
That's good.

00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:38.650
All right, perfect.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.820
Anybody else?

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.300
All right, so just
do me a favor.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.330
I'll give you a demonstration
of what hypnosis feels like.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.690
Put your feet firmly
flat on the floor.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.273
Put your hands
uncrossed on your laps.

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:48.327
Uncross it, that's right.

00:11:48.327 --> 00:11:49.910
And just listen to
each and every word

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.360
I say from this point forward.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.020
I want you to just
look straight ahead.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.640
I'll count to three.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.820
When I count to three, just
simply close your eyes.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.540
One, two, three.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.930
Close your eyes.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.377
Open them back up.

00:12:01.377 --> 00:12:02.710
That's what hypnosis feels like.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.640
There's no lotion,
potion, magic pixie dust.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.056
Harry Potter's not going to
run on stage with a magic wand

00:12:07.056 --> 00:12:08.712
and zap you into hypnosis.

00:12:08.712 --> 00:12:10.560
See, sometimes ladies
and gentlemen people

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.425
are expecting to feel
a sense of hypnosis.

00:12:13.425 --> 00:12:14.550
And there really isn't any.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.940
All it is are your
eyes are closed

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.250
and you listen to each
and every suggestion

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.590
I give you, which is what
you guys can do yourself.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.760
You know that little voice
in your head giving you

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.290
that little sort of self talk?

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.910
That self talk can be positive
or it can be negative.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.520
Depends on what
that little voice

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.990
is saying to you at this
particular moment in time.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.810
Now what we're
going to do is we're

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.340
going to shut that little--
whoa, you're already there,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.425
aren't you?

00:12:33.425 --> 00:12:35.920
Soon as you get that upturned
wrist, that means yeah.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.970
Do you meditate?

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:37.897
You do, don't you?

00:12:37.897 --> 00:12:39.480
All right, awesome,
you're number two,

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.670
is going to drop
like a rock as well.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.990
Now you know as well as I do
that what the mind believes,

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.500
the mind achieves, right?

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.927
So if I set up and frame
this the right way, what

00:12:48.927 --> 00:12:51.260
I'm actually doing is I'm
giving them embedded commands,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.340
embedded suggestion.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.760
In fact it's just
like embedded code.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.761
I'm coding them right now
to fall into hypnosis,

00:12:56.761 --> 00:12:58.051
and I haven't even done it yet.

00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:00.080
It's just an embedded
suggestion that you guys

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.570
will be wonderful, each
and every one of you,

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.304
if you can focus,
relax, and concentrate.

00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:05.220
And you're quite tired,
aren't you, right now?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.060
We're going to get
you a good power nap.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.226
It's what's going to happen.

00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:10.020
Now there are just
a couple of rules.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.160
Please do not leave the stage
unless I ask you to do so.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.730
If I ask you to leave the
stage, I'll whisper in your ear,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.205
leave the stage.

00:13:17.205 --> 00:13:19.080
Now without any worries,
troubles, or fusses,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.296
just stand up and make your
way back into your seat.

00:13:21.296 --> 00:13:22.670
It doesn't mean
I don't love you,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.140
it just means I can't
use you for the show.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.190
Maybe you weren't at the
right level of hypnosis

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.050
that I can use you for, OK?

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.820
But don't leave of
your own free will.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.653
So here's what happens
ladies and gentlemen.

00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:35.050
Some people don't know whether
they're hypnotized or not.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.384
And all of a sudden they stand
up, they leave the stage,

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.758
and all of a sudden they really
and truly were hypnotized

00:13:39.758 --> 00:13:42.080
and they go and do something
really outrageous outside

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.637
and blame it on me afterwards.

00:13:43.637 --> 00:13:45.970
So I've already told you,
don't leave the stage unless I

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.562
ask you to do so anybody.

00:13:47.562 --> 00:13:50.262
Anybody out in the audience that
feels the effects of hypnosis--

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.600
there will be a few of you
as you tune into my voice,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.839
you'll start to feel getting
hypnotized in your seat,

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:58.130
actually during this little
bit of a presentation here.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.110
If you do feel that effects,
the person sitting next to you,

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.790
do me a favor and take pictures
of them as fast as you can.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.770
But don't let them
fall out of their chair

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.770
and bang their head.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.570
They'll have a massive
headache afterwards.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.570
But if I do see them
hypnotized in the audience,

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.861
I might ask them if they want
to be a part of the show.

00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:16.040
Or I'll certainly
wake you up and have

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.400
you enjoy the rest of the show.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.630
Because this really and truly
is the best seat in the house

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.180
that you guys have
now just occupied,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.370
because you'll have a
heightened sense of relaxation.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.850
But also you'll
have a heightened

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.730
sense of listening to each and
every suggestion I give you.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.790
Nod your head if you understand.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.462
Perfect.

00:14:32.462 --> 00:14:34.920
All right, so just in a few
moments, just some final rules.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.740
Please block out all
the sounds around you

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.690
out as if they no longer
exist and just listen

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.731
to the sound of my voice.

00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:42.080
Fully relax and just
listen to my voice

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.610
and allow yourself to go.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.090
I know some people in this
room are rather analytical.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.010
So sometimes if I ask
you to relax and float

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.300
on a soft fluffy
cloud of relaxation,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.302
don't analyze how thick the
cloud is or how long it is

00:14:54.302 --> 00:14:55.010
or how big it is.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.711
Just assume that you can float
on a soft fluffy cloud, OK?

00:14:58.711 --> 00:15:00.960
Because sometimes that is a
sticking point with people

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.543
and they'll ask me
afterwards, they'll

00:15:02.543 --> 00:15:05.810
say, man, that cloud had a
little bit of gray in it.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.500
I don't know, but
just go with it, OK?

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.080
Sounds good?

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.990
And I won't embarrass you
to do anything silly here.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.448
We're just here to
feel the effects

00:15:12.448 --> 00:15:15.350
and the phenomenon of hypnosis
and how it can apply to you

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.390
and your lives moving forward.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.114
Sounds cool?

00:15:19.114 --> 00:15:21.530
All right, so just put your
feet firmly flat on the floor.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.071
Put your hand
uncrossed on your laps.

00:15:23.071 --> 00:15:27.731
Just begin to relax as
you listen to my voice.

00:15:27.731 --> 00:15:30.230
Just get a bit more volume on
that, Foster, just this track.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.960
That's wonderful.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.850
Now just for the
hypnotised volunteers

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.160
as you relax peacefully,
resting each and every day,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.390
I just want you to listen to the
sound of my voice and my voice

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:37.890
only.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.327
Now understand something, you
can't get stuck in hypnosis.

00:15:40.327 --> 00:15:42.660
If you don't hear the sound
of my voice for five minutes

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.750
or more, you will naturally
emerge from hypnosis.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.200
In other words, if I fall
off the stage, bang my head,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.860
get a concussion,
go to the hospital,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.690
after five minutes you'll
wonder where on earth I am.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.621
But at least you won't be stuck
here or trapped all afternoon.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.370
Now each and every one
of you can and will

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.369
be hypnotized if you just
want to be hypnotized.

00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:00.821
Let it go and just relax.

00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:02.320
So the hypnotised
volunteers, I want

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.300
you to stare at the ceiling.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.360
You'll see some bright lights.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.940
And as you stare
at the ceiling, I

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.620
want you to find a fixed
object or a fixed light.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.496
Now just begin to
stare at the light.

00:16:10.496 --> 00:16:13.120
Now in a few moments, I want you
to realize the more you stare,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.990
the more tired you become.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.850
The more tired you become,
the more you stare.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.780
You guys in the audience
can find a fixed object

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.690
somewhere in the room as
well and just stare at it.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.773
And the more you stare,
the more tired you become.

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:23.660
Now I'll be using the
word sleep quite a lot.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.243
You won't actually
be sleeping though,

00:16:25.243 --> 00:16:26.722
but it's just the word we use.

00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:27.555
You will be relaxed.

00:16:27.555 --> 00:16:29.420
Now in a few
moments as you focus

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.636
in on the light,
the more you breathe

00:16:31.636 --> 00:16:34.260
and the more you hear my voice,
the more you will simply relax.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.281
Now I'll count to three.

00:16:35.281 --> 00:16:37.030
But not before, keep
staring at the light.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.950
When I do count to three, we'll
just regulate and teach you

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.080
how to breathe and relax.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.590
In a second when
I count to three,

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.444
we'll take a deep breath
in and out with me,

00:16:43.444 --> 00:16:45.610
and you'll push all the
aches and pains, the worries

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.240
and the troubles
of the world away.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.220
Allow yourself to sink
and drift and relax

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.040
and melt into a
level of relaxation.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.550
One, two, three.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.971
Take a deep breath in.

00:16:56.971 --> 00:16:59.160
And breathe out.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:16:59.660
That's good.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.570
And just relax, each
and every way feeling

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:02.630
wonderful about yourself.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.796
Now in a second I'll count
to three, but not before.

00:17:04.796 --> 00:17:06.329
Keep staring at
your chosen object.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:07.162
I'll count to three.

00:17:07.162 --> 00:17:09.100
Simply take a deep breath
in and out with me.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.849
Every time you breathe
in and breathe out,

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.770
you'll feel the
sense of relaxation.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.810
One, two, three.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.616
Breathe in.

00:17:16.616 --> 00:17:17.810
Good, breathe out.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.663
Push all the aches and
pains, worries away.

00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:21.329
What happened today
is just another day.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.710
What happens tomorrow
is a distant dream away.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.309
What happened yesterday just
went into the memory vault.

00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:28.850
Now in a few moments I'll ask
to take another deep breath in.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.474
This time when I ask
you to breathe in,

00:17:30.474 --> 00:17:32.410
you'll simply breathe
in and close your eyes.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.740
And when you breathe out,
you'll allow your heavy head

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.990
to rest down to your chest.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.650
Once again, I'll count to three.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:38.440
You'll take a deep breath in.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.160
When you breathe in,
allow your eyes to close.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.790
And when you breathe out,
allow your heavy head

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.914
to rest down to your chest.

00:17:42.914 --> 00:17:45.000
Now don't worry whether
I'm standing to the front,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.041
to the back, to the left,
or to the right of you.

00:17:47.041 --> 00:17:48.120
Just listen to my voice.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.240
One, two, three.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.700
Breathe in.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.920
Close your eyes and breathe out.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.750
Just feel the aches and pains,
worries and troubles disappear.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.732
And allow your heavy head just
to rest down to your chest.

00:17:59.732 --> 00:18:01.690
Now from this point
forward, the deeper you go,

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.330
the better you feel.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.788
The better you
feel, the deeper you

00:18:03.788 --> 00:18:06.774
go, keeping yourself fully
relaxed at all times.

00:18:06.774 --> 00:18:08.190
Now in a few
moments, but not yet,

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.817
as you feel a sense
of relaxation,

00:18:09.817 --> 00:18:11.650
as you listen to my
voice, allow all thought

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.822
processes to disappear and
just tune into my voice.

00:18:15.822 --> 00:18:17.530
Now in a few moments
I'll count to three.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.010
But not before, when
I do reach three,

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.340
you'll just simply
open your eyes.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.500
You'll look at the object you
were looking at moments ago.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.250
And as soon as you find
it, your eyes will close

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.874
and you'll sink down
further and deeper

00:18:25.874 --> 00:18:27.880
into a sense of relaxation.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.177
Because the deeper you
go, the better you feel.

00:18:30.177 --> 00:18:31.760
In a few moments,
I'll count to three.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.880
You'll simply open your eyes.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.230
You'll look at
your chosen object.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.670
And as soon as you find
it, your eyes will close.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.400
You'll sink down further
and deeper into relaxation.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.800
Every time you open and close
your eyes, think of sleep.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.150
One, two, three.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.830
Open your eyes.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:45.470
Look at the object.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.886
Close your eyes even further
and deeper, all the way down.

00:18:47.886 --> 00:18:48.915
Keep your eyes closed.

00:18:48.915 --> 00:18:50.790
Now you'll keep your
eyes closed at all times

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.831
unless I ask you to open.

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:53.265
Keep them completely closed.

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.390
In a few moments, but not
yet, I'll count to three,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.170
but not before.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.100
When I've reached three,
you'll simply open your eyes.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.100
You'll look at the
objects and you

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.780
find that your eyes will close.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.430
Every time you open and close
your eyes, think of sleep.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.750
One, two, three.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.830
Open your eyes and close
them all the way down.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.080
Allow your heavy head just
to rest down to your chest,

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.780
keeping your eyes
closed at all times.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.745
Nothing will trouble,
worry, or disturb you.

00:19:13.745 --> 00:19:15.925
In any way, allow
yourself to relax.

00:19:15.925 --> 00:19:18.520
Now in a few seconds I'll
count to three one more time.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.490
This time when I reach three,
you'll simply open your eyes.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.680
You'll look at the object.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.300
As soon as you find it,
your eyes will close.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.758
You'll sink down
further and deeper

00:19:24.758 --> 00:19:26.820
into a level of relaxation.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.850
One, two, three.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.140
Open your eyes and close them.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.973
All the way down, just
allow your heavy head

00:19:31.973 --> 00:19:33.110
to rest down to your chest.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.443
Push all the aches and pains,
worries and troubles away.

00:19:35.443 --> 00:19:37.540
You feel wonderful
about yourself.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.640
The abilities to
be able to relax

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.670
are so profound
and so unique, you

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.590
will never lose this experience
for the rest of your lives.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.100
Now in a few
seconds but not yet,

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.690
I want you to focus
on the soft muscle

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.777
tissue surrounding your eyes,
also known as your eyelids.

00:19:50.777 --> 00:19:53.110
But I want you to imagine
your eyes are becoming heavier

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.140
and heavier and heavier.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.720
In fact in a few
moments but not yet,

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.320
I want you to imagine it's
almost as if superglue has

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.032
been poured across your eyes.

00:20:01.032 --> 00:20:03.490
I want you to imagine your eyes
becoming so heavy, so lazy,

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.440
and so tight that
as you focus in

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.580
on your muscles of
your eyes, imagine

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.160
your eyes becoming heavier
and heavier and heavier.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.760
Imagination is way more
powerful than knowledge

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.960
or anything else.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.890
Imagine it's almost as if
your eyes are so heavy,

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.972
so shut tight, so tired-- in
a few moments but not yet,

00:20:21.972 --> 00:20:23.680
when I ask you to try
and open your eyes,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.480
you won't be able to.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.146
In fact, it's almost
as if superglue has

00:20:26.146 --> 00:20:27.560
been poured across your eyes.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.240
In a few seconds but not yet,
I want you to try and open

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.720
your eyes, but not before.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.480
Now you'll realize the more
you try and open your eyes,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.230
the more you fail.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.830
The more you fail,
the more you try.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.230
But you'll realize
in a few seconds,

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.950
but not yet, when I ask you
to try and open your eyes,

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.330
you'll understand the more
you try and open them,

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.010
the more you fail.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.660
And the more you fail,
the more you try.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.830
But either way you will not
be able to open your eyes.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.330
It's almost as if
superglue has been

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.454
poured across your eyelids.

00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:50.139
Now you will lend me the
use of your imagination.

00:20:50.139 --> 00:20:51.930
Now one or two of you
might be able to peek

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.520
and open up your
eyes at this stage,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.220
but that's not why you're here.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.555
Just listen to the suggestions.

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.930
In a few moments when I ask
you to try to open your eyes,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:20:59.805
you won't be able to.

00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:01.170
They're stuck down to your face.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.907
Try and open your
eyes, but you can't.

00:21:02.907 --> 00:21:04.490
Try and open your
eyes, but you can't.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.680
Try and open your
eyes, but you can't.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.810
Try and open your
eyes, but you can't.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:07.640
Stop trying.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.570
Relax and just think of sleep.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.010
Each day in every way feeling
better about yourself.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.710
You're all doing
wonderful up on stage.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.510
Now in a few
seconds but not yet,

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.344
as you feel the sense
of relaxation drifting

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:19.801
from the top of your head all
the way down through the tips

00:21:19.801 --> 00:21:21.320
of your toes, no
power on earth can

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.760
stop you drifting into a
level of deeper relaxation.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.860
Because the deeper you
go, the better you feel.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.110
Now in a few moments but not
yet, I'll count to three.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.110
But not before, when
I do reach three,

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.310
I want you to imagine as
if every single muscle

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.250
tissue in your arms,
legs, face, and feet

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.792
just simply disappear
and collapse.

00:21:38.792 --> 00:21:40.250
In fact, I want
you to imagine it's

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.541
almost as if you're made from a
handful of loose rubber bands.

00:21:43.541 --> 00:21:45.040
When I reach three
but not before, I

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.140
want you to imagine
every muscle tissue,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.080
every fiber of your body
simply turns to jelly

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.990
and completely and
utterly relaxes.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.720
Any tension, any aches, or
any pains will just disappear.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.560
You'll feel yourself
loose and limp just

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.130
like a child's soft toy,
just like a wet dishrag.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.520
In fact on three, you'll
find every muscle tissue

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.350
in your body simply dissolves
and collapses, loose and limp

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.040
like a rag doll.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.630
You'll feel yourself slumping
forward in your chair.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.180
That's perfectly normal.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.100
You have imaginary seat belts
keeping you safe at all times.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.060
But you will allow every
single muscle tissue

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.460
to simply dissolve and
collapse, almost like a handful

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.740
of loose rubber bands.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.290
One, two, and three.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.160
Just collapse and each and every
muscle tissue in your arms,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.580
legs, face, and feet, allow
them to collapse, keeping

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.954
your eyes closed at all times.

00:22:30.954 --> 00:22:33.370
Now in a few moments, I'll be
coming up and down the line.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.280
I'll be touching you on
your left or right wrist.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.530
I will in fact just raise
your hand a couple of inches

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:38.112
off your lap.

00:22:38.112 --> 00:22:39.820
The moment you feel
me touching your hand

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.570
and raising it a few inches off
your lap, the minute your hand

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.240
touches back down
on your lap, it

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.960
will immediately send you
deeper and more relaxed.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.930
And the deeper you go,
the better you feel.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.920
Allow all the muscles
to simply dissolve

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.530
as I pick up your
left or right wrist

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.590
and just plop it back
down on your lap.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.630
Just allow yourself to relax.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.315
There you go.

00:22:57.315 --> 00:22:59.810
And the deeper you go, right
there, the better you feel.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.980
Just relaxing each and
every day and every way,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.500
feeling great about
yourself, relaxing deeper,

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.645
further, deeper you go.

00:23:06.645 --> 00:23:09.580
And as you feel me touching your
left or right wrist, the minute

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.110
your hand touches
back down on your lap,

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.560
it sends you further and deeper
into a level of relaxation.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.550
That's good.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.932
And the deeper you go,
the better you feel.

00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:20.890
Now in a few moments, I
want you to understand.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.420
You'll listen to each
and every word I say.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.030
And every word I
say becomes truth.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.594
And truth becomes
your ultimate reality.

00:23:26.594 --> 00:23:28.760
You will in fact keep your
eyes closed at all times.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.360
Unless I ask you
to open your eyes,

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.940
you'll keep them
completely closed.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.637
Now from this point forward
I want you to understand,

00:23:34.637 --> 00:23:36.220
if ever you hear the
audience give you

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.830
a massive round of applause,
no matter whether your eyes are

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.640
open or your eyes are
closed, if you ever

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.040
hear the audience give you
a massive round of applause,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.495
no matter whether your
eyes are open or closed,

00:23:44.495 --> 00:23:46.080
as soon as you
hear that applause,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.780
you realize it will
help you relax.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.260
It will send you
further and deeper

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.650
into a level of relaxation.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.870
Every time you hear a large
noise clapping, cheering,

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.522
it will just help you relax and
send you further and deeper.

00:23:56.522 --> 00:23:57.980
Now I want you to
understand you'll

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.750
hear the audience give you
a massive round of applause

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.770
in a few moments.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.860
The more applause you
hear, the better you feel.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.942
And the better you
feel, the deeper you go.

00:24:04.942 --> 00:24:06.650
Now ladies and gentlemen
in the audience,

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.150
I'll count to three,
but not before.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.720
When I do reach
three, I would like

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.610
you to give as much
noise out as you possibly

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.025
can on the understanding
that the more noise you make,

00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:14.900
the better they feel.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.130
The better they feel,
the deeper they go.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.501
And the deeper they go, the
better the presentation.

00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:21.000
So I'll count to three, and
help your friends and colleagues

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.900
relax.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.620
Get ready guys.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.835
One, two, three.

00:24:23.835 --> 00:24:26.085
Give it all up for the
volunteers, as loud as you can.

00:24:26.085 --> 00:24:27.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.370
Keeping your eyes
closed at all times.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.220
And the deeper you go,
the better you feel.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.060
And the better you
feel, the deeper you go.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.420
That's good guys.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.416
All right, we got it.

00:24:36.416 --> 00:24:38.040
Now just for the
hypnotised volunteers,

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.780
just some final words of advice.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.780
Now ladies and gentlemen,
this is a slightly bit

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.530
of a numbers game.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.720
Like I said before, 80% can
and will go into hypnosis.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.820
But there's always about 20%
that won't for whatever reason.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.906
So what I do is I
like to cut the pack.

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:52.530
I like to look at
who I'm going to keep

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.530
and who I'm going to release
back into the audience.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.988
So what I'm simply
doing is looking

00:24:55.988 --> 00:24:58.430
for those that have a level
of deeper relaxation, those

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.054
that can focus, relax,
and concentrate the most.

00:25:01.054 --> 00:25:02.470
And the way I do
it is just simply

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:03.779
by a power of elimination.

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:05.320
So in a few moments
but not yet, I'll

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.480
count to three but not before.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.100
When I do reach three,
your eyes will be open.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.725
You'll be sitting
upright in your chair

00:25:09.725 --> 00:25:10.710
when I do reach three.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.460
I want you to realize
that if you ever

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.104
hear me say the word
sleep, no matter

00:25:14.104 --> 00:25:16.270
whether your eyes are open
or closed, if you do ever

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.630
hear me say the word sleep, no
matter whether your eyes are

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.930
open or closed, as soon as you
hear me say the word sleep,

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.304
your eyes will
immediately close.

00:25:22.304 --> 00:25:24.540
You'll sink down in your
chair just like a rag doll.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.860
Now understand if you ever
hear me say the word sleep,

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.235
your eyes will
immediately close.

00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:30.772
You'll sink down in your
chair just like a rag doll.

00:25:30.772 --> 00:25:32.980
So ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce myself

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.120
to the volunteers.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.900
I like my volunteers to have a
chance to introduce themselves

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.570
to you guys.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.500
When I count to three, you'll
be fully alert, wide awake.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.320
One, two, and three.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:40.820
[CLAP]

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.110
Eyes open, welcome back guys.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.300
Awesome, good to see you.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.150
You guys know how
to rest and relax.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.349
That is beautiful.

00:25:46.349 --> 00:25:47.890
What did you say
your name was again?

00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:18.060

round of applause

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.351

00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:22.620
They're going to be sharing
their personalities with you.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.590
Relaxing all the way.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.390
Is anybody in the audience
feeling the effects?

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.098
Was there anybody with
their eyes closed?

00:27:27.098 --> 00:27:28.530
Anybody I need to know about?

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.160
Anybody laying on the floor?

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:31.870
No, we're good?

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:32.980
All right, perfect.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.800
Now this is for the volunteers.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.940
You'll listen to each
and every word I say.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.231
Every word I say becomes truth.

00:27:36.231 --> 00:27:37.520
And truth becomes reality.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.470
I'm just going to
rearrange you real quick.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.870
On the kind of three,
your eyes will be open.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.411
You'll be fully
alert and wide awake.

00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:43.590
One, two, and three.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.720
Welcome back everybody.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.710
Would you mind just coming and
taking a seat in there for me?

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:47.920
That would be perfect.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.920
And can you just come on
the end, come this way.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.280
And I'm just going to have
you come and sit right here.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.000
Perfect.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.230
You guys know how to relax.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.730
I just want you to look
at hands real fast.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:57.180
Look at the hands.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.640
Look at the hand.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.380
Look at the hand.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.500
Look up at the hand.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.200
And sleep.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.920
Just relax.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.650
Every muscle tissue, every
fiber in your body just

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.906
relaxing all the way, relaxing.

00:28:08.906 --> 00:28:10.530
Now just for the
hypnotized volunteers,

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.680
you'll listen to each
and every word I say.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.250
Every word I say
will become truth.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.320
Just relax my friend and
truth will become reality.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.620
You will literally listen
to every word I say,

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.240
and you'll feel
good about yourself.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.000
Just relax.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.480
Now in a few
seconds but not yet,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.880
I want you to realize
something profound

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.963
and unique about yourself.

00:28:24.963 --> 00:28:26.504
In a few seconds
but not yet, I want

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:27.670
you to understand something.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.437
You're all small
goldfish getting

00:28:29.437 --> 00:28:31.770
ready to swim around in a
beautiful small goldfish bowl.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.680
Now you can use your
hands, legs, face, and feet

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.040
to take a swim around the bowl.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.760
I want you to realize the more
you swim, the better you feel.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.300
And the better you
feel, the more you swim.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.810
Now in a few moments but not
yet, your eyes will be closed.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:42.800
You'll be sitting
upright in your chair

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.000
and you'll be swimming on three.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.458
In a few seconds you'll be a
small goldfish swimming around

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:47.634
in a small goldfish bowl.

00:28:47.634 --> 00:28:49.550
And you'll be feeling
wonderful about yourself

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.424
with your eyes closed,
getting ready to swim.

00:28:51.424 --> 00:28:53.766
On the count of three, using
your arms, using your legs,

00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:56.266
using your face and feet to
take a wonderful swim, on three.

00:28:56.266 --> 00:28:58.144
One, two, three.

00:28:58.144 --> 00:28:58.810
You're swimming.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:59.435
Use your hands.

00:28:59.435 --> 00:29:00.019
Use your face.

00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:00.685
Close your eyes.

00:29:00.685 --> 00:29:01.190
Swim, swim.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.500
And the more you swim,
the better you feel.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.060
Swim, swim.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.300
Use your hands,
legs, face, and feet.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.070
Keep swimming, swimming
in the goldfish bowl.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.520
The more you swim,
the better you feel.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.600
And the better you
feel, the more you swim.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.780
Keep swimming in
the goldfish bowl.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.642
Swim, swim, swim, swim
in the goldfish bowl.

00:29:11.642 --> 00:29:12.350
Just take a swim.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.020
Freeze.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.270
Hang on.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.070
There's a shark in the bowl.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.825
Freeze.

00:29:14.825 --> 00:29:16.484
There's a shark in the bowl.

00:29:16.484 --> 00:29:17.150
There's a shark.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:17.840
It's looking right at you.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.770
Make yourself look smaller.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:19.270
Shrink.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:19.920
Shrink down.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.636
There's a shark.

00:29:20.636 --> 00:29:21.135
Shrink.

00:29:21.135 --> 00:29:21.634
Shrink.

00:29:21.634 --> 00:29:22.230
It's gone.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.580
Swimming.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.740
Use your hands,
legs, face, and feet.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.410
Swimming, swimming,
swimming, swimming happily

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:25.890
in the goldfish bowl.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.460
And the more you swim,
the better you feel.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.990
And the better you
feel, the more you swim.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.630
Now if anything touches
you on the top of the head,

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.439
it's goldfish food.

00:29:31.439 --> 00:29:32.480
You want to eat the food.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.770
If anything does touch you on
the top of the head, it's food.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.510
You're going to want
to eat the food.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:36.240
Right there, eat the food.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.160
Go ahead and get that food.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.650
That's lovely.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.480
Go ahead and eat that food.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.220
Eat the food.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.810
Right there, that's it.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:40.890
The more you eat,
the better you feel.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.450
Eat the food right
in the goldfish bowl.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:42.810
That's good.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:43.850
Eat that food right there.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:45.090
The more you eat the
food, the better you feel.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:45.760
Get that food.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.210
Eat the food.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:46.660
Eat the food.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.010
Eat the food.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:47.070
Eat the food.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.340
Eat the food.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:47.400
Eat the food.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:47.670
Eat the food.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.070
Eat the food.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.320
Eat the food.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:48.380
Eat the food.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:48.660
Eat the food.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:48.720
Eat the food.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.010
Eat the food.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.300
Eat the food.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:49.910
That's right.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:50.200
Eat the food.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:50.520
Eat the food.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:50.890
Eat the food.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:51.500
Eat the food.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.041
Eat the food.

00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:52.590
And sleep.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.760
Just relax and sleep.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.930
Every muscle tissue
in your fiber

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.994
just relaxing itself and
drifting further and deeper.

00:29:59.994 --> 00:30:02.720
And the deeper you go,
the better you feel.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.210
Now for the
hypnotized volunteers,

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.816
I want to understand something
very profound and very unique.

00:30:06.816 --> 00:30:08.440
In a few seconds, I
want you to realize

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.550
you're all at the beach.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.110
We're getting ready to
have a thoroughly good time

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.560
at the beach, and I
want you to understand,

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.210
you're going to have a lovely
ice cream, a Mister Softee, Mr.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.305
Whippy, Mr. McFluffy.

00:30:16.305 --> 00:30:18.430
Now you'll get that ice
cream in a second on three,

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.013
and you'll lick that
ice cream as fast

00:30:20.013 --> 00:30:21.280
as you can before it melts.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.650
It is actually about
95 degrees outside.

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.050
It is roasting hot.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.480
I'll be giving you
that ice cream.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.960
You'll sit upright
with your eyes closed,

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.550
and you'll lick the
ice cream as fast

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.890
as you can before it melts.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.290
One, two, three.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.040
Get the ice cream.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.777
[REPEATS "LICK IT"]

00:30:36.777 --> 00:30:37.360
Its dribbling.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:37.955
Lick it.

00:30:37.955 --> 00:30:38.580
It's dribbling.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.640
It's on your wrist.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.290
Lick it.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:40.910
It's on your wrist.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:41.240
Lick it.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:41.960
It's on your wrist.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.360
Lick it.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.550
It's dripping all the
way on your wrist.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:43.880
Lick it.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.650
It's on your elbow.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:45.140
Suck your elbow.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:45.720
Lick it.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.580
It's on your elbow.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:46.950
Lick it.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:47.640
It's on your knees.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.170
It's dribbling on your knees,
on your knees, on your knees,

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:49.540
on your knee.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:49.920
Lick it.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.420
It's on your knee.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:50.921
Lick it.

00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:51.670
It's on your knee.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.190
And sleep.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.200
Just relax and sleep.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.360
Just relax and sleep.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.165
And the deeper you go,
the better you feel.

00:30:58.165 --> 00:31:00.690
You ready to have some fun guys?

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.280
You guys ready?

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.450
In a state of stunned
silence, I love it.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:05.230
All right, good.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.320
You guys can make noise.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:06.820
It's fine.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.890
They're concentrated.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:08.890
They're good.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.520
All right, who's a colleague
of this young man here?

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.330
Anybody?

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.360
Nobody?

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.860
All right, now this is just for
the person I'm touching now.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.250
I want you to understand
from this point forward,

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.350
I want you to realize
your new name is EIEIO.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.590
Always was and always will
be and always should be.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.690
Nod your head if you understand.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.150
In fact, if ever I ask you a
name from this point forward,

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.757
your name was and
always will be EIEIO.

00:31:30.757 --> 00:31:32.090
Nod your head if you understand.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.965
Good, feeling good
about yourself.

00:31:34.965 --> 00:31:35.465
Excellent.

00:31:35.465 --> 00:31:36.960
Now just for the person
I'm touching now,

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.876
I want you to realize
you are really and truly

00:31:38.876 --> 00:31:40.040
the original Tinkerbell.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.206
Now in a second I want you
to understand if you ever

00:31:42.206 --> 00:31:43.940
hear me say the
word hypnosis, just

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.710
for the person I'm touching
now, if you do actually ever

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:47.252
hear me say the word
hypnosis, you're

00:31:47.252 --> 00:31:49.710
going to realize that wings
are sprouting out of your back,

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.850
in your back ready to fly.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.641
You might take a hop,
might take a flutter,

00:31:52.641 --> 00:31:55.457
but you might just fly with
those wings on your back there.

00:31:55.457 --> 00:31:56.790
Nod your head if you understand.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:57.760
Good.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.710
You'll realize if ever
I say the word hypnosis.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.460
Now just for the person
I'm touching now--

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.765
or you're good man, I got you.

00:32:03.765 --> 00:32:04.390
You just relax.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.219
There you go.

00:32:05.219 --> 00:32:06.760
Just for the person
I'm touching now,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.740
I want you to realize if you
do ever hear me say my name,

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.200
Richard Barker, I want you
to realize and understand

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.907
you're completely and
utterly in love with me.

00:32:13.907 --> 00:32:15.740
If you do actually ever
hear me say my name,

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.740
Richard Barker,
you'll immediately

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.282
stand up and shout as loud as
you can, I love Richard Barker.

00:32:19.282 --> 00:32:21.531
As soon as you do so, you've
forgotten you've done it.

00:32:21.531 --> 00:32:23.000
Nod your head if you understand.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.458
If you do actually ever hear
me say my name Richard Barker,

00:32:25.458 --> 00:32:28.050
you'll immediately stand up and
shout, I love Richard Barker.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.710
Nod your head if you understand.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:30.553
Good.

00:32:30.553 --> 00:32:32.300
Now just for the person
I'm touching now,

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.240
I want you to realize something
profound about yourself.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.739
You're going to realize your
name has completely and utterly

00:32:36.739 --> 00:32:37.380
vanished.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.180
I want you to understand the
more you try and remember

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.504
your name, the more it's gone.

00:32:40.504 --> 00:32:42.170
The more you try and
remember your name,

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.450
the more your name
has disappeared.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.320
I'll be asking you your name.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.321
It's completely vanished
from your memory banks.

00:32:46.321 --> 00:32:47.653
Nod your head if you understand.

00:32:47.653 --> 00:32:50.370
The more you try and remember
your name, the more it fails.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.819
You can't remember it at all.

00:32:51.819 --> 00:32:53.110
I'll give you a top tip though.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.739
If you do actually sing
happy birthday to yourself,

00:32:55.739 --> 00:32:57.030
your name just might come back.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.363
Nod your head if you understand.

00:32:58.363 --> 00:32:58.940
Good.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.920
So I'm just going
to rearrange them

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.330
real fast ladies and
gentlemen, just find out

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.540
who we've got up on here.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.130
On three, one , two, and three.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.130
Eyes open, welcome back.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.530
Good to see each and
every one of you.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.610
What did you say your
name was my friend?

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.410
AUDIENCE: EIEIO.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:09.080

AUDIENCE: Akshay.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:11.615

00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:12.115
Sorry?

00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:12.860
AUDIENCE: Akshay.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.310

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.970
Oh, that's lovely.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.460
Nice to see you.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.450
Welcome to the hypnosis show.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.380
It's good to see each
every one of you.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:16.870
That's perfect.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:17.330
And what was your name?

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.230
Cappy.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.050
AUDIENCE: Cappy.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.310
RICHARD BARKER: Cappy.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.810
I got you.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:21.460
I'm Richard Barker.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.480
Nice to see your sweetheart.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:22.980
AUDIENCE: Nice to see you.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.780
I love Richard Barker.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.738
RICHARD BARKER: Oh, OK.

00:33:24.738 --> 00:33:25.451
That's fine.

00:33:25.451 --> 00:33:25.950
Thanks.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:26.910
You can let go now.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:27.981
Yeah, that's take.

00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:28.480
Take a seat.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.360
What was your name again?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.890
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.726
I don't know.

00:33:35.726 --> 00:33:38.390
RICHARD BARKER: Just your
name is what I'm after.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.340
AUDIENCE: I don't
know what my name is.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.520
I don't know what it is.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.730
RICHARD BARKER: All right,
I'll come back to you.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:43.693
What was your name bro?

00:33:43.693 --> 00:33:44.086
AUDIENCE: EIEIO.

00:33:44.086 --> 00:33:44.710
RICHARD BARKER:
Oh, come up here.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.630
Just stand up here a second.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.450
Why don't you come over there.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:47.580
I want you to think
hard about that,

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.329
because you had one
when you came in here,

00:33:49.329 --> 00:33:51.219
just to let you know.

00:33:51.219 --> 00:33:53.760
When I say check it downstairs,
I don't know if they do that.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.650
But come this was man.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:56.340
Oh, you're tall.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.897
Is that your first name?

00:33:57.897 --> 00:33:58.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.330
RICHARD BARKER: So EIEIO
is your first name.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.080
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.735
RICHARD BARKER:
What's your last name?

00:34:02.735 --> 00:34:03.401
AUDIENCE: Gupta.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.639
RICHARD BARKER: Do you
have a middle name?

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:09.420
AUDIENCE: I don't.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.702
RICHARD BARKER: So
it's EIEIO Gupta.

00:34:10.702 --> 00:34:11.168
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:11.168 --> 00:34:13.126
RICHARD BARKER: Can you
spell that for me dude?

00:34:13.126 --> 00:34:17.717
AUDIENCE: E-I-E-I, and
then O, and then G.

00:34:17.717 --> 00:34:19.050
RICHARD BARKER: All right, good.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.495
Give him a round of applause.

00:34:20.495 --> 00:34:21.120
He was awesome.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.036
Take a seat there man.

00:34:22.036 --> 00:34:23.394
I've got you.

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:24.949
I'm Richard Barker by the way.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:25.949
Sorry, nice to meet you.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:26.883
Yeah, it's cool.

00:34:26.883 --> 00:34:30.345
AUDIENCE: I love Richard Barker.

00:34:30.345 --> 00:34:32.345
RICHARD BARKER: It's a
friendly place, isn't it?

00:34:32.345 --> 00:34:33.320
Just go ahead, take a seat.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:33.945
That's awesome.

00:34:33.945 --> 00:34:36.200
Could we get your name again?

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.661
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:34:37.661 --> 00:34:40.072
I don't know it.

00:34:40.072 --> 00:34:42.530
RICHARD BARKER: Do me a favor,
just stand up a second would

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.030
you?

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.375
Could you stand up
for me a second?

00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:48.620
Does anybody know this
young lady in the room?

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.320
You do?

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.320
What's her name brother?

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.556
AUDIENCE: Charity.

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:52.835
RICHARD BARKER: Charity?

00:34:52.835 --> 00:34:53.560
Guess what?

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.989
Your name's Charity.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:55.850
It's gone.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.230
Oh actually-- oh stand up.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.020
I got you.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.490
So Charity, your
name is Charity.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.575
But think about it,
and it's disappeared

00:35:00.575 --> 00:35:01.490
out your memory banks.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.448
What's your name again?

00:35:07.912 --> 00:35:12.861
It's for $100, if you
can give me your name.

00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:14.486
AUDIENCE: I don't
know what my name is.

00:35:14.486 --> 00:35:17.020
RICHARD BARKER: I will
give you-- it's Charity.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.100
That's a top tip.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.910
I'll give you $200 if you can
give me your name, Charity,

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.820
which of course it's vanished.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.768
What is that?

00:35:25.768 --> 00:35:27.755
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:35:27.755 --> 00:35:30.130
RICHARD BARKER: Try singing
"Happy Birthday" to yourself,

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.984
see what happens.

00:35:31.984 --> 00:35:33.310
Sing out loud.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.375
AUDIENCE: I don't
want to sing out loud.

00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:36.250
RICHARD BARKER: What?

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.470
AUDIENCE: I don't
want to sing out loud.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.392
RICHARD BARKER: OK, just
sing it to yourself.

00:35:40.392 --> 00:35:41.975
Let me know when
your name comes back.

00:35:44.633 --> 00:35:45.500
AUDIENCE: Charity.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.406
RICHARD BARKER: It's Charity?

00:35:46.406 --> 00:35:47.031
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:47.031 --> 00:35:49.832
RICHARD BARKER: Give a round
of applause, it's Charity.

00:35:49.832 --> 00:35:51.050
That's awesome.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.760
Charity, that's fantastic.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.717
You know what?

00:35:53.717 --> 00:35:54.300
You know what?

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.210
It's gone.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:56.310
Whoa, I got you.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.470
Sorry, what was it, your name?

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:00.770
Oh never mind, take a seat.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.060
That's good.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.935
Give a round of applause
ladies and gentlemen

00:36:02.935 --> 00:36:05.944
would you to the
stars of the show.

00:36:05.944 --> 00:36:07.610
Now one thing interesting
about hypnosis

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.140
is you can actually create
a memory that lasts forever,

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.200
or remove a memory,
i.e. your name

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.130
or a number or
something like that.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:16.720
So what this is
really useful for is

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.519
that if you have something
in your background

00:36:19.519 --> 00:36:21.560
or in your DNA that was
an unpleasant experience,

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.720
like some kind of trauma
perhaps or a situation

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.044
that you really would like
to forget-- of course as we

00:36:27.044 --> 00:36:28.710
mentioned, it's in
the subconscious mind

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.470
and will stay there
forever because it's almost

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:31.594
like a computer hard drive.

00:36:31.594 --> 00:36:32.850
You can't scrub it.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.170
But through hypnosis,
I can scrub the scene.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.350
I can create the
effect of the scene

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.490
actually being altered or
being removed completely,

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.407
like a name just like that.

00:36:43.407 --> 00:36:45.240
Now the more you try
and remember that name,

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.080
the more it disappears.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.780
But I will give it back to
you at the end of the day.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.010
What did you say
your name was again?

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.770
AUDIENCE: EIEIO.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:50.728
RICHARD BARKER: OK man.

00:36:50.728 --> 00:36:52.459
I could make that
last indefinitely.

00:36:52.459 --> 00:36:54.750
But can you imagine being
stopped by the police outside

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.574
and your name's become EIEIO.

00:36:57.574 --> 00:36:59.740
All right, just listen to
each and every word I say.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.360
On the count of three, sleep.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.040
Just relax.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.310
Every muscle tissue,
every fiber in your body

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:05.990
just relaxes and Rests.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.950
And the deeper you go,
the better you feel.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.550
And the better you
feel, the deeper you go.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:10.805
Now just for the
hypnotized volunteers,

00:37:10.805 --> 00:37:13.430
I want you to understand
something very unique and very

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.180
interesting about yourselves.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.280
In a second but not yet,
I want you to understand

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.270
you're all exotic animals.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.150
And by exotic animal, I don't
mean pig, sheep, cat, goat.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.830
I don't ordinarily
mean something

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:26.000
you find at home or on a farm.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.830
Now by exotic animal,
I mean something

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.820
you might find on
safari or in the zoo,

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.170
something you might find
on the Discovery Channel

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.076
or a place far, far, far away.

00:37:34.076 --> 00:37:35.450
Now in a few
moments but not yet,

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.120
you'll embed in your
subconscious mind

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.394
the animal of your choice.

00:37:38.394 --> 00:37:40.310
You'll do all the actions,
do all the motions,

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.185
do all the movements.

00:37:41.185 --> 00:37:44.110
You will truly become the
animal of your choice.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.151
Now in a few seconds
but not, you'll hop.

00:37:46.151 --> 00:37:46.650
You'll fly.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.170
You'll crawl.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:47.795
You'll slither.

00:37:47.795 --> 00:37:49.821
You'll do whatever it is
that your animal does.

00:37:49.821 --> 00:37:52.070
You'll leave your seat and
have a prowl, have a crawl,

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.300
have a fly, or have a hop.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.640
Now embed into your
subconscious mind

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.352
the exotic animal
you've just become.

00:37:57.352 --> 00:37:59.060
And in a few seconds
your eyes will open.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.320
You'll adopt the position,
the stance, the posture

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.190
of that exotic animal.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.090

something very interesting.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.990
I want you to understand
that the favorite food

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.906
of your choice is embedded
in the hair of some

look out into the audience,

00:39:21.883 --> 00:39:24.550
you'll find your favorite
food embedded in their hair.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.270
And if you come across something
that doesn't have any hair,

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.180
you'll have a natural
impulse and a desire

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.740
to kiss them repeatedly
on the top of the head.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.290

you'll immediately

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.500
Take a prowl.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:49.900
Take a hop.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.483
Take a flurry.

00:39:50.483 --> 00:39:51.260
Take a crawl.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.520
Go and get as much food
as you possibly can.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.810
Go ahead and get that
food right there.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.410
The more you eat,
the better you feel.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.340
The better you
feel, that's good.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.534
The more you eat-- the more you
eat, the better you feel free.

00:40:00.534 --> 00:40:01.420
Freeze.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.060
Just freeze.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.450
In a second but not
yet, when I reach three,

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.491
you're no longer animals.

00:40:04.491 --> 00:40:05.408
You're back to normal.

00:40:05.408 --> 00:40:07.907
You fully know where you are
and everything's returned back.

00:40:07.907 --> 00:40:09.430
Every faculty comes
back to normal.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.888
You will in fact though wonder
what on earth you are doing.

00:40:11.888 --> 00:40:13.178
One, two, and three.

00:40:13.178 --> 00:40:14.290
Holly moly.

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:15.940
Charity, what are you doing?

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.140
Come back over here
and just take a seat.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.515
Give them a big round of
applause ladies and gentlemen

00:40:18.515 --> 00:40:18.940
real quick.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:19.800
Come over here real fast.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.270
Take a seat.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.770
Take a seat.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.330
Real quick, take a seat.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:22.929
Take a seat.

00:40:22.929 --> 00:40:24.970
All right, just take a
seat right here my friend.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:25.620
Take a seat.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.680
That's, guys, that's lovely food
you had right there by the way.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.180
It's great.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.263
Take a seat-- there you
go-- wherever you want to.

00:40:31.263 --> 00:40:33.180
Take a seat wherever
you want to.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:33.770
Take a seat.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:34.936
Look at the hand real quick.

00:40:34.936 --> 00:40:35.580
And sleep.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.072
Just relax every muscle tissue,
every fiber in your body.

00:40:38.072 --> 00:40:40.030
Now I'm going to bring
you from one up to five.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.446
When I do bring
up one up to five,

00:40:41.446 --> 00:40:44.310
I want you to understand that
one hour of hypnosis or less

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.600
felt like four to six hours
of uninterrupted sleep.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.519
In fact, when your eyes
open and you go back

00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:50.060
to work or go back
into the audience,

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.601
you'll feel wonderful
about yourself.

00:40:51.601 --> 00:40:54.520
In fact, you'll feel better
than you've ever felt before.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.420
You'll feel vibrant,
alert, and alive.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.485
And all the applause
will in fact be for you.

00:40:58.485 --> 00:41:00.610
One, feeling refresh,
feeling alert, feeling alive.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.190
Two, feeling like you bathed
your eyes in a cool mountain

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.510
spring.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:04.250
Three, feeling the energy
rushing into your veins.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.333
Four, feeling better than
you've ever felt before.

00:41:06.333 --> 00:41:08.610
And in a second but not
yet on five, eyes open.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:09.111
Big stretch.

00:41:09.111 --> 00:41:10.693
And give them a big
round of applause.

00:41:10.693 --> 00:41:12.896
Ladies and gentlemen, five,
eyes open, fully alert.

00:41:12.896 --> 00:41:13.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.185
You guys are great.

00:41:15.185 --> 00:41:16.010
All right.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:17.612
What was your name again?

00:41:17.612 --> 00:41:18.820
AUDIENCE: Charity.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:19.560
RICHARD BARKER: Charity, good.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.060
Excellent.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.268
What was your name my friend?

00:41:21.268 --> 00:41:23.590
AUDIENCE: EIEIO.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.430
RICHARD BARKER: OK,
we'll fix that later on.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:29.030
Sort of changes all the
passwords there doesn't it?

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.300
Username, EIEIO.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.050
All right, you guys
can make your way back

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:32.390
into the audience.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.160
Give them one more round of
applause ladies and gentlemen,

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.120
the stars of the show.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.160
These guys were awesome.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.920
Awesome, awesome.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.910
Now just before I go
ladies and gentlemen,

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:43.050
we have reserved about
10 minutes for questions.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.190
There are microphones
either side of the room.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.920
If you do have a question about
hypnosis or what you just saw,

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.900
please do feel free to get ready
and get behind the microphones

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.110
and ask me any questions
you want about hypnosis,

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.960
self-hypnosis, and
actually how it

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.000
can improve you both
personally and professionally.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.250
I mean, hypnosis has been
around for a very long time.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.350
And I'll tell you, if you
learn how to self-hypnotize,

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.810
you will absolutely feel
better about yourself.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.114
If anybody actually
struggles with insomnia,

00:42:09.114 --> 00:42:10.780
can't get a good
night's sleep, hypnosis

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.337
is the best remedy for that too.

00:42:12.337 --> 00:42:14.670
So if you do have any questions,
I'll be hanging around.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:15.961
I'm quite willing to take some.

00:42:15.961 --> 00:42:17.520
There are microphones
on either side.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.710
All you have to do is
put the question there

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.300
into the microphone
and I'll answer it

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.210
fully and frankly
for you guys as you

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.140
get prepared to ask a question.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.240
So we'll fire away.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.442
Yes ma'am?

00:42:27.442 --> 00:42:30.070
AUDIENCE: So what's an easy
way to do this for yourself?

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.320
RICHARD BARKER: Good question.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.712
So for self-hypnosis-- so one
of the best ways I've found

00:42:34.712 --> 00:42:36.170
is you know sometimes
that you feel

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:39.930
that anxiety level creeping
in, and things like that?

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.630
And what tends to
happen with anxiety

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.010
is what the mind believes,
the expectancy of the anxiety,

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:46.310
it actually creates it.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:47.330
So it fulfills it.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.840
The best way to
actually self-hypnotise

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.157
is take three breaths in.

00:42:52.157 --> 00:42:53.740
First of all, focus
on a fixed object.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.780
Could be a flickering flame.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.696
Could be a television.

00:42:55.696 --> 00:42:58.970
Could be something you
have at home, eye fixation.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:59.960
Take three breaths in.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.090
Just close your
eyes, which simulates

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.770
slowing down your heartbeat,
and just think of nothing.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:07.404
Just don't think of anything.

00:43:07.404 --> 00:43:08.320
Just think of nothing.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.590
Just think of sleep
and relaxation.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.330
And then what I like to do
is have embedded suggestions.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.110
I'll have suggestions
that I give myself

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.470
which commonly are known
as the affirmations

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.750
or the embedded suggestions
I'll give myself.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:22.420
And all I'll simply do is take
three breaths, close my eyes

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.160
and relax.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.650
Open my eyes, read
an affirmation

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.744
or a positive suggestion,
close my eyes.

00:43:27.744 --> 00:43:28.660
Take three breaths in.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.493
I normally do that in
the morning because it

00:43:30.493 --> 00:43:32.840
sets my day up correctly.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.530
But basically just
closing your eyes,

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.330
taking three breaths in and
slowing down your heartbeat.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.002
Sounds good?

00:43:38.002 --> 00:43:39.455
Are you going to give it a try?

00:43:39.455 --> 00:43:39.950
AUDIENCE: I will.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:40.430
RICHARD BARKER: Excellent.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.180
Thank you.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.330
AUDIENCE: Why is there
a dragon on your jacket?

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:43.705
RICHARD BARKER: I'm sorry?

00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:45.190
AUDIENCE: Why is there
a dragon on your jacket?

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:47.064
RICHARD BARKER: Why is
there a dragon on my--

00:43:47.064 --> 00:43:48.740
because it has hypnotic powers.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.480
It didn't do it today,
but sometimes it

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.760
jumps off and actually zaps.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.170
No, I just like a
dragon on the jacket.

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:58.150
I just like dragons on jackets.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:01.267
AUDIENCE: Can hypnosis
help with relationships?

00:44:01.267 --> 00:44:02.600
RICHARD BARKER: Absolutely, yes.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.130
Hypnosis can help
with relationships.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.252
And the thing is,
most of what we do

00:44:08.252 --> 00:44:09.960
and how we do it as
humans, whether we're

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.550
interacting with family or the
person that is in our life,

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.660
whether it's marriage or
dating, whatever you think about

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.420
actually translates
into reality.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.550
So whatever your
thought processes are,

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.000
your thought process translates
into an action, typically.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.800
So what if you could change
that thought process around?

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.230
And for relationships
in particular,

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.427
it's about having that
change of thought process.

00:44:32.427 --> 00:44:33.260
So how do you do it?

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.020
It's a little bit like
the answer to the question

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:35.520
beforehand.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.180
You write it down,
first and foremost.

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.420
And then you give yourself
a sense of relaxation,

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.730
which you can do as a couple.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.360
And then you give
yourself the affirmation

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.560
of the embedded command.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.620
So absolutely works
for relationships.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.820
I do actually get
a lot of couples

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:52.760
come to see me for sex and
health and relationship

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.060
building as well.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.360
So I thank you.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.930
AUDIENCE: So you indicated that
the success rate was about 80%

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.240
when you had people come up.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.567
Today, here it was about 44%.

00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:03.650
Why do you think that was?

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.390
RICHARD BARKER: Here, you've got
different levels of hypnosis.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:10.330
You've got somnambulistic,
right there.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:13.520
And you've got different
mild levels of hypnosis.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.100
So I reckon there in about
a room of maybe nine, yeah,

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.622
probably about 50%.

00:45:17.622 --> 00:45:20.080
But then I can do this again
tomorrow and it would be 100%.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.496
I could do it again
the day after.

00:45:21.496 --> 00:45:24.594
But overall, overarching,
it's roughly about 80%.

00:45:24.594 --> 00:45:26.010
So when I work on
a cruise ship, I

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.480
know I'm going to
lose at least 20%.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.550
AUDIENCE: So if it was
just normal variation.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.375
It wasn't something about
the people or the atmosphere

00:45:32.375 --> 00:45:32.810
you think?

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.185
RICHARD BARKER:
You know, I would

00:45:34.185 --> 00:45:37.530
say it's a tough environment
to relax in front of all

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.340
your colleagues and your peers.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.210
And what I find is
it's a higher rate

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.030
when you're on a cruise ship
and you don't know anybody else,

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:49.202
because you've got no fear of
letting yourself totally go.

00:45:49.202 --> 00:45:50.660
But this room is
a little bit tough

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.470
because obviously you
work with each other

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.780
and you don't want
to be seen to be

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.560
letting yourself go too much.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.610
So that's about normal.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.430
Yeah, that's about right.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.930
Hi.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:01.710
MALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:02.530
First, thank you.

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:03.120
It was great.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:03.800
RICHARD BARKER: Thank you.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.466
AUDIENCE: I have maybe
a funny question.

00:46:05.466 --> 00:46:07.990
Can you use hypnosis to
persuade your colleagues

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.976
to do what you want?

00:46:10.976 --> 00:46:12.100
RICHARD BARKER: Absolutely.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.870
Some of the best persuaders
and influencers are hypnotists.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.662
Now I have a saying,
each day in every way,

00:46:17.662 --> 00:46:19.078
I'm in the business
of persuasion.

00:46:19.078 --> 00:46:21.220
And each day in every way
I'm getting better at it.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.470
Now this is not something new.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:26.249
When you were children and
you wanted to get something,

00:46:26.249 --> 00:46:27.040
you did two things.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.780
You either influenced,
manipulated,

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.040
or persuaded your
parents to have

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.650
what it is that you wanted,
or you threw a tantrum

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:37.500
and created a scene to
get what you wanted.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.120
So it's nothing different
to what we do in adult life.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.680
But if you anchor
some statements,

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.840
we have things called
arcing statements

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.770
and undeniable truths.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.740
For example, an
undeniable truth would

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.504
be it's a beautiful
day outside isn't it?

00:46:50.504 --> 00:46:51.920
You get somebody
in the yes state.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.930
And the more you get them
in the yes state, when

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.090
you ask for the bigger
commitment, the more chance

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:57.770
you have for them to say yes.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:00.080
So if I want to sell
something to somebody else--

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:04.130
and I have a book on selling
with hypnosis-- that I know

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.930
I have to get them into
an agreeable state.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.420
So you can do that
in your workplace.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.210
The way you would do it was,
it's a wonderful day outside,

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:12.267
isn't it?

00:47:12.267 --> 00:47:14.600
And you would, agree wouldn't
you, that the sky is blue,

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.180
isn't it?

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.310
Well yeah.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.190
It's just like the infomercials.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:20.830
By now, you'll
realize the benefits

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:22.160
of my products and services.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.660
And by now, you'll
pick up the phone

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.050
and dial 1-800-SIRMIXALOT,
because you

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.380
need to buy the Shamwow
or whatever it might be,

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.510
because by now you can see the
benefits in your life of it.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:35.540
So of course the embedded
command is buy now,

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:39.140
and you're pointing right
there at the buy now button.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:43.090
So yes, it can be used for
influencing and persuading

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.680
colleagues, absolutely.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.375
I think we're this side.

00:47:46.375 --> 00:47:47.750
AUDIENCE: Have
you ever used this

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.380
to influence and persuade
colleagues or something

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.580
outside of shows?

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.030
RICHARD BARKER: Yes.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:58.966
I get asked if I use
this in my dating life.

00:47:58.966 --> 00:48:00.840
And I demonstrated this
once in a restaurant.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.590
I went on a date,
very fancy restaurant.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.730
I didn't want to spring
for the high end food.

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:09.280
So I diverted the person's eye
to mac and cheese and a Diet

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:09.780
Coke.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.710
And then I proceeded
to have a red wine.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:12.360
I had a steak.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.725
And I had a wonderful time.

00:48:13.725 --> 00:48:15.600
And all the servers just
couldn't believe it.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.250
So you can use it for
all kinds of benefit.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:19.270
I use this in emails.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.930
I use it on the phone.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:22.562
I use it in dating.

00:48:22.562 --> 00:48:24.770
I'm just in the habit of
using it all the time, yeah,

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:25.820
absolutely.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.730
Once it becomes habit and
it becomes normal to you,

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.355
and like I said, my motto is I'm
in the business of persuasion.

00:48:31.355 --> 00:48:33.313
Each day in every way
I'm getting better at it.

00:48:33.313 --> 00:48:34.680
I'll test it on police officers.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.740
I'll test it on
different circumstances.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.007
And I always win.

00:48:38.007 --> 00:48:40.090
Typically I always get the
result I'm looking for.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.830
So thank you.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.050
Good question.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:44.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.480
Do you think it would be
possible to build technology

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.720
to either assist or
even fully automate

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.056
the process of
hypnotizing someone?

00:48:52.056 --> 00:48:52.930
RICHARD BARKER: I do.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:53.670
I do.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:57.840
We are using video streaming
and online platforms right now.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.820
Some of my clients are in
California and I'm in Orlando.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:07.400
And I'm using systems
and platforms right now

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.522
for that process.

00:49:08.522 --> 00:49:10.980
One of the things I saw the
other day which was interesting

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.650
was a texting system
that navigates you

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.640
into the yes state.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.160
Like a robotic you
say this, I say that.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.250
If you say this, I say that
flowchart, an algorithm.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:24.900
And getting somebody
into an agreeable state--

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.510
because the more somebody nods
their head, the more they're

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.220
going to comply, the
less resistant they are.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:34.400
You're in the business of
implanting a suggestion.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.760
You have more chance
of it to be successful.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.400
I think it is going to get
somewhat automated or somehow

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.050
guided.

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:44.130
Like even if it's a talking
head graphic-- because you heard

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.560
some of my language
I used, a lot of it

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.240
was in the pattern of threes.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.150
I set up the ready, set, go.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:51.220
You can automate that.

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.140
In a few moments but not
yet, when I use that,

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.900
I'm actually setting up
anticipation and expectation,

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.470
because I know the mind
will follow through if it's

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.387
expecting to follow through.

00:50:01.387 --> 00:50:02.970
So to answer your
question, I do think

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:04.210
that this can be automated.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:08.120
Some clever programming
can get this automated.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.025
Yes?

00:50:09.025 --> 00:50:10.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:13.010
I noticed throughout
the program that you

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.070
were speaking
virtually constantly,

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.180
using very few gaps.

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.180
Are you doing that to drown
out the internal voice,

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.590
or is that just your style?

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:22.423
RICHARD BARKER: Yes.

00:50:22.423 --> 00:50:24.410
It's a little bit of
a pattern interrupt.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:28.560
So I'm keeping them at
the level of my pattern

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.420
and interrupting their
normal thought process.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.690
So I'm not giving him
a chance to think.

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:35.830
So the more I keep
talking, the mind

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:37.340
has to focus on that voice.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.260
And therefore it can't think to
itself, what time is this over?

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.916
What time do I need to
get back into the office?

00:50:42.916 --> 00:50:45.160
It just has to be following.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.370
So it is a hypnotic language,
yes, the hypnotic nonstop,

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:51.110
verbalizing suggestions
and commands to give people

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:52.820
less chance of being resistant.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:59.040
AUDIENCE: How did you spot which
participants were ready to be

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.520
hypnotized or were hypnotised
versus the ones that weren't?

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.470
RICHARD BARKER: When they
actually first came out--

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:04.470
AUDIENCE: When you asked
them to leave the stage.

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:05.656
Like how did you know?

00:51:05.656 --> 00:51:08.120
RICHARD BARKER: You know,
it's a good question.

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.170
It just goes with gut,
to be honest with you.

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:10.820
I'm looking.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.540
I'm looking at those that
are looking somewhere

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.120
around the room or
looking elsewhere.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.600
I'm looking at those that
I believe are relaxed.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.810
There's no direct science.

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.890
But when I touch somebody,
I can feel catalepsy.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:23.850
I can feel arms loose and
limp or arms stiff and rigid.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.450
Especially when
you touch the hand,

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:27.959
I can feel those resistant
and those less resistant.

00:51:27.959 --> 00:51:30.000
And you can just tell,
when you look at somebody,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.760
you just get that
sense, especially

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.010
if you've been doing this for a
while, that not here, not now.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:39.030
Doesn't mean not ever, just
maybe not here, not now.

00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:46.310
OK, we need to wrap up.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.705
So I'll take the one more,
if they're really quick,

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:49.830
or just one more real fast.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:52.507
And then we'll need
to close this off.

00:51:52.507 --> 00:51:54.840
AUDIENCE: For the category
of the people who did not get

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.298
hypnotised, does
it mean this thing

00:51:56.298 --> 00:51:58.152
doesn't help them any at all?

00:51:58.152 --> 00:52:01.620
RICHARD BARKER: They still
got a level of relaxation.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.520
But the question was-- can
you just repeat that please?

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.020
AUDIENCE: For the
category of people

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.890
who don't get hypnotized,
that 20% category

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:10.680
that you referring
to, does that mean you

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.140
or your activities
doesn't help them?

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.140
RICHARD BARKER: You
can come back tomorrow

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.880
and be hypnotized if you
don't get hypnotized today.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.840
You can self-practice
hypnosis as well.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.800
It never means never.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.630
I've had people that just
could not be hypnotized,

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:26.671
like five times in a row,
and all of a sudden one

00:52:26.671 --> 00:52:28.000
particular time they dropped.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.416
It has something to do with
what you did when you woke up,

00:52:30.416 --> 00:52:34.330
what you ate for lunch, what
you're thinking and feeling.

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:36.480
But all these guys will
get a sense of relaxation

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.562
just for being up here.

00:52:37.562 --> 00:52:39.520
And actually if I were
to hypnotise them again,

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.300
like some of the
stronger ones, they

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:44.030
would fall into hypnosis
much faster and much quicker

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.329
the second time around.

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:47.120
Some of my clients they
walk into my office

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.687
and I just say sleep
and they're out,

00:52:49.687 --> 00:52:51.520
and then I work on them
because they already

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.160
adjusted to what-- they're
already in the frame of mind.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.130
OK, thank you.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:58.550
Well we are right out of time.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.350
I hope that was
interesting for you guys.

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.725
I hope it was somewhat different
and you had a good time.

00:53:02.725 --> 00:53:04.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:05.430
Thank you.

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.800
And I'll stick around outside
if you have any questions.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.210
And again, it was nice to meet
each and every one of you.

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.900
And thanks for the volunteers
for taking part and taking

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:13.400
the plunge.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.910
I appreciate it.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:15.630
And thank you.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.820
Enjoy the rest of
your afternoon.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.394
Thank you very much.
