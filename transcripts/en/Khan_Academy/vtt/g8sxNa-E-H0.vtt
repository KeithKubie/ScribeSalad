00:00:00.527 --> 00:00:02.155
The history of the Jewish people

00:00:02.155 --> 00:00:04.672
goes back roughly 4,000 years.

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:07.873
In order to understand the desire

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:11.335
by Jewish people in the late 1800s

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:13.602
and early 1900s for a Jewish homeland,

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:17.606
we have to go back
roughly 17 or 1800 years

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:24.003
to the year 135 in the Common Era.

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.499
It was then that Judea was a province

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.667
of the Roman Empire.
Judea is the biblical home

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:34.337
of the Jewish people. It's the location of

00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:37.505
Jerusalem. In 135 of the Common Era the

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.585
Roman emperor, Hadrian,
is able to suppress

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:44.118
a rebellion by the Jews in Judea and after

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:46.019
suppressing that rebellion, he expels the

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:54.419
Jews from Judea. Hadrian expels the Jews

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:59.506
from Judea. Not only did he expel them

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:02.273
from Judea, but he actually
renamed the province.

00:01:02.273 --> 00:01:04.799
This province up here
in red was Roman Syria.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.183
He merges these two
provinces and calls them

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:10.606
Syria Palaestina. Let me write that down.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:17.653
He renames it Syria Palaestina,

00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:19.865
which is essentially why for the next

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:23.090
1700 years or so and
even parts of it today

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.271
are referred to as Palestine.

00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:28.470
Now, we will fast forward over the next

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.417
more than 1700 years. Over this period

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:37.869
most of the Jewish people are not now

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.669
living in what was then Judea.

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:44.009
They have settled in groups in Europe,

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.940
in the Middle East, in Africa. There were

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.599
even groups of Jews who
had settled in India.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.506
For the most part they thrived in their

00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:54.401
various communities, but unfortunately

00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:57.839
their history had a fairly large amount

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:01.539
of persecution, of
discrimination, of kind of

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.872
using them as a scapegoat.
This was particularly

00:02:03.872 --> 00:02:06.838
the case in Europe where you have the

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:09.604
Christian church often kind of blamed the

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:12.601
Jews on religious
grounds. They were an easy

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.698
scapegoat any time things went hard.

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:16.609
You had ethnic cleansing. You had pogroms.

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.008
This was the Russian empire, especially

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.671
as we get into the 1800s, was especially

00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:24.726
infamous in its treatment of the Jews.

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:27.846
You have this long history
of Jewish persecution.

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:30.542
In fact, much of Jewish tradition today

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:32.943
is around remembrances of these various

00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:35.620
tragedies, these various persecutions.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.335
With that as the context, we then get into

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:44.422
the late 1800s. Let's go to 1860. 1860.

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.424
You have the birth of Theodor Herzl.

00:02:46.424 --> 00:02:50.497
1860. You have the birth of this gentleman

00:02:50.497 --> 00:02:54.507
right over here. Theodor Herzl born.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:59.734
He's born to a
German-speaking Jewish family

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.939
in the Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.612
The family he's born into
isn't particularly religious.

00:03:04.612 --> 00:03:08.272
As a young man, he remains fairly secular.

00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:10.524
He's not a particularly religious person.

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:13.360
As he grows and he becomes
a journalist, he is

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.345
able to observe the
anti-Semitism, especially

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.753
that's occurring especially
in the late 1800s

00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:20.948
in Russia, but throughout much of Europe.

00:03:20.948 --> 00:03:23.506
In 1894, so at this
point he's 34 years old,

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:26.590
still a fairly young man, in 1894 in Paris

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.205
he directly observes the Dreyfus affair.

00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:37.337
The Dreyfus affair, in
which a French Jewish

00:03:37.337 --> 00:03:40.115
officer in the military
is accused of treason,

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:42.133
accused of spying for the Germans.

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:43.996
This leads to all sorts of kind of public

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:46.869
anti-Semitism. It later
is shown that it was

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:51.671
false claims on Dreyfus. Some people would

00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.273
debate whether this directly led to

00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:56.676
Theodor Herzl's articulation of a need

00:03:56.676 --> 00:03:58.884
for a Jewish homeland,
but it was something

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:00.587
that he directly observed, so it must have

00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:02.752
influenced him in some way. It was this

00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:04.917
and all the other
anti-Semitism that he observed

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.068
either directly or
indirectly his entire life,

00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:09.147
or even that he was able to
read in the history books.

00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:11.874
Taking all of that in, and this is coming

00:04:11.874 --> 00:04:16.276
from a fairly secular individual, in 1896

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:22.608
at the age of 36, he
writes Der Judenstaat,

00:04:22.608 --> 00:04:25.496
which literally translates
as the Jewish State.

00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:27.494
Der Judenstaat.

00:04:27.494 --> 00:04:31.273
This was a very articulate description or

00:04:31.273 --> 00:04:35.111
desire, or articulation I
guess I should say, of the need

00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.537
for a Jewish homeland and a Jewish State.

00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:42.310
It's really the birth
of political Zionism.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.261
Political Zionism.

00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:50.098
Now, where does the
word Zionism come from?

00:04:50.098 --> 00:04:52.755
The root is Zion from Mount Zion.

00:04:52.755 --> 00:04:55.448
Mount Zion is essentially
a hill in modern-day

00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:58.264
Jerusalem, but the word
Zion is often equated

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:03.179
with Jerusalem, with the Holy Land, with

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:05.044
kind of the home of the Jews.

00:05:05.044 --> 00:05:06.736
That would be roughly right over here,

00:05:06.736 --> 00:05:10.208
Jerusalem is roughly right over here.

00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:12.536
I stress the modifier "political,"

00:05:12.536 --> 00:05:14.439
political Zionism,
because there was already

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.583
a movement to bring the Jewish people back

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:21.095
to their ancient homeland in Judea,

00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:24.085
which could be referred to as Zionism.

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:27.977
It was really Herzl who articulated a need

00:05:27.977 --> 00:05:29.995
to set up a political state and start to

00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:34.375
organize around trying to
create a political state.

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:37.919
Over here I quote some of what
he wrote in Der Judenstaat.

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.439
"We are a people, one
people. We have sincerely

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.410
tried everywhere to
merge with the national

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.546
communities in which we live, seeking only

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:47.405
to preserve the faith of
our fathers. It is not

00:05:47.405 --> 00:05:50.334
permitted us. In vain
we are loyal patriots,

00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:53.540
sometimes super loyal.
In vain do we make the

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.767
same sacrifices of life
and property as our

00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:58.346
fellow citizens. In vain
do we strive to enhance

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:00.869
the fame of our native
lands in the arts and

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.584
sciences, or her wealth
by trade and commerce.

00:06:03.584 --> 00:06:06.197
In our native lands,
where we have lived for

00:06:06.197 --> 00:06:08.257
centuries, we are still decried as aliens

00:06:08.257 --> 00:06:11.601
often by men whose
ancestors had not yet come

00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.009
at a time when Jewish sighs had long been

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.142
heard in the country.
Oppression and persecution

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:19.422
cannot exterminate us.
No nation on earth has

00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:23.204
endured such struggles
and sufferings as we have.

00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:28.203
Palestine is our unforgettable homeland."

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:30.350
This ends up getting huge traction,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.202
resonates with the Jewish diaspora,

00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:35.842
gives him the power to
essentially, the next year,

00:06:35.842 --> 00:06:43.268
organize in 1897 the
first Zionist Congress,

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:49.303
first Zionist Congress

00:06:49.303 --> 00:06:52.092
where he's able to bring
together likeminded,

00:06:52.092 --> 00:06:55.936
or at least people who
are looking to organize

00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:59.189
a way to eventually
establish a Jewish State,

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.269
preferably in Palestine.
I say preferably in

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:04.805
Palestine, and it's clear
that this was the first

00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:07.345
choice, to go back to
the historical homeland

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:09.541
of Judea, but even Herzl
himself had considered

00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:12.339
Argentina, which at the
time was very open-minded,

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.811
very open towards immigration.
There was some talk

00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:18.754
of East Africa, British East Africa.

00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:22.436
In fact, the British
offered Uganda in 1903

00:07:22.436 --> 00:07:25.169
to the what would later be called the

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.272
Zionist Organization. It was considered

00:07:27.272 --> 00:07:30.351
and I believe it was the
sixth Zionist Congress.

00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:32.269
These were things that
were actually considered.

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:35.028
But Palestine was always,
because of historical

00:07:35.028 --> 00:07:40.521
reasons, the hopeful home
of the Zionist Movement.

00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.789
I fully realize this is
an incredibly touchy issue

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.759
regardless of where people stand on their

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:48.269
views of Zionism or of Theodor Herzl.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:49.603
Some would view him as a visionary,

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:51.939
view him as a hero, some would view him as

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:54.945
starting the seed that led to the eventual

00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:58.932
occupation of Palastine
and the settlements

00:07:58.932 --> 00:08:01.429
that are going on there.
I will try my best

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:05.536
to stay out of picking sides there.

00:08:05.536 --> 00:08:08.759
Regardless of where you
are in that argument,

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:12.010
it's pretty amazing how much foresight he

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.938
actually had and his ability
to get this thing going.

00:08:14.938 --> 00:08:18.940
Even from the get-go, he
had some conversations

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.876
with the Ottomans and other folks about

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:22.936
being able to get land in
Palestine and all the rest.

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:25.069
He wasn't successful in his own lifetime.

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:27.877
But even after that first
Zionist Congress, which

00:08:27.877 --> 00:08:31.869
was held in Basel, he
understood what he was doing

00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:34.520
and he was looking
beyond his own lifetime.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.677
This is a quote here from his journal and

00:08:36.677 --> 00:08:38.204
it's pretty telling. "Were I to sum up the

00:08:38.204 --> 00:08:40.917
Basel Congress in a
word, which I shall guard

00:08:40.917 --> 00:08:43.220
against pronouncing
publically, it would be this:

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.216
At Basel I founded the
Jewish State. If I said

00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:49.215
this out loud today I would be greeted by

00:08:49.215 --> 00:08:52.176
universal laughter. In five years perhaps,

00:08:52.176 --> 00:08:55.472
and certainly in 50 years, everyone will

00:08:55.472 --> 00:08:57.549
perceive it." This is
an amazing impresison

00:08:57.549 --> 00:08:59.065
because the state of
Israel would come into

00:08:59.065 --> 00:09:04.028
a reality in roughly 50 years.

00:09:04.028 --> 00:09:06.223
With that said, and once
again I know this is

00:09:06.223 --> 00:09:08.260
an incredibly touchy issue, the one thing

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.850
that is probably surprising
to many people is

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.800
that he was not an extreme
individual. It comes

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.939
out from some of his other writing that

00:09:17.939 --> 00:09:20.410
even though he wanted
this Jewish State, he

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.864
was a fairly tolerant
individual and he did not

00:09:22.864 --> 00:09:24.870
view this only for the Jews and he didn't

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.671
feel that it should be taken by force or

00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:28.874
in any other way. It
comes out in his writing

00:09:28.874 --> 00:09:30.531
right over here. This is from his diary.

00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:33.344
"It goes without saying
that we shall respectfully

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:35.292
tolerate persons of
other faiths and protect

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:37.539
their property, their
honor and their freedom

00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:39.298
with the harshest means of coercion."

00:09:39.298 --> 00:09:41.210
So protect their property, honor and ...

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.846
using the harshest means
of coercion to protect

00:09:43.846 --> 00:09:46.076
their property, their
honor and their freedom.

00:09:46.076 --> 00:09:47.516
This is a tolerant thing to do.

00:09:47.516 --> 00:09:49.936
"This is another area
in which we shall set

00:09:49.936 --> 00:09:52.740
the entire world a wonderful example.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.070
Should there be many such immovable owners

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.205
in individual areas
who will not sell their

00:09:57.205 --> 00:09:59.538
property to us." So, hey,
if we want to go there

00:09:59.538 --> 00:10:01.547
and properly buy land
but people don't want

00:10:01.547 --> 00:10:04.427
to sell it to us, "we shall
simply leave them there

00:10:04.427 --> 00:10:06.431
and develop our commerce
in the direction of

00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:08.770
other areas which belong to us."

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.841
He wasn't in the mood to really get into a

00:10:10.841 --> 00:10:12.975
confrontation or to antagonize anyone.

00:10:12.975 --> 00:10:14.939
And he recognized that
there were other people

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:17.678
there that might not
want to sell their land

00:10:17.678 --> 00:10:21.195
to those that might settle this new State.

00:10:22.175 --> 00:10:24.761
Later on his life, actually shortly before

00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:26.518
his death, he actually
writes a novel about

00:10:26.518 --> 00:10:29.622
this potential State
that might be created.

00:10:29.622 --> 00:10:33.086
He writes, and this is
written in Altneuland,

00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:35.011
it literally translates
to The Old New Land,

00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:38.140
"It is founded on the ideas which are a

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.139
common product of all civilized nations.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:43.151
It would be immoral if
we would exclude anyone

00:10:43.151 --> 00:10:46.177
whatever his origin, his
decent, or his religion,

00:10:46.177 --> 00:10:48.295
from participating in our achievements,

00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:50.214
for we stand on the shoulders of other

00:10:50.214 --> 00:10:53.617
civilized peoples. What
we own we owe to the

00:10:53.617 --> 00:10:56.181
preparatory work of
other peoples. Therefore,

00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:59.603
we have to repay our
debt. There's only one

00:10:59.603 --> 00:11:03.760
way to do it. The highest
tolerance. Our motto must

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.091
therefore be, now and ever:
Man, you are my brother."
