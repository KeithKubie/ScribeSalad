00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.779
This is what heaven is like.
And things just got a little too real.

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.619
It's episode 38 of IMG!

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.600
Okay, so this is Katy Perry

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.710
and this is Paula Deen.
Uh-oh.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.650
Because this is Tom Hanks and this is 50 Cent.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.520
Coincidence? Here's a caterpillar whose
pattern resembles

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.210
little penguins.
And what if Obama was a white guy?

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.740
Crystal e-mailed me a picture
she took of a cooler lid that says

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.930
'wow, look at them jugs.'
But, onto the dessert.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.620
"Freakgirl" makes beautiful cupcakes,
but the pun award goes to her

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.120
'Up-cakes.'
Parents can be scary,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.670
but this picture is one of the most
terrifying I've ever seen.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.739
Can you make sense of this

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.770
shape? What is it?
And in these next two pictures

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.270
can you find the faces?
And that's right, you guessed it,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.450
it is now time for 99 pictures of bananas.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.610
Enjoy them all.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.340
Here's an artist who meticulously cuts
paper with an exacto blade to make

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.229
swirling portrait out of a single

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.790
sheet.
And here is a giraffe licking a squirrel.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.810
How about a panda on a rocking horse?
Or face paint a famous paintings?

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.390
Warhol, Pollock, 'The Scream,'

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.560
Magritte, 'Starry Night.'
Pocky box delivers realistic South Park families

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.880
and Mario delivers

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.070
any performance-enhancing drug you want,
because now

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.369
you're swimming with portals.
Hello?

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.619
Ooohh.
Baby hands are delicious,

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.690
but after the town of Kolmanskop, Namibia was abondoned wind and sand

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.479
re-claimed the homes,
leaving these eerie desert rooms.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.899
Also eerie are underground neutrino detectors.

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.280
Eerie and very, very large.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.460

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.520

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.040
