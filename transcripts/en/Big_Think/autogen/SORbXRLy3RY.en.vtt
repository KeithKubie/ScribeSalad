when you think about it and when you
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.670
when you think about it and when you
start asking the question why a lot of

gonna take that out of the refrigerator

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
gonna take that out of the refrigerator
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.389
gonna take that out of the refrigerator
and we're gonna get a pan really hot or

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
and we're gonna get a pan really hot or
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.770

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.940
a grill really hot we're gonna slap it
on there we're gonna turn it over and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
on there we're gonna turn it over and
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.560
on there we're gonna turn it over and
we're gonna stick it with a fork a few

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
we're gonna stick it with a fork a few
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240
we're gonna stick it with a fork a few
times and and then we're gonna call it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
times and and then we're gonna call it

times and and then we're gonna call it
done but when you start really thinking

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
done but when you start really thinking

done but when you start really thinking
about what a steak is made up of the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
about what a steak is made up of the
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.449
about what a steak is made up of the
system of mussels myofibrils and the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
system of mussels myofibrils and the
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.339
system of mussels myofibrils and the
things that actually were

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349
things that actually were
 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.140
things that actually were
inside a muscle and the chemicals that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
inside a muscle and the chemicals that
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.550
inside a muscle and the chemicals that
are involved you start to realize wow

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
are involved you start to realize wow
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.800
are involved you start to realize wow
what I really need to do is is think of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
what I really need to do is is think of
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.739
what I really need to do is is think of
it as is three different thermal trips I

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:21.749
it as is three different thermal trips I
 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.720
it as is three different thermal trips I
get it out of the refrigerator and let

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
get it out of the refrigerator and let
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.849
get it out of the refrigerator and let
it come to room temperature because that

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859
it come to room temperature because that
 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.179
it come to room temperature because that
is going to allow for faster cooking I

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189
is going to allow for faster cooking I
 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.490
is going to allow for faster cooking I
want a really good sear but I want most

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
want a really good sear but I want most
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.349
want a really good sear but I want most
of the interior the meat to be

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359
of the interior the meat to be
 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.360
of the interior the meat to be
medium-rare okay well in that case what

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370
medium-rare okay well in that case what
 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.679
medium-rare okay well in that case what
I really need to do is to make my

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689
I really need to do is to make my
 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.720
I really need to do is to make my
primary cooking method about what I want

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
primary cooking method about what I want
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.659
primary cooking method about what I want
most of the meat to be so what makes

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:41.669
most of the meat to be so what makes
 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.610
most of the meat to be so what makes
sense I treat it like a roast I put it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
sense I treat it like a roast I put it
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.619
sense I treat it like a roast I put it
in the oven at a lower temperature let

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629
in the oven at a lower temperature let
 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.170
in the oven at a lower temperature let
the the inside of the meat get closer to

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180
the the inside of the meat get closer to
 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.789
the the inside of the meat get closer to
that medium-rare temperature take it out

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799
that medium-rare temperature take it out
 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.229
that medium-rare temperature take it out
rest it for a little while

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
rest it for a little while
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.420
rest it for a little while
salt it and then sear the outside so if

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
salt it and then sear the outside so if
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.740
salt it and then sear the outside so if
you actually start thinking about it is

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
you actually start thinking about it is
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.990
you actually start thinking about it is
two different pieces of meat I'm cooking

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000
two different pieces of meat I'm cooking
 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.309
two different pieces of meat I'm cooking
the interior the meat and I'm cooking

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319
the interior the meat and I'm cooking
 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.869
the interior the meat and I'm cooking
the exterior than meat and there are

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879
the exterior than meat and there are
 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.509
the exterior than meat and there are
actually two different processes and

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519
actually two different processes and
 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.069
actually two different processes and
that sounds complicated but actually

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079
that sounds complicated but actually
 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.929
that sounds complicated but actually
it's not it does however require that

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939
it's not it does however require that
 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.300
it's not it does however require that
you understand something about what meat

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
you understand something about what meat
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.470
you understand something about what meat
actually is and how it actually works

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480
actually is and how it actually works
 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.750
actually is and how it actually works

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760
cooking pasta
 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.250
cooking pasta
we've always brought huge amounts of

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260
we've always brought huge amounts of
 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.830
we've always brought huge amounts of
water to a boil and dumped it in why

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
water to a boil and dumped it in why
 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.089
water to a boil and dumped it in why
have we done that well a lot of people

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099
have we done that well a lot of people
 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.249
have we done that well a lot of people
kind of argue about how we got into the

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:22.259
kind of argue about how we got into the
 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.039
kind of argue about how we got into the
into the habit of doing that and it

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049
into the habit of doing that and it
 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.390

would take a really long time to discuss

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
would take a really long time to discuss
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.249

trying to do we're trying to rehydrate
 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.530
trying to do we're trying to rehydrate
something without overcooking it we're

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
something without overcooking it we're
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.439
something without overcooking it we're
trying to make it al dente that is we

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449
trying to make it al dente that is we
 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.240
trying to make it al dente that is we
want it to be a certain texture in the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250

in boiling water we still have to think

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139
in boiling water we still have to think
 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.569
in boiling water we still have to think
about the fact that we're saturating a

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579
about the fact that we're saturating a
 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.819
about the fact that we're saturating a
very dense dried piece of starch and

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829
very dense dried piece of starch and
 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.219
very dense dried piece of starch and

varieties so what do we really need to

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639
varieties so what do we really need to
 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.909
varieties so what do we really need to
do well we need to bring it to a boil

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919
do well we need to bring it to a boil
 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.159
do well we need to bring it to a boil
that's true because we've got some

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169
that's true because we've got some
 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.349
that's true because we've got some
certain expectations for the outside of

it at least in my opinion is to start it
 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.479
it at least in my opinion is to start it
in colder water so that we're slowly

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489
in colder water so that we're slowly
 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.860
in colder water so that we're slowly
bringing it up to temperature which

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870
bringing it up to temperature which
 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.559
bringing it up to temperature which
gives more time for the the starches to

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569
gives more time for the the starches to
 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.199
gives more time for the the starches to
rehydrate without actually over cooking

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209
rehydrate without actually over cooking
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.149
