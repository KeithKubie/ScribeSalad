00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.590
Have you ever tried to remove a liquid from
another liquid?

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:03.610
Not so easy.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:14.549
There's a reason they say oil and water don't
mix, but neither does oil 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.690
and pretty much anything else.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.200
Oil is a mainstay for modern post-industrial
revolution society.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.930
We run our engines, and heat and power our
homes with it; and even with all the precautions

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.830
and cost involved, sometimes we accidentally
spill it everywhere.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.050
Most recently in Refugio State Beach on the
central coast of California on May 19th, but

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.539
also in Yellowstone National Park, in Montana,
in the Black Sea, Israel, Louisiana, Indiana,

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.510
CuraÃ§ao and North Dakota THRICE; and that's
just in the last year and a half!

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.210
Cleaning up the spill is HEAVILY studied,
but what about later?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.010
What happens 5, 10, 50 years after a spill?

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.190
Is everything just hunky-dory?

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.190
Not at all.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.109
On March 24, 1989 the Exxon Valdez oil tanker
ran aground spilling more than 11 million

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.670
gallons of crude oil into waters off the coast
of Alaska.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.370
At the time, it was the largest oil spill
in US history.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.931
More than 1000 miles of shoreline were covered
in the toxic hydrocarbon chemical; and more

00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:15.780
than 2000 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, and
a quarter million seabirds died following

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.780
the spill.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.210
The Exxon Valdez was a huge story when I was
a kid, and by volume it was only eclipsed

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.390
by the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill
by BP.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.720
These two spills are affecting flora and fauna
in massive numbers -- but now, years later,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.900
what's happening?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.630
Even after cleanup is considered "done," oil
is still in the environment; for example,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.000
tarballs wash up onshore months or years later.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.550
Tarballs are crusty weathered balls filled
with soft gooey oil -- like a toasted marshmallow

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.550
of death.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.990
When I think of an oil spill, I picture water
with a thin layer of oil on top spreading

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.640
for miles -- that's the first stage.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.690
Eventually, the sun, wind, waves, ocean bacteria
and other forces act on the oil creating the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.690
tarball.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.360
The sun helps evaporate the lighter components,
leaving behind the heavy chemical compounds;

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.450
sand and tiny particles in ocean water collect
in the oil, and the sun, waves and wind form

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.560
the oil into an emulsion.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.560
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
says it looks like chocolate pudding -- and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.969
is even stickier than the original spilled
oil!

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:26.629
If it comes in contact with the beach, it
can crack open causing new tiny oil spills.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.930
Some cleanups are so severe, the top-most
layer of sand is completely removed and new,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.260
uncontaminated sand is brought in.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.590
Scientific American wrote in 2003 that bacterial
growth is "inhibited," on beaches and in Alaska

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.270
"toxicity remained for a decade or more".

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.370
Mammals and ducks ate prey contaminated with
oil, and mussel beds are STILL recovering

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.629
-- estimated time?

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.139
30 years.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.629
According to the National Wildlife Foundation,
turtles and dolphins are being affected by

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.189
oil, with turtles stranding themselves at
five times the normal rate, and a new study

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.109
in PLOS ONE found adrenal and lung lesions
caused by oil in Gulf dolphins' inhaling of

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.310
oil fumes when they come up for air!

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.430
Under the water, life is hit HARD whenever
oil spills; but humans are quick to forget

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.829
and move on.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.569
Coral in the gulf were covered in oil, and
dead and dying coral was found seven miles

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.290
from the BP spill site.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.989
A study published in Science after the Exxon
Valdez spill found even a few molecules of

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.799
oil out of a billion -- known as parts-per-billion
-- was enough to harm some animals; like salmon,

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.189
whose mortality rates increased for years
after the spill because sensitive fish eggs

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.620
were contacted by tiny amounts of toxic crude
oil.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.219
Oil is toxic, inhalation or ingestion of,
and contact with hydrocarbons is bad, but

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:54.790
the decades of cleanup and response can affect
the ecosystem in so many ways.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.169
The propellers of boats alone can disturb
and kill wildlife!

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.629
Today, 26 years later, oil is STILL found
on the beaches of Alaska and though some species

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.629
have returned to pre-spill levels some species
of fish, whale and bird are not recovering

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:10.629
at all,.

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.129
More recently, NOAA created a model of how
sea currents likely carried the BP Deepwater

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.280
Horizon oil along the Gulf coast and into
the Caribbean and Atlantic.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.560
Though years go by and the media move on,
spills like these go on to affect waterways

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.910
for generations to come
