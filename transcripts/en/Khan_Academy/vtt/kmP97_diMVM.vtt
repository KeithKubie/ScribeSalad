00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.360
We are on problem number 14.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.095
See, what did they draw here?

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:10.850
That's the y-axis, that's
the x-axis.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.255
They drew a line that looks
something like this.

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:18.100
Let's see, negative 3, so it
goes something like this.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.940
That's close enough.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.090
And then they're saying that
this is the point negative 3.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.820
This is the point y
equals negative 1.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.760
This is of course the y-axis.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.610
This is the x-axis.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.790
The figure above shows a graph
of the line of y equals mx

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.000
plus b, where m and
b are constants.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.160
Which of the following best
represents the graph of y is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.050
equal to minus 3mx plus b?

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.120
Well, if this yellow line-- this
is y equals mx plus b.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.230
Well, what is b, first of all?
b is just the y-intercept.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.770
So the y-intercept is right
here, y equals negative 1.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.160
So b is negative 1.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.240
And what's the slope?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.660
Well, when we run, that's
what-- 1, 2, 3 units.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.000
Change in x is 3.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.390
What is the rise?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.000
The rise, we go down,
so it's negative 1.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.430
We go down 1.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.150
So the change in y is
equal to negative 1.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.500
So the slope is negative 1/3.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.650
So the equation of this
line is y is equal to

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.740
minus 1/3 x minus 1.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.560
So if you want to know what
minus 3mx plus b is, what's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.560
minus 3 times this m?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.800
What's minus 3 times
minus 1/3?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.970
Well, the negatives cancel out,
so you just get-- let me

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.000
switch to purple, because that's
that problem-- minus 3

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.070
times-- this is m, right?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.540
This is m.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.820
So minus 3 times minus 1/3,
that just equals 1.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.070
So it equals 1x plus b.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.570
What's b?

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.760
It's minus 1.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.729
So the graph we're looking
for is x minus 1.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.190
And so if we wanted to draw
that, the y-intercept would be

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.700
the same, it would
be right there.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.330
And then you just have
a slope of 1.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.830
Slope of 1 looks-- well, that's
as close as I could do

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.670
to drawing it, right--
that's a slope of 1.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.140
Your change in x should be the
same as your change in y.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.630
So if you look at all the
choices, first of all, it's

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.410
pretty obvious it's
D, I think.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.360
And they make it very explicit
that the slope is 1 and the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.460
y-intercept is negative 1.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.850
And that's choice D.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.100
Next problem.

00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.750
I get excited when there's
something to draw, because we

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.790
can get through them faster.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.120
15.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.120
If the volume of a cube is 8,
what is the shortest distance

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.610
from the center of the cube
to the base of the cube?

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.220
Fascinating.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.880
So the volume is 8,
so what are the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.130
dimensions of this cube?

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.890
It's a cube, so all the sides
are the same, right?

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.420
So x times x times x is x to the
third, and that equals 8.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.810
So the dimensions-- what to
the third power is 8?

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.000
You should know that.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.930
2, right?

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.720
2 times 2 times 2 is 8.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.360
So the dimensions of the
cube are 2 by 2 by 2.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.450
So let's take that cross section
where the center is.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.490
And if I were to draw it, so
that's just-- so the center of

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.410
the cube is right here.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.400
And we know the dimensions
of this cross section.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.020
It's 2, 2, 2, 2.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.280
Right?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.290
I just sliced the cube
right there.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.830
And I just want to make sure
I'm doing this problem.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.940
From the center of the cube to
the base of the cube-- so the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.145
base of the cube is going to
be-- if I were to draw the

00:04:00.145 --> 00:04:02.740
cube, this would have been the
base of the cube down here.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.490
So this is the base
of the cube.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.820
So they're essentially just
asking us, what's this

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.250
distance right here?

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.870
Well that's easy.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.300
This is the center, so
it's right in the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.940
middle, so it's 1. soon.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.230
It's 1 to the bottom, it's 1 to
the roof of the cube, it's

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.709
1 to each of the sides.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.910
So it's 1 away.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.590
So that is answer A.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.400
Next problem.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.390
Problem 16.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:46.440
If y is equal to 5x cubed over
z, what happens to the value

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.952
of y when both x and
z are doubled?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.330
So the way I think about it
is, y is equal to 5x cubed

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.670
divided by z.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.030
Actually do you know what the
very easiest way to do this

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.490
problem is?

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.720
Substitute numbers
for x and z.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.140
So let's say that x is equal
to 1 and z equals to 1.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.190
So in this situation,
y is equal to what?

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.790
5 times 1 cubed divided by 1,
well that's just equal to 5.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.880
Now they're saying,
what happens

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.030
if x and z are doubled?

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.490
So let's take the second
situation.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.450
x is equal to 2, z
is equal to 2.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:35.910
Now, y is equal to 5 times
2 cubed over 2.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.630
And that is equal to what?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.920
Well, 2 cubed divided by 2, this
2 cancels with the cubed.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.760
You get 2 squared.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.620
So it's just 5 times 2 squared,
which is 5 times 4,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.100
which is 20.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:57.310
So y went from 5 to 20, so y
increased by a factor of 4.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.810
And that is choice E.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.280
y is multiplied by 4.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.860
These questions can be
surprisingly confusing because

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.710
you're like, oh, you have these
variables, do you make x

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.530
into 2x and z into 2z,
and then solve for--

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.430
just try out numbers.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.700
They're not putting any
restrictions on you, so just

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.260
substitute x and z, 1 and
1, and then double them.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.490
Next problem.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:27.690
The SAT, speed matters more
than maybe rigor.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.880
All right.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.840
Problem 17.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.340
Luke purchased an automobile
for $5,000.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.680
And the value of the automobile

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.420
decreased by 20% per year.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.470
The value in dollars of the
automobile n years from the

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.100
date of the purchase is given by
the function v, where v of

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:59.660
n is equal to 5,000 times 4/5,
which is the same thing as

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.480
0.8, to the nth power.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.460
Fair enough.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.350
How many years from the date of
the purchase will the value

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.150
of the automobile be $3,200?

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.400
Well, they're saying the
value is $3,200, so we

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.730
just solve for n.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.060
v of how many years is
equal to $3,200?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:23.200
3,200 is equal to 5,000
times 4/5 to the n.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:30.380
Divide both sides by 5,000, you
get 3,200/5,000 is equal

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.860
to 4/5 to the n.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.690
And then, let's see,
what's 32/5,000?

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.710
You can delete these 0's.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.760
Let's see, 16/25.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:54.540
That equals-- so 16/25 is
equal to 4/5 to the n.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.120
And we should immediately--
well, hopefully you'd

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.810
recognize is that 16 is 4
squared, and 25 is 5 squared,

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:09.970
so 16/25 is equal
to 4/5 squared.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.970
4 squared is 16.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.310
5 squared is 25.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.780
So n is equal to 2.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.930
2 years.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.210
And that is choice B.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.260
Let's see if I have time for--
no, we have a couple more

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.300
problems. I'll do
the last three

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.910
problems in the next video.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.240
I will see you
