00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.980
I think one of the most common reactions that I get when I tell people that I've discovered new species

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.420
is utter surprise that there are new species
left to be discovered.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.280
- That’s a male of a new species, that’s
the first male we got!

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.860
- No way!
- Yeah!

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.900
What we're doing is looking under every rock, every log, every debris on the ground...

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.140
you really have to put yourself into the shoes of an arachnid and imagine,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.080
'if I was an arachnid, where would I be hiding?'

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.420
I'm definitely not in the lab all the time.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.040
That's really a stereotype that's inaccurate.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.540
I think the stereotype that I'd like to imagine myself in a little bit more is like

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.840
Indiana Jones sort of situation, exploring the unknown and trying to discover something new.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.360
Why did it have to be snakes?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.940
I am scared of snakes - legit.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.680
I don't even want to admit that right now!

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.260
I'm really scared of mosquitoes, and I'm scared of birds flying out of the bushes at night.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.580
(sighs) Yeah...

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.340
There's moments when I'm in the field that I don't feel like it's the most glamorous job,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.360
when I haven't showered and I've run out of water

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.240
and I just want to go home and watch some Netflix...

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.020
- Hello! It's the end of my first day out in the field.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320
But I’m already pretty tired, hot and sweaty...

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.720
- Hello, it’s Lauren!

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.986
I just got back from my morning of collecting

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:27.760
and it was hot and sweaty as you can probably see...

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.740
...but at the end of the day it's something
that I really love doing, and that's everything.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.760
Arachnids are both diurnal and nocturnal,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.120
and arachnids are often what we call cryptic species, which means that they're trying to blend in,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.000
and so that makes them really hard
to see.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.300
So we do have a number of tools that we also bring along with us when we go out

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.500
into the field, and one of those is a leaf litter sifter.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.640
You shake all the leaves around, and at the bottom is a funnel that collects all of the little leaf particles,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.500
and lots of insects and arachnids, and even some other weird things like amphipods,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.280
which are a kind of crustacean.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.460
We also bring a vegetation beater or a beat sheet, which is like a white kite

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.880
that you hold under vegetation as you knock a stick or something against the vegetation

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.020
and spiders and insects rain down,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.420
sometimes ants rain down into your shirt too,
which is not the most fun.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.600
Then you use a pooter, which is like a mouth vacuum,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.780
to suck all the insects and arachnids up and collect them into a vial.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.780
I want to get a logo screen printed on my fanny pack

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.220
that says, "Just poot it."

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.800
That'd be good, right?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.160
As soon as you get back to the base camp and start looking at what you've collected,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.940
you may notice that you've collected all the same few species, which is a sign of a disturbed forest,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.880
or you've collected a lot of different species, which is a sign of a healthy forest.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.260
- This is some of the stuff we collected over the last two weeks.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.600
It might not look like a ton, but in each of
those little baggies

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.540
there's anywhere from two to a few hundred to maybe even a thousand specimens.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.540
Then once night completely falls, we'll take out our ultraviolet lamps and start looking

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.980
for scorpions. We'll work until 1:00 in
the morning or so and then try to get some sleep.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.380
- I don't know exactly for sure what it is,
but I'm going to find out!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.400
Ah-HAAAA!

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.900
I think that my research stems from a need
that I have as an individual to understand

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.080
the biodiversity of the world.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.810
Somewhere between 30 and 50% of the arachnid
species on Earth are only known to science.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.230
What I've made my personal life's mission
is to try to document the remaining 50%, and

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.030
what that requires is a lot of on-the-ground,
hard work, and also back in the lab working

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.040
the microscope and in the genetics lab.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.100
- This one is a new species.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.360
AHHHHH!

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.740
We're pretty excited.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.860
It's like the whipped cream on top of the ice cream sundae.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.860
We found it the first day, and this one is an adult female, which means it's a really valuable specimen:

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.800
we can actually use it for describing the species formally.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800
and, I don't know, I couldn't be more happy.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.820
We're losing species at a rate that's higher
than the rate we're discovering species,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.130
and unless we understand what's out there, it's impossible to understand how to protect it

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.730
and how to conserve it.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.980
So for me, I feel a fundamental duty to the
Earth really to document and improve our knowledge

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.980
of species on the planet.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.460
In this next episode, see firsthand the deadly risks a volcanologist takes

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.880
when examining an erupting volcano.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.710
