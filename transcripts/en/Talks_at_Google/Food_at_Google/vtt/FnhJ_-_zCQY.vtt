00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.950
Well, we got a huge
audience today.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.850
Google Food and
Talks at Google is

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.420
proud to present Hans
Roeckenwagner, Chef

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.520
LA for a long time, 3
Square Bistro and then also

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.280
Roeckenwagner Bakery
and Cafe fame.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.040
So he's going be demoing
a couple recipes.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.310
For those of you who
received cookbooks,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.680
there's a card in there.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160
So if you'd like to
just fill it out,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.620
send it to the emailing list.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.570
They'll happily send
you the recipes.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.280
And then also,
afterwards, there's

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.550
also an opportunity
to sign up for that.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.368
So without further ado,
Chef Hans Roeckenwagner.

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:54.713
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.737 --> 00:00:57.820
HANS ROECKENWAGNER: It's
just not morning anymore.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.040
Hello, everyone.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.300
This the first time I've done
a demo with so many computers.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.640
I guess there's a
first for everything,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.730
and today is the first for that.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.330
Anyway, my name's Hans
Roeckenwagner, as Jeff said.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.030
And believe it or
not, I am going

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.190
to be celebrating my
30 year anniversary

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.010
of being in the food
business in Los Angeles.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.962
That's a dinosaur
in our industry, OK?

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.030
I feel like Jurassic
Park sometimes.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.360
30 years.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.170
Imagine that.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.500
1985, I opened my
first restaurant

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.160
literally down the street right
here where Joe's is right now.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.942
Everyone know where Joe's is?

00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:43.900
That was my restaurant.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.770
I built that restaurant
actually with my bare hands.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.030
I had $70,000.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.450
That's all I had, which I
borrowed from my family.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.760
And my wife and I opened
our first restaurant.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.480
We had nine tables.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.060
I think we had 36 seats.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.900
And that was the dream for us,
24 years old, young and stupid.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.730
But I think that's
actually the only way

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.890
to do it, to be honest.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.240
Because this industry
can eat you alive.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.270
So what I'd like
to do today, I'm

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.510
going to show a couple of
recipes from my first book.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.420
I have two cookbooks,
and one which you're

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.080
holding your hand, some of you.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.910
And the other one is
from the first cookbook.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.259
And as Jeff said,
send us your email

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.550
and we'll email you the recipe.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.940
What I'd like to do, I'd
like to do stuff as I talk.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.560
I think you're here more
to hear me talk than to do.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.920
And please ask me questions,
because that gives me

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.580
an idea of what you want to know
and what you're interested in.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.680
Everyone is interested
in food now, right?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.730
I mean, for sure you are.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.070
You're here.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.020
But think even those
who are not here,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.080
everyone's interested in food.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.350
What is that?

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.150
What gets us together
like that about food?

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.487
It's not just sustenance.

00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:03.570
And that's actually what
drew me so the restaurant

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.096
business a little bit.

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:06.595
Maybe I won't even
go to my recipes.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.710
There's something about food
that unites us and brings

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.980
us together.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.100
And one of the most
satisfying things for me

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.460
is to walk into, hopefully, my
restaurant, a busy restaurant,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.110
and see people
enjoying themselves.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.040
Not just in the
food-- the ambience,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.590
the service, getting
together and just having fun.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.720
Actually, one of the things,
having been in this industry

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.910
for so long and having had
a restaurant for so long,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.640
I was in Los Angeles during
a very difficult time when

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.260
we had the fires,
we had the riots,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.010
we had the earthquakes in
a very short succession.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.940
Some of you may remember
that, others not.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.960
But there was a time when
LA felt really disconnected,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.260
and down, and out.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.860
And everyone counted us out.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.750
And I felt I needed
to do something

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.810
to get people together.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.260
Because we grow up in
this car culture and we

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.400
barely look at each other.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.570
And now we're on our computers,
and that's good for you,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.500
but not so good for us.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.220
But I felt we needed
to do something

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.110
to create community again.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.510
And there was this thing in
Germany that we used to do.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.675
It's called stammtisch.

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:27.510
And literally it's--
Stammtisch has two meanings.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.050
One, the four of us could
get together and say, OK,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.434
every third Wednesday
of the month,

00:04:33.434 --> 00:04:34.600
we're going to get together.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.300
We're going to sit
around this big table.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.400
We're going to have a drink,
and we're going to eat,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.640
and we're going
to talk politics,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640
whatever we feel like doing.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.350
And that's what's
called a stammtisch.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.970
And the other thing
about stammtisch

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.150
is actually the table itself.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.190
It used to be a very gnarly,
big, wooden table that sat,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.980
and it was reserved for
regulars, for regulars only.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.970
So if you came as a foreigner
or someone that doesn't frequent

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.160
that restaurant, and you
would sit at that table,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.120
you'd literally get
kicked out because it

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.020
was reserved for the regulars.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.290
So I felt I needed to
do something like that.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.270
And I started stammtisch
in '90-- I think '93?

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.360
And I said, OK, I sent out
some emails to some friends.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.370
And I said every Tuesday--
it was then Tuesday--

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.070
every Tuesday,
let's get together.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.400
Just come have a bite.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.720
Have a drink.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.290
And something big
grew out of that.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.035
Over the next 10 years, we
built this into this big thing

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:38.330
where people always
knew every Tuesday night

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.115
I know where I'm going to be.

00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:41.490
I'm going to be
at Roeckenwagner.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.340
That was then my prized
possession restaurant

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.420
on Main Street here
at the Edgemar.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.480
Everyone knows the
Edgemar Complex?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.780
So in the back,
there's a restaurant.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.120
It's still there now.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.310
I sold it actually in 2006.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.660
And we did stammtisch.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.810
And people knew
exactly where to be.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.710
And I'm really proud
of having done that.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.190
A lot of friendships
have formed.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.590
A lot of things
have happened there.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.970
And we still do it now.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.820
Every Wednesday night at
3 Square, I'm there air.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.650
I'm at 3 Square, and
I'm hosting the table.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.070
Anyone who wants to join, meet
some new people, have a beer,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.631
have a laugh, come on down.

00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:26.130
All right.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.296
I should really get cooking.

00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:32.170
If not, I'm going to-- so
we're going to do today, we're

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.780
going to do kadaifi-wrapped
shrimp on a eggplant caviar,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.540
melanzane with
marinated tomatoes.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.450
And what I want
to focus on today

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.770
a little bit is the
eggplant caviar.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.660
Everything else is
going to be pretty

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.890
simple and straightforward.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.171
Eggplant, being a
native of Germany,

00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:55.170
we didn't have eggplant.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.930
I mean, we had it,
but it was brought in.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.609
But we all look
at this vegetable

00:06:59.609 --> 00:07:01.400
sometimes, what are we
going to do with it?

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.900
Right?

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.750
It's a little
intimidating, right?

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.140
And actually
eggplant is a fruit.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.970
It's a berry.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.480
It has seeds, and the seeds, at
times, can make it a little bit

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.980
bitter.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.140
So as we're doing it,
I'm going to show you.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.430
So let me start.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.540
These are the Ichiban eggplants,
the long, slender ones.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.800
This is what we have right now.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.980
They're in season all year long,
but to be honest, generally

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:40.430
I prefer the big big, golden
eggs, the black bells,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.650
for this particular dish.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.130
What I've done
here ahead of time

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.170
is I charred some
of these eggplants

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.470
and I got them ready for you.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.660
And I mean charred.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.320
I'm not messing
around with this, OK?

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.140
So you can do this over a grill,
or you can do it over a burner

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.040
just like this.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:06.410
You put them cut side
down and don't touch them.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.492
Just leave them there.

00:08:09.492 --> 00:08:10.950
In about three,
four, five minutes,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.340
we're going to check them
out, and I want them literally

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.850
charred like this, OK?

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.390
So this is your chance
to really burn it.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:22.780
All right.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.040
So I'm going to
keep this going just

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.250
to show you roughly
how long it takes

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.095
and how charred I want it.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.214
Now, these, when you're done
with this, you can see here.

00:08:41.214 --> 00:08:42.130
I'm going to show you.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.180
We're going to get rid of
some, obviously, as much as

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.980
possible of this black,
charred substance,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.160
and also some of the seeds.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.940
You don't want to take
out all the seeds.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.020
But see how nicely this
is just being scraped off?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.190
OK.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.780
And then, literally.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.510
If you start at the stem,
you can scrape this right out

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.170
of the shell.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.790
OK.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.170
So if you have a few pieces
of the char in there,

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.490
I like that actually because
it gives a smoky flavor.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.670
I like smoky flavor.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.040
I like sausages.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.130
I like anything smoked.

00:09:43.789 --> 00:09:46.080
But still, you can always
add a little more at the end.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.470
Let me try to do a couple more.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.100
We'll add it.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.220
Let's check this out here.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.800
So this is not
enough yet, clearly.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.680
Because there's two
things we're doing here.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.320
We're charring it to
get some of the flavor,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.610
and also we're cooking it.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.630
We're going to cook it in
the shell, in the skin.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.970
So we want to really char it
very well on the cut side,

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.150
and then we're going to
turn it around, and give it

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.430
more heat from the bottom and
actually cook it in its skin.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.240
So any questions so far?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.430
No?

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.500
I'm that good?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.340
Come on.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.290
Ask me something.

00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:37.370
Maybe you see it better
on this one actually.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.440
It comes out even better.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.040
It could've been maybe cooked
just a little bit more.

00:10:46.982 --> 00:10:50.385
It'll be nice and soft.

00:10:50.385 --> 00:10:50.885
OK.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.615
I'm going to put that aside.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.340
So let me talk about
my bakery a little bit.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.140
Are some of you are
familiar with my bakery?

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:05.980
Yes?

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.060
I don't see enough hands.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.930
OK.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.160
Excellent.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.110
That is actually my
big business now.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:20.380
In 1992, 1991, when I sold the
restaurant on Abbot Kinney,

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.340
I moved down to Main Street.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.430
And I felt, you know what?

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.470
I really can't find the
bread that I want for my food

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.830
and for my sandwiches.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.980
And I brought a master
baker from Germany

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:47.920
and started a bakery as
part of the restaurant.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:58.200
And this bakery, that
was part of my kitchen,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.230
started to produce
some really good stuff.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.220
One of them, which
you're eating right now,

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.250
that's something we've
become known for-- pretzels.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.862
And within a year or
so after we opened,

00:12:12.862 --> 00:12:14.320
there was a little
coffee shop that

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.220
opened right in front of us.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.920
And that was Peet's Coffee.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.670
And one day, unbeknownst
to me, this woman walks in.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.740
And I kid you not, her
name was Janet Coffee.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.630
I'm not making this up.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.260
Janet Coffee walks in
the door and says, hi.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.145
I'm Janet Coffee.

00:12:34.145 --> 00:12:35.570
I work for Peet's Coffee.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.700
We'd like to carry
your pastries.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.325
We're like, OK.

00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:39.130
Well, that's easy.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.270
You're right up front.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.130
We'll bake it in the back.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.296
We'll bring it to the front.

00:12:42.296 --> 00:12:42.870
No problem.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.920
Yeah, but we have
five other locations.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.320
So all of a sudden, I had to get
a truck, I had to get a driver.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.790
And that's how our bakery
started, literally-- out

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.035
of the back of our kitchen.

00:12:55.035 --> 00:12:56.660
So in the daytime,
it was a restaurant.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.076
In the nighttime,
it was a bakery.

00:12:58.076 --> 00:12:59.920
It was a perfect
use of the space

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.530
and, economically,
obviously very good.

00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:07.420
And that's just about right.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.660
Now, you'd never think
of doing this, right?

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.160
So we started delivering
Peet's Coffee.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.630
And little by little, we
got another account here,

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.490
another account there.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.600
And all of a sudden, I
found myself, you know,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.410
this bakery is really
something I should

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.110
be taking more seriously.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.030
And then a few years later,
we bought this little space

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.220
on Washington Boulevard
near Beethoven,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.230
which now is the little
cafe of ours where

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.400
we do breakfast and lunch.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.024
If you haven't been
there, go by there.

00:13:47.024 --> 00:13:48.890
It's a really charming
little neighborhood

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:54.120
spot-- super friendly, great
coffee, great pastries.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.700
So we moved our
production there,

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.990
because we really had outgrown.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.280
One thing I learned, actually,
is flour and oil don't mix.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.050
So in a restaurant
kitchen environment,

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.570
you have a lot of oil--
the friars, the sauteing,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.850
all this stuff going on.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.420
Even though you
have hoods, there's

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.180
always some of it in the air.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.030
So the bakers would
come in at night

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.196
and the flour is everywhere.

00:14:15.196 --> 00:14:17.865
Bakers, I mean, there's
flour everywhere, OK?

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.480
It's kind of like drywall dust.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.775
It gets everywhere.

00:14:24.775 --> 00:14:26.150
So we figured out,
you know what?

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.320
We really need to take
this somewhere else.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.350
So we moved into this-- OK.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:37.710
So it depends on how big
the eggplants are, right?

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.870
And the moisture of
the eggplant also.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.060
I'm just about done
with the charring.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.690
If I feel that maybe
they're cooked enough

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:50.890
and all I need to do is
feel them out a little bit,

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:56.070
I would then-- is
there plastic wrap?

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.280
Jeff, is there plastic wrap?

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.470
Well, I'll tell you.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.820
I would put it in a
bowl or in a container.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.580
Right?

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.900
Wrap it in plastic
and just let it sit.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.150
And like that, you're
cooking it a little bit more

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.410
and a little bit
longer, and you're also

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.610
steaming it up a little bit.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.939
The skin is easier to remove.

00:15:13.939 --> 00:15:16.230
You may have seen it on a
couple of the eggplants where

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.020
it was very easy.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:22.920
So that's one little tip.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.230
Where was I?

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.730
Yes?

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.600
Ah, you can.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.033
I haven't done it.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:35.510
AUDIENCE: I always set off mine.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.759
HANS ROECKENWAGNER: I'm sorry?

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:40.174
AUDIENCE: I always set off
my smoke alarm [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:40.174 --> 00:15:41.840
HANS ROECKENWAGNER:
Oh, the smoke alarm?

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.630
Well, the smoke alarm
comes from the smoke,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.662
not whether it's a
broiler or the stove top.

00:15:49.662 --> 00:15:51.529
You know these things?

00:15:51.529 --> 00:15:52.070
I don't know.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.160
They're $15, $20.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.020
It's so easy.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.750
If you're in an environment
that's very sensitive,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.130
and now more and
more of you are.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.080
You may want to
take one of these

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.882
and put it out on the
balcony and do it.

00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:08.340
And I'm sure there's
other uses you

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.876
can-- these come in really
handy, these little burners.

00:16:12.876 --> 00:16:14.250
But you can do it
on the broiler.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.458
Whether or not that's going
to help your smoke alarm,

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:19.500
I don't know.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.200
All right.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.140
So we got our eggplant.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.630
And once you have the
eggplant, obviously you

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.250
need more than this.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.610
OK.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.550
What you want to do is, you
want to get a cheesecloth,

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.630
a food grade cheesecloth.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.300
Well, they're all food
grade, more or less.

00:16:38.907 --> 00:16:40.240
And you put out the cheesecloth.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.680
You put it in the center.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.290
You pull up the ends,
and you literally

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:49.840
let it hang like a little bag
in the refrigerator overnight.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.240
And we do that actually in
commercial cooking a lot

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.780
because some things
just need time to drain.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.787
You could try to squeeze
it out, but you're

00:16:58.787 --> 00:17:00.620
going to squeeze out a
lot of the good also,

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.240
a lot of the meat.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.599
Whereas, you give it time,
it just does it by itself.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:10.319
Gravity works, I can tell you.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.430
And it's just much easier.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.225
For instance, what we do also--
have you ever had tomato water?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.530
You can do tomato
water like that

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.800
also, where you literally
take the tomatoes.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.190
You put it in the blender,
and you blend it really well.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.150
And you lie it in a bowl
with the cheesecloth,

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.450
and you put the tomatoes in.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.430
Pull up the ends and hang
it over another bowl.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.240
And the next day, you
have clear tomato water,

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.980
which is delicious.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.970
And you can use it as a
soup, just a little bit

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.610
of snipped chives.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.870
It's delicious.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:51.580
Tomato water.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.230
We used to do that a lot too.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.700
So back to the eggplant.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.210
All right.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.940
We have the eggplant.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.337
I'm going to just
chop this by hand.

00:18:01.337 --> 00:18:02.920
I don't need the
Robot Coupe for that.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.830
And to be honest, so
sometimes it depends.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.280
When you have eggplant caviar,
sometimes it's more chunky.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.150
Sometimes, it's more pureed.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.390
The one that you're
going to be tasting

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.620
has been pureed because
we made so much.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.930
But now these days,
I feel the less I

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.314
process my food, the better.

00:18:30.314 --> 00:18:32.230
Because I really want
the essence of the food.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.010
I'm kind of old school, OK?

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.450
As you can tell, no
tats, no earrings, no--

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:45.190
I dare you to find any
other chefs like that,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.890
unless they're 60 years old.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.150
So again, now these days
when I go to restaurants,

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.200
and I go out a lot.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.620
I go to New York a lot.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.260
My wife works in New York.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.530
And we go out a
lot, and very often,

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.060
at the end of the meal--
not even at the end.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.690
The next day, I say to my wife,
so what did we eat last night?

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.780
And if I can remember
a few things,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.210
and they're vividly in
my palate, in my brain,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.060
then I know I had a good meal.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.470
If I don't remember what I had?

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.310
Well, what did we have?

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.555
Oh yeah.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:17.170
We had chicken.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:17.711
What chicken?

00:19:17.711 --> 00:19:20.350
Well, you know, I don't know.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.640
That's not good enough for me.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.780
Right?

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.210
And the other thing is
I want to taste what I'm

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.750
being told I'm going to have.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.500
I don't want 50,000 ingredients
I can't tell one of them,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.410
you know?

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.150
So that's why I
actually like this.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.150
This is a Mediterranean dish.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.010
Every doctor I've
ever had told me

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.240
you should be on the
Mediterranean diet.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.290
OK, well, we'll do that today.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.300
So the reason I come to that
is because this eggplant,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.560
I can put it in the food
processor, which I prepped,

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.080
but I don't have it now.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.180
But actually, I want to show you
that we can just do it by hand,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:03.070
not overprocessed, still have
a little bit of texture, right?

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.610
And get the essence
of the eggplant.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.120
OK.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.460
A little bit more shallots.

00:20:21.322 --> 00:20:22.280
A little bit of garlic.

00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:29.820
A little bit of yogurt.

00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:34.880
This is just to
make it smoother.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.270
Salt, pepper.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.300
A little bit of vinegar.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.870
I like white vinegar here.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.858
And then just a little
bit of olive oil.

00:21:02.978 --> 00:21:12.070
And this is your fresh
eggplant caviar, or melanzane.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.559
So, again, how long
did that take us?

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:18.100
If I hadn't talked so much, it
would be done in five minutes,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.390
right?

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.815
OK.

00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:23.550
Actually, a couple of things
that I can put in here--

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.410
sometimes I do.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.690
Sometimes I don't.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.460
And that's what
cooking is about also.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.760
Cooking is about the moment.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.845
Where is it?

00:21:34.845 --> 00:21:36.390
Right here.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.000
I have some dill, fresh dill.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.880
I just put in a little
dill, just to give it

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.150
a little bit more, just another
dimension, a little added

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.380
flavor.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:55.720
It doesn't distract
from for my eggplant

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.060
but will only make it
better and enhance it.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.450
So that's really
it for my eggplant.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.220
Pretty straightforward, right?

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.940
And this, to be honest, you
can put on a piece of fish,

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.320
you can put on a piece of
meat, you can eat with chips,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.790
you can eat it on a sandwich.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.400
This is one of those
building blocks

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.310
that we're always talking about
in the kitchen, a building

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.930
block that really
builds your dish.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.330
It can be the dish
itself, or it can enhance

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.650
anything you put it with.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.270
Goes good with seafood.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.850
Goes good with chicken.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.530
I think it goes even
good with steak.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.580
Kadaifi is not only one
of those-- it's actually

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.480
a Middle Eastern thing.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:55.710
And kadaifi is shredded filo.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.950
Are you guys familiar
with filo dough?

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.180
Filo is super, super
thin dough that we

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.345
tried to make at one point, and
later on, I went to the factory

00:23:04.345 --> 00:23:05.970
to see how they make
it professionally.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.330
The guy said why are
you making it yourself?

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.050
It's really a lot of work.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.510
A little bit similar to a
strudel dough, actually.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.400
So it almost looks
like angel hair, right?

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.110
And it's a little
bit hard to find.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.300
You want to probably go to
a Middle Eastern store that

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.040
specializes in
ingredients like this.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.540
OK.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:28.550
We have our shrimp.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.407
We have some shrimp here.

00:23:32.407 --> 00:23:32.990
I have a mess.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:44.500
I actually never work in
a mess, but right now-- I

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.650
have the shrimp.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.000
I'm going to marinate
these just a little bit.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.670
I'm going to add some basil,
salt, pepper, olive oil.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.720
You may have noticed that
all the things that I do I

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.610
try to impart flavor
from the beginning.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.950
And sometimes, that may
be very basic ingredients,

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.150
and sometimes that may be more
complex ingredients like spices

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.030
and things like that.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:23.290
OK, a little bit of basil,
a little bit of olive oil,

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:23.930
salt, pepper.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.560
And you just want to
marinate these a little bit,

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:38.120
maybe a half an
hour before, just

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.110
to impart some basic flavor.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.140
You know one thing we forgot
on the eggplant caviar?

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.270
Lemon juice.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.700
Also very good.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.760
Sometimes, you want to use
lemon juice versus vinegar,

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.800
but you need a
little bit of acid,

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.470
and I'd like to get into that.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.590
So now should we put them in?

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:02.460
Or what do you think?

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:10.290
Now we're going to take
this kadaifi, right?

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:17.747
We'll lay it out, and then
we wrap our shrimp in it.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.010
That's it.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:40.680
So in the recipe from
my first book, actually,

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.590
we used to fry these.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.550
Since most of you
don't have fryers,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:53.410
and hopefully you don't have
a commercial kitchen at home,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.700
let me give you a little tip.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.040
So very often when you
talk about fried food,

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.920
there's a few reasons for
frying food-- A, it's delicious,

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.320
and B, you crisp it up, right?

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.090
You make it really
crisp, and that's

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:11.040
what we like in what I
think are the juxtapositions

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.780
between hot and cold, crisp
and soft, sweet and sour.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:23.210
And so in this, I may put a
little olive oil on the sheet

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.465
pan, place this on the
olive oil, and just spray

00:26:27.465 --> 00:26:32.740
it a little bit, the finer
the mist, the better.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.630
And then I just bake it.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.510
And you get a similar
flavor but less oil,

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.430
and you still get the crispness.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.510
So we actually have the
ones for you guys to try.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:44.910
We just put them in the oven.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.400
The kadaifi, you've
never heard of it?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:01.580
Yeah, we chefs have a
way of finding stuff.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:07.190
No, I think I was actually
exposed to it by one

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.370
of my cooks very
early on, who said,

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.870
hey, chef, have you
ever tried this?

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.660
And I said, hey, bring it over.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.540
Let's try it out.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.250
And when I came to the States,
you have to understand,

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.470
I came here in 1980.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:29.380
I feel so old been quoting dates
to you, but I kind of have to.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.570
So when I came over
to the States in 1983,

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.550
I came from Germany.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.940
I worked in France, and
Switzerland, and Germany.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:44.720
What we had was French food,
German food, Swiss food,

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:48.370
which is very similar to
German food, and Italian food.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:52.530
There were no Mexican
restaurants, Thai restaurants,

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.930
Chinese restaurants.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.600
I mean, there were maybe
a few here or there,

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.760
but I was never exposed to that.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.970
I came from a very
small, little town.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.780
OK, later on in
my apprenticeship

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.430
and when I worked in France
and in Switzerland, but again,

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.360
there was maybe one
Chinese restaurant

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.490
in a large metropolitan
area, or one Thai restaurant.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.325
And we weren't that exposed.

00:28:15.325 --> 00:28:20.540
But when I came here, my wife
took me to all these places.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.810
I said, wow, this is great.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:28.040
And there was a treasure trove
of ingredients, and techniques,

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.700
and flavors that I
discovered, that I then

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.750
started to blend in with
my German food and so

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:42.550
became part of this
California cuisine revolution

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:47.050
that's really based
on local ingredients.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.740
I know local is a
way overused word,

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.210
but I have bought produce
at that farmer's market

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.750
in Santa Monica for 30 years.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.650
Local to me is nothing new.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.900
I grew up on local, OK?

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.240
But what I would what
we would do then,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.350
that generation
of cooks-- and I'm

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:10.020
talking Wolfgang Puck,
and Michel Richard,

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.900
and Joachim Splichal,
and Matsuhisa-- these

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.480
are somewhat my contemporaries.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.060
They're people that did
all this at the same time I

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.160
was doing it.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.500
And so I had, obviously, a
very strong German background.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.360
And I would start
cooking my food

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.930
and then add a little cilantro,
and at a little soy sauce,

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.010
and add a little bit
of ginger, ingredients

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:40.230
that I wasn't that familiar
with but was exposed to

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.700
and started
incorporating in my food.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.300
And that's how I
developed my style.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.190
Because this is
a very-- now this

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:53.550
could be labeled as maybe a
touch of Asian, but definitely

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.880
Mediterranean, Middle Eastern.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.180
You know, it's not-- you can't
peg it just to one thing.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.290
So that's how my
original restaurant,

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.580
which was a very
high end restaurant

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.180
that I ran for 23 years.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.800
23 years, I ran a
high end restaurant

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.240
that was consistently listed as
one of the top 10 restaurants.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.880
I got the articles
to prove it to you.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.430
But then-- wow.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.200
Where am I?

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.250
Where do we want to go
with this conversation?

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.880
Do you want to
hear more of that?

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.430
Or do you want to hear
more of the bakery?

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.680
What are you interested in?

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.275
Nothing?

00:30:36.275 --> 00:30:37.290
AUDIENCE: Laugenbrot.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:38.090
HANS ROECKENWAGNER: I'm sorry?

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:39.090
AUDIENCE: Laugenbrot.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.560
HANS ROECKENWAGNER:
The Laugenbrot.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.060
Laugenbrot.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.970
Laugenbrot, the
gentleman over here

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:49.450
just referred to something that
in Germany we call laugenbrot.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.970
Really what it means is
it's a pretzel bread.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.890
We at the bakery obviously
do a lot with pretzels.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.600
We make what we call
German twister pretzels.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.650
We make pretzel rolls.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.360
We make pretzel bagels.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.770
We make pretzels sliders.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.070
We make pretzel croissants.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:08.310
We make pretzel chips.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.530
We tried to do everything
with pretzels we can.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.100
And that's our big thing.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.030
In the meantime, we have
grown so big in our bakery

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.180
that we now supply
Peet's Coffee, all

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.440
the Peet's Coffee in
the Southern California

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.600
area, about 32 stores.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.210
We're in all the Whole Foods,
about 33 stores and counting.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.090
We're in all the Gelson's.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:36.210
We supply about 400 to
500 accounts every day.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.800
We have 13 trucks on the road.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.430
We have about 125 employees
just at the bakery.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.550
That's the big business now.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.370
This is just fun.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.650
No, I'm really
proud of the bakery

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.233
and what we've done
with it, you know?

00:31:51.233 --> 00:31:55.300
And if it continues to be an
education to me every day--

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:55.805
every day.

00:31:55.805 --> 00:31:57.180
Because now, all
of a sudden, you

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:01.870
deal with logistics and
drivers and so many things.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:02.740
But it's fun.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.320
It's just-- I'm having a blast.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.990
But I still like to
cook, and I still

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.332
like to be part
of the restaurant.

00:32:12.332 --> 00:32:13.790
It's just that the
bakery right now

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:20.210
is taking a lot more time
out of my daily schedule.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.020
And another thing
that's taking-- I

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.440
have to brag about
this a little bit.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.510
On Sunday, I'm going
to do a bike ride

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:30.220
from Los Angeles to San Diego.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.770
And it's part of Chefs Ride.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:37.730
And it's three days,
100 miles each day,

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.860
and we're raising money for
Share Our Strength for the No

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.950
Kid Hungry Program.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.690
Since I'm in the
dude's room today,

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.945
he is a big advocate
for this as well.

00:32:50.945 --> 00:32:53.320
And he's going to meet
us in Santa Barbara.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.320
And we are raising bonds feed
the kids that can't afford.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.770
One out of five kids
in the US does not

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:06.575
know where their next meal
is going to come from.

00:33:06.575 --> 00:33:10.620
In my mind, that's
unconscionable.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.966
And a bunch of chefs
have gotten together.

00:33:13.966 --> 00:33:15.340
There's a group
on the East Coast

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.340
that just finished
their ride last night.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.090
There's a group on the West
Coast of notable chefs.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.120
We got together, and we said,
OK, we're going to raise funds.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.510
Each of us pledged to
raise at least $10,000.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:31.420
I was the first to raise
$10,000 on the West Coast.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.620
And altogether we're going
to raise some $400,000.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:41.240
Each dollar feeds four kids
with subsidies and everything.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.830
So if you feel like it,
putting in a couple of dollars

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.630
here and there, every
dollar feeds four kids.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.480
This doesn't go to me.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.400
I'm on a bike starting
Sunday morning,

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.894
riding my bike from Santa
Barbara to San Diego.

00:33:57.894 --> 00:33:59.060
So I'm really proud of that.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.140
I haven't done it yet,
but I've raised the money.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.556
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:02.556 --> 00:34:06.810
I've raised the money,
and that's what counts.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.550
So what else?

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.837
Tomatoes.

00:34:11.837 --> 00:34:13.545
So these are beautiful
heirloom tomatoes.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.179
We very often peel our tomatoes.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:22.739
Because I think by
doing that-- there's

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.980
a lot of different
thoughts on this.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.670
You're removing a
lot of the nutrients

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:29.400
that, generally,
for most vegetables,

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.090
are right under the skin.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.110
But since I am as
much about flavor

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:40.600
as I'm about the nutrients, it
makes it a lot more flavorful.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.659
So we have beautiful
heirloom tomatoes here.

00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:48.150
We peeled them.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.620
We seeded them,
and we diced them.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.595
OK?

00:34:52.595 --> 00:34:53.750
I've got some red ones.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.500
A little bit of
salt. I'm not going

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.760
to put the black pepper
right here, because I

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.490
don't want it to distract
from this beautiful color.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.690
So if I had finely
ground white pepper,

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.110
I would probably
use white pepper.

00:35:14.675 --> 00:35:15.830
A little bit of olive oil.

00:35:19.808 --> 00:35:22.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.730
HANS ROECKENWAGNER: Hot water.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:24.740
Put them in a colander.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.950
Hot water, count to
10, pull them out.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:28.860
OK.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.330
Thank you for asking.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.540
Tomato.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.200
Take the tomato, you make
a little cross in the top.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:34.960
OK?

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.760
Then, as I said, hot, boiling
water, not salted or flavored.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.000
Put it in there.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.010
Pull it out after 10 seconds.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:49.290
Then where you made the cross,
generally if the tomato's ripe,

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.260
you'll see that it's already
starting to peel off.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:52.770
OK?

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.850
And if you notice that
you can peel it off,

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:59.400
then you shock them in ice
water to stop the cooking.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.350
And then you peel your tomato.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.450
If the skin does
not I'm off yet,

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.840
you just put them back
in until you're ready.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.940
These peel very easily.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.920
The cardboard tomatoes that
you buy in the supermarket,

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.840
they'll be mush before
you can peel them.

00:36:17.276 --> 00:36:19.650
There's a few ingredients you
really don't want to skimp,

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.910
and a tomato is one of them.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:26.910
Why eat a tomato if you can't
get any flavor out of it?

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:35.600
So olive oil and just a little
bit of-- these are my cooks.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.224
They make it foolproof for me.

00:36:37.224 --> 00:36:38.640
We could go through
an earthquake.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.515
Nothing would happen.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.110
Anyone notice yesterday?

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.276
That was earthquake weather.

00:36:45.276 --> 00:36:49.430
I don't know about
you, I was worried.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.415
A little bit balsamic
vinegar, not too much.

00:36:52.415 --> 00:36:53.665
We just want it for flavoring.

00:36:59.406 --> 00:37:02.190
Maybe a little more olive oil.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:05.020
And this is where your
touch can come in.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.090
You can add dill.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.230
You can add basil.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.110
You can add a little ginger.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.480
You can add garlic.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.270
It's up to you.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:21.180
As if now by magic, the
cooked shrimp would appear,

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.090
I'd be happy.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.520
OK, so now we have
our eggplant caviar,

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.470
which gives us this beautiful,
earthy, smoky flavor, and also

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.220
creamy and soft.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.585
Then we have the tomatoes
with the acidity, the sweet,

00:37:36.585 --> 00:37:40.070
and the sour, and the
coolness of the tomato.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:45.830
And then we're going to have
our shrimp, firm, plump,

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.460
juicy shrimp, with
the crisp surrounding.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.430
I mean, you can't go wrong.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.090
So acidity.

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:56.830
Let's talk acidity a little bit.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.890
In my first cookbook, I devoted
a whole chapter do that.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:07.740
Because very often people at
home, they cook something.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.790
At the end, they taste it.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.540
And you know, it's
good, but it's just not

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.680
as good as at Hans's place.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.520
[CHUCKLING]

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.800
So I believe that almost
anything needs a balance.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.370
And that balance
very often comes

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:30.380
from adding a little bit of
acidity, whether or not that's

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.940
lemon juice, lime
juice, vinegar.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.340
All those things just add
a little bit of-- they

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:46.050
open up your palate, and they
make everything else shine.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:52.570
So next time you make a
salsa, obviously, lime juice.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.860
Right?

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.050
Or you make this eggplant
caviar, a little lemon juice

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:59.300
or a little bit of vinegar.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.380
Try this.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.530
Even in sauces, very often
when we make brown sauces,

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.570
at the end, we add a
teaspoon of balsamic vinegar

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.450
or just a little bit
of cherry vinegar.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:17.100
And it just opens up
the whole spectrum

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.100
of flavors to everything else.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.640
I am almost done.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.910
So any more questions?

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.320
God.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.910
I don't know.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:38.410
I know.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:43.050
This always gets me in
trouble, but there's really

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.120
nothing left.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.620
I hate to say it.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.600
There was-- well, there's me
again, old timer speaking.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.080
There was a place on
Wilshire Boulevard that was

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.630
called the Black Forest Inn.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.900
That was actually very good.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.850
And the guy, Norbert, a
good friend of mine, older.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:06.560
He was about, I don't know, 15
years, maybe, older than me.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.757
This guy was in the
kitchen for, I don't know,

00:40:10.757 --> 00:40:13.440
35 years, every single day.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.570
And then he sold the restaurant.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:18.750
This is so sad.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:19.710
He sold the restaurant.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.460
He died within half a year.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.750
It was the craziest thing.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.270
This guy needed his kitchen.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:28.360
But that was a very
good German restaurant.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.240
At that time, this was,
again, in the mid-90s.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.170
This almost broke
my heart, because I

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.060
remember him getting a review.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.870
I'm not going to say
who the reviewer was,

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:47.190
but this was a reviewer
who had published

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:51.430
Spanish Catalan and
French cookbooks himself

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.910
and authored many, many
articles on that region of food.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:59.139
And then he went out to
critique a German restaurant.

00:40:59.139 --> 00:41:00.430
He gave it a really bad review.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.900
And I felt really
bad about m you know?

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:10.940
I don't think he got
that kind of food.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.550
It's so funny.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.070
I just read an
article the other day

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:19.030
that we are actually more
influenced by German stuff

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:23.800
overall through our ancestors
than any other background,

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.930
I think.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:30.330
But I think what has happened
is it's being assimilated

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.330
into American culture.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:35.540
So there's a lot of
things that we now

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:41.080
consider American that
actually came from Germany.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.200
I mean, one of then is the
hamburger, the hot dog.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:52.414
It was a Viennese-- it was
a German hot dog that is,

00:41:52.414 --> 00:41:54.080
including the hamburger,
one of the most

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.930
popular foods in this country.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.700
Delicatessen, that's
a German thing.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:06.762
So there's a lot of things
that we consider now American.

00:42:06.762 --> 00:42:08.470
And that's great I
think that's all good.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.390
White asparagus.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.750
Thank you.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:19.640
We actually just
finished the season.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.940
So that's been actually--
I've been a big champion

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.070
of the white asparagus.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.570
And that's one of the
things that, again, I

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.595
did very early on.

00:42:29.595 --> 00:42:31.720
OK, I'm going to get back
to that in just a second.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.230
So let's plate this.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.850
Will you give me three of them?

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:39.420
So there's many different ways
I could plate this, right?

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:45.510
I'm making this up
as I go here, OK?

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:46.636
Like everything in life.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.330
I love plating food.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.610
Always have.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.990
For a while there, my
high end restaurant

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:13.760
was considered to be
serving architectural food.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.700
That was in the '80s.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.786
That was a hot thing.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.320
Since we eat with
our eyes as much

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:30.010
as we do with our stomachs,
you want to make it look nice.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:34.970
This is sort of a fancy--
fancier presentation.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.026
We could add some
dill if we wanted to.

00:43:38.026 --> 00:43:42.340
We could have some fun and
just play around with it.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.990
The reason we do
this sometimes is

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:47.120
because this shows that
it's light, actually.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.250
And it has air.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.020
It could almost fly away.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.660
So that's it.

00:43:58.358 --> 00:44:01.590
The only thing I may
add to this is just

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.420
a little bit of olive oil.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.600
And to be honest, why are
we adding the olive oil?

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.750
For flavor.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.700
That's why Americans
actually have had the hardest

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.760
time with olive oil.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.940
I've cooked in Italy.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.065
I've gone to some of the
best restaurants in Italy,

00:44:21.065 --> 00:44:23.455
and the first thing the
chef in the kitchen takes in

00:44:23.455 --> 00:44:26.840
is, this is my olive oil.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.450
Everyone has a
different olive oil.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.332
But every chef tell you,
this is my olive oil.

00:44:31.332 --> 00:44:33.290
And they use the olive
oil completely different

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:34.700
than we do.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.620
It's a flavoring agent.

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.330
Add a soup.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:40.000
You make a great,
great bean soup?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.310
You put a little olive
oil on top of it.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.410
And you get that
creaminess, and that flavor,

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.330
and that earthiness from
that particular olive oil,

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.540
whether or not it's
acidic or it's peppery.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.944
OK?

00:44:52.944 --> 00:44:54.360
So olive oil,
that's how we should

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.550
use oil olive, especially
extra virgin olive oil.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:01.400
Never ever, ever fry an
extra virgin olive oil.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.780
It's a waste of money.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.280
OK?

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.370
You're wasting your money.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:09.800
This is like gold, and that's
how you have to treat it.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.590
You drizzle it a little bit
on the end, on your salad,

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.315
on your grilled steak,
on your grilled fish.

00:45:16.315 --> 00:45:22.540
And it opens up, again,
that extra level of flavors.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.070
So back to asparagus.
why are we cutting?

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:26.792
Why are we cutting?

00:45:26.792 --> 00:45:28.000
Oh, we don't have enough, OK?

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.090
That's the price of popularity.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:34.455
[CHUCKLING]

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:38.070
White asparagus.

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:42.100
So I grew up in an area where
we grow white asparagus.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.940
And when I came here, I was
exposed to, believe it or not,

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.110
I had seen green
asparagus in Germany,

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:52.730
but it wasn't as common
as the white asparagus.

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:56.200
And the white asparagus
is a delicacy.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:01.740
Not that green is not, but
the white asparagus never

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.600
gets exposed to the sunlight.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.620
And so it gets
harvested very early

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.690
in the morning 4, or 5
o'clock, while it's still

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.240
not full sunshine.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:20.440
And, literally, there
are these mounds of dirt.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.020
So you have to imagine
this row of dirt.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.890
And the asparagus kind
of grows out on the side.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.980
And what they do is
when they harvest it,

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:33.900
they can see where the topsoil
breaks, where it cracks.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.950
And they can tell that's
where an asparagus is.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.616
Then they had these
little shovels, they

00:46:37.616 --> 00:46:42.870
and literally cut this asparagus
deep down, about this long,

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.150
out of the ground.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:51.350
So each stock is hand harvested.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.350
It's white.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:57.040
It's about this thick,
thicker than a thumb,

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.330
and it needs to be peeled.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:01.590
But when it's made
right, it's about one

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.330
of the best things
you'll ever have.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:07.520
And it's pure, and you
can tell the terroire,

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.540
the soil that it comes out,
you can tell the minerals.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.520
And, generally,
when we make it, we

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.800
make it as unchanged
as possible.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.430
We just add-- we
boil it in water

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:26.110
with a little salt, a
little lemon juice--

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:30.460
acidity-- and a little
bit butter at the top.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.850
Because then as you pull
it out of the water,

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.420
it coats it with
butter a little bit.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.330
It's so good.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.260
So when I came here, there was
no white asparagus here, right?

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.280
I said, oh, I gotta change this.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:48.280
And I started-- this was in '87.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.510
I started actually importing
my own white asparagus

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:53.070
from Germany.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.550
I had to get an
agricultural permit.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.360
I had to get an
importing license.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.780
I had to do all kinds of stuff
to bring in white asparagus.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.740
And the first three years
I did it, I lost money.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.700
But I believed in it.

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.590
And I believed
that eventually I'd

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:14.820
gain a couple more
customers every year,

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.700
and I'd create a following.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.140
Sometimes, these
things take time, OK?

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.950
And after about
five or six years,

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:24.140
I was the asparagus king.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.800
So I made it to pretzel
king and asparagus king.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:32.910
And I really started promoting
this white asparagus.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.680
And at first, I
only had Germans,

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.680
because Germans knew about it.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.300
So in that, it's a
very short season.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.700
It usually starts
when the weather

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.012
gets warmer, April, May.

00:48:45.012 --> 00:48:50.610
You have to we're in
Europe, so it's possible

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:53.860
not to get warm until June.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:58.160
So it also signals the
beginning of summer, you know?

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.390
Sidewalk cafe's open.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.760
People are outside.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.950
It's just a great
time, and that's

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.110
when that vegetable is at
the height of the season.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:12.320
It's about seven to eight weeks.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.340
And all the
restaurants in my area

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.740
change their menus
to white asparagus.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.550
And, generally, when
you go to a restaurant

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:22.965
and you look at the
menus, it says steak

00:49:22.965 --> 00:49:29.110
with beans, swordfish
with broccoli.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.110
But in the asparagus
season, it's

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:37.390
white asparagus with steak,
white asparagus with swordfish,

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:39.760
white asparagus with shrimp.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.890
The white asparagus is the star.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:47.450
So I believed in this, and
it really took me three years

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.660
and then it kind of took off.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.530
And now you're starting
to see it everywhere.

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.620
Well, not everywhere.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:57.220
Per pound, white
asparagus is more

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.110
expensive than
lobster, maybe even

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.550
twice the price of lobster.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:04.887
That gives you an
idea of why maybe it

00:50:04.887 --> 00:50:10.015
hasn't been as popular yet, and
it's also very hard to find.

00:50:10.015 --> 00:50:10.515
OK.

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:15.610
They've tried, and for
awhile I used to get it

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:17.840
from a farm in Indiana.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.030
Here, it needs a
very specific soil.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:24.340
It's like sandy and
a lot of moisture.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:30.990
So it's usually grown
alongside rivers or lakes

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:33.110
with very sandy soil.

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.700
They haven't been able
to-- you can get some

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:39.410
from South America, but
don't waste your money.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.430
They're no good.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:43.382
Do it right, like the tomato.

00:50:43.382 --> 00:50:45.340
You want to eat a tomato,
you eat a good tomato

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.298
or don't eat it at all.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.950
I grew up right
next to the border

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:54.300
of France and Switzerland.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.930
I would walk to France,
and I would take my bike

00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:58.555
to Switzerland.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:06.550
I didn't think of anything doing
that, but it was a great area.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.120
There was great food, because
we had influence from France

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.590
and we had influence
from Switzerland.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:16.010
And it's kind of considered
the Toscana of Germany

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:20.280
because it's the warmest region
of Germany-- so lots of foods,

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.120
lots of vegetables, wine.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.610
We have some good
wines in Germany also

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:29.712
that are becoming more
and more popular here now.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:33.570
OK.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.140
Yes?

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:43.865
Just a string, yeah.

00:51:43.865 --> 00:51:46.406
A little twine.

00:51:46.406 --> 00:51:48.280
If I had cheesecloth,
I would show it to you.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:48.700
But it's very simple.

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:49.840
It's like a napkin.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.800
You fold it out.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.740
Put out the napkin.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.570
Put it in the center.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:55.177
Pull it up.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.390
Tie it and just hang
it in the fridge.

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:00.860
And put a bowl below, obviously.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.970
Because it drips.

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:02.780
That's it.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.950
And you're removing a
lot of the moisture.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:09.200
That then allows you to add
some of the other-- the yogurt,

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.729
the olive oil, the lemon juice,
without it being too runny.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:20.010
Wow.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:23.060
So what else?

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:36.279 --> 00:52:37.570
HANS ROECKENWAGNER: We do both.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.550
We obviously have a lot
of different breads.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.760
So we do both.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:52.990
Make your own starter, yeah.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:56.940
Rapeseeds, it's actually
relatively easy.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.390
If ever you want a
tour of the bakery,

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:02.110
I'd be happy to give you a tour.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:09.590
It's great fun, seeing a bakery
in action with 70, 80 bakers.

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:10.760
It's a lot of fun.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.550
We still do a lot
of stuff by hand.

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.620
It's called mandrolic.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.160
There are certain machines
that-- like, for instance,

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.780
the kneading of the dough.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.140
It's so funny.

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:27.280
What I'm learning more and
more in the baking industry

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:32.110
is that a lot of these machines
that we use in the bakery

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:33.820
are super, super specific.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:37.300
They do one task
and one task only.

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.860
And that task they
try to mimic the hand

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:44.760
as much as possible--
the kneading,

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.660
the shaping, the cutting.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.390
All these things,
the machines try

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:54.030
to mimic what the
hand motion does.

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.030
So you will have a machine
that literally all it

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:59.970
does is it takes the dough
and it divides it balls.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.220
That's all it does.

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.570
But that's a $50,000 machine.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:10.360
And then the next machine
will shape it like your hand.

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.640
Because when you
have a ball of dough,

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:19.240
you're rounding it in your
hand to become a ball.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:23.450
And as you're doing that,
you're giving it elasticity

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:28.280
and you're giving it a
tension on the surface.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.320
And that's why
very often you see

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.890
the one roll is a
little bit bigger,

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:34.719
and the other one
is a little smaller,

00:54:34.719 --> 00:54:36.260
and the next one is
a little flatter.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.740
Well, not everyone
has the same hand.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.450
Not everyone has
the same tension.

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:45.030
And not everyone
has the same motion.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:50.660
In bakery, my big business
now, the biggest thing

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:56.800
that we face on a daily
basis, what is it?

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.700
Consistency!

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.280
It may sound so
simple, but I have

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.110
customers that rely
on that hamburger bun

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:12.800
to be 4 inches, not 5 inches,
not 3 inches-- four inches.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.470
Because if it's 3 inches,
the meat hangs over it.

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:18.010
If it's 5 inches, you
can't see the meat.

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:20.430
So consistency, for us
in the bakery business,

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:23.450
is the biggest deal.

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:26.340
I'm telling you, at
times it's even more

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.010
important than quality.

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.530
And actually, for
me as a chef, that

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:31.905
was a little bit
of a revelation.

00:55:31.905 --> 00:55:34.010
Because as a chef,
you are always

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:36.910
trying for that 100%, 100%.

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:38.640
That's all you do.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.629
You try to achieve
100% everything you do.

00:55:43.629 --> 00:55:45.503
But as a baker, you'd
be setting yourself up.

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:54.280
Because you cannot
deliver everyday 100%.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.470
So you have to actually
pare back just a little bit

00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:02.640
to be within that tolerance
of what you're making.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.170
Because your customer
accepts quality.

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.890
Quality is important.

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:08.780
Don't get me wrong.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.320
I mean, I'm still
driven by quality.

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:16.345
But in the bakery business,
consistency is huge, huge.

00:56:16.345 --> 00:56:17.720
I have a lot of
people out there.

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.970
Oh, I'll just open my bakery.

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:19.530
OK, great.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.220
Please, go ahead.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:25.340
And then next thing, they
start out with a great bread.

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:29.780
We have a lot of upcoming
hot bakers out there

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:32.640
that put out a great product.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.800
Five Loaves-- great product.

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:44.860
Now multiply that by--
we make between 35,000,

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:50.140
50,000 pieces every single
day-- every single day.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.240
So that's where the challenge
comes in when you grow

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:59.860
and when you start delivering to
other people from Santa Barbara

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:06.360
to San Diego-- my bike
ride this weekend.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.930
So that's our challenge
in the bakery business.

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:13.910
And I'm really excited about all
these young bakers coming up,

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:16.840
putting out really
good stuff, good stuff.

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.890
And that's good
for us, especially

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:20.490
us who are really into quality.

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:26.255
We're really into that
super the ultimate.

00:57:26.255 --> 00:57:26.880
And it's great.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.570
I love it.

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:36.110
But then making it times 30,
40, 50,000 is a different story.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:42.950
We make at the bakery
350 different products

00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:46.090
every day fresh.

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:48.840
Nothing is frozen.

00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.970
Made daily, delivered daily.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:55.260
I'm really proud of that.

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:56.260
You know what I think?

00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.220
Now looking back at
my career, you know,

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:02.390
I used to serve 20
people in my first run.

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:03.380
30 people.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.820
Later on, maybe
100 people a day.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.610
Dinner.

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:12.160
If you think about
that, I touch possibly

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.030
in the tens of thousands
of people's lives

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:17.780
every single day,
trying my product.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.800
That's awesome.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:20.430
I go to places.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.200
Sometimes, I'm
invited for dinner.

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.910
And they don't know.

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:25.392
And I see my bread on the table.

00:58:25.392 --> 00:58:25.975
I'm like, wow.

00:58:25.975 --> 00:58:26.680
That's great.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.720
You know?

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.844
That's fantastic.

00:58:29.844 --> 00:58:30.720
Right?

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.430
So I'm having a much bigger
impact with that than I ever

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:36.450
had with my restaurants.

00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:42.010
I take nothing away from what
I have done in my restaurants.

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:44.340
I'm super proud of it.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:48.260
But you know, it's
tough out there.

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:51.780
I see all these
young guys really,

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.720
really working very
hard and putting

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.652
a lot of good--
they were wearing

00:58:55.652 --> 00:58:57.360
their heart of their
sleeves, and they're

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.260
putting it out there.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.718
And we are the
benefactors of that.

00:59:02.912 --> 00:59:03.412
Yes?

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:14.490
I had one of my friends
place an ad in the paper.

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:16.860
But that doesn't work anymore.

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.360
He was one of my
best bakers ever.

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:23.010
He helped set us
up, and he moved on.

00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:27.300
He became a baking instructor,
actually, up north.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.930
But we've had a lot of
good bakers and still do.

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:32.325
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.720
HANS ROECKENWAGNER: No,
actually lots of people.

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:40.050
But then comes the, well,
what about the visa?

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:41.050
What about this?

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.200
What about that?

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.490
And I've brought
over a lot of people,

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:46.720
and it didn't work out
after weak, you know?

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.050
It's just culture shock,
different circumstances,

00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:51.890
different situations.

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:52.660
It's not so easy.

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:58.760
Well, I think that's it.

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.600
I've talked myself out.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.100
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.200
Thank you.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.350
Come on over.
