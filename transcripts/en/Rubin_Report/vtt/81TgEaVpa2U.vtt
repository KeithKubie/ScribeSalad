1
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.100
All right.
People.
We are alive on the youtube.
We're live streaming.

2
00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:14.030
We lost our live streaming capabilities a couple of days ago.
We don't know why.

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.160
I don't have an email address of anyone at youtube.

4
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:17.750
I look forward to getting one one day.
Uh,

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.820
but apparently we're live right now and I'm with,
Whoa,
Mr Twitter,
Mr Twitter.

6
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:23.631
That's what I just tweet out.

7
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:26.750
I called him mister Twitter after what happened on Rogan.
Ya'll.
Yeah,
yeah.

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.150
I'm calling you missed your Twitter Tim pool.
It was crazy for me after,
you know,

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.020
five,
I'm assuming everybody knows that I was on with Jack and Joe and for me,

10
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:38.900
I'm just having a conversation,
like the cameras don't exist.

11
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:41.480
I'm sitting here listening with the to say I'm trying to be respectful and make

12
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:44.180
sure they finish their point,
not let them go too far with it.

13
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:47.120
Because there are a few times where I was like,
you can't say you're lying.

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.890
But after the fact,
all these videos were like Tim pool destroys,
you know?

15
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.650
And I'm like,
I didn't feel like I was destroying them.

16
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:56.540
I just felt like we're having a conversation,
you know?
Yeah,

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.050
I felt like they were listening.
At least Jack was Tim.
This is the Internet.
Yeah.

18
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.900
If you even engage in a remotely decent conversation with someone,

19
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:06.500
someone gets that is,
hey Ruben just destroyed temple.

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.460
There will be several districts here.
Okay.
So you were on with,
uh,

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.480
with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey,
who most people know,

22
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:13.820
and he was on a rogue in about a month ago.

23
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:16.010
He's been in Sam Harris' podcast and a bunch of others.

24
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.960
He agreed to do this show two years ago.

25
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:21.110
I've emailed him a zillion times and I tweet at,
yeah,
I saw it.
Yep.
Oh,

26
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.540
they're trying to clear the schedule and I,
he is welcome.

27
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.310
He would've been welcome here today and all that.
Uh,

28
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.330
you were also on with Vijaya got a yeah.
Uh,

29
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.070
who is from legal and trust and safety at Twitter.

30
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:34.130
So it was the two of them Rogan sort of moderating it.

31
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:36.620
And you're kind of brought in,
well,

32
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:41.000
the brought in as the muscle basically to,
I mean,
you can kind of sit back and,

33
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.610
and you to just go to town on that checkpoint.
His lawyer.
Yeah.
You know,
and,

34
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:47.300
and Joe,
Barbara got a bunch of good points but I think my favorite meme,
which,

35
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.490
which described what happened was it's,

36
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:53.210
it shows that Ash Ketchum and Gary from Pokemon with two Pokemon underneath with

37
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:55.130
my name and Vaginas name under it.

38
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:59.270
Like they brought us both in to like get to the nitty gritty cause I,
you know,

39
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.060
here's the thing,
uh,
in the first interview that Joe did,

40
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.890
Joe didn't know a lot and uh,
neither did jack.
Uh,
and I think,

41
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:10.610
I think it's fair to point out jack was running a ton of companies and I respect

42
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:12.500
him for going on at numerous times,

43
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
but I think it's important to point out most of the questions I asked he defer

44
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.490
to,
you know,
trust and safety.
Yeah.
So,
all right,

45
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.820
so let's just do a whole bunch of stuff here.
So I want to ask you,

46
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.280
the first thing that I'm going to ask you is just how did this whole freaking

47
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:26.630
thing come together?
Cause I was,

48
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.200
I was buying dog food yesterday and then I suddenly saw a pop up and I was like,

49
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:32.040
how the hell is this happening?
Yeah,
no,

50
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.880
I knew you were coming in here and I had no idea that it was going on.

51
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:38.420
So I want to ask you that,
but I just want to say one thing quick off the bat,

52
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.890
which is what you just said there,

53
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:43.870
hits it on the head that it will all I saw out of the two of them,
uh,

54
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.030
but mostly Jack and I don't mean this to attack him or her personally.

55
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.940
I mean as professionals doing the job they doing at Twitter.

56
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.040
If you're going to go on shows and talk about these things,

57
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.550
that all it was was endless kicking the can down the road that you know,

58
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.490
Harry Truman,
the buck stops here.
I mean there's no,

59
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.300
there's no bucket and there is no stop.
It's like,
we'll look into it.

60
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.450
Oh that happened.
We're not sure about that.
We'll talk about it with this person.

61
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.550
There's just,
it's just endless.

62
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.700
Two important things came out of that conversation regardless of anything else

63
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:14.560
was when,
uh,
in two different instances I pointed out if your rule,
so,

64
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:18.340
so the way I described it on Twitter as to a conservative mis-gendering,

65
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.031
someone would be,

66
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.390
if they are biologically male and you called them a female pronoun and to

67
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.650
progressive's it's in the,
it's the inverse.

68
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:26.220
If a trans woman wants use the Pronoun,
I pointed that out.

69
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.590
One of those is factually correct.
We should make a point about that.
Right,
right,

70
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.160
right,
right,
right.
Yeah.

71
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.440
One of them is actually on Wikipedia consensus for the rest of society that it

72
00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:36.030
is factually true.
But the,

73
00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:38.950
the point I want to make is not whether or not your ideology ideology is correct

74
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:41.590
or not correct,
but that you do enforce an ideological rule.

75
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.600
And she said thank you for the feedback and then Joe and which,
which she,
she,

76
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.240
but then gentleman at another point and then her response was,

77
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:52.070
I think that's absolutely correct.
Show.
So I'm,

78
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.210
I'm glad that they admitted they do have a bias.

79
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.500
And they were a few points where I saw jack have a look on his face.

80
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.860
So the first thing was when they were pointing out their rules,

81
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.510
I interjected by saying,
no,
no,
no,
you're,

82
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.940
you actually have a rule that's biased against conservatives.

83
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.340
And Jack had this look where it was like,
what,
what rule?

84
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.710
Like he didn't realize it.
He didn't,
he didn't.
I'm like,

85
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.570
you realize one of the top podcasts in the world,

86
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.900
Ben Shapiro's show and Ben Shapiro disagrees with you to tens of millions or

87
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:23.570
more.
They don't agree with that rule.
It makes no sense to them.
And then I,

88
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.020
you know,
I tried to make a point about,
uh,
I looked it up,

89
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:28.120
it's called body integrity identity disorder.

90
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.950
Is there people who like amputate body parts?
I'm not trying to equate the two,

91
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:36.490
but to point out there are other similar syndromes that aren't protected under

92
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:40.360
the rules.
So they do have the specific predicted class based on an ideology.

93
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.070
So there was a ton of moments like that where it seemed like you were laying out

94
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.370
some pretty clear things that again,
they couldn't,

95
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.250
they sort of were kind of evasive or we don't know where we'll look into it,

96
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:54.220
right?
Like it's a lot of,
we'll look into it and it's like,
all right,

97
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:57.220
we know you're not really gonna look into it because this,
it's not as if this,

98
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.250
it's not as if Tim pool as much as I respect to him pull just magically came up

99
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:03.460
with all this stuff yesterday,
right?
Like this stuff's been out there for awhile.

100
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.180
It looks like the tweet I referenced has gone.
Uh,
I,
so I,

101
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:11.950
I specifically prepared this,
I don't want to call it a stunt,
but I was like,

102
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:13.330
I want to be able to pull this up on cue.

103
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:17.110
So I set up a bitly link to this tweet in question from September.

104
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.770
That was doxing.
Law enforcement never taken down and people were tweeting,
Jack,

105
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:23.800
what's up with this?
There's articles written about how it's never come down.

106
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.580
And what they said is that they took down some of the people that linked to the

107
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:30.720
tweet or something,
but no,
no.
She just said,
oh,
I don't know.
I don't,
you know,
we,

108
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.290
we,
we make mistakes and,
and you know,
uh,
I will say this too,
after the show,

109
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.760
Jack said my two analogies about sand and snow were really,
really important.

110
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.531
And he's going to,

111
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:44.980
he understands what I signed by this and that references if they keep making

112
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:45.814
mistakes.

113
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.850
The analogy I always use is how many grains of sand until you have a heap.

114
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.410
The heat being biased against conservatives and the snowflake references
Twitter.

115
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.530
Thanks.
Look,
we're just one company.
We're making mistakes.

116
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.690
They don't themselves for the fact that all of these other companies are doing

117
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.840
the same thing.
It's an avalanche.
And they're,
they're one of the snowflakes.

118
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.320
The only way you change this is when the individuals and the company is take

119
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.380
responsibility for what's happening.
Do you,
all right,
so hold on.

120
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.600
I don't want to lose the question about how the hell this thing came to be.

121
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.750
It's funny to run off that road at this point yet.

122
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.430
Do you think they actually care?
Jack Link's partly silk.
So,

123
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.190
all right,
well you were the one sitting across from you,
so I wanna know.

124
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.490
I want to know your thoughts on that.
But I partly was just like,

125
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.350
these guys know exactly what they're doing.

126
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:30.770
We know that conservatives get banned and shadow banned and unfollowed and all

127
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:32.930
these things all,
and it's not just conservatives by the way,

128
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.460
cause it's people like [inaudible] is not a conservative.

129
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.840
Right,
right,
exactly.
Yeah.
So,
but that basically they go on these shows,

130
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:44.930
even though it was sort of impressive that the legal person showed up that

131
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.540
they're just going on just again to kick the can down the road.

132
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.750
Cause he gives a glimmer of hope for people to be like,
see they care.

133
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.270
They're kind of doing their thing,
even though we know nothing's going to change.

134
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:56.690
Right.
And that's exactly how I ended it.
I'm like,
here I am sitting here,
Jack,

135
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:58.640
you're justifying why everything you're doing is right.

136
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.250
I'm trying to justify what you're doing is wrong.
And that's the end.

137
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.790
That's nothing's going to change.
And so,
so for me,
I'm looking at the,
the,
the,

138
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.590
the opening gateway,
the,
the bridge to the nightmare dystopia.

139
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.140
When I see conservatives being banned from bank accounts from Patriot is one

140
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:19.400
thing,
but that paypal another than chase actually has people done mastercard,

141
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.830
you know,
according to Patriot,
mastercard actually wanting to get Robert,

142
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.100
I grew up,
I believe Robert Spencer and I'm like,
this is happening.

143
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.150
You realize that,
right?

144
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:30.590
Real China's doing it on a grand scale and we're watching the,
the start of it,

145
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.880
the avalanche is kicking off.
And these companies like,
I don't want to,
you know,

146
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.370
none of the other companies will showed up,
but Twitter is going,
we're doing,

147
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:41.900
we're doing our best.
Jack outlined this vision of a future to me and he was,

148
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.810
and I'm like,
you're describing the opposite direction to where you're going.

149
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:47.420
He's,
you know,
like,
uh,
I can remember exactly what I'm saying,

150
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:49.280
but he was talking about open,
you know,

151
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:52.850
everyone can speak and all these things and just laying out the four principles

152
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:54.650
of what makes healthy conversation.
And I'm like,

153
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:57.290
you realize you're actually walking away from what you're describing.

154
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.140
And you know,
I will say this too.
Um,

155
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.250
ultimately what I feel like was kind of happening is,

156
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.760
is that you tell utilitarian verses deontological debate,
which a,

157
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.150
for those who aren't familiar,
Jack was convinced that he must do the most good.

158
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.150
That means some,
he's looking at the collective and saying,

159
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:17.340
how can I make sure that 90% out of a,
you know,

160
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.720
a hundred people are sharing their thoughts and I look at this and say,

161
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.950
the individual needs to be allowed to speak.
So out of out of 100 people,

162
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:27.590
I'm like,
each individual needs to be able to speak and we can't do,

163
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.500
we can't protect everybody.
And that's why I asked Jack when he said,

164
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:33.140
we did research and that's why we implemented this trans rule.
I said,

165
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.320
why did you stop there?
What?
He said he didn't.
And I'm like,
but look,

166
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.230
if you're going to implement the rule to protect one class of people,

167
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.440
we can look at suicide rates for dentists.
We can look at suicide rates.

168
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.580
Where police,
are you going to make police a protected class or,

169
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.070
or if you're saying,
okay,
well you can't Miss Gender Trans people,

170
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:53.040
well can you call Jews Nazis?
As I got called a Nazi by several guards,

171
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.080
offensive I think to verified people today and I,
I tweeted,
yeah,

172
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.940
and I don't care.
I mean,
not like that's the fun bit.
Right.

173
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.710
So I get it because if you're,

174
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:05.250
if you're basically a functioning human being that is in a hysterical nutbag

175
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.390
right.
Exact,
right.
Like basically I don't run around reporting everybody,

176
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:13.140
I call it out occasionally and I'm only doing it to show the double standard,

177
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:17.100
not to get these people kicked off.
And it's an action.
Yeah.
To just say you are,

178
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.480
you look what you guys are doing.

179
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.080
I mean by any estimation where they laid out yesterday in terms of targeted

180
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:22.914
harassment,

181
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.800
that that'll get you booted and the whole Milo thing and we can get into that.

182
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.221
Well,

183
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:29.520
these people that today there were two verified people calling us fascists and

184
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:33.270
Nazi's in a bunch of others and that then that harassment escalates to extreme

185
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:34.130
degrees.
Yeah.

186
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.500
And there are certain personalities that I don't want to name that have made

187
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.410
fake videos and gotten people banned because of it.
Yeah.

188
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.270
So the challenge and calling out the specifics is that they want attention.

189
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.720
Yeah.
And then when you named them,
they point the finger,

190
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.550
I have no problem calling out like organizations,

191
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.010
like I mentioned the SPLC and hope not hate and I'm doing it again.

192
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.210
I know that's going to lead to,
but uh,
you mean the southern poverty hates it,

193
00:09:57.211 --> 00:10:00.710
right?
Oh,
whatever you want to call it.
Yeah,
I'll try.
I'll try to.

194
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.430
It's SPHC is that now?
I don't,
I'm,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna try and be,

195
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.740
I'll call them out for the areas,
but I won't do,

196
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.210
I won't do ride like calling insulted their name or anything.
Yeah,
no,

197
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.460
they're horrible.
I think they're bad.
Simple.
But I will say this,

198
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.070
the only thing I can really say in terms of my personal interaction with them is

199
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:21.000
that they brought this article that claimed I was attending a Holocaust deniers

200
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:25.200
conference in Iran and they used a holocaust denying conspiracy theory website

201
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:28.710
to prove it.
If that's their standard of proof,
that's nightmarish,

202
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.500
especially when they are consulting certain groups or they're involved with

203
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.440
change the terms that org which wants to,
you know,
do all these things.

204
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.100
They did retract that though and they apologized and called me an individual on

205
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:42.330
the left.
Yeah.
So,
okay.
There you go.
Right.
Well that's all I show much there.

206
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:46.230
I mean,
module where I had to sue them to get them off his anti Muslim extreme.

207
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:49.890
Well what he did,
but Muslim,
but here's the,
here's the important thing.

208
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.130
They settled based on a strongly worded letter.

209
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.900
I don't believe it ever actually got to the point where a suit was filed.
So,
uh,

210
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.190
they,
they recognized,
they overstepped their boundaries.

211
00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:01.050
In my case and Magic's case,

212
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.240
there are a lot of people that don't get that same that you know,
uh,
I,
I'm,

213
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.140
I'm not as big as Magid or,
or even you,

214
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:09.660
but I'm fortunate enough to at least have some,
you know,

215
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:12.610
notoriety that provides me with protection like t to,

216
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.080
to try and call me right is the most insane thing ever.

217
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.370
And then the weird thing is it's white progressives doing it.
Like my,

218
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:24.090
my mixed race family who had racist sexually attack us and the white

219
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.630
progressives who are well off are the ones who are pointing the finger at me.

220
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:29.910
It's like you people are racist.
That's how I can say,

221
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.540
well that that is the new pernicious racism of the left.
But okay,

222
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:36.330
let's pause for just [inaudible] we're going,
let's get back to the beginning.

223
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:39.150
How the hell did this thing even happen?
Because when I saw it,

224
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:43.170
I'm sitting in the parking lot at Petco and I was like well cause cause it's

225
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:45.480
like if you,
if they were trying to protect their asses,

226
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.600
it's like the last person you'd want to sit in there with is you.

227
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:49.590
Because if you would've said to me,

228
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:54.010
who's the right guy to take them down a notch,
I would've said you,

229
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:55.770
there might've been a couple of other guys,
but I'm,

230
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.470
you'd be right in the center of the right person that gets all of this.

231
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.880
I feel lucky,
but who walk on?
How the hell did this?
It's a long,

232
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.810
it's a decently,
it's not super long,
but,
so here's what happens.
Uh,

233
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.050
Joe Rogan does the video with pot,
with Jack Dorsey.
They get slammed.
Yeah.

234
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.400
I make a video about it saying like,
I watched the podcast,

235
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:19.420
I was excited at first it quickly got boring and then I kind of just trailed off

236
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:22.510
and felt like Joe wasn't actually getting into anything.
And you know,

237
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.900
we're better off for him doing the interview by I'm tiny degree.

238
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.840
But ultimately I don't think we gained anything from it.
Uh,

239
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.200
basically because he didn't get into the nitty gritty.
Yeah,
it was really it.

240
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.010
He goes yo by any,
no,
no,
but he knows this,
right?
It was,

241
00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:37.960
it was a really surface level regurgitation of what we had already heard a

242
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:38.794
million times.

243
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.870
And so when Joe responded to the complaints,
yeah,

244
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.990
I made a followup video where I was like,
I respect you for doing this.

245
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.450
Joe Recognizes he's gonna,
you know,
I criticize a bunch.

246
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.530
I before the video I made went live because this was just like I make rent

247
00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:56.680
videos on my second channel that they do way better than my more like structured

248
00:12:56.681 --> 00:12:58.600
videos.
But,
uh,
before we even went live,

249
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.470
I got notification that Joe Rogan or somebody's fully with him had copyright

250
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.550
flagged it and I was like,
wait,
Whoa,
Whoa,
hold on.
This is a credit.

251
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:10.170
This is fair use.
So fortunately,
uh,

252
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.810
several months ago Joe had followed me on Twitter and apologize for,
you know,

253
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:17.470
he canceled on me in the past and he was just like,
I feel bad about it and it's,

254
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:20.680
it's,
it's a long time ago.
So now,
now he's following me.

255
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.100
I just tweeted at him and I said,
hey,
would you mind releasing this?

256
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:27.480
It's fair use.
I was criticizing your podcast.
And he's like,
yeah,

257
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:28.840
send me the link and we'll go over it.

258
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.450
I sent him the link and then he responds right away with like,
hey man,

259
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:33.700
your criticisms were actually really good.
Can I call you right now?

260
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.280
And I was like,
sure,
great.

261
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.940
And then he calls me and then he kinda just explained like he felt really bad

262
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.140
that he didn't do a good enough job.

263
00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:42.700
He didn't realize how important these issues work.

264
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:45.340
He just thought he was meeting with like a tech CEO and he didn't really follow

265
00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:48.640
a lot of this stuff.
And then at the end of the,
that near the end of the call,

266
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:51.310
we talked for a while.
He goes,
you know,
I owe you coming out on the show man,

267
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:53.860
so I'll bring you out sometime.
I'm like,
yeah,
sure.
Have a good day.

268
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.230
Five hours later,
whatever.

269
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:58.750
I'm looking at my shorts playing video games like end of the day,

270
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:01.840
but to go to bed and my phone rings and it's Joe and he goes,

271
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.450
you want to come on the show on Friday?
And I'm like,

272
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:07.330
that's like I got to fly tomorrow.
That's like one day.
He's like,
yeah.

273
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.560
And I'm like,
okay.
We go.
I go on the show,
everybody saw it.
It was great.

274
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.230
And then immediately after the show,
he's like,

275
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.950
he calls me up right when I get back to my hotel and he says,

276
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.380
how would you like to come on and do this thing?

277
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.660
Don't tell anybody and it'll be you,
me,
Jack,
and he's going to bring on somebody.

278
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.040
And he says,
I'm trying to confirm it.

279
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:30.010
So I think the main reason he didn't want to promote it was he was concerned

280
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:31.960
that like,
it's hard to confirm.
It's,

281
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:35.020
it's especially with someone as busy as Jacquez.
So he was like,
I want to make,

282
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.630
I don't want to hype it up.
I want to make sure we actually do it.

283
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.520
Otherwise everyone's gonna get angry when we cancel.

284
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.620
So then I didn't know what was gonna happen.

285
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.360
And it wasn't until like a few days ago where he,
uh,
not,
not to be it.
Maybe,

286
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.980
maybe like a week ago,
they were like,
we're good to go.

287
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:52.300
We're going to fly you out.
And he was like,
I don't think there was anything.

288
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.020
I expressly like don't promote it,
but just Joe was like,
I'm going to,

289
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.160
I'm going to take care of that.
I'm like,
all right.

290
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.280
So I just didn't say anything cause I don't know if was gonna happen.
Right.

291
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:04.130
So that's why I think it's so,
it's so interesting cause hey,

292
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:06.380
first off I give Joe Credit for going,
okay,

293
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:08.240
this isn't my area of expertise per se.

294
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:11.300
So let me bring in somebody that is so that there's a little bit of that back

295
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:14.420
and forth,
but be,
it partly brings me back to what I said before,

296
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:17.500
which is once they had heard,
I don't know when they found out that they,

297
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.390
that you know,
Jack and a and that she backed in,

298
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:22.040
apparently he pitched to them in advance.
Okay.

299
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:24.590
So a couple of let's say a couple of days before.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Like a month.
Okay.

300
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.360
So a month.
So they don't the lead time,

301
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:29.630
no way that this Tim pool guy is going to be the one sitting across from them.

302
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.080
That it seems to me that the only reason that they would agree to do it because

303
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:35.360
they had to assume it was going to go exactly as it went,

304
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.330
not well for them now is that it would,

305
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.420
the only reason you do it is if it's just to kick the can down the road.

306
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.170
That it's just,
you know what I mean?
It's not for justification.
Yeah.
I mean,

307
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:48.910
you could look at a vagina,
had a laptop with a bunch of research and,
and I,

308
00:15:48.911 --> 00:15:51.500
and I,
I there,
there were a couple instances where I said,
oh,

309
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:53.900
she makes a good point.
Right?
There are some people she mentioned,

310
00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:57.380
this is why we banned them.
And in some cases,
you know,
I bought up,

311
00:15:57.381 --> 00:15:59.900
sorry of a cod.
I didn't bring him.
I bought Carl Benjamin.

312
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:02.540
I didn't bring him up to defend them because I know he tweeted things that it's

313
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:07.340
like,
dude,
you really pushed buttons but then inadvertently find out.

314
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.940
One of them was a very clearly pointing at their,

315
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.790
they're biased rule set and not actually targeting anybody in any way.

316
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.240
In which case they did ended up,
you know,
false striking him at least one time.

317
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.970
But they did,
they did their research.
A few people.

318
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.890
But ultimately I think one point we got out of that was we're just going to

319
00:16:23.891 --> 00:16:26.390
trust you.
Like you haven't presented this evidence to anybody.

320
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:28.930
You're saying it now.
But there is an important detail there that,

321
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:31.880
that I want to stress too is that everything she said about why they banned

322
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:33.260
people,
those are statements of fact.

323
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.390
And if those aren't real and they can't prove it,

324
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:36.560
they can be sued for defamation.

325
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.640
So anybody who's now been bounded by Twitter that she mentioned would have their

326
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:43.410
lawyers going back.
Well,
I'm not saying do anything,
I'm just saying if it,

327
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.490
cause I,
Alex Texted Joe Apparently said that's not true.
Okay,
great.
Well,

328
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:49.430
they made a statement to fact on his show as to why they took action against you

329
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:54.050
saying,
Alex Jones did x.
If that's not true,
well now you can file your complaint.

330
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.120
Yeah,
see that's what I think the reason I'm so it's not even frustrated.

331
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:00.740
I'm actually not frustrated by it.

332
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:05.210
I'm so like sort of blood Zay about it is because it's like I,
you know,

333
00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:06.290
I had Jack Conti in here,

334
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:10.550
the Patriot CEO like two years ago and there he was sitting with me telling me,

335
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:10.791
you know,

336
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:14.870
we'll never people whispering sweet nothings in your or to convince you.
Right.

337
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:15.920
And it'll only,

338
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.090
we'll only boot people because of manifest observable behavior [inaudible] here,

339
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.930
mob mob and you can't make this stuff up.
And,
and that's sort of what I,

340
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:27.860
that was the feeling that I got from this Jack,
Jack Dorsey,
that it's just like,

341
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.220
we'll just say things and it kind of keeps moving things along.

342
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.090
Here's what I think.
And again,
I'm not,
I'm really not impugning him as a person.

343
00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:37.700
I,
I,
I'll take your word for it.
Well,
no.
So,

344
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:42.680
so there are some conservatives who are not super high,

345
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:45.470
like high profile,
whatever that um,

346
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.890
I've met in the past and someone told me a long time ago,
not,
not super long ago,

347
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.790
relatively recently,
within the past few months,

348
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.740
that Jack's actually not a bad guy.

349
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.950
It's the people around him who are telling these things and he's not exposed to

350
00:17:55.951 --> 00:18:00.840
herd some insiders though.
Exactly.
And so what ends up happening is when I said,

351
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.050
your rule is biased against conservatives from the get go,

352
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.810
Jack genuinely looked confused and he said,
wait,
wait,
wait,
what rule?

353
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.430
And then I do explain it to them,

354
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:10.530
but then maybe he shouldn't be the CEO of the company.

355
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:15.720
I mean not to be [inaudible] he's the CEO of several companies.
Is that correct?

356
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.050
I believe so,
yeah.
I mean you've got cash app,
square,
Twitter,

357
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.043
I don't know what else.
All right.

358
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.620
So let's just say Twitter is enough of a job in and of itself.

359
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.740
Like if you don't know the rules,
like what are you doing?
Right,
right.

360
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.090
Takes pleasure.

361
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.600
It's not that he didn't know the rules and he didn't because he talked about the

362
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:31.680
research they did for that role.

363
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.210
It's that he didn't realize more than 50 about 50% of this country.
Actually,

364
00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:38.910
it's way more than that.
Don't agree with that ideological view.

365
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.990
And the reason I say more than that is because moderate liberals,
you know,

366
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:47.070
like I talked to my mom and my mom is a lifelong liberal and she's,

367
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.030
she's a progressive.

368
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.810
She agrees with so much of what the modern left today agrees with and the new

369
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:54.930
progressives and,
but she said,
oh,
I don't know if you know,

370
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.200
trans women should be competing against biological women.
And I said,
Whoa,

371
00:18:58.201 --> 00:19:01.350
hold your horses.
Their mom.
That's a conservative,
you know?
Uh,

372
00:19:01.351 --> 00:19:04.230
and so if my mom a liberal is still questioning that,

373
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.010
then Twitter's very clearly taking a very small minority position on that.

374
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:12.000
If you've got a feminist like Megan Murphy who is clearly on the left being

375
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:13.710
banned because she doesn't want to adhere to this,

376
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:18.150
it's not even a left versus right issue.
You've got moderate liberals,
feminists,

377
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.970
conservatives all saying,
we'll hold on on this issue,

378
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.990
but Twitter is clearly adopted a very ideological rule.
And Jack,

379
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:27.420
I don't think anyone's ever told Jack that.
And here's the thing,

380
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.930
when really don't think that though,
I don't,
I'm with you on all this.
But so he,

381
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:35.520
so he lives in some level of a bubble.
But of course it's very obvious stuff.

382
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:36.360
I mean what you just laid out,

383
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:38.790
I mean I've been talking about this for have you had heavy use now?

384
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:39.780
You know what I mean?
It's not like,

385
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.500
it's not like the Internet hasn't been like a buzz about this type of

386
00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:47.550
conversation,
but no one's got to him.
I haven't seen anyone actually break down.

387
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.330
They say,
oh,
but hate speech.
That's not fair.
They say things like that.

388
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:52.200
And I'm like,
no,
no,
no.
Hold on.

389
00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:55.050
There's a very clear ideological divide between this rule and everything else.

390
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.940
When it comes to hate speech,

391
00:19:56.941 --> 00:20:01.470
very obviously conservatives are Gung Ho on free speech and the menu on the left

392
00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:02.304
aren't,

393
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.850
but that's still different because it's like we just don't want you to harass

394
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:08.880
people and say mean things and it's kind of been normalized because all the

395
00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:13.770
platforms do it.
But the mis-gendering thing is so specific.
Uh,
and,
and you know,

396
00:20:13.771 --> 00:20:16.420
I'll say this too,
I really hate using,
like I,

397
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.100
they kind of backed me into using this because I don't necessarily disagree with

398
00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:23.790
why they have the rule.
Like I think purposefully being disrespectful,

399
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:26.400
targeting people.
Mis-Gendering deadnaming I don't,
I think those are wrong,

400
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.750
but at the same time you have to recognize conservatives think you're,

401
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.240
it's inverted for them,
right?
They think it's wrong to gender someone.

402
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:37.530
They're not by luck,
you know,
that's not their biological gender.
And my goal is,

403
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.140
look,
I'm,
I'm,
uh,
so we talked about this the first time I was here.

404
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:41.880
I'm a social liberal amount of classical liberal,

405
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.840
but I respect the right of other people to have opinions and debate and share

406
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:50.020
ideas and try and figure out what.
So I will say,
listen,
this is what they think.

407
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.710
And they're,
and they're arguing and you don't see that.
And I genuinely believe,

408
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.500
because I've seen the debates with the conversations with Jack,

409
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.290
the testimony from Congress,
no one has ever pointed this out to him.

410
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.100
And he was Kinda like,
I think he kind of realized it.
I look at Jack,

411
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.850
I mean that to me that makes it sound like he's an idiot.
I mean,
I like,

412
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:10.840
I completely hear you and I'm not,
I'm not judging your judgment or him actually.

413
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.790
It's just like,
I don't know what job you're,
and then,
dude,

414
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:15.970
you should have another job I think.
I think he's,
uh,

415
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.910
it's almost like he has,
say he is the chief executive officer,
but it's,

416
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.060
I think it's more of a,
he gets an email and goes to,
sure.
You know what I mean?

417
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.260
Does that sort of tell you though what social justice does to accompany that?

418
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.850
All this could be going on and you sort of need a head guy.

419
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.270
It's true for any company depending how big it is though.
You know,

420
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.190
it's like Jack can only know so much,
but I also think you have to look at,
um,
I,

421
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.030
I could be wrong on this.
Jack was fired.

422
00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.150
They replaced him with Dick Costolo and then take a solo laughed and then Jack

423
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:46.030
came back.
So it may just be that they were like,
bring them back in.

424
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:49.090
It's going to be kind of a in paper and like in name only thing.

425
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.430
He does have authority,
obviously he's talked about that,

426
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.480
but I think he's not super focused.
And again,
I'm not attacking the guy.

427
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:58.000
It's like I want him to come in here and I would treat them with as much respect

428
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:01.120
as I would of anyone else.
So.
Okay.
Well,
well yeah,
go ahead.
Well,

429
00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:04.690
I think the only reason these conversations happen is because of him.
I think he,

430
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:07.390
he,
you know,
he follows,
I'm pretty sure he follows Jordan Peterson.

431
00:22:07.391 --> 00:22:09.280
I think he follows you.
Um,

432
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.540
so I think he genuine genuinely is trying to understand why people are mad at

433
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:14.050
him.

434
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.720
And that's why after the podcast he said the grains of sand thing makes a lot of

435
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:20.500
sense.
Like to him,
he was probably thinking,
we just,
we just made mistakes,
man.

436
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.281
And then I say,
right,

437
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:24.100
but each of those mistakes makes a huge pile and people are pointing to the pile

438
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:27.610
and you're going,
but it's,
it's a mistake.
It's a mistake.
No,
it's a pile,
dude.

439
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.440
It's a huge heap.
It keep doing it.
It's a pretty big heap.
So,
yeah.
Okay.
So when,

440
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.230
so you,
there,
there was a lot of the conversation that was about,
well,

441
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:37.480
more of this seems to be happening to conservatives,

442
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:41.710
but you did point out actually that sometimes they've banned some lefty
accounts,

443
00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:46.370
right?
Yeah.
Not,
it's not a lot,
but there,
there have been some,
there's a,

444
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:51.220
a decent amount of,
so I would say it's the lower tier accounts across the board.

445
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.930
If it's,
it's really freaky to,

446
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.670
it's the anti war left is getting a ton of,
of heat,

447
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.490
but they're not particularly popular or mainstream.

448
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.040
So there's no one coming out to defend them.

449
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.430
Conservatives when they hear about it,
we'll be like,
hey,
that's not cool,

450
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.530
but it's not an,
you know,
so,

451
00:23:08.531 --> 00:23:11.890
so occupy Wall Street accounts have been banned by Twitter for,
for,

452
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.940
I have no idea why they never pushed you to say this got rid of like 56
accounts.

453
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.190
Uh,
some with like 50,000 followers.

454
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.110
So the activist left that are not the same as the editor to like high profile

455
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:24.160
regressive left people.

456
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.320
These are people predominantly focused on Venezuela and Siri on like get,

457
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.200
you know,
end the war.

458
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.020
They don't have the mainstream pull from the left to defend them.

459
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.460
And the information isn't traveling to conservative circles.
I see it,
you know,

460
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:39.910
somebody,
uh,
Michelle Malkin tweeted,
you know,
this,
this uh,

461
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.850
silicon valley lobbyists said it happens to the left too,

462
00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:44.140
but couldn't name a single person.

463
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.000
And then I named organizations that have been hit recently.
Uh,

464
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.620
I think it's fair to point out for every one antiwar left us,

465
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.380
you get like 30 conservative.
So that's why I was asking you the question,

466
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:57.770
cause I don't want people to think that it's nobody on the left because it's not

467
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:02.120
nobody,
but in terms of proportion it seems to be far worse.

468
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.870
And it's not far right.
I mean that's the thing.
It's not far right now,

469
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.120
it's not Sargon of Akkad.

470
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.870
Benjamin May have broken their rules by targeted harassment or whatever.

471
00:24:09.871 --> 00:24:12.290
What he was saying,
he said some crazy stuff.
Whatever he did,
I'm not sure,

472
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:13.670
I'm not defending it or whatever,

473
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:18.410
but it's like the idea that he's far right in my mind is crazy.
Like,
yeah.
Is,

474
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.190
well,
you know,
he's a bit of a troll but he's basically a,

475
00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:25.150
an old school liberal or something on that.
So Argon and Daniella,

476
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.100
they joined Ukip.
Yeah.
And so even though you know,
like Dang,

477
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:29.830
Kyla has had communist star,
uh,

478
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.200
on his chest and he has political compass is slightly center left.

479
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.370
It's like you join a conservative or right wing party.
Then like,

480
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:40.260
I don't know how you,
you say you're not to right wing,
but either way,

481
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.400
that in and of itself isn't a reason to get booted off a platform.
Of course not,

482
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.450
but,
but Sargon set a bunch of stuff and he even messaged me,
he was like,

483
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.100
he was saying like,
Oh man,
your face when you realize like what I said,
you know,

484
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.130
it's like you said some,
he said some pretty crazy things,
man.
Yeah.

485
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.940
So do you think it's possible,
I,

486
00:24:55.941 --> 00:25:00.020
I'm sort of coming to this belief that we're about to watch one,

487
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:03.650
if not more of these giant tech companies completely crumbled within the next

488
00:25:03.651 --> 00:25:07.970
two years that the platforms have grown to the point where nobody can control

489
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:11.420
them anymore.
And this is where I would give you a little,
I would give Jack,

490
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:14.060
let's say a little bit of Alicia not understanding what's going on,

491
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.180
but they've all grown so big.
There are so many people on them.

492
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.260
There are so many bots and targeted accounts and all of these things and

493
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:25.010
competing interests and people who believe in free speech and people who don't.

494
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:25.844
And you know,

495
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.940
governments like Pakistan who are trying to get Twitter to take down people for

496
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:32.570
their blasphemy laws.
Yep.
And then Twitter and American company actually does it.

497
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.070
Well,
I don't think they've taken anybody down.

498
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.410
Did they not take anybody down basement?

499
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.190
And I actually agree with Twitter on this one.
They notify you.
Yeah.

500
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.210
So I've seen a lot of conservatives who are upset that has gotten this blasphemy

501
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:45.770
notice.
And I'm like,
oh,
hold on Twitter.
Send me a favor.
If you could be killed,

502
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.370
if you go to Pakistan now,
if you po,
if you bought violate Pakistan law,

503
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.530
I would appreciate it if Twitter told me,
hey,
just Fyi,

504
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:54.420
they want to kill you so I don't go there.
Right.
It's just gas.

505
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.120
Twitter hasn't taken any adverse action against these people who have posted

506
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:01.430
pictures of Muhammad.
They've just said,
we want to let you know,

507
00:26:01.431 --> 00:26:04.630
Pakistan has filed a complaint against you and you may want legal our

508
00:26:04.631 --> 00:26:06.020
presentation to deal with it.

509
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.780
That I agree with that they're giving you a government.
Uh,

510
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.210
notice where we want the transparency in the companies.
It's up.

511
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.980
Those images or whatever images they are,
they are,

512
00:26:13.981 --> 00:26:16.790
those are up in Twitter and Pakistan,
they're taking,

513
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:18.650
they're taking down in Pakistan,
so they're taking that,
right.

514
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:20.820
So that's where it's an American company.
See,

515
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:25.110
this is where I would say an American companies should,
should,
uh,

516
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.080
operate on the laws of America,
uh,
in,
um,
in America though,
I mean,
it's,

517
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.200
it's tough.
This is one of the debates too about cultural imperialism should,

518
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:35.420
and that's one of the things I was asking to,
to Jack,

519
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:38.980
because I know they enforced blasphemy laws in other countries.
It's,
it's the,

520
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.350
you must follow the laws of the,
of the countries they're in.
But I asked them,

521
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:46.830
does your hate speech policy apply to Iran?
They pour,
clarified them.

522
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.630
They're blocked in around.
I'm like,
okay,
well what about,
you know,

523
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:53.250
Pakistan or our country where it's illegal to be gay?
Do will you?

524
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:57.920
If so,
it's,
it's a weird circumstance.
Yeah.
Let's pull up,
uh,

525
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.120
there's a ton of countries where it's illegal to be gay.

526
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.920
Let's say someone is convicted of sodomy or homosexuality and then you go on

527
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:07.740
Twitter and target them and say,
you're a dirty criminal,
you're awful.

528
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.120
We'll Twitter ban you because then you have a weird conundrum of the citizen

529
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:14.820
following the law of his own country being banned by Twitter.

530
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.240
Even though Twitter has to follow the law of that country too.
It's a weird,

531
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.730
now I personally would be on Twitter side on that one,

532
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.370
like that's horrifying what they do in those countries,

533
00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.820
but at the same time Twitter is imposing its cultural values on foreign

534
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:30.230
countries where it's supposed to be following their laws.
It's,
it's,

535
00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:33.480
it's getting to me,
I mean look,
I'm not a CEO of a giant tech company,

536
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:36.040
but that's where I would just say we're a United States company and we are going

537
00:27:36.041 --> 00:27:39.810
to follow the free speech laws of the United States and if if then the country

538
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:41.760
wants to stop you from being on there,

539
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.920
well then they can do what they want and they often do as this,
but this is this,

540
00:27:45.921 --> 00:27:47.340
this,
this is why I think we're freedom.

541
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.460
We're going to start saying like a nightmare,
you know,
scenario of dystopia.

542
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.950
What their response to me in how their rules supersede us law is that while

543
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:58.650
we're a global company,
and I'm like,
right,

544
00:27:58.651 --> 00:28:01.290
but you have a platform that is extremely,

545
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:03.210
extremely powerful influencing our elections,

546
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.450
and this is the most important point.
People don't seem to understand.

547
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.960
I've seen so much criticism out there out the people out there don't seem to

548
00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:11.280
understand what I'm saying.
They're like,

549
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:14.070
Tim doesn't understand that free speech doesn't give you a right to a private

550
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:15.960
platform.
Absolutely.
Right.
Well,

551
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:18.930
I'm a social liberal who believes in regulation that recognize when a company

552
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:19.950
becomes so powerful,

553
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.630
it starts becoming a detriment to your democratic republic and your
institutions.

554
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.180
The government must intervene.
That's my opinion.
Yeah.

555
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.060
So you're taking a Trump position on this actually Trump position.
Yeah.

556
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:33.060
Will Trump launch basically the government to get involved at this point?
Well,

557
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:36.300
I mean,
I don't,
I mean,
that's a pretty conservative position.
Mine.
Yeah.

558
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.690
Social socially liberal regulation of major companies.

559
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.390
While it's become conservative now because now you,
it's so weird.

560
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.150
We'll just shows you how things flipped,
right?

561
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.530
Because you hear now conservatives saying it's gotten to the point and there

562
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.980
were going to go against what our core belief is.
I,
I don't fall on that.
I still,

563
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.570
it's crazy human ingenuity,

564
00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:58.800
but it annoys me when people respond to like the Joe Rogan podcast saying like

565
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.850
these conservatives,
they,

566
00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:04.110
they screamed small private business and small government up until they get

567
00:29:04.111 --> 00:29:04.770
banned.
And I'm like,

568
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.250
I have always been in favor of regulating companies that are breaking rules.

569
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.910
I used to work for environmental organizations before the government regulating

570
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:14.040
Twitter right now at this point.
Absolutely.
I,

571
00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:18.180
and this was only after the conversation with Jack because seeing the,
you know,

572
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.640
I respect you would be for the Trump government.
I mean,

573
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.050
which I assume you're not a big Trump guy.

574
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:25.200
You would know the government and definitely not for the government led by

575
00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:29.220
Donald Trump to,
to regulate Twitter.
It's not just led by Trump.

576
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:33.060
I was audio Kazuyo Cortez and isn't how she got 3.5 million followers.

577
00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:37.960
So she has influenced,
sure,
sure.
But there's an issue here.
If,
uh,

578
00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.320
you know,
one of the things I said to them was,
if you are unwilling to uphold,
I,

579
00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.010
I didn't say it as clearly as I've thought about,
I tweeted about it.

580
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:49.180
If you're unwilling to uphold the legal standard of public discourse set by the

581
00:29:49.181 --> 00:29:51.610
rules of the Supreme Court in the Unite States constitution,

582
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:56.850
then you will face regulation and their unwillingness to do so and full,

583
00:29:57.221 --> 00:30:01.240
full well knowing foreign governments are manipulating us to trick us into

584
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:05.710
voting for f.
Uh,
knowing that new knowledge was involved in this scheme,

585
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.630
to do Russian bots to cost the Republican's and election that that's terrifying

586
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:11.464
me.
Uh,
to me.

587
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:16.710
And I would rather see Twitter turned off right now switch gun if it meant we're

588
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:19.120
going to protect our democracy,
our democratic republic,

589
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.530
cause every gets mad at me.
Representative Republic through death,

590
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.750
through democratic institutions.

591
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.110
<v 2>Do you think in a weird way that the Twitter people jack included want that?</v>

592
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.700
That they actually,
yeah,

593
00:30:29.701 --> 00:30:33.390
that they've realized and maybe that's why they're doing this little press thing

594
00:30:33.391 --> 00:30:36.360
right now they've realized they can't control the beast anymore.

595
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.910
So what would be the best thing Jerry Solution?
Jerry.
Jerry.

596
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.680
<v 1>Uh,
so what they do on periscope,</v>

597
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:46.630
and Jack mentioned this is you'll get a notification,
is this comment.
Okay?
Yeah.

598
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.400
And I always say yes for the most part.

599
00:30:48.401 --> 00:30:51.070
Like unless you said something like an incitement to violence or break the law,

600
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:53.230
I'm pretty much like,
yeah,
you got a stupid opinion,
but it's fine.

601
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.230
Twitter too to the same thing.
It absolves them of responsibility.

602
00:30:56.231 --> 00:30:59.800
It clears the bias sample a hundred thousand random people in the,

603
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:02.650
in the country of the origin of tweet and then let them decide.

604
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:08.040
<v 2>Yeah.
So when a vagina yesterday was saying [inaudible] let's,</v>

605
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.120
they'll do it to the other way.

606
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.810
When these guys this morning called us Nazi's and fascists and whatever,

607
00:31:12.811 --> 00:31:16.440
this usual nonsense that comes out and talking about the two of us,
um,

608
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.820
do you think that would be a violation of the rules that she laid out yesterday?

609
00:31:20.821 --> 00:31:25.821
Verified accounts libeling people to get their people to attack you as a,

610
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.260
um,
not,
I mean he,

611
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.390
one of these guys called you and Nazi propagandists and I think he should be

612
00:31:30.391 --> 00:31:33.150
allowed to.
I'm a fascist.
I'm for him being allowed to as well.

613
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.840
But I'm saying by the,
by the rules that she laid out yesterday,

614
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.650
do you think that should be allowed on their platform by,
by her rules,
not,

615
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:41.940
not your free speech rights?

616
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.250
<v 1>Um,
the,
the problem is their rules are arbitrary.</v>

617
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.490
I think,
uh,
we,
you know,

618
00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:53.390
we saw a guy post a picture of Mike Cernovich in his underwear and uh,

619
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.100
the first time he did it,
he got a lock out.
Second time nothing happened.

620
00:31:56.101 --> 00:31:58.760
Just my understanding.
So that's shocking to me.

621
00:31:58.761 --> 00:32:01.670
I don't care where the photo came from.
Uh,
people are saying like,
oh,

622
00:32:01.671 --> 00:32:03.080
it was on a public website.
I don't care.

623
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:07.160
You took a photo of somebody in a compromising position and posted it without

624
00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:11.420
their permission.
Like that's crazy that Twitter allows that can't say,

625
00:32:11.421 --> 00:32:14.480
I'm surprised they're harassment campaigns had been going on for years against

626
00:32:14.481 --> 00:32:16.610
conservatives that Twitter does nothing about.

627
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.750
So am I surprised that this could be a violation of the rules if you do it to

628
00:32:20.751 --> 00:32:25.070
someone else?
Of course Twitter would ban you if you were doing it to people.

629
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:29.740
Right.
You know,
you look at,
you look at,
we've got,
we've got a problem.
Yeah.

630
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:30.591
Well exactly.

631
00:32:30.591 --> 00:32:34.070
I mean you look at why when she read the first tweet from Sargon as to why he

632
00:32:34.071 --> 00:32:35.900
got banned and he was saying,

633
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.090
he said a bunch of things like about white people and men.

634
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.580
These are not hate speech.
According to Twitter.

635
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.960
He wasn't saying a to anybody directly.

636
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:44.890
He was saying these phrases are not hate speech.
And Twitter said,
yes,

637
00:32:44.891 --> 00:32:47.150
it is banned.
Well that's why our suspension,

638
00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:49.070
so that's why people like us who were free speech.

639
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.590
People are so frustrated with this because it's like,
look,

640
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:54.290
you can clearly call a Jew in Nazi there.
It's no problem.

641
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.720
But if you called a black person the n word,

642
00:32:56.721 --> 00:33:00.280
and obviously I'm not for doing that,
you'd be rooted in a second.
Anyone.
Yup.

643
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:03.560
Now you can argue whether you're be allowed to do that or not.

644
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.600
The subjective nature of it.

645
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.440
There's a slur for Jewish people that support supported the,

646
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:14.150
the Germans after the K and Tacos.
Well,
I don't want to say it.
Is that allowed?

647
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.000
Yeah,
I don't know.
The live stream probably just went down.

648
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.210
I've seen a bunch of people on the left using that calling people and I'm like,

649
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:21.760
dude,
that's a slur.
Like that's,
that's a,

650
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.970
that's an ethnic slur against Jewish people,
man.
Yeah.
How is that not being,

651
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:28.550
how did you know what,
here's my thing.

652
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.110
They know they have that extra layer of protection.
I mean,
write some,

653
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:35.570
something funny happened at the end of the stream we did where apparently it

654
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:37.490
didn't go down.
So Joe said,
we're done.

655
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.350
The mics were hot and now there's a conspiracy going around as to what I was

656
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:47.000
talking about.
Some people have incredibly pointed out truth,

657
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:47.670
like the,

658
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:52.100
what really happened and some people are getting conspiratorial after we ended

659
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:55.550
vagina asked me for the names of,
she said,

660
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.900
what was the Antifa tweet that did that,
that docs the cops?
And I said,
it's uh,

661
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.320
I gave you the link.
It's down now.
It was a bit.
Dot.
Ly Slash Antifa tweet,

662
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.270
I believe.
They took it down and she said,

663
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:07.880
and can you give me the names of the accounts that were threatening?
I said,
no,

664
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.710
I believe in minimizing harm.

665
00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:13.430
It's an ethics and a part of the journey journalistic ethics where my,
my,
my,

666
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:17.480
my primary concern is that after Lauren southern got taken down from Patrion a

667
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:20.630
lot of conservatives and were like pointing to,
it's going down saying,

668
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:22.970
why aren't they being taken down but a symmetrical,

669
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.590
I reached out to Jack Conti and said,

670
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:27.860
there's accusations of asymmetry based on these accounts and Jack immediate,
uh,

671
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:31.760
immediately band.
It's going down.
So now I said,
awe,
Whoa,
that was bad.

672
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:33.740
I did not want the tapping right from this point on,

673
00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:36.230
I will never give a name of these companies so they can take action against

674
00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:39.770
people who I'm at odds with.
That would be me using my weight for personal gain.

675
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:42.860
Once a stream ended,
she asked me for names.
I said,
no.

676
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.270
I began to explain when Lauren southern got taken out and then Joe's like

677
00:34:45.271 --> 00:34:48.320
everybody out.
So two two,
two narratives emerged.
The first,

678
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.230
I can already see where the first was that p two and I,
this is,

679
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.240
this is what most people are sharing.

680
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:54.980
Tim Pool maintained his journalistic integrity.

681
00:34:54.981 --> 00:34:58.380
Even we didn't know the Mites were alive and I'm like,
oh,
that's like,

682
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.590
that's sweet.
I see.
Like I'm like happy accident.

683
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.260
Some people are claiming that I'm refusing to share the names because they're

684
00:35:03.261 --> 00:35:05.930
fake and I made it all up.
I'm like,

685
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.850
what ended up happening was after we left the room,

686
00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:10.580
she asked me for the names and I was like,
which names specifically though?

687
00:35:10.581 --> 00:35:12.380
Like what do you,
what do you ask?
She said,
I'm not going to ban them or anything.

688
00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:14.390
I just want to know who was saying it to you.
And I was like,

689
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.760
I don't know what you're talking about.
Which specific particularly it's,

690
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.600
oh the people threatening you.
And I was like,
oh,
that was three,
three years,

691
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.040
three like two or three years ago.
I have,
it was just an antifa account.

692
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.590
Like I don't remember that.
It wasn't anybody high profile.

693
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.420
Is there a weird thing also where that getting people band or let's say the

694
00:35:29.421 --> 00:35:32.160
people who are threatening you with violence or I've had people threaten me with

695
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:32.721
violence,
you know,

696
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:36.860
like some fairly serious things and that's the only time I really ever reported.

697
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:39.310
Every now and again someone writing really vile,
like,

698
00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.020
like truly like really vile,

699
00:35:41.021 --> 00:35:44.670
usually some gay reference and I'll report it just to see if Twitter does sang

700
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:47.100
about it cause I'm just trying to test the thing and they don't of course.

701
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.880
But the few times that I've gotten what I think are seemingly legit death

702
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:53.040
threats,
they have gotten rid of the accounts.

703
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:55.980
But then after they do it and you and I get the email back and it's like we've

704
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.950
suspended this account or terminate this county,
I'm always like,

705
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.720
did I just accomplish anything there?
Because if anything,
yeah.

706
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.140
Unless that person was then,

707
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:06.810
unless they used an IP address and I wouldn't be for any of this,

708
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.720
but unless they actually track down who this person was,

709
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.650
well now we've just enraged somebody who had a lot of rage beforehand.
Yeah.

710
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:18.350
So we probably just exacerbated the situation.
Yeah.
Block and mute.
That's fine.

711
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.520
I used to never block anybody.
Yeah.

712
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.460
I would just meet people who are incessant and bad faith actors.

713
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.910
But then I decided out of sight,
out of mind.

714
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.000
So although blocking someone doesn't prevent them from ever seeing your tweets,

715
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.400
it makes it much more,
much less likely that they'll see your tweet.

716
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.160
So I was like,
there's,
there's certain people I've blocked,

717
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:36.870
I think I've blocked maybe like 25 people,

718
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.560
bad faith actors who wait for our tweets.
Second plot of context,

719
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.650
like some of the people from yesterday with Joe Rogan,
the deck screenshots,

720
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:46.260
they lie about what was said,
but they know that their followers and have a fat,

721
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:50.010
well not,
we'll never fact check.
So then they just pushed that lie.
Uh,

722
00:36:50.011 --> 00:36:53.760
I believe that people are allowed to be crazy and stupid.

723
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.330
So the people who are like the guy who was accusing me of being a far right

724
00:36:57.331 --> 00:36:59.280
conspiracy theories and whenever I think he's lying,

725
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:02.580
I think he knows full well because that guy used to DM me and he was asking me

726
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:07.540
to like cover a certain issues up until I called him out for posting the

727
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.580
threatening to post revenge porn if Cernovich now he's angry and I was lying.

728
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.510
He said about,
maybe I'll make this clear.
Yeah,
so people are probably gonna pick,

729
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.640
they probably know who this guy is because there's a meme going around.

730
00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:19.650
If me saying journalists are going to do this,
then he does this.

731
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:20.791
Just to be clear,

732
00:37:20.791 --> 00:37:25.470
this guy was asking me to cover stories for him up until he got mad at me and

733
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:28.350
now he's claiming on far right.
This is asking me for help.

734
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.830
Does that mean that he regularly dams far right conspiracy theorists that he

735
00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:33.150
think are acting in bad faith for help?

736
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.000
Well this is the problem and those are the other guy who was like,

737
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:38.190
I used to be two pools roommate,
straight up lie.

738
00:37:38.191 --> 00:37:41.550
He posted a straight up lie and I'm like,
you want me to post the dms?

739
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.970
I can prove you're lying.
So is there nuts?

740
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.620
So let's take this to a different metal level for a second.

741
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.220
How to Twitter for just a moment,
but do you think this the basic,

742
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:53.790
the basic quest for truth,

743
00:37:53.791 --> 00:37:58.080
let's say that some people are on versus just the rest of this crew that wants

744
00:37:58.081 --> 00:38:03.000
to just watch scorched earth or just destroy everything that that really is what

745
00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:03.990
the culture wars about.

746
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:06.680
Cause you and I have pretty significant political differences and it is cool.

747
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.110
And I know,
and correct me if I'm wrong,
it's,
it's irrelevant to me.

748
00:38:10.111 --> 00:38:12.000
I think it's irrelevant to you.
You know,
we can,

749
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.240
we can do those discussions and we've done them before.
Yeah.

750
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.290
I don't think we would do them now because there's so many other things to talk

751
00:38:16.291 --> 00:38:17.124
about.
But it's like,

752
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.730
I think we both know that we're on basically the same quest for something that's

753
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:24.060
true,
so decent that we want people to live free.
But,

754
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.190
but that's what the culture war really is about.

755
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.120
It's that you've got this little sliver of people trying really trying and we're

756
00:38:30.121 --> 00:38:33.210
dealing with people that basically act like,

757
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.370
like Heath Ledger's joker I think.
I think it to burn,

758
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.640
but I think there's a sociopath's left and the right's got him.

759
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:42.430
There are people that I believe on the left and the right who are grifters,

760
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.070
I don't know which side has more or less.
Um,

761
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:49.480
I don't publicly call out people as grifters because I can never prove even to

762
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:53.080
myself.
I'm like,
I think something about that person.
I don't trust them.

763
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:54.520
But that would,

764
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.730
that would be really unfair to accuse them of being disingenuous on things that

765
00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.840
they're truly passionate about.

766
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.160
But I think what we have kind of in the culture war is,
you know,

767
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:07.420
I saw something on Twitter where there's this activist who works for NBC and

768
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:09.920
he's literally activist.
He's lobbied Twitter for action.

769
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.020
So I can't call him a journalist.

770
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.740
And he was claiming that everyone who criticized captain marvel or Brie Larson

771
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:19.310
was an insult.
I said,
I did a piece on it today and I'm like,
you can't,

772
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:23.020
you can't clearly think that every single person is not getting late.

773
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:26.050
It's a really,
you're very clearly trying to trigger an attack people.

774
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.000
But the important point was that for the record,

775
00:39:28.001 --> 00:39:31.330
I'm getting laid and I have no desire to see it.
Well,
yeah,
but so the point,

776
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.510
you know,
I tried to bring up just calmly to one,
uh,

777
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:38.530
it was a buzzword reporter who quoted it.
I didn't argue for or against.
I said,

778
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.330
here's what people are thinking.

779
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.810
And his response was that I was engaged in far right propaganda and I've lost my

780
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:48.430
mind.
And I'm like,
he was like,
I don't see any of these conversations on reddit.

781
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.020
Therefore it's far right propaganda.

782
00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:52.960
Youtube is dominated by far right propaganda.
And I'm like,

783
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.890
I realized something because someone commented this,
reddit is moderated,

784
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.050
particularly by the companies,
you know,

785
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.060
they want to make sure they're promoting their content.

786
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:02.380
And there's very few things that can appear.

787
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.220
But Youtube is a very libertarian platform where whatever works works,

788
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:09.370
it's a very meritocratic.
So on youtube for video is good.

789
00:40:09.371 --> 00:40:12.220
And entertaining people watch it.
What does that mean?
Well,
they're not in cells.

790
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:15.100
It means that a lot of people are watching these videos and youtube is saying,

791
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:16.240
if people like it,
we're going to show it.

792
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:21.450
That's not a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories.
It's a lot of these videos.
Uh,

793
00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.680
Chris doesn't captain marvel very simply.
People saying,

794
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.300
I'm sure the movie will do well.

795
00:40:25.301 --> 00:40:27.370
I'm sure it's going to be like a moderately good marvel film.

796
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.460
I just don't like Brie Larson because she's very snooty and condescending.

797
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.360
I'm going to sit this one out.

798
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.910
There are some people who are completely how I feel.
Right.

799
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.500
Level of the marvel movies,
right.
Boom event.

800
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.140
Infinity War was I think the best one.
That would great.
Yeah.

801
00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.400
I'm so excited for the best one.

802
00:40:39.401 --> 00:40:42.640
I can't wait for the next one and I have no desire to see it cause I saw her

803
00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:45.790
little speech and it's like,
you know what?
I just don't want to support you.
We,

804
00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:49.810
if we keep supporting these people who are so contrary to the,

805
00:40:49.811 --> 00:40:51.070
at least the things that I believe in,

806
00:40:51.071 --> 00:40:53.920
it's like the only way you're going to ever get change because I don't want the

807
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:56.920
government to stop them.
I want,
I want them to stop themselves.
But so,

808
00:40:56.921 --> 00:41:00.480
so here's the thing,
I don't,
I don't feel that way for me.
It's kind of that,
uh,

809
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.580
they marketed,
the movie has a big feminist film,
Brie Larson zone words.

810
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.070
The commercial has a big her in the screen and then a and o appears.

811
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.330
So it says a hero.
And I'm like,
I see where they're going with this.
I sat there,

812
00:41:10.331 --> 00:41:12.220
Ghostbusters,
I sat to the last Shaddai.

813
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.320
I'm going to sit this one out until the reviews come in.

814
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.220
I got no beef with marvel or Brie Larson.
I don't like the things she says.

815
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:22.960
But Chris Evans,
Captain America says crazy things too.
Well,
mark,

816
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:24.500
rough alone makes him right.
Right,
right.

817
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.500
So I can separate the art from the artist.

818
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.850
But when your marketing is overwhelmingly reminiscent of Ghostbusters and last

819
00:41:30.851 --> 00:41:34.400
Jedi,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna wait and I'm hearing it's boring.
You know,

820
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:38.420
it's got like a 6.6 on Metacritic and even left wing outlets are saying it's

821
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:41.220
mediocre and boring at best.
So I'm like,
maybe I won't see it.
You know,

822
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:44.390
definitely was the Nazi trolls that have screwed.
Oh,

823
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:46.110
and that's the craziest thing are the ratings.
They're already,

824
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.190
they're already seeing that there's a,
an outlet that wrote a story saying,
Oh,

825
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.790
trolls are uh,
right,

826
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.880
right wing trolls or preparing a campaign to destroy the ratings.
And they're,

827
00:41:55.881 --> 00:42:00.440
they're a story was we saw one person on Twitter who said,
let's do this.

828
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:03.920
And I was like,
how many he had,
he had apparently had no followers.
I'm like,

829
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.680
random Twitter.
How did you make it?
Like who cares what?

830
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:11.330
But that's why this is also is so strange to me because we can see these trends

831
00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:12.051
all over the place.

832
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:15.800
So we'll remember when there was that video of Kazuo Cortez dancing.

833
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.560
Nobody cared.
Nobody cared complimented her.

834
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.830
I saw all the conservatives,
well all of them,

835
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:24.770
all the verified conservatives that have any following of note where like,
oh,

836
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:28.280
this is kind of cute,
or I don't like her,
but she's a human,
Blah Blah.
And then,

837
00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:29.900
but all the,
all the,
uh,

838
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:32.840
the mainstream conservatives going crazy and most of them,

839
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:35.660
they didn't link to anything where they would link to an anonymous account that

840
00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:39.100
you don't even know.
It was one account that sounded like that.
Was that Newsweek?

841
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:43.180
Which one?
It was.
It was anonymous.
Uh,
no.
I know,
but what,
what,
what,
uh,

842
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.330
outlet row.
Oh,
that article.
Oh,
I don't know.
But they were,

843
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.190
I was everyone your times wrote about it.
Yeah.
When I first saw that video,

844
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:51.800
I laughed and I said,
I tweeted something like,
wow,

845
00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:55.050
this makes her seem really relatable and endearing.
It's really,
it's a,
I said,

846
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.190
it makes her look like she's fun and I come like,
I was like a compliment.

847
00:42:58.191 --> 00:42:59.150
I'm like,
I'm like,
wow,

848
00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.210
that's really cool that we have this video of like a college fun time.

849
00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:04.710
They were recreating breakfast club dances.
I mean,
I don't,

850
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.430
I know that those people will look me in with conservatives.

851
00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:10.820
I don't think of me that way.
But the first response I saw from ever,

852
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.480
literally everybody was like,
lol,
this is so funny.
Like it's fun,
Ha.

853
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.900
But then when you see that at the political level and we see it all the time,

854
00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:20.510
it's sort of the game or level or the Twitter level or whatever.

855
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:22.610
You realize that these,
these themes,

856
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:25.040
like it doesn't take a genius to put some of this together,
but all right,
let's,

857
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.110
let's shift a little bit.
So first off we're going to do,

858
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.050
we'll do like an hour of Q and a from the audience.
Yeah.
You down for that,

859
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.330
whatever,
whatever.
We're going to do that.
But I want,

860
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.850
I want to do a bunch of work here at first,
but people can submit on,

861
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:36.670
on the super chat right now.
Let's talk about,
uh,

862
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.410
my favorite organization in America even more.

863
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:43.080
I like these guys even more than the southern poverty hates enter data and

864
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:46.610
society.
Oh,
that conspiracy theater transition a bit about data and society.

865
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:47.450
They put up a chart.

866
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.120
The alternative influence or now they're directly associated when they put
their,

867
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:54.410
they're directly connected to the daily stormer.
Yeah,
it's a fact,
and I,

868
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:58.430
I've mentioned this in the past and people on the left had the same reaction

869
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.370
that we have to their conspiracy theory,

870
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:05.390
crime web and actually the connection between data and society to Neo Nazis is

871
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.200
extremely direct relative to what they claimed.

872
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:13.580
So one of their advisors has appeared years just what data society.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

873
00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.200
in society is a,

874
00:44:15.201 --> 00:44:18.770
it's a New York based think tank of progressives that are tracking data,

875
00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:20.780
social media and how it impacts society.

876
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:24.830
And they do a lot of research looking into far right and Russian interference.

877
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:29.210
One of the people,
uh,
so I,
this is great and I hope,
I hope they're listening.

878
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.000
I have an insider who's been feeding me information and I know they're working

879
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:34.770
on like a Russian document right now.

880
00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:38.280
And the woman who was writing it tweets every three minutes about some

881
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.860
nonsensical conspiracy theory.
And I laughed.
I'm like,

882
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:41.940
it represents them very well,

883
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:43.910
but I hope they're listening and they know that I've,
yeah,

884
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.740
somebody inside their organization has sent me like,

885
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:51.300
so I also know that they've admitted the connections in their report.

886
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:52.530
The alternative influence network,

887
00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:57.450
they're a direct quote sent to me was some of these are not factual.
So I have,

888
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.290
you know,
and that's,
and that's how I admitted to you that the report was doable.

889
00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:05.010
I don't want to say related to mean basically just about your names.
I'll,

890
00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:05.730
I'll say this.

891
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:10.290
I have been fed insider information and one of the statements given to me by an

892
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:14.520
individual,
not from them,
but through someone associated in a certain capacity.

893
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.530
I'm very,
I'm trying to be very careful not to expose,
uh,

894
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.740
was a quote.

895
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:24.530
Some of these are not factual and there's more there.
Um,
but that was,
that was,

896
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:29.190
you know,
yeah.
So I'll ultimately,
I've just,
you know,
whatever.
Right.

897
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.220
But what's interesting about it is it's not just whatever,

898
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:36.750
because we then see how these studies that were based in nothing other than,
Oh,

899
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:38.280
this person appeared with this person,

900
00:45:38.281 --> 00:45:39.990
or this person did a live stream with this person.

901
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.020
And then you link it together and it looks like some sort of massive network.

902
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.510
Okay.
He's ridiculous scheming together and the connections are fake.

903
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.090
Some of them are connections were often fake,
but not only that,

904
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:50.240
there was no evidence that the whole premise of it,

905
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.630
this alternative influence network was that this group of people that included

906
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:57.390
Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson and you and me and a whole bunch of others that

907
00:45:57.391 --> 00:46:02.370
we've radicalized people to the far right when in fact there is actual data.

908
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:02.730
Right.

909
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:07.050
The objective as has shown that I've actually read dean radicalized people have

910
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:09.000
the right and made them more liberal in a lot of cases.

911
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:12.960
And I've actually not that anecdote evidence is,
is enough ended up well,

912
00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.180
but I have a lot of evidence more,
but more importantly,

913
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:19.500
it claims that youtube channels.
Okay.
Sam Harris,
does he have a youtube channel?

914
00:46:19.501 --> 00:46:23.180
I'm pretty sure he does.
Um,
but they also mentioned James Demore who at the,

915
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.840
at least at the time,
there was four people listed that weren't youtube burrs,

916
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.810
some that were on youtube with like a thousand subscribers.

917
00:46:30.811 --> 00:46:33.990
I posted one or two videos at some point and I'm like,
that's a fake,

918
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.980
it's fake narrative.
But,
but let's,

919
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.970
I want to make something absolutely clear that thing that I had muted on Twitter

920
00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:41.320
because I can,
cause we're,
they're going after me and the,
the,

921
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:44.860
the report is implying that we're like,
oh yeah.
And,
and,
and,

922
00:46:44.861 --> 00:46:46.110
and they tried to get into,
they,

923
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:49.120
they try to dance around the nuance of understanding that,
uh,

924
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.130
one of the problems was they said these people hold views from libertarian to

925
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.370
see mainstream conservative libertarian to white nationalists.

926
00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:00.840
I don't fit that bracket at all.
Absolutely not.
Uh,
simply because I defend,

927
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:03.330
you're not a white nationalist.
Oh yeah.
My,
my,

928
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.010
my mixed race family would fit really,

929
00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:07.170
really well into a white notes are completely,
oh,

930
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:11.510
it's half Korean quarter Korean actually quoted.
Yeah,
I've half white.
So,
so,

931
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.510
so here's the important thing.

932
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.740
One of the advisers to data and society has appeared on numerous podcasts and

933
00:47:16.741 --> 00:47:20.460
praised,
uh,
the former web dev from the daily stormer.

934
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:24.930
She was heavily criticized for this has tried coming out and making like,

935
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.530
you know,
oh no,
no,
it's just my research.
But there's a podcast from a,

936
00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:33.370
I believe it may be from w NYC where she's talking about,
no,
this neo Nazi guy,

937
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:35.860
it's all just jokes.
It's all just lol,
lol,

938
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:39.220
the big swastika on his chest and all these things.
It's just funny.
Ha Ha.

939
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.770
And that's,
that's one of their advisors.
So if they want,

940
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:44.980
if they want to lay accusations towards me,
because I w I kid you not,

941
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:48.310
one of their accusations was that in a video,
someone walked past me.

942
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.030
I was at a party at vidcon where there's thousands of people I've never met.

943
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.310
I showed up to do an interview with a guy and as,

944
00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:56.520
as someone's interviewing and talking to me on their camera,

945
00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:59.560
someone was like walked in after the fact and she says that connects them.

946
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.010
It's like,
okay,
I never had a word to that person.
I've never met them.

947
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.800
I just saw them at a party.
When you and shake hands,

948
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:11.070
your organization has an advisor who has appeared on shows and praised an actual

949
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.250
neo Nazi.
Well,
depending on who you ask will say he's not really a neo Nazi.

950
00:48:15.251 --> 00:48:16.720
I don't want to drag people by naming them,

951
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:19.000
but it's an individual who is one of the most notorious trolls on the planet,

952
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.880
was associated with daily stormer,
has a swastika on their chest.

953
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.910
I'll leave it there and I will point out to people who know the woman and this

954
00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:31.270
man will say it's unfair to characterize them in that manner.

955
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.490
But if we're going by the standards set by data and society there,

956
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:39.600
you literally have a woman who's written a book and defended too to the extent

957
00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:42.940
which that it's just a joke.
It's just a game.
It's,
it's,
it's funny.

958
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.590
Well tell that to them they should tell it to themselves if they think it's

959
00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:51.190
funny cause you get a tattoo of a swastika on your chest and to to make

960
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:54.100
horrifying jokes about marginalized communities.

961
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.370
That's their standard for what's funny or at least one of their advisors.

962
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:00.160
I have to question their motives when they want to accuse me of being a gateway

963
00:49:00.161 --> 00:49:02.920
to anything.
Maybe we should look internally,
you know,
clean your house,

964
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.750
clean your room before trying to change the world.
Right.
It's right over there.

965
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.460
Yeah,
exactly.

966
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.980
<v 2>Um,
what do you make of the fact the way that,
okay,
so these,</v>

967
00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:13.330
these reports come out and then immediately huffpo daily beast.

968
00:49:13.331 --> 00:49:14.590
Everybody jumps on board them.

969
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.550
Vox did a big piece on it as reclined even tagged me in the tweet to voting the

970
00:49:18.551 --> 00:49:23.200
article to me.
Oh yeah.
Um,
that they all didn't,
they use it as,

971
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.680
oh,
we've got evidence of it and what I see evidence of that these,

972
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:28.570
these are the outright radicalists and that,
you know,

973
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:31.700
you're making turning people into white nationalists and I'm turning people into

974
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.030
homophobes or some,
some ridiculous nonsense.

975
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:37.660
But what I think is most fascinating about it is it's like if you look at the

976
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:38.441
people in that group,

977
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:41.500
most of them are sort of self funded or Patrion or youtube or some of them

978
00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:43.660
probably have other jobs.
You know,

979
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:48.690
vox is funded by like hundreds of millions of dollars of VC money and they feel

980
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:52.190
the need to go after Chris Ragan who is a freaking like I like I like a lot,

981
00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:54.490
but he's a Bernie Bro video game.

982
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:58.210
So it shows you that the power really has shifted where they know it's like

983
00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.540
their lives and their Lou your rally losing.
You know what I mean?

984
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.830
What annoyed me about the Ezra Klein thing?
He said this really is the right

985
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.440
<v 1>actionary right.
And I'm like,</v>

986
00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:11.120
I made a documentary in hour long documentary about institutional racism.
Uh,

987
00:50:11.121 --> 00:50:14.150
I have only ever defended,
um,

988
00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.360
social justice policy in terms of the problems of institutional racism,

989
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.430
the importance of protecting marginalized communities.

990
00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.490
My issue is that I'm on the libertarian spectrum towards the left.

991
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:25.640
These are people who are hippie pot-smoking sit on the beach with dreads and

992
00:50:25.641 --> 00:50:29.330
chill.
There's are the people that I,
with skateboarders,
we want to be left alone,

993
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:32.240
but we're all friends and we want to have hugs and we want to have vegan food.

994
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:35.900
People have,
oh no,
my whole life.
So we're,
we're the kind of people who are like,

995
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.130
Nah man,
like we should,

996
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:40.550
we should do the best to cooperate and end these oppressive things.

997
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.440
But you silencing other people,
you accusing other people smearing them,

998
00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:48.170
attacking them and being racist are things I don't agree with.

999
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:52.070
Linda Sarsour was just dragging Nancy Polosi for being a white feminist who

1000
00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:54.950
supports white patriarchy and I'm like,
yes,

1001
00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:58.820
I agree that we should respect all peoples of different faiths and national,

1002
00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.180
a national origins,
gender identity,
etc. You are not doing that.

1003
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.870
You're literally trying to weaponize the color of this woman's skin if there's a

1004
00:51:05.871 --> 00:51:08.740
racist in the equation.
If Linda start somewhere.
Exactly.
Yeah.

1005
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.420
So how is it that that makes me reactionary,
right.

1006
00:51:11.421 --> 00:51:15.380
When I'm actually in favor of upholding the tenants of social justice without

1007
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:19.830
being an authoritarian mean person,
I'm gonna avoid swearing,
you know?
Yeah.

1008
00:51:19.831 --> 00:51:22.850
Let's do the political thing quick.
Are you forgetting marriage at well,
yeah,

1009
00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:26.330
of course.
The two.
Okay.
That's pretty lucky.
You are for abortion.

1010
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.520
You're pro choice.
I'm pro choice.
I'm pro choice to,
okay.

1011
00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:31.550
That seems pretty lefty or there's nuance there too.
Are you guys death penalty?

1012
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.950
Absolutely.
Against him.
Against the death penalty to,
are you hungry?

1013
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:38.550
Strong public education?
Yeah.
100%.
Me Too.
Are you a for euthanasia?
Uh,

1014
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.000
they give you a death.
Uh,

1015
00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.000
we know that you have a right to decide at the end of your,
oh yeah,

1016
00:51:43.001 --> 00:51:46.880
that's a pretty lefty thing.
Um,
what,
right,
right.
And,
and,
and,
um,
a right to try.

1017
00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:48.750
What does that,
the experimental medications.
Yeah.

1018
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.810
I'll go one step further than you,
that's more of a libertarian thing.

1019
00:51:51.811 --> 00:51:54.950
I'm for progressive tax.
Uh,
I'm in favor of minimum wage.

1020
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.330
Both of these students come with caveats.
Uh,

1021
00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.820
I believe clearly against both of those.

1022
00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.010
I believe on the left the rug now if you will.

1023
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.470
And I believe that we should do student loan forgiveness.

1024
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.650
I believe that there's a bunch of other areas where there's a discussion there.

1025
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:11.630
Yup.
Yup,
Yup.
Uh,
so I,
I can go on,
but it's like,
uh,
this is it.
It's crazy.

1026
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:14.240
When I say I supported Bernie and people like he's lying and I'm like,

1027
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:18.940
watch my videos.
I'll point out the insanity of the green new deal.
Try.

1028
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.740
The second page of the green new deal is like racial equity.

1029
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:22.970
Equity is not equality.

1030
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.180
Why is my environmental bill being plagued by identitarianism?

1031
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:28.780
That makes me angry.
I like environmental as I'm,

1032
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:33.260
I'm in favor of environmental regulation.
Yeah.
And,
and I'm an,
I've been,

1033
00:52:33.261 --> 00:52:35.450
I have been on this,
in this business is all of my life.

1034
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.510
It's almost like no matter what Democrats,
it's crazy to me.

1035
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:41.720
And the funny thing is I made a video about Linda Sarsour dragging Nancy Polosi

1036
00:52:41.721 --> 00:52:44.060
today and I thought it was funny how like,

1037
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.260
I've actually probably complimented Nancy Pelosi even though I don't like the

1038
00:52:48.261 --> 00:52:51.560
corporatist mainstream Democrats because I thought about an unlike,
well,

1039
00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:54.950
my only real gripe with her is how she handles her business with Trump.

1040
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:59.030
Not really her position.
She mocked the green new deal.
And I,
I agree with her.

1041
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:02.150
So there's a lot of mainstream Democrats that,
you know,

1042
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:04.940
I don't care from mainstream,
moderate Republicans,
Democrats,

1043
00:53:04.941 --> 00:53:09.110
I don't care about that.
My concern is cultural politics,
ground level protest.

1044
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:10.243
What do I see?

1045
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:14.360
Do we have far right white nationalists and on the Republican side of Congress,

1046
00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.450
while there are some people you can live with,

1047
00:53:15.451 --> 00:53:17.900
accusations against Steve King got removed from what?
Of Committees.

1048
00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.810
But what else do you have?
Um,
not,
not,
not too much,

1049
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.510
but the left is going to claim Trump is,
he hasn't.

1050
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.850
Then you're going to have on the left you have Kirsten Gillibrand the future.

1051
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.430
The future is female intersectional.
Oh,
that's identitarianism.

1052
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:32.100
I don't like that you have Alexandria Kazuo Cortez Green new deal.

1053
00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:33.680
Identitarianism you have Elon.

1054
00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.570
I'm did sleep there all identitarian so I look at the left and I'm like,

1055
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:39.240
all of these people want to enact policy based on the color of someone's skin.

1056
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.060
I've experienced that my life from the left and the right.

1057
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.990
And I do not want to live in that world where I've had a white people,
you know,

1058
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:49.710
a white supremacists vandalized my,
my,
my family's home when I was little.

1059
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.710
My mom has explained to us that this is part of the world.

1060
00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:55.740
People who don't like mixed race families.
I,
I've to occupy Wall Street.

1061
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.760
My God do.
I did.
I get to experience the beauty of being not white or,

1062
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:02.450
or a person of color because you're mixed and they,
the,

1063
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.830
the people on the left say,
you're too white.
You don't get to speak,

1064
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.080
but I'm mixed.
Too Bad.
Then you have other people saying,

1065
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.450
I only will listen to you because you're mixing.
I'm like,
well,

1066
00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:13.170
which one is which?
Who Do I,
I hate it.
I hate all of it.
I don't want it.

1067
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.770
What do you think if we were really doing like the Psych One oh one on this

1068
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:17.490
condition,

1069
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:20.520
because I actually am starting to think it's sort of like a mental condition.

1070
00:54:20.521 --> 00:54:25.020
It's a mass mental condition that's going on because it's not based.
In fact,

1071
00:54:25.021 --> 00:54:29.340
so no matter how much you explain to these people that you're for the individual

1072
00:54:29.341 --> 00:54:32.140
and you want everyone to live free and you're not a big hit,

1073
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.420
and the opposite of fashion and all of these things in the opposite of their

1074
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.430
closer to fascists than we would ever be.
Well,
the guy,
the guy,

1075
00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.710
the verified guy who was calling me a fascist today,

1076
00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.950
also tagged stitcher radio in the tweet because they're,

1077
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.260
they're my hosting service now.
They don't host my podcast.
Anyway,

1078
00:54:46.261 --> 00:54:48.640
we're were released on Stitcher,
on them,
many of them.
But I go,

1079
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:50.610
who is acting as a fascist here?
Me,

1080
00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.980
the Guy Defending Andrew individual rights and freedom.

1081
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.480
Or The guy who's attacking me,

1082
00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:57.030
calling me a fascist and trying to get me booted off the plane.

1083
00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:00.520
This is one of those has more fascism in it than the,
I think at a,

1084
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.390
at a certain level that it was partly an accident,

1085
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.570
but partly on purpose that this,
this culture came to exist.

1086
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:11.070
People who are racist realized people hate racism.
What do you do?

1087
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.040
Claim to fight racism and empower racists.

1088
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.190
So what are we seeing antifascists been Portland screaming,
racial slurs,

1089
00:55:17.191 --> 00:55:20.670
a police screaming racial slurs at,
at,
at the,
those,
you know,

1090
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.320
criticize Patriot prayer all you want,

1091
00:55:22.321 --> 00:55:25.950
they've said as hadn't done really awful things.
Um,
in terms of their,

1092
00:55:25.951 --> 00:55:29.220
there've been videos of a tiny punching,
someone starting a fight.

1093
00:55:29.221 --> 00:55:31.470
I've seen it all,
but at the same time,

1094
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.350
you point out the people who run Patriot repair or not white.

1095
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:36.330
So when white people show up,

1096
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:39.660
white progressive's claiming their anti racists screaming racial slurs at police

1097
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.500
screaming racial slurs that conservatives bio means have your disagreements with

1098
00:55:43.501 --> 00:55:45.990
that group.
But I'm pretty sure you're the racists like that.

1099
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:48.990
Even by your own standard.
That's what I mean about a mass mental condition.

1100
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:50.130
Because you know,
Bret Weinstein,

1101
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:53.100
when the whole thing was happening at evergreen state,
he kept saying,

1102
00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:55.050
I thought this was the most fascinating part of the whole thing.

1103
00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:58.500
Beyond the absurdity of know being called racist for not wanting the school to

1104
00:55:58.501 --> 00:56:01.990
be segregated.
Sort of easy putting that aside.
Um,

1105
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.830
he said that the students that he actually feared,

1106
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.900
we're not the minority students.

1107
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.950
It was the white students behind them who had that look of,
you know,

1108
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:13.100
we've got the bat and we're going to Google you.
They're white.

1109
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.600
They have to really prove it right.
They have to really prove it.

1110
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.720
They're a form of white supremacists and this,
so I kind of,

1111
00:56:18.721 --> 00:56:20.160
I was planning this way for years.

1112
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.010
You have the what's called like a right wing white supremacist.

1113
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.230
These are people who believe that white people should be supreme and that they,

1114
00:56:27.231 --> 00:56:28.900
they,
they,
they try to accomplish that.

1115
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:31.360
And do you think these people have any incident of what you already said?
No.

1116
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.961
I mean look there,

1117
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:34.630
there are absolutely some people in power who hold these views.

1118
00:56:34.631 --> 00:56:37.450
I think it would be absurd not to think so,
but I don't think I thought,

1119
00:56:37.451 --> 00:56:40.580
I don't think it's as widespread as the left tries to claim it as any degree and

1120
00:56:40.581 --> 00:56:44.110
taught at universities.
I was working now is it?
Yeah,
but here's the thing.

1121
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.330
The left left,
left wing and right wing,

1122
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:51.420
left wing white supremacy is the idea that why people are supreme and so you end

1123
00:56:52.031 --> 00:56:52.990
up with over with,

1124
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:57.640
with white people believing they're the white saviors that must force other

1125
00:56:57.641 --> 00:56:58.930
white people to do as they're told.

1126
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.700
And so it gets really weird then when these left wing individuals who believe

1127
00:57:03.701 --> 00:57:08.220
that white people are supreme tell minorities what to do.
White supremacists,

1128
00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:10.710
you know,
I've told this story a couple of times.

1129
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.120
We'll do a couple more minutes here and then we're going to do a Q and a.

1130
00:57:13.121 --> 00:57:15.790
So get your questions in on super chat right now.
Um,

1131
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.670
but one of my real wake up moments to all of this,

1132
00:57:17.671 --> 00:57:19.920
I was on TYT once and you know,

1133
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:24.000
they were playing the clip of Fox News and do you might know David Webb who's a

1134
00:57:24.001 --> 00:57:27.030
conservative who happens to be black and we were falling.
That's right.

1135
00:57:27.031 --> 00:57:29.140
We were friends from our old Sirius XM days.

1136
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.760
We used to go out to dinner and have drinks and whatever.
And one of the hosts,

1137
00:57:32.761 --> 00:57:36.990
a white progressive who didn't know David Ignore,
know,
knew that I knew him,

1138
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:39.940
kept saying that he's the token black guy.
He's,
and it's like,
yeah,

1139
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.010
he's the uncle Tom.
He's like whatever you want to call it.

1140
00:57:43.011 --> 00:57:46.490
And that was one of the first moments for me where it was so obvious what it
was.

1141
00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:49.580
Cause I know David and I know he believes what he's believed.

1142
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.990
David's the one that he was on with,
uh,
Arriva Martin who's a progressive also.

1143
00:57:53.991 --> 00:57:57.350
And she didn't even realize,
I was like,
oh yeah.

1144
00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:01.070
And she called him out for his white privilege.
And then he goes,
yeah.
He goes,

1145
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:04.520
well,
I'm black.
And then she goes,
my people gave me the wrong information as if,

1146
00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:06.260
as if it's true.
Like,
Oh,
who are you speaking to?

1147
00:58:06.261 --> 00:58:08.240
Was a white guy or black guy during occupy Wall Street.

1148
00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:11.180
There was an argument about the merit of work or something.

1149
00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.210
I said a few things and was told as a white person,

1150
00:58:14.211 --> 00:58:17.810
I didn't understand and my opinions were invalid because I could never

1151
00:58:17.811 --> 00:58:21.080
understand being a marginalized person.
And then I said,
I'm actually mixed race.

1152
00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.160
And the response was,

1153
00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:24.470
<v 3>oh,</v>

1154
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.440
<v 1>I see what you're saying now.
No,
no,
I get it now.
And,
and I laughed.
I'm like,</v>

1155
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.270
I'm like,
you're racist.

1156
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.730
Like you'll only listen to me because you think I'm not white.

1157
00:58:33.731 --> 00:58:37.570
Like you're a racist when you,
it's the soft bigotry of low expectations.
We also,

1158
00:58:37.571 --> 00:58:41.320
it's like,
would you ever want that?
Like how big God damn deal.

1159
00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:44.830
I would never want anyone to give me anything better than the quality which you

1160
00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:46.900
don't give me.
So,
so amber Tamblyn,
uh,

1161
00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:50.020
there's a story that was out today or yesterday about a amber Tamblyn saying

1162
00:58:50.021 --> 00:58:52.030
she's not going to vote for Bernie.
She wants support a woman.

1163
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:55.900
And she said something like,
we now have a choice.
And to me,

1164
00:58:55.901 --> 00:58:59.530
I thought that was crazy.
I'm like,
as much as I am excited for the,
you know,

1165
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.540
people of color and women who are running for office,

1166
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.250
I certainly think that their perspectives,
we'll bring a unique,
you know,

1167
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:07.540
value to our political climate.
I wouldn't base my,

1168
00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.970
my vote on the color of their skin or their gender,

1169
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.450
but here is someone who actually says,
Bernie,
you're great but woman.

1170
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.820
And I'm like,
that doesn't mean your ideas are good.
Yeah.

1171
00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.780
There's a certain perspective you might hold that might be valuable.

1172
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:23.180
If that's expressed,
I would vote for the expressed perspective,

1173
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.550
but I'm not going to be like,
I won't vote for a man.

1174
00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.220
Are we going to do what do what a female Hitler emergence?

1175
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:30.830
Or you're going to be like,
well,
it's a woman or you're going to vote for,
uh,

1176
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.350
we talked like,
it's crazy though.
I hate to tell you this as a Bernie guy,

1177
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:36.110
but they're coming in for Birdie.
I mean,
well at the end of the day,

1178
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:38.750
by the next year and a half of an election,

1179
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:40.740
Bernie is the old white guy at the end.

1180
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.770
That's what you'd be already is and he will be done in destroyed by it is

1181
00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.730
increasing and this is why and that that was the whole thing.
In a weird way,

1182
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.510
in 2015 this is an important story.

1183
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:53.630
I was walking with one of my coworkers at fusion frothing at the mouth about how

1184
00:59:53.631 --> 00:59:54.500
much I loved Bernie.

1185
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:58.130
I was ranting loudly like going through all the things he said and done.

1186
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:59.690
Here's the important thing people don't realize.

1187
00:59:59.691 --> 01:00:02.840
In 2015 Bernie Sanders says no open borders.
That's a Koch brothers proposal.

1188
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:05.360
He says he's free trade agreements destroyed manufacturing this country,

1189
01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.590
we need stronger borders.

1190
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:09.980
Illegal immigration is bad because it's hurting the middle class and the and the

1191
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:13.340
lower class and I'm like,
he also talked about student loan forgiveness,

1192
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:15.920
expanding programs.
He's a little too left for me and a lot of areas,

1193
01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:18.590
but I was like,
this is a guy who means it.
It's one of the first times,

1194
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:21.890
but more importantly,
out of out of everything he was saying,
gun issue.

1195
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:24.980
It's an urban versus rural debate.
I'm like,
wow,
that's true.

1196
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:27.230
There's a very dramatic difference in perspective here.
I was like,

1197
01:00:27.231 --> 01:00:29.810
this guy's telling the truth.
What happens once it gets on stage?

1198
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.220
White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Bernie.

1199
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:36.080
That was pretty good.
That's all.
I wasn't even trying.
I'm like,
that.

1200
01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.120
That's not true.
What's going on here?
Then he goes,

1201
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.400
we must get equal pay for women,
and I'm like,

1202
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.090
we have three law is in place already.
Bernie,
what are you doing now?

1203
01:00:44.091 --> 01:00:45.740
I'm looking at the future we're in and I'm like,

1204
01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:49.430
Bernie decided to endorse Hillary and he and he started pushing this narrative

1205
01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:52.220
that has stepped him.
He's,
it's backfired on him.
Now they're saying,

1206
01:00:52.221 --> 01:00:56.210
I won't vote for a white men.
Sorry,
Bernie by,
there you go.
That's what you got.

1207
01:00:56.450 --> 01:01:00.860
So I've met with three houses though.
I will say this though,
I would,

1208
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:04.100
I,
I still lean in his direction.
Um,

1209
01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:06.790
I I do think is a little further to the left than I am,
but I,

1210
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.220
even after all of these things,
if I was going to vote and I'm,

1211
01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:13.430
I probably won't because I don't trust anybody.
If I would vote,

1212
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:16.520
he still has some Brownie points from me.
I still,
I still do like him,

1213
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.830
but I think he's kind of,
he shouldn't endorse Hillary.

1214
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.100
He shouldn't have pushed it into Terry and stuff.
And that really,

1215
01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:25.110
really pushed me away from him.
It did.
So,
uh,
I'm,

1216
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:29.540
I'm taking a close look at Tulsi Gabbert right now and I don't know if there's

1217
01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:32.450
anyone else I'd actually be interested in and I don't know a lot about Tulsa,

1218
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:35.210
so I don't want to say like I definitely would vote for,
but there's,

1219
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:38.180
there's a lot of things I like about her in terms of anti imperialism,

1220
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.670
no intervention in foreign wars and things like that.

1221
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.950
That sounds very trumpy into well but,
but it's,
it's libertarian,
right?

1222
01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:48.680
So you can be a right,
a right libertarian,
left libertarian.
The,

1223
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:51.380
the difference is what really bothers me is people always show the political

1224
01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:55.270
compass and they say Antifa is left libertarian.
Then as not true,

1225
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:58.400
Antifa uses violence to force an ideology on other people.

1226
01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:02.270
Left Libertarian are people with dreadlocks and peace symbols.

1227
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:06.740
They're sitting on a beach going or whatever and they want to be left alone,

1228
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:11.090
but they're cooperative,
so anarcho communism,
it exists.
It's simple.

1229
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:15.410
It's 10 people who live on a farm and one person grows corn.
One person,

1230
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:18.350
you know cooks meat and they just share and there's no real debate about who's

1231
01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:21.640
doing more than the other.
There's no quantification of the value.
I'll go.

1232
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.150
Communism works really,
really well in small groups.
It works really,

1233
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:26.790
really bad when you have to connect different communities to each other and

1234
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:29.700
quantify the amount of labor versus the value being given,

1235
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.390
in which case currency becomes extremely important and communism doesn't work at

1236
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:36.270
large scales without killing millions of people and getting into it.

1237
01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:39.090
So you may not be the perfect solution for absolutely.

1238
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:42.200
It's absolutely monopolist system of 350 something and then people with

1239
01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:44.430
different thoughts.
And the annoying thing to me is a,

1240
01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:47.550
I believe in a mixed economy,
um,
you have to have aspects of a free market.

1241
01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:50.820
You have to have some environment,
you have to some regulatory controls.

1242
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:53.790
I believe social programs are important because,
uh,

1243
01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.300
the laissez faire capitalism in my opinion,

1244
01:02:57.301 --> 01:03:02.100
results in runaway corporations and then it's no flex in an avalanche,

1245
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:06.630
right?
So I often use the,
uh,
clean water restoration act as an example.

1246
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:07.660
This,
the crane,

1247
01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.920
the clean water restoration act came out and I could begin my data wrong.

1248
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:14.020
It's been 15 years since I worked for these environmental organizations after a

1249
01:03:14.021 --> 01:03:17.790
river in Ohio started on fire because a bunch of different car companies were

1250
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.610
dumping pollution.
But at times it's not,
not very large levels.

1251
01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:23.840
So individually they'll look,
look,
I'm not doing anything.
We're pretty,
it's a,

1252
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.750
it's a minor amount.

1253
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:27.840
You needed someone to look at the bigger picture and be like,
guys,
it's on fire.

1254
01:03:27.841 --> 01:03:31.700
And it's because all of you together make a big problem.
So,
uh,

1255
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.310
a social contract was formed and everyone agreed to it and there's someone to

1256
01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:38.610
enforce it.
So,
um,
I believe,
you know,
that's where I get with regulation,

1257
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.930
but that's why I believe unchecked capitalism results in unfortunate veering off

1258
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:46.200
in random directions,
which can cause problems,
right?
Yeah.
All right,
so that,

1259
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:49.410
so let's just,
let's just do a little bit of youtube before we go too far,

1260
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.720
politics wise,
right.
There's a little more on youtube though.

1261
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:55.050
And then we'll do the Q and a.
So what do you make of what's going on on Youtube?

1262
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:58.230
Because I get people every day nine,

1263
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.110
I'm not talking about the trolls and the reddit losers and all that.

1264
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.910
I'm talking about real people who I know.

1265
01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:06.450
I mean it's often people that I've met at events who email me and say,
Dave,

1266
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:09.720
I've got unsubscribed from channel.
I call out youtube on it all the time.

1267
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.020
Once years ago I had an email address of someone at Youtube.

1268
01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:16.500
They actually gave me an email address and someone at Youtube told me there was

1269
01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:19.770
a bug on my channel.
Then when I followed up,
they stopped responding.

1270
01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:22.230
And then why don't you leave?
They told me to not.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1271
01:04:22.231 --> 01:04:25.280
And didn't you have like a livestream locked in place?
Was that you?
Oh yeah.

1272
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.440
We had to leave alive.
So if you would go to my homepage,
you know,

1273
01:04:28.441 --> 01:04:32.440
youtube.com/rubin report,
the video on the front would always say,
uh,

1274
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:35.430
the Rubin report is now alive even though we weren't.
So people would just,

1275
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:37.200
well click away.
And the point is,

1276
01:04:37.201 --> 01:04:41.280
without getting into all the bugs are just cry me a river.
All of this shit,

1277
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:44.390
all of this shit that we all kind of know.
Unsubscribes videos.
No,

1278
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.100
not going to feeds the demonetization.

1279
01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:50.260
They demonetize my video with Peter Boghossian and James Lindsey about,

1280
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.850
but it's really complicated.
Yeah.
So I'm just,
I'm just,

1281
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:56.870
I'm just shoveling stuff out here.
I made it.
I made a video,
uh,

1282
01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:00.000
John Stewart praise the Trump administration over the handling of the nine 11

1283
01:05:00.001 --> 01:05:02.330
victims fund made a video.
And I said,
uh,

1284
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.530
John Stewart praises Trump over nine 11 victims fund.

1285
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.390
And the point of that video was,

1286
01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.090
I agree with John Stewart wholeheartedly cut the politics out.

1287
01:05:09.091 --> 01:05:12.700
These are people who sacrificed their lives to to save lives.
And I,

1288
01:05:12.701 --> 01:05:15.540
I fully agree with doing everything we have to to take care of our first

1289
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:17.740
responders,
the video doing well,

1290
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:21.460
but listed no views until I took nine 11 out and changed it with first

1291
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:23.700
responders.
All of a sudden the views reappeared.

1292
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.930
I made another video about a woman,

1293
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:30.070
a Muslim woman from Egypt who was being berated by another woman in a parking

1294
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:34.180
lot.
And the point I was making with that video is I typically don't make videos

1295
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:37.780
about this because these people are being shamed already.
It's like,

1296
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:40.690
of course I don't agree with running up to a Muslim person and screaming at him.

1297
01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:43.000
And so this poor woman,
I am holy in her defense.

1298
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:46.480
And that was throttled to an extreme degree probably because it was about,

1299
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:47.950
you know,
Islam or Muslim or something.

1300
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.780
And so first I'll say Hanlon's razor never attribute to malice,
which is,

1301
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:53.920
he's explained by incompetence.

1302
01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:58.200
The do you monetization thing is rent is seemingly random.
So my,

1303
01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.690
my mom makes math videos,
they get demonetized nothing in them.

1304
01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.330
It's like two plus two is four and it's you monetized,

1305
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:09.190
I mean I made a video where I went to a raccoon cafe in Japan with my buddy
Luke,

1306
01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:12.150
and we're literally just feeding raccoons and giggling while hockey family music

1307
01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.920
place.
Cause I thought it'd be a fun video to make.
Do you monetized?
So,

1308
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:18.340
so I get that a lot of it could be random and it could be just,
you know,

1309
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:21.070
just ineptitude and all that.
The one that I just mentioned though,

1310
01:06:21.071 --> 01:06:23.910
where it already had a couple of hundred thousand views with Peter and you know,

1311
01:06:23.911 --> 01:06:26.620
when we're talking about the circle hooks and all that,
it's all about academia.

1312
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:28.770
I mean,
this is not something that could have an ad on it.
Uh,

1313
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:32.350
it got through the algorithm and it was monetized at first and then it was

1314
01:06:32.351 --> 01:06:36.290
manually confirm a manual review,
confirmed review unmonitored.

1315
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:40.090
Then I had to fight it publicly and they monetize it again.
Wow.
That's,
yeah.

1316
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.880
So that,
but,
but that's the finding that time is evidenced,

1317
01:06:43.881 --> 01:06:45.050
that's what I'm saying.
The reason I'm,

1318
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:48.070
the reason I always do this is because this is the only course of,

1319
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.460
I don't like doing it,
but it's the only course of action we have.

1320
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.040
And this is then where I think some of the lefties we'd say,

1321
01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:56.800
and now some of the Trump people would say government regulation,

1322
01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:01.720
they own all the pipes,
they own all the information.
And so I'll say this,
um,

1323
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:03.850
I said earlier,

1324
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:07.600
I would welcome regulation against Twitter because I believe it's becoming so

1325
01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:11.410
detrimental,
especially after talking to Jack and,
uh,
um,

1326
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.580
a vagina that that really tells you how the conversation went.
Well,
they,

1327
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.870
they look me in the eyes and said,
we are going to do what we think is right.

1328
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.520
We are an unelected.
Listen,

1329
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:26.550
Twitter is an unelected council of the Uber elite millionaires who are dictating

1330
01:07:26.951 --> 01:07:31.030
what people can or can't say on one of the most important public platforms in

1331
01:07:31.031 --> 01:07:33.500
our country,
in the world.
Who,
who,
who,

1332
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.800
who determined they should have that influence over our elections.

1333
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:40.630
I don't like a citizens United.
And yes,
I understand the nuances with,
you know,

1334
01:07:40.631 --> 01:07:44.110
taking away the right to speech through money means that best media companies

1335
01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:45.730
will hold so much power.
It's complicated.

1336
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.890
I don't want billionaires dictating our elections.

1337
01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:51.160
I don't want oligopolies forming and I certainly don't want Twitter joining

1338
01:07:51.161 --> 01:07:53.980
their party.
I see them say this and I say,
you know what?

1339
01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:57.850
Maybe the best thing would be a sledgehammer right now because the debate is,

1340
01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:01.720
is basically over.
They said,
they said basically we allow speech on our platform.

1341
01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:05.170
If you follow our rules while we know people are getting elected through your,

1342
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:08.560
through your platform,
and you've excised a large portion of the population,

1343
01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.420
knock it down,
here's a problem.

1344
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.560
Regulation wouldn't actually work on youtube or on other platforms because you

1345
01:08:14.561 --> 01:08:16.250
can't regulate to,
to create technology.

1346
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.520
The government can't go to youtube and say,
you must invent something.

1347
01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.690
Something just happened recently in Canada.
Well,
no,
but they could say you,

1348
01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:26.780
you have to treat all traffic equally.
You have to get,
sure it's impossible.
No,

1349
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:29.330
I'm not saying they should.
Wait,
what do you mean?
What do you mean?
So,
uh,

1350
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.250
youtube absolutely impossible.
Twitter.

1351
01:08:31.251 --> 01:08:33.800
It's more possible because Twitter could just timeline out,

1352
01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:35.330
like everything is chronological,
were done.

1353
01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.180
A bandings will based on First Amendment Youtube.

1354
01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:41.420
When you go to youtube.com there's 15 videos they show you that you can see

1355
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:43.280
there's 10 and then there's another bracket below,

1356
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:44.810
which usually is like a single person's channel.

1357
01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:47.750
They have to have an algorithm to determine what they should feed you.

1358
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:51.740
Otherwise no one gets any content fed to them at all.
Right.
So I get it.

1359
01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:54.680
It's not in a purely chronological feed that it doesn't work that way.

1360
01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:58.010
But there could,
again,
I see I'm not for this,
so it's hard to,

1361
01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:00.620
it's hard to take this position,
but if the government came in,

1362
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.390
there was something they could say that would probably make it fairer.

1363
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.340
I would not be for this.
So.
So you,

1364
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:10.190
so with the monetization you have no right to an advertiser,

1365
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:12.740
youtube is acting as your agent to sell chance.
Absolutely.

1366
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.750
And even when you demonetize,

1367
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.460
you still get a little bit when it comes to promotion,

1368
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.420
the Youtube Algorithm right now is probably one of the best meritocratic systems

1369
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.270
for content.
If your content is good.
Like I've had,

1370
01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:28.100
I've had unprecedented growth like in my career with youtube.
It took me years.

1371
01:09:28.101 --> 01:09:32.540
I've been doing this for,
you know,
what,
eight years now.
And,
and uh,
I gained,

1372
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:35.810
I hit 100,000 subs in like three months of actively being on Youtube.

1373
01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.380
It took me six years to get that on Twitter because Twitter is about,

1374
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:41.720
is people going to have people going to share your content?
Well,

1375
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:45.440
what works on Twitter is rage,
anger,
calling someone a Nazi.

1376
01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:48.350
You'll get retweets that gets you followers on Youtube.

1377
01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:51.440
It's making compelling content.
So you took the way better.
In my opinion,

1378
01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:54.470
the government will not be able to regulate youtube into working better.

1379
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.520
They won't.
So regulation won't work for Twitter.
I'm sorry,

1380
01:09:58.521 --> 01:10:01.660
what worked for Youtube?
It will work for Twitter and Facebook.
Uh,

1381
01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.620
Youtube could regulate,
uh,

1382
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.850
couldn't be regulated in certain capacities like a monkey.

1383
01:10:07.851 --> 01:10:11.480
Jones deserves every shout out.
I get possible whenever I do a video.

1384
01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:15.500
His channel was deleted without breaking any rules.
He made really edgy content.

1385
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:18.740
He made fun of Elliot Roger.
That's that shooter,
that incell shooter.

1386
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.350
And it was very clearly mocking the sky,

1387
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:25.850
but for whatever reason youtube said terminated his channel.
And I,
I still,

1388
01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.220
I still think it's important point out youtube does better than most other

1389
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:30.860
platforms in terms of protecting the rights of,
of speech.

1390
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.920
I really do believe that because I'll give you an example.

1391
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:37.450
Sargon said a naughty word on youtube.
It's still there.
It's still there,

1392
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.470
patriot and banned him.
So youtube was like,

1393
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:41.690
this video is not stripped of any rights or anything.

1394
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:45.830
We understand the context and so I can respect you to still pointing out
monkeys.

1395
01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:49.620
Band was insane.
It terrifying and really scary.
I'm,

1396
01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:53.210
I'm with you that I would chalk a lot of this up to just general ineptitude or

1397
01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:57.260
just that the thing has become so big.
You know,
it's a Goliath now and well,

1398
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:58.190
you know,
maybe you can't,

1399
01:10:58.191 --> 01:11:01.400
it can't withstand its own thing and the political forces and everything else.

1400
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:05.480
Um,
but I'm still,
I'm still not for regulators and hear them,

1401
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.950
but it's an interesting,

1402
01:11:06.951 --> 01:11:09.960
you can't ride around into discussion with many people and it's an interest five

1403
01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:14.970
to have.
Youtube is also really important for,
uh,
elections.
But the system,

1404
01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:17.790
the algorithm is it's meritocratic.
Meaning well,

1405
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:22.140
what if you knew tomorrow that within the algorithm they were doing something to

1406
01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:25.890
limit the scope of your videos,
the ability for your own subscribers.

1407
01:11:25.891 --> 01:11:29.370
I have to get your videos so you have three channels or they were making sure

1408
01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:33.300
that your people were being unsubscribed or a series of other things that there

1409
01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:35.910
is often much evidence to believe is happening.

1410
01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.890
What we got and then what do you do?
Hedge your bets.
I,

1411
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.500
this is why I started a second channel and now I'm launching subverse.

1412
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.910
I recognize that uh,
trying to make a living just off of youtube alone.

1413
01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:48.901
What isn't,

1414
01:11:48.901 --> 01:11:51.870
isn't isn't a safe bet because I've seen in the past it's not just us that's

1415
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:55.800
been affected by this.
There are people who just not even for political reasons,

1416
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:56.251
youtube,

1417
01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:59.040
we'll say we need to change the algorithm for x reason and then all of a sudden

1418
01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:03.270
someone's traffic drops by 80% so I recognize there's politics behind a lot of

1419
01:12:03.271 --> 01:12:07.860
it.
I trust that youtube for the most part is trying its best.

1420
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:12.720
But I do think that they're going to take a utilitarian approach in that Monkey

1421
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.930
Jones deleted channel even though to break any rules cause he's a threat to us.

1422
01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.520
That's,
that's Bs and that that worries me a lot.
Uh,
but,

1423
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:24.440
but ultimately I think the only thing you can really do is make alternate

1424
01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:27.510
channels and keep trying to figure out and evolve.
You can't just,

1425
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.300
you can't just cross your fingers and hope Youtube.
Cause here's the thing.
Look,

1426
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.740
youtube.com has 15 videos and that's the majority of most people's content.

1427
01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:36.510
When someone goes to youtube.com your videos there,

1428
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:40.080
youtube has no obligation to promote you when they do that.

1429
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:41.930
And there's no guarantee your content will,

1430
01:12:41.931 --> 01:12:46.710
will always fit what the algorithm wants.
So you,
you make content,

1431
01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.650
you're,
you're,
you know,
your,
your,
your skyrocketing,
your,
I think,

1432
01:12:49.651 --> 01:12:51.450
are you over a million yet?
You're really close to a million.

1433
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.180
We were right under it,
but I probably would have been there a year ago.
But yeah,

1434
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:58.050
so you're doing really well.
Everything's working.

1435
01:12:58.290 --> 01:12:59.970
But because your content is the same,

1436
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.790
youtube changes the algorithm like trace at several times a day,

1437
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:06.450
one day your traffic might just vanish and it's not political and you won't know

1438
01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:08.280
why.
Right?
So it's that.

1439
01:13:08.281 --> 01:13:11.070
It's the sort of lack of transparency and maybe there's interesting arguments

1440
01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:15.450
why there has to be a three.
Because when they,
when they were more open with it,

1441
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:19.340
it was all gamed and the videos were awful.
Like I remember back in the day it,

1442
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:21.300
there'll be a video called like it,
you know,

1443
01:13:21.301 --> 01:13:24.090
something stupid like big beautiful men bouncing on beach balls and you click
it,

1444
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:26.490
it's a black screen because they just want you to click it.
Well,

1445
01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:30.240
I mean I started this show on to Uit and that's what they taught us how to do

1446
01:13:30.241 --> 01:13:33.620
all of the worst type of clickbait and just,
I mean it just is,
I don't even,

1447
01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:36.330
I'm not even,
I'm not even,
but merging them,
that was,
that was just the game.

1448
01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:38.700
Then they taught us how to do the worst type of click made.

1449
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.420
There's a reason why there's so many videos where it's like Ben Shapiro destroys

1450
01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.040
with logic and facts.

1451
01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:46.950
It's because that structure was working for the algorithm and it still does.

1452
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:51.300
And uh,
for the most part,
the structure of like an all caps word,
um,
I do it too.

1453
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.020
It's because,
um,
youtube finds it acceptable to just emphasize a word.

1454
01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:56.850
You can't do a bold,
but,
uh,

1455
01:13:56.851 --> 01:14:00.030
and you can't convey emphasis on words through tax without doing a capital or

1456
01:14:00.031 --> 01:14:00.720
something.

1457
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.720
So that's a technique that works in the algorithm to get people to like pitch

1458
01:14:03.721 --> 01:14:07.410
the word and emphasis is important and conveying the meaning of your sentence.

1459
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:09.180
So as long as,
yeah,
whatever.
All right,

1460
01:14:09.181 --> 01:14:11.040
so let's just do one other thing and then we'll get to the Q and.
A,

1461
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:15.340
which is a piggy backing off what you just said so I can sense you're totally

1462
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:18.100
okay.
Basically with what's going on here because you're growing,

1463
01:14:18.101 --> 01:14:21.400
like your business is growing,
you're doing journalism that you love.

1464
01:14:21.401 --> 01:14:25.500
You strike me as one of the only sort of journey.
Well,

1465
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.170
while I was gonna say I'm,
I'm okay with that.
Well,
no,
no,

1466
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.190
but my point being is like we're watching all of the learn to code crowd that

1467
01:14:33.191 --> 01:14:36.190
was trying to get everybody,
all the trolls or whatever band.

1468
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:38.800
It's like they're buzzfeed's laying off people.

1469
01:14:38.801 --> 01:14:43.120
Huffpo got rid of the editorial staff.
Vox is horrible.
Daily beast is crap.

1470
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:43.983
Like all of these,

1471
01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:48.400
they're just giant monsters of crap who have lied to everybody for so long and

1472
01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.280
it's all,
nobody cares about any of it.
But what I'm watching right now,

1473
01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:55.780
and this is the reason I'm hopeful is a just by the very nature of what I'm

1474
01:14:55.781 --> 01:14:58.270
doing and I'm very proud of it and I think it's growing and it's good.

1475
01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:02.470
I think I see guys like you,
I see guys like Andy.
No.
Um,
uh,

1476
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.140
Nick Monro on Twitter who does an interesting,
he's doing actual journalism.

1477
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:10.720
He's leveraging Twitter for actual journalism.
I'm seeing people taking,

1478
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:13.150
take technology,
use it their own way.

1479
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:14.980
Peterson and I are working on this platform.
Like,

1480
01:15:14.981 --> 01:15:17.580
I think there's so much hopefulness here.
I've been this for you.
Yeah.

1481
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.300
Give me some good news before we do the Q and,

1482
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:23.380
and one of the main reasons youtube takes action against channels is because the

1483
01:15:23.381 --> 01:15:24.160
culture war.

1484
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.630
These digital journalists who write these absurd stories put pressure on

1485
01:15:28.631 --> 01:15:31.810
advertisers and then you test it has to do something to stop the bleed.

1486
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:34.690
As these companies lay more and more people off,

1487
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.270
there's less people to write lies about us.

1488
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:41.700
And that means youtube has less constrained.
So,
you know,
I,
I,

1489
01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:42.610
I get really frustrated.

1490
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:45.010
People point the finger at Youtube on things you took didn't do wrong.

1491
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.650
Point the fingers at the things they did wrong.
I got Monkey Jones.

1492
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:48.484
That was wrong.

1493
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:52.660
But a lot of issues like the monetization you t people think demonetization is

1494
01:15:52.661 --> 01:15:54.850
someone at Youtube twirling their mustache on and take your money away.

1495
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:56.560
It's like,
no,
no,
no.
You took just lost their money to,

1496
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:58.930
they don't want to do monetize if they don't have to,
but they're,

1497
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.280
they're scared of these fringe identitarian Weirdos at this media companies who

1498
01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:06.950
want to call you and Ansel and Youtube is trying to do its best to make sure

1499
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.170
here's this thing,
hit look.

1500
01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:13.650
You still get youtube red revenue when you can be monetized 100% that is youtube

1501
01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:17.800
putting up a barrier to protect you from these lunatics are lying about you.

1502
01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:21.760
So Youtube does things wrong.
Absolutely.
But they're doing better than a lot.

1503
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.140
And I truly believe that once these companies collapse under the weight of their

1504
01:16:26.141 --> 01:16:29.050
own incompetence and other cultural problems,

1505
01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:32.350
I think youtube is going to be more free to be like you guys.
We got you.

1506
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.660
You know,
so I mean look,
the fact that you're allowed to exist doing this,
you're,

1507
01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.740
you're,
you speak truth to power in a lot of ways.

1508
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.680
You do things that would never be allowed by some of these people at these media

1509
01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:42.071
companies.

1510
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:44.680
They never allow you to have certain people in here to talk about these things.

1511
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:48.400
Youtube has opened the door and a lot of ways continues to.
Yeah,

1512
01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:50.440
and while they have mistakes,
I'm,
I'm,

1513
01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:53.530
I'm hopeful because I know people at Youtube,
I've known them for years,

1514
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.380
that they,
I think there is a,

1515
01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.490
there's absolutely an ideological bent to a lot of people.

1516
01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:01.420
I do have some sources that work within Google have shared information that I

1517
01:17:01.421 --> 01:17:04.200
don't think it's as bad as a lot of people think it is.
I think there's,

1518
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:07.300
there's some points where it gets really bad the far left identitarianism within

1519
01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:08.020
the company,

1520
01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.940
but there's a lot of really hopeful in the area of free speech and protecting

1521
01:17:10.941 --> 01:17:14.540
rights that I think Google is aware of that other companies don't care about.

1522
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.040
Yeah.
Well I'm glad to hear that.

1523
01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:18.560
That's a nice way to wrap up this first half they were doing here.

1524
01:17:18.561 --> 01:17:20.840
And I would just add to that that yeah,
I'm,

1525
01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:23.330
I'm incredibly appreciative of youtube looking like,
look,

1526
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.660
my life is fucking amazing because of this.
Absolutely.
This is great.

1527
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:30.170
I love detective,
right?
So when I'm fighting it and when,
and I always say,

1528
01:17:30.171 --> 01:17:32.330
I'm tired of fighting you guys.
And it's like,
give me,

1529
01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.430
I don't have an email address.
Give me,
you don't even know,
but you don't,

1530
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:37.700
you know,
and it's like if you guys would just be a little bit better,

1531
01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:41.660
I think they'd get a lot.
I don't understand why at this point for you,

1532
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:46.010
especially youtube doesn't just unlock everything.
Um,
like do they,

1533
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.710
what do they think I'm going to do tomorrow?
Right.
No but,
but there,
there,

1534
01:17:48.711 --> 01:17:53.060
there have been conversations about giving people the option to choose the

1535
01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:57.290
amount of ties themselves.
Trusted,
trusted high profile.
Like your Dave Rubin.

1536
01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:58.520
Like they can look at your videos,

1537
01:17:58.521 --> 01:18:00.860
they know exactly what you're going to do and all these talk shows,

1538
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:04.740
it is a talk show that is in line with almost any other kind of talk show you'd

1539
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.180
see on TV that has normal advertisers.
I don't think there's going to be a big,

1540
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:11.120
you know,
like you,
you're not even like Tucker Carlson who,

1541
01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:13.180
who has like activist coming at them cause you're,

1542
01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.990
you're not even anywhere near where he is.

1543
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:18.920
So I'm surprised youtube hasn't come to you and says,
we think you're good to go,

1544
01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:22.580
period.
And they should.
I believe the system for you should be inverted.

1545
01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.180
It should be that right now your video gets the monetized.
You ask for a review.

1546
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.350
What should happen is your video should be monetized and they should have to

1547
01:18:30.351 --> 01:18:33.700
choose to review you because you're trusted.
You're,
you're,

1548
01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:38.640
you're studio Dave Ruben.
Mainstream conversation professional.
But it is,
it's,

1549
01:18:38.641 --> 01:18:40.040
it's,
this is another thing too,

1550
01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:42.500
is it's important to recognize and hope youtube does too.

1551
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:45.250
They need to create this protections because what you're doing is the,

1552
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.300
is the new mainstream talk show,
right?

1553
01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:50.750
The television networks are doing really well,
but these digital outlets,

1554
01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:55.630
not so much.
Uh,
in a lot of ways,
this is the professional fee,

1555
01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.140
you know,
five,
seven years,
five to six,
seven years ago,
youtube didn't have this.

1556
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:04.910
It had like,
I remember the first few I made,
it's like awful.
It's just so trashy.

1557
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.210
Half a million views and that through,
did you know it's news,

1558
01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.670
but I had no idea what I was doing.
The quality was trash,

1559
01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.690
but I've got half a million views.
Yeah,
because youtube didn't have this.
Now,

1560
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:15.860
youtube actually has,

1561
01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:19.730
there's a guy on youtube who does live high profile talk shows about political

1562
01:19:19.731 --> 01:19:22.820
issues that have serious ramifications on our culture and you've got a beautiful

1563
01:19:22.821 --> 01:19:25.790
set and you're not the only one.
So Youtube,

1564
01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:30.490
I'm sure they know this and at this point why,
why,
why is Seth Seth my uh,
what's,

1565
01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.900
who's the late night talk show hosts Seth Myers,

1566
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:35.870
he's a preferred partner and you're not,
they give him special access.

1567
01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:36.381
They don't give you,

1568
01:19:36.381 --> 01:19:39.920
that's ridiculous that if youtube wants to see their platform grow,

1569
01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.920
then they need to start coming to people like you.
And they do this to,

1570
01:19:42.921 --> 01:19:43.754
to a lot of people,

1571
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.850
but they absolutely need to comment and give special protections and,

1572
01:19:46.851 --> 01:19:50.930
and you know,
preferred access not just to the mainstream cable channel guys.

1573
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.560
You know what I mean?

1574
01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:55.790
Now I owe you 5% of the monetization of this video if it gets monetized.

1575
01:19:55.810 --> 01:19:56.180
All right,

1576
01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:59.620
here's where we were to take a one minute break and then we're going to do super

1577
01:19:59.621 --> 01:20:00.454
chat questions.

1578
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.630
<v 4>Get them in right now.
We'll,</v>

1579
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.300
we'll read them live and do our thing for as long as we can.
Alright.
Hang tight.

1580
01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:07.600
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

1581
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:14.240
<v 5>wow.</v>

1582
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:39.260
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

1583
01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:17.780
<v 5>wow.</v>

1584
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:22.170
[inaudible]

1585
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:38.780
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

1586

1587
01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.120
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

1588
01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.590
<v 2>all right,
we're back.
I think that was record time.
Yeah.</v>

1589
01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:54.300
We paid in different bathrooms real fast.
That was,
yeah,

1590
01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.480
the magic way out the door.
No magic of youtube right here.

1591
01:22:56.481 --> 01:23:00.050
We go before anything else this Friday,
if you're in the La area,
uh,

1592
01:23:00.051 --> 01:23:04.970
I'm at the Ice House comedy club.
Uh,
it's Friday,
March 8th.
It's me.
Stand up,

1593
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:08.320
mess around with the crowd audience Q and a.
Bring in an IDW member.

1594
01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.510
There's rumor that maybe 10 pool will be there.
Who the hell knows?

1595
01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:13.690
We'll see what happens.
Okay,
here we go.
I've got a zillion questions here.

1596
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:17.420
Keep throwing them in on a,
on super chat.
We'll get to as many as possible.
Uh,

1597
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:19.960
Tim,
you're an amazing example of journalistic integrity.

1598
01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:21.760
I'm glad your channels are getting traction.

1599
01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.460
The fact that you stuck to your principles,

1600
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:27.680
even when thinking the feed was down was amazing.
Referencing the Rogan brand.

1601
01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:33.210
Do you think vagina was rep referencing abuse and harassment honestly,

1602
01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:37.420
or was this ideological doublespeak so a lot of people were frustrated with her

1603
01:23:37.421 --> 01:23:41.950
because she kind of talks like a lawyer and in the nature of the conversation

1604
01:23:41.951 --> 01:23:43.450
she is a lawyer and that makes it tough.

1605
01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:47.640
<v 1>I think she believes what she was saying.
Um,
I think you like,
look,</v>

1606
01:23:47.641 --> 01:23:48.750
when it comes to ideology,

1607
01:23:49.230 --> 01:23:52.770
I don't think Jack and vagina are lying about what they truly believe is right.

1608
01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:56.400
I just think they don't realize they're wielding a giant sword and no one ever

1609
01:23:56.401 --> 01:24:00.870
gave them that.
They have no rights to that power.
So yeah.

1610
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:05.170
<v 2>Is there an immediate plan for Twitter to remove lifetime bans and form a review</v>

1611
01:24:05.171 --> 01:24:08.290
process where the SAR guns and Milo's of the world that seemed to have got

1612
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:11.540
<v 1>they,
they,
they,
they mentioned it being in the pipeline or something.</v>

1613
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:15.290
To me that sounds like it's never gonna happen.
Yeah.
You know,
it's too,

1614
01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:18.420
<v 2>Tim,
I know you are a rather unassuming guy.</v>

1615
01:24:18.421 --> 01:24:21.810
I'd like to say that you were a very good reporter and have unimpeachable

1616
01:24:21.811 --> 01:24:23.370
integrity.
Keep up the good work.

1617
01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:27.930
<v 1>Not even a question.
I am a man who read nice things,
right?
I am not perfect.</v>

1618
01:24:28.050 --> 01:24:30.840
Uh,
I,
you know,
I see all these things complimenting me.
I'm like,

1619
01:24:30.841 --> 01:24:33.720
I was just saying what I felt and I also feel like,
you know,

1620
01:24:33.721 --> 01:24:36.270
people like to call me objective and all these things.
Like,
dude,
I am,
I can,

1621
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.640
I told Joe,
listen,
I'm a centrist partisan.

1622
01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.580
I clearly support certain values and integrities,
uh,

1623
01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.580
integrity and integral principles.

1624
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:47.280
These are the things that led me to do journalism the way I do.

1625
01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:51.720
I don't want to act like I'm better than anybody else.
I Dunno.
Yeah.
Okay.

1626
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:52.391
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1627
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:56.740
do you think Twitter should or does hire people like yourself that keep an ear

1628
01:24:56.741 --> 01:25:01.720
to the ground or a,
they can simply hire a team to intake media like yours?

1629
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:05.800
There were many cases where they played ignorance to current events or cultural

1630
01:25:05.801 --> 01:25:06.260
events

1631
01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:09.830
<v 1>out of that,
that it's just,
we don't know.
We're pushing.
Yeah.
I asked them,</v>

1632
01:25:09.831 --> 01:25:12.160
why don't you open an office in a conservative area?
They said,
well,
our,

1633
01:25:12.161 --> 01:25:13.490
our trust and safety team is global.

1634
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:17.900
I think ultimately what happens is they're trying to decide what is or isn't

1635
01:25:17.901 --> 01:25:18.320
right.

1636
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.490
And they think they're smarter than 200 years of history and precedent set by

1637
01:25:22.491 --> 01:25:25.250
our institutions and our founding fathers and our ancestors.

1638
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:29.180
They're not what they believe they are.
It's a level of arrogance that is,

1639
01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.080
in my opinion,

1640
01:25:30.081 --> 01:25:33.470
it's normal human arrogance and it takes a certain understanding of philosophy

1641
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:38.390
to say,
I can never know what's right for,
for hundreds of millions of people.

1642
01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.030
I need to break up my power and disperse it.

1643
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:44.390
Jack seems to understand this concept when he talks about distributed networks

1644
01:25:44.391 --> 01:25:48.110
and blockchain stuff and I wonder why then he won't say,
you know,

1645
01:25:48.111 --> 01:25:50.330
the power that the tri force of,
of,

1646
01:25:50.331 --> 01:25:52.880
of Twitter needs to be fractured and send out different directions.

1647
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:55.040
That's what needs the power needs to be distributed.

1648
01:25:55.041 --> 01:25:56.150
It's too much for one person.

1649
01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.870
So you're saying that perhaps the distributed social network could be the

1650
01:25:59.871 --> 01:26:01.650
solution to some of this?
Um,
I'm,

1651
01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:03.780
we'll leave some people who were working on like,
is that what,

1652
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.980
is that what I want,
I'm just reading questions here.

1653
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.940
Just adding the thoughts that pop into my head,
but I,
but I will,
I will add,

1654
01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:11.060
that's been,
that's like,

1655
01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:13.780
I think you're in a race right now with a ton of other people that I'm like,

1656
01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:17.490
that's a beautiful thing.
I love that race right there.
There was diaspora.
Yup.
Uh,

1657
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:18.410
if you're familiar with diaspora,

1658
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:23.440
I mean people send me links to different and now we obviously mines is trying to

1659
01:26:23.841 --> 01:26:25.280
create,
it's a really interesting model.
It's a,

1660
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:28.250
it's got a central nucleus with semi decentralized,
which could work.

1661
01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:32.780
And I've been using that for my group organizing,
so we'll see.
Yeah.
Well look,

1662
01:26:32.781 --> 01:26:33.531
that's a beautiful thing.

1663
01:26:33.531 --> 01:26:35.960
Let the competition go and then maybe some of them will end up merging.

1664
01:26:35.961 --> 01:26:38.640
Competition is a great little,
yeah,
that's what it's all about.
Uh,

1665
01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.920
thanks for the stream fellows.
Okay.
Uh,
Hey Ruben,
do you think,
uh,
oh.
Hey Ruben.

1666
01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:46.810
Hey Tim.
Do you think that Trump will ever do a live stream with a utuber also,

1667
01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:50.720
Tim,
thanks for your reporting.
Much appreciated.
I think eventually he will.

1668
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.040
I think he's still like,

1669
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:55.100
I hope he will come in here and it will be bananas and Oh my God,

1670
01:26:55.101 --> 01:26:58.040
if I ever thought I got hate,
it'll,
it'll raise it to a whole new level.

1671
01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:03.080
But my feeling is that eventually he's using the mainstream media as their

1672
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:05.750
perfect rock and a hard place thing.
As long as he can.

1673
01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:07.790
And eventually something will shift,

1674
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:10.320
the symmetry will shift and he'll have to do something.

1675
01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:14.330
Like the challenge for me is on Trump is like,
I can criticize them all day,

1676
01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:17.060
but the media literally does that nonstop 24,
seven.

1677
01:27:17.061 --> 01:27:19.730
I feel like I'm not adding anything to the conversation to point out why I agree

1678
01:27:19.731 --> 01:27:22.760
with why they criticize him.
Yeah.
I also think it's insane.

1679
01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:24.620
Trump derangement syndrome is a serious problem.

1680
01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.250
You can clearly look at the things he's done that are working and not be a

1681
01:27:28.251 --> 01:27:31.970
lunatic and you can like whatever.
I don't wanna get on Trump.
I will rant.

1682
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:37.790
Um,
I worked for a major newly acquired tech company.
I'm a senior engineer.

1683
01:27:37.791 --> 01:27:40.730
Not many people are savvy to search algorithms.

1684
01:27:40.731 --> 01:27:44.400
How do we verify that our data is factual?
And an Arrow where our,

1685
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:48.320
where our sensors are few but powerful.
I mean,
this comes up all the time,
right?

1686
01:27:48.321 --> 01:27:52.730
It's like,
oh,
it's,
you can,
I mean,
look,
I w y you know,
people,

1687
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.340
you have a group of people who trust the mainstream media.

1688
01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:59.690
And Glenn Greenwald tweeted,
I feel sorry.
I genuinely feel sorry for the MSN.

1689
01:27:59.691 --> 01:27:59.990
You know,

1690
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:04.190
he was referencing MSNBC viewers who for years have been told Trump was working

1691
01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:05.150
for Putin and all stuff.

1692
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:08.480
And now that we're hearing the Mueller reports going to be anticlimactic and

1693
01:28:08.481 --> 01:28:12.020
there's probably nothing in it there.
They're losing their minds.
Like,
oh no,

1694
01:28:12.021 --> 01:28:15.830
our narrative.
What do you do?
Well,
you can't,
you,
you can't trust anybody.

1695
01:28:15.831 --> 01:28:19.940
It's insane.
I'm surprised.
I don't know what to tell you,
man.
Um,
it worries me.

1696
01:28:19.941 --> 01:28:22.620
I stay up at night sometimes.
Someone,
uh,

1697
01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:26.060
gave us four 99 in pounds on super chat and they said,

1698
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:28.550
[inaudible] pool a drink on me.
Dude killed it on rogue.
And what do you,

1699
01:28:28.551 --> 01:28:32.710
what do you drink?
Not Alcohol.
You don't drink any alcohol?
Well,
I,
uh,
I,

1700
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.770
yesterday I had some beer after the Rogan thing and I had a deep fried Oreos

1701
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:40.220
with ice cream.
So that was like,
that was fun.
We,

1702
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.700
I went out and I had a beer and I didn't finish it.
I drank about half of it.

1703
01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.010
I can't,
I can't,
I used to drink too much when I was young.

1704
01:28:46.011 --> 01:28:47.720
I just can't drink anymore.
It just doesn't work for me.
Well,

1705
01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:51.530
this is a Paleo House.
There are no Oreos in here,
but there is beer,
no beer.

1706
01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.520
You think about it,
chicken about it.
Like,
okay.
Satay peanut sauce or something.

1707
01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.820
Uh,
Tim,
I don't agree with your politics,

1708
01:28:58.821 --> 01:29:01.830
but I love how this discussion went or how your discussion went on.

1709
01:29:01.831 --> 01:29:04.800
Joe Rogan's podcast.
Well done,
sir.
A lot of,
but they're just saying nice things.

1710
01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.520
Um,
where are the people who ate me?
Let's see.
Okay,

1711
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:14.520
the word fascist,
hence Nazi is among the fighting words not protected.

1712
01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.880
Does this change either of your minds about these terms a chip ski versus New

1713
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:22.860
Hampshire?
I mean,
I,
I don't believe in hate speech period.

1714
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:27.450
So I think with the exception of the very tiny,
tiny limitations on speech,

1715
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:30.610
you can't yell fire in a crowded theater or quo coffered or direct violence.

1716
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:31.650
I think you can do whatever you want.

1717
01:29:31.651 --> 01:29:34.020
So even though those guys were calling us and Nazi today,

1718
01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:35.820
I'm not actually for them getting booted.

1719
01:29:35.821 --> 01:29:39.420
The only reason I was sharing it was to show the idiotic double standards is

1720
01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:40.760
actually after the interview of yes.

1721
01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.440
If Twitter wants to claim they're trying to prevent us from leaving.

1722
01:29:43.441 --> 01:29:46.920
The only reason I haven't left Twitter is because I'm an adult who understands

1723
01:29:46.921 --> 01:29:48.780
the,
in the world people say mean things.

1724
01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:52.230
But there are some people who are not emotionally mature enough and I think

1725
01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:55.310
there's so according to the more in common document by the hidden tribe,

1726
01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.580
scraped knees and you have enough data,

1727
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:59.670
progressive's are like 8% they're overwhelmingly white.

1728
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.180
They tend to make more than twice as likely to make $100,000 per year.

1729
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:06.390
What does that mean?
You've got a bunch of well off,

1730
01:30:06.391 --> 01:30:09.780
more likely to be well off white people who haven't been in the real world,

1731
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:10.770
who are,

1732
01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:13.410
who have bulldozer parents who have cleared every obstacle out from in front of

1733
01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:15.840
them.
And when they go out in the real world,
they meet someone who says,

1734
01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:20.790
I just plain don't like you.
And they go,
oh,
it's a real offense to them.

1735
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:24.480
They've never experienced that before.
Yeah,
I was homeless.
So I'll say this too.

1736
01:30:24.481 --> 01:30:27.740
When,
when it comes to like,
what if I got banned tomorrow when I,

1737
01:30:27.741 --> 01:30:29.670
when I went on a,
when I was on Rogan and I said,

1738
01:30:29.671 --> 01:30:33.240
the SPLC hope I hate chase bank is banning people is organizations are doing it.

1739
01:30:33.241 --> 01:30:35.190
And they could bend me too.
I don't care.

1740
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:38.850
You know what happened if I got banned on every platform right now,
I'd go,

1741
01:30:38.851 --> 01:30:41.900
I'd go kick on the beach,
have a coconut and be like,
ah.
I,
I would,

1742
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:46.450
I would honestly be like,
I'm glad it's finally over.
I can relax.
I am,
I am,
uh,
uh,

1743
01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.390
a hippie at heart,
lefty libertarian,

1744
01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.570
and I want to sit on in the middle of nowhere under some trees with the coconut

1745
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:55.260
and some buddies and just,
you know,
making our own fire,
finding her own food.

1746
01:30:55.261 --> 01:30:59.010
And I just want to be left alone.
And I have an unfortunate,

1747
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:01.140
something in my head where I'm passionate to,

1748
01:31:01.141 --> 01:31:03.240
to fight for these values in our society.

1749
01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:08.310
I have told myself this since I was like 18.
The moment it becomes too difficult,

1750
01:31:08.670 --> 01:31:09.720
I am gone.

1751
01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:14.370
And it's just been this ongoing passionate drive I've kept,

1752
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.290
kept going and kept working.

1753
01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:19.560
And now for some reason I was just in front of Jack Dorsey,
the CEO of Twitter.

1754
01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.650
Who the hell am I to sit in front of this multimillionaire,
billionaire?

1755
01:31:22.651 --> 01:31:26.550
Whatever is worth while you're somebody doing what you're supposed to do.

1756
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.380
I'm just a guy talks about stuff,
you know,
it's like,

1757
01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:32.520
but this is what you're supposed to be doing.
That's what the event and,
but,

1758
01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:36.060
and I'll say it again,
if,
if they all said,
you know what,
Tim,

1759
01:31:36.061 --> 01:31:38.430
we're going to ban you out.
Right?
I'd be like,
man,

1760
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:42.120
I'd get my car and I would just,
Oh my God,
you know,
let me tell you,

1761
01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:47.010
it sounds so awesome that some days I'm like,
man,
I can't stop.
I have to work.

1762
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.310
I haven't taken a day off in two years,
but sometimes I'm like,

1763
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:53.220
the only way I could stop as if they force me to,
that'd be so great.

1764
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:55.080
I'd go stay at the skate park for a week.

1765
01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.020
Just play some music with an acoustic guitar out under the stars.

1766
01:31:58.021 --> 01:32:02.140
Used to put you out of your [inaudible] knock you out of my misery.
Not Good.

1767
01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:05.890
Um,
hey Dave and Tim loved the work you guys do.
Tim,

1768
01:32:05.891 --> 01:32:10.000
do you plan to report on the SNC Lavaline scandal in Canada?

1769
01:32:10.001 --> 01:32:12.640
I actually don't know what that is.
I don't know about it,

1770
01:32:12.850 --> 01:32:15.130
but that reminds me of something,
I'm sorry,
I can't answer that question,

1771
01:32:15.131 --> 01:32:15.964
but I did want to point something out,

1772
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:19.570
I forgot about earlier when it came to why you can't regulate tech companies

1773
01:32:19.571 --> 01:32:20.500
into inventing things.

1774
01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:24.250
Canada passed a bill that would require Google to create a registry of,
you know,

1775
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:27.490
political ads.
So go that.
Okay.
And terminated all political ads.
Yeah.

1776
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:30.730
You can't invent something.
So I apologize,
I can't answer that,
but you know.
Okay.

1777
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:32.103
Um,

1778
01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:35.950
do you feel that the actors that you guys mentioned earlier actually hold those

1779
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:39.430
leftist opinions or do you feel that they are forced to espouse those opinions

1780
01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:43.210
by their publicist out of desire to look like the good guy?
You know,

1781
01:32:43.211 --> 01:32:46.920
there's a piece of me that when I,
when I saw the,
uh,
the thing with Brie Larson,

1782
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:48.190
you know,
at the award leaving,

1783
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.330
I actually sort of felt like she knows the movie's not gonna do well.

1784
01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.470
So it's like,
what do you do?

1785
01:32:53.471 --> 01:32:56.740
You get in front of it by making now a comment that's going to claiming as the

1786
01:32:56.741 --> 01:33:00.640
trolls are.
Yep.
Yep.
So you,
so it's like,
it wasn't that the movie wasn't good.

1787
01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:03.670
She Shit,
they destroyed me.
Like she walked it back a song.
I think,

1788
01:33:03.671 --> 01:33:07.140
I think the issue is there is a youtube are made of steel.

1789
01:33:07.141 --> 01:33:10.130
It might've been pissed after exactly.
A really school,
uh,

1790
01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.130
youtube or made a video where Michael B.

1791
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:15.250
Jordan is on the view and they're asking a black panther and he says,
you know,

1792
01:33:15.251 --> 01:33:16.980
look,
we're just here to celebrate who we are.

1793
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:20.650
We're not trying to bring anybody down.
And he brings up out in South Korea,

1794
01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:23.290
a bunch of other people from Indonesia.
I'll shut up in traditional clothing,

1795
01:33:23.291 --> 01:33:26.280
and it was really uplifting and everyone was happy.
And this year too,

1796
01:33:26.281 --> 01:33:27.790
where is like,
green check mark,
like,
oh,

1797
01:33:27.791 --> 01:33:29.350
that made me feel really good when Michael B.

1798
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:31.870
Jordan said that we're celebrating who we are with each other.
That's so awesome.

1799
01:33:31.871 --> 01:33:34.490
That's,
it's a,
it's a small world after.
All right.
So Disney is saying,

1800
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:38.200
unhappy Brie Larson does the head Bob,
this is will be wasn't made for you.

1801
01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:42.600
And I'm like,
oh,
whoa.
Why are you doing?
Like,
that's mean?
And then she,
she,
she,

1802
01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:45.340
she also has a bunch of tweets where she's like a Tsh.

1803
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:49.030
I simply looked at a TSA agent,
he has my phone number,
and I'm like,
oh,
come on,

1804
01:33:49.031 --> 01:33:53.440
man.
Like,
dude,
yeah,
I get it,
but can you please get adult?
Yeah.

1805
01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:58.240
Uh,
four liberals on Rogan debating whether Twitter is sensitive sensory and

1806
01:33:58.241 --> 01:34:01.660
conservatives and no conservative invited to the discussion.
Really,

1807
01:34:01.661 --> 01:34:05.020
really good points is how censored we are.
Yep.
But,

1808
01:34:05.021 --> 01:34:08.830
but that's a actually,
I actually really,
really good point.
I have no,

1809
01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:13.720
I have no response other than Yep.
I mean,
but look,
it was,

1810
01:34:13.721 --> 01:34:15.610
it was authoritarian,
left versus libertarian.

1811
01:34:15.611 --> 01:34:17.890
Laughs talking about the banning of Libertarians.

1812
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.630
And I don't mean big a libertarian.

1813
01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:23.200
So I think one of the things I should clarify too is the debate isn't about

1814
01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:25.990
conservatives are the most mostly getting the brunt of this,

1815
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.620
but there are libertarian left.
It's,
it's really about the authoritarian left.

1816
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:33.250
There's no real authoritarian,
right.
Other than like,
um,
well,

1817
01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:35.620
I don't want to name any of the mainstream politicians who fall into that

1818
01:34:35.621 --> 01:34:38.960
category.
That's Democrats too.
I'm not pointing,
I don't even,

1819
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:43.270
I don't even know who that would be really.
I'm not going to say it,
but it's,

1820
01:34:43.271 --> 01:34:47.320
it's,
it's,
it should be fairly obvious.
The mainstream corporatist Democrats,

1821
01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.960
they're authoritarian,
right.
As far as I'm concerned,
they've always been,

1822
01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:52.810
they are not in line with Bernie Sanders.
They hate Bernie Sanders.

1823
01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:54.010
They hate Tulsi Gabbert.

1824
01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:58.340
They hate the left libertarian people who want to end the foreign wars.

1825
01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.361
So you know,

1826
01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:04.250
anybody who was in favor of taking corporate money taking $300,000 from Goldman

1827
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.520
Sachs,

1828
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.430
but right before they announced so they can use that money and they're in favor

1829
01:35:07.431 --> 01:35:09.260
of military,
industrial,
complex foreign bombing,

1830
01:35:09.261 --> 01:35:10.640
another country's that's authoritarian.
Right.

1831
01:35:10.641 --> 01:35:14.720
And that includes Democrats and Republicans.
Fair enough.
Yeah.
Um,

1832
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:19.260
what is worth someone like Alex Jones who you know's exaggerating on things,
uh,

1833
01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:24.200
or buzzfeed who lie but pretend to be honest and the good guys feel free to come

1834
01:35:24.201 --> 01:35:26.660
back to Australia anytime.
I gladly will.
I think we're going to do it next year.

1835
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:27.663
Uh,

1836
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:32.090
Alex Jones made a statement that was read out by vagina that I believe was

1837
01:35:32.091 --> 01:35:32.660
indefensible.

1838
01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:36.140
He said he was encouraged to be able to do things politically and even

1839
01:35:36.141 --> 01:35:40.120
criminally and get your battle rifles ready.
And I understand,
you know,
if,

1840
01:35:40.150 --> 01:35:42.980
if it's supposed to be a joke or metaphorical or whatever,

1841
01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:46.790
but he did say it and you have to recognize there's,
he's got a huge audience.

1842
01:35:46.791 --> 01:35:49.790
People will take that literally and he can't do that.
However,

1843
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:51.740
that was an x one stream action.

1844
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.720
Buzzfeed is doing haymakers I did a video on my youtube channel where I

1845
01:35:56.721 --> 01:36:00.500
explained what,
what,
what you've got an uppercut,
a powerful boom to the face.

1846
01:36:00.501 --> 01:36:03.260
And then buzzfeed doing small jobs over and over again.

1847
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:07.340
Buzzfeed was on the Covington,
you know,
BS,
buzzfeed.

1848
01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:09.230
Even after it was proven.

1849
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:13.390
Their story about Michael Cohen and Trump was wrong so far.
So first of all,

1850
01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.950
that went away quick,
didn't it?
None of that.
They want to keep defending it.

1851
01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:19.760
Mueller Mueller came out and said,
the story is fake.
What is must we do?
Nope.

1852
01:36:19.761 --> 01:36:23.420
We stand by our sources.
Cohen testifies Trump never directly told me to lie.

1853
01:36:23.421 --> 01:36:26.690
It doesn't work that way.
Nope,
we were right.
It's like,
you know,
I mean,

1854
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:29.260
I mean it went away.
Not that the story went away.
I mean that it just,

1855
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:31.950
nobody really called them out with the left.
She was like check.
Cause it was,

1856
01:36:31.951 --> 01:36:35.810
it happened on a Friday and by Monday it was basically over.
It's,
and so,

1857
01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.900
you know,
I'm,
I'm curious and I mentioned this to,
uh,

1858
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:42.320
it's one of the problems with bias,
right?
Uh,
I think Jackson,
good guy,

1859
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:45.620
I think he's trying,
they didn't know who Johnathan Morgan was.

1860
01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:49.340
They knew who Jacob Wall was.
Why?
Because the journal journalists are like eight.

1861
01:36:49.341 --> 01:36:52.070
It's something like 72% of journalism jobs are in blue districts,

1862
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:55.970
so they're like,
Ooh,
Jacob Wall,
Jacob Wall,
Jonathan Morgan,
a democrat.
They don't,

1863
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:59.270
well,
you know,
even though he duped them,
even though this guy,

1864
01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:02.540
it's reported by the New York Times that he was engaging in this operation,

1865
01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:04.910
Facebook banned him for,
I think it's fair to say this happened,

1866
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:08.540
was manipulating national reporters and to smearing or Republican.

1867
01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:11.480
They still just kind of like,
they do,
they report on it.
That's fair.

1868
01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.050
But where was the outrage from the whole Twitterati all the digital media saying

1869
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:19.160
are the Democrats are meddling in our election.
Oh my God.
Nap.
Yeah.

1870
01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.320
Did any of the uh,

1871
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:25.340
verified journalists or politicians or whatever who were calling for violence or

1872
01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:27.530
punched those kids in the face or any of those?

1873
01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:31.260
Did any of them that get banned or suspended?
So I,

1874
01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.680
the only thing I can comment on is the,

1875
01:37:32.681 --> 01:37:35.180
the one guy I referenced over and over again who said lock him in school,

1876
01:37:35.181 --> 01:37:36.590
burnt down fire on them when you see them.

1877
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:39.290
He did get a suspension and was forced to delete those tweets.

1878
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:42.530
But I think it's absolutely hilarious that you can have someone like Chuck

1879
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:45.860
Johnson where he said he was raising money to take out,
you know,

1880
01:37:45.861 --> 01:37:50.660
deray and they're like,
oh better banned him perma ban,
no warning.
Just done.

1881
01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:52.310
And there was a,
I could be wrong,

1882
01:37:52.311 --> 01:37:55.330
but I believe there was a story about email leaks where like some up an

1883
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:58.140
individual was like just to get rid of him.
Then you have the,

1884
01:37:58.141 --> 01:38:00.440
this other guy who was like,
lock them in school,
bring it down.
No.

1885
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:02.190
Well please don't do this again,

1886
01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:06.420
please like calling for the death the kids versus insinuating you want to raise

1887
01:38:06.421 --> 01:38:09.450
money to do a hit piece on an individual that was,

1888
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.960
could be construed in a certain way.
I get it.
I would have had no problem with.

1889
01:38:12.961 --> 01:38:13.620
They said,
listen,

1890
01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:16.260
do you understand why people might think you're talking about killing somebody?

1891
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:19.170
Can you take this down and,
oh,
okay.
Sorry about that.
No,

1892
01:38:19.171 --> 01:38:23.130
they were like whack this other guy.
Just please just,

1893
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.590
we'll stop on.
Oh,
Lordy,
lordy.
All right guys.

1894
01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:27.510
We're going to get to as many as possible.
Just a reminder,

1895
01:38:27.511 --> 01:38:32.040
I am at the Ice House in Pasadena,
right here in La.
March 8th it's this Friday.

1896
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:35.400
Maybe Tim will be there.
Maybe an IDW.
No,
I promise you an Ibw guy.
I'll either,

1897
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:39.210
maybe 10 will be there.
I assume the link is right down below,
so check that out.

1898
01:38:39.211 --> 01:38:42.420
Or it's Dave rubin.com/events.
Okay,
here we go.

1899
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:45.780
My birthday is the following day too,
so it's,
yeah.
Oh,
well,
yeah,

1900
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.810
this changes everything.
That's why I'm staying in La for the weekend.
You know,

1901
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:52.370
I don't,
I don't know.
How old are you going to be?
33 33rd birthday in La.

1902
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:54.130
Three three this could ever,

1903
01:38:54.150 --> 01:38:57.120
you could end up with the coconut and just go off the grid.

1904
01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:02.280
That's how it all and all right,
here we go.
Uh,
although vagina was forthcoming,

1905
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:06.360
did you detect any tactical dishonesty in how she spoke?
Bows?

1906
01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:10.170
Worse damage control,
especially in comparison to Jackson.
Absolutely.

1907
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.090
Like when I brought up learn to code,

1908
01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:15.530
they prepared for it and she said it was connected to harassment campaigns on a

1909
01:39:15.531 --> 01:39:15.871
whole and then,

1910
01:39:15.871 --> 01:39:19.680
and that's why there's only a couple of times I actually stopped her and like in

1911
01:39:19.681 --> 01:39:23.040
anger,
I apologized for it because,
but I'm like,
I have to,
you know,

1912
01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:27.180
I want to give them time to answer because I didn't want to just start leveling

1913
01:39:27.181 --> 01:39:30.270
all these things and throwing them.
I wanted them to explain themselves,
be fair.

1914
01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:34.320
But when she went back on,
well,
it was a harassment.
I'm no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

1915
01:39:34.321 --> 01:39:34.680
no.

1916
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:37.950
The editor in chief of the daily caller was not harassing anybody who's tweeting

1917
01:39:37.951 --> 01:39:42.030
a joke and you locked him out of his account.
There is no explanation for that.

1918
01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:43.830
And following the episode with Joe,

1919
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:47.100
I got inundated with emails of people showing me that even when they were

1920
01:39:47.101 --> 01:39:52.020
tweeting to their friends,
someone responded to a conservative personality.

1921
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:54.410
They said,
Loi,
this is a really great thing.
And they may,

1922
01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:57.330
maybe this could help someone learn to code spending just joking at it.

1923
01:39:57.331 --> 01:39:57.871
Yet they're basically,

1924
01:39:57.871 --> 01:40:01.590
because basically I think what Twitter did was they were lobbied by activists,

1925
01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:05.570
activists who work for news organizations.
They say it's not true,
but I'm like,
I,

1926
01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:09.450
journalists were targeted in the first place,
um,
by people saying,
learn to code.

1927
01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.430
I can't imagine that wasn't the case.
And they said,

1928
01:40:11.431 --> 01:40:15.060
just band everybody who's just an algorithm that,
you know,
just,
yeah.
All right.

1929
01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:17.940
I'm calling it a lot of blood for a second because,
so we talked about the,
uh,

1930
01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:21.630
just sort of the business model of the media companies and why they are

1931
01:40:21.631 --> 01:40:21.961
criminally,

1932
01:40:21.961 --> 01:40:24.990
but what do you make it just the general state of journalists in general.

1933
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:28.680
Like I mentioned some of the journalists I like,
but there,
there are so many,

1934
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:30.800
these people that work at these companies.
I mean,
let,
let,
let,

1935
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:34.810
you could never have another job.
Like they could never,

1936
01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:36.900
they don't have a job in the first place.
Don't really.
Yeah.
You know,

1937
01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:39.370
I used to work for American,
I worked for American Airlines region.

1938
01:40:39.371 --> 01:40:41.070
I'll tell American Eagle lifting,

1939
01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:44.310
I believe around something like 50,000 pounds per day.
Um,

1940
01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:47.490
I part my hand at one point during this labor,
I was making 10 bucks an hour.

1941
01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.450
And then when I,
for the first time,
walked into a newsroom,
I went,

1942
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.710
how much are they getting paid per year?

1943
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.140
You're getting more than double what I got to write about Brad Pitt's junk.
Yeah.

1944
01:40:58.390 --> 01:41:00.670
What is,
and then they're saying they're not getting paid enough.
And I'm like,

1945
01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:04.450
wow,
you know,
vice a notoriously underpaid people,

1946
01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.180
but I never really thought of it much because I was like,

1947
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:09.460
you're upset that you're getting 30 grand a year.

1948
01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:13.390
Like I was getting 13 to lift bags and be insulted and do backbreaking labor

1949
01:41:13.391 --> 01:41:14.290
covered in sweat all day.

1950
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:17.510
This is paradise and that's another reason why I'm like,
I,

1951
01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:19.750
you really have no leverage over me.
These people,

1952
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:22.180
if they're threatening me with banning,
I really don't care.

1953
01:41:22.181 --> 01:41:25.090
You could take away my shoes,
my pants,
and I have.

1954
01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.450
I have seen the worst of the worst I have.
I have been to the favelas of Brazil.

1955
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:31.240
I have been to the old communist bloc housing in Ukraine.

1956
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:35.290
I have seen how bad things can really be an all I look at when I see the beauty

1957
01:41:35.291 --> 01:41:39.640
and comfort of America is spoiled brats who are complaining about how bad they

1958
01:41:39.641 --> 01:41:43.540
have it when they have it better than 99% of the world.
It's mind blowing to me.

1959
01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.610
Free his country,
the history of the world,
that bed,
Tim,
I'm so proud of you.

1960
01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:51.910
You stood your ground and held their feet to the fire.
Dave,
love you to fight on.

1961
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:54.280
All right.
That's okay.
And then another one I love.
Well,
here's the deal.

1962
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:57.190
We got three.
I love,
he's in a row that was just,
I love you.
Love you.
Tim.

1963
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:58.390
Been amazing to see your rise.

1964
01:41:58.391 --> 01:42:01.870
Please both of you keep defending free speech and expression.
Okay.
Um,

1965
01:42:02.290 --> 01:42:04.960
thanks for doing this important job.
This is an interesting one for you.

1966
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:08.950
Who would win in a tag team wrestling match.
Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson,

1967
01:42:08.951 --> 01:42:12.370
verse Dave Rubin and Eric Weinstein.
Uh,
you and Eric,
um,

1968
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:15.340
I'm not trying to be a Dick,
but Ben Shapiro is on the smaller yeah,
but no,

1969
01:42:15.341 --> 01:42:18.100
it's true.
I mean,
but Jordan's got long reach.
He's got long reach,

1970
01:42:18.101 --> 01:42:21.790
but then you're,
uh,
you're,
you're a little taller than average,
so you could,

1971
01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:25.570
you could probably easily counter against Jordan if you put some,
you know,
but,

1972
01:42:25.571 --> 01:42:30.550
but Eric is got the,
the,
the curb weight he could easily crush,
man.
Yeah,
he's,

1973
01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.240
he's,
he's,
he,
yeah,
he's got the white claw,
his way out classes.
You know,
both.

1974
01:42:34.241 --> 01:42:36.350
So I think you guys together,
it's an unfair,
you know,

1975
01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:40.900
the memes are already coming out.
Oh,
this is a good one.
Oh,
and I actually,

1976
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:41.860
I was going to ask you this,

1977
01:42:41.861 --> 01:42:44.650
but I only saw about 80% of the whole thing yesterday cause I didn't realize it

1978
01:42:44.651 --> 01:42:46.090
was on until I have to click your bed store.

1979
01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:50.660
Why didn't you ask about why Louis Farrakhan's account is allowed?
Man,
I,

1980
01:42:50.670 --> 01:42:53.710
you know,
I'll be honest,
there was a bunch of stuff that just,
I didn't get to,

1981
01:42:53.711 --> 01:42:56.530
I had notes and I was checking them too.
And there was just,

1982
01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:01.680
I felt like there was so much and at a,
at a certain point too,
he's,

1983
01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.690
they've addressed it and I don't know,
there,
there,

1984
01:43:04.691 --> 01:43:06.910
there were a couple of people that afterwards I was like,
God,

1985
01:43:06.911 --> 01:43:10.390
that's a really good point.
You know,
I just,
I'm not perfect.

1986
01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:14.620
A lot of people thought that I wasn't the right person for the job.
Um,
I look,

1987
01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:17.320
I see a lot of people praising you.
You're like,
wow,
Tim was perfect for this.

1988
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:19.810
Some people are strapped saying,
Ben Shapiro should've been the right person.

1989
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:23.030
And I'm like,
yeah,
maybe.
I don't know.
I,

1990
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:26.380
when Joe give mean conservative people that we were saying from the conservative

1991
01:43:26.381 --> 01:43:28.970
side thing,
you weren't being hard enough.
Yeah,
I actually didn't see any of that.

1992
01:43:29.210 --> 01:43:32.710
Uh,
there were there comments from people and even like,
you know,

1993
01:43:32.711 --> 01:43:35.410
I'll say this too,
it seems like Sam Harris has fans absolutely tested me.

1994
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:37.450
I don't know,
whatever.
Uh,

1995
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:41.200
but there are conservative people who thought it would've been better if Ben

1996
01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.070
Shapiro was there instead.
Because,
you know,
maybe,
I don't know.

1997
01:43:45.071 --> 01:43:47.710
I think Ben Shapiro is really good at what he does and it's a good point that

1998
01:43:47.711 --> 01:43:49.930
he's a conservative and I'm not.
Um,

1999
01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.740
while I certainly have tracked a of this news,

2000
01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.090
maybe that would have made more sense.

2001
01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:57.680
All I can say is I got asked to do it and my response to,
to Joe was,
Joe,

2002
01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.980
I'm a little burned up in a tree that just got us down feathers and you're

2003
01:44:00.981 --> 01:44:03.800
kicking me out of the nest right now by asking me to do this.
I'll do it.

2004
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:06.200
And he was like,
yeah,
yeah,
come on man.
He's like,
you're a smart guy.
And I'm like,

2005
01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:08.120
let's go,
you know,
so

2006
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:10.930
<v 2>beautiful thing.
Just doing what you're supposed to be doing,
I guess.
Yeah.</v>

2007
01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:12.080
Love both y'all.

2008
01:44:12.081 --> 01:44:15.410
I'm a conservative and I have many strong political differences with you guys,

2009
01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:18.410
but I appreciate both of you for your dedication and seeking the truth rather

2010
01:44:18.411 --> 01:44:20.990
than promoting politically convenient narratives.
Right on.
Thank you.

2011
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:25.670
<v 1>Maybe the conspiracy is some organization created the regressive left to unify</v>

2012
01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:29.070
depth,
like ma,
like you're moderate liberal and conservatives and to allying

2013
01:44:29.970 --> 01:44:33.030
<v 2>good.
Why do I keep getting invited to conservative things where I go up there,</v>

2014
01:44:33.031 --> 01:44:36.000
I tell them all these things that I disagreed with them and they keep inviting

2015
01:44:36.001 --> 01:44:39.850
me back.
It's very bizarre,
you know?
I mean,
really,
if me and you said,
well,

2016
01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:43.120
let's try it right now.
If,
if,
uh,
if a progressive,
uh,

2017
01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:47.640
organization and not to mock us or to whatever would invite us to a,

2018
01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:51.990
to a university or something,
would you do it?
Absolutely.
All right.
So let's see.

2019
01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:54.870
Maybe somebody will invite us,
but yeah,
probably not.
Um,

2020
01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:59.460
has anyone looked into the contractor's Twitter uses to moderate tweets?

2021
01:44:59.461 --> 01:45:03.740
Jack mentioned also the other social media companies use the same ones.
Could be,

2022
01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:04.740
could that be part of the bias?
You know,

2023
01:45:04.741 --> 01:45:07.830
there was an interesting moment where he said the thing about they're looking

2024
01:45:07.831 --> 01:45:12.750
into allowing the user to have control of whether the responses could be seen.

2025
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:16.080
And I thought that was interesting because what I notice is now that now that

2026
01:45:16.081 --> 01:45:18.060
I'm high profile,
every time I tweet,

2027
01:45:18.061 --> 01:45:20.550
I could tweet a picture of my dog and I get a million people in.

2028
01:45:20.551 --> 01:45:23.000
They're telling me I'm a,
I'm a Nazi and the rest of it and you can,

2029
01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.070
and they know that the worst that they are to me,
the more likes it gets.

2030
01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:30.890
So the idea of shutting down replies I think is,
is interesting.
But,
but then he,

2031
01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.910
he sort of walked it back cause then he said no,

2032
01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:36.390
we would let the users have to click an extra click.
Right.

2033
01:45:36.810 --> 01:45:37.440
<v 1>That's so,</v>

2034
01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.770
so basically they're trialing the system where when you tweet and someone

2035
01:45:40.771 --> 01:45:42.180
responds,
you can mute them.

2036
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:46.350
So no one can see it unless you go to the bottom and then like open up the muted

2037
01:45:46.351 --> 01:45:47.184
posts or whatever.

2038
01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:50.290
<v 2>Right.
So I guess there's something valuable there.
Right here.
Here's a,</v>

2039
01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:53.680
you can sort of push it down then I guess Twitter,
the problem with Twitter is,

2040
01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:56.390
is how do you get rewarded on Twitter?

2041
01:45:57.530 --> 01:46:01.910
<v 1>Anger.
Yeah.
Insults.
So I know some,
some people who are,</v>

2042
01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:04.640
they used to be regular journalists.
There's a guy I used to work with,
uh,

2043
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:07.400
when I would do some guest hosting for a certain network and he was a normal

2044
01:46:07.401 --> 01:46:09.800
dude.
We got along,
we have basically the same politics.

2045
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.740
And then he realized he gained followers by replying to Donald Trump.

2046
01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.530
And what did he do now it's like,
I look at his Twitter and I'm like,

2047
01:46:15.531 --> 01:46:17.360
what the Hell is wrong with you?
Like that's,

2048
01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:19.610
I mean for sure they say the same thing to me.

2049
01:46:19.611 --> 01:46:22.250
But admittedly I think it's funny when they,
uh,

2050
01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:24.980
to move into another point when they're like,
Tim,
you changed.

2051
01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:27.710
They claim on being red.
Pilled and then I made a video where I was like,

2052
01:46:27.711 --> 01:46:31.310
here's an article for 2012 from 2012 where I was calling up black bloc

2053
01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:33.650
anarchists for getting violent and they physically attacked me.

2054
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:36.800
You want to tell me?
My opinions have changed.
I'm sure many of them have.

2055
01:46:36.801 --> 01:46:39.700
Absolutely.
I look at my videos,
but you can also go 2012 and see,

2056
01:46:39.701 --> 01:46:42.080
I have always been at odds with these people.
They hate my guts.

2057
01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:43.700
They physically attack me numerous times,

2058
01:46:43.701 --> 01:46:46.970
aren't occupy because I believe in being,
I'll tell you exactly what happened.

2059
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:50.190
I filmed some people draining the out of a tire wasn't intentional.

2060
01:46:50.191 --> 01:46:51.780
I didn't seek them out.
I just saw him and I filmed it.

2061
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:56.700
They came to me later and said,
if you don't produce propaganda for us,

2062
01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.630
we will stop you.

2063
01:46:58.170 --> 01:47:03.030
They wanted me specifically to film the things they would point to like only

2064
01:47:03.031 --> 01:47:05.940
filmed the police don't feel,
must let us do our thing.
And I said no,

2065
01:47:05.970 --> 01:47:08.550
I'm going to let people know exactly what's happening.
So they did.

2066
01:47:08.551 --> 01:47:10.810
I was a tech several times and it's,
it's been,

2067
01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.160
it's like to think that there are people who are like,

2068
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:17.090
I don't understand why Tim is calling out Antifa.
Oh No.
It's like,
hey,

2069
01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.940
have you ever watched anything I've ever done?
Like we there,
there,
there's a,

2070
01:47:20.941 --> 01:47:24.540
there's an article about me in like some magazine was a picture of me being held

2071
01:47:24.541 --> 01:47:29.310
back by cops while I was fighting a guy in black bloc in 2011 and come on man.

2072
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:31.890
Well,
so the idea that you've been putting all of that aside,

2073
01:47:31.891 --> 01:47:34.800
the idea that you're not allowed to evolve or change your opinion.
Oh,
exactly.

2074
01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:37.200
Sad.
And,
and,
and,
and like somebody,

2075
01:47:37.201 --> 01:47:38.430
there was a recently a video where it was like,

2076
01:47:38.431 --> 01:47:42.180
Dave Rubin's opinion changing over time and people are gasping.
And I'm like,

2077
01:47:42.450 --> 01:47:45.690
so you took old videos of Reuben and then you realize that as he got older he

2078
01:47:45.691 --> 01:47:49.360
read things and changes opinion that doesn't,
well,
how was that in writing them?

2079
01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:53.820
Literally every week for the last five years as I've changed on things.

2080
01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:55.620
I've talked about it openly like,
but you don't,

2081
01:47:55.650 --> 01:47:58.770
you don't really bothers me about,
uh,
I,
I think,
look,
I'll be honest,

2082
01:47:58.771 --> 01:48:01.800
I think there's absolute criticism that you can be criticized for.

2083
01:48:01.801 --> 01:48:04.830
I think you're,
I'm not Jesus.
Right,
exactly.
Criticize the hell out of me.

2084
01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:08.040
I remember watching one of your videos.
You had someone who was like,

2085
01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:13.080
I'm very much like on the left and social justice and I was watching it and then

2086
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:16.290
like shortly after I saw someone say that they posted a link to like an older

2087
01:48:16.291 --> 01:48:17.460
interview did with like,

2088
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.370
you know Jordan Peterson and they said all Reuben ever does is talk to

2089
01:48:20.371 --> 01:48:22.890
conservatives.
And I was like,
you know what unit it is?

2090
01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:23.760
They do the same thing to me.

2091
01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:28.560
They only share these videos and they assume you're not talking to people.

2092
01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:31.920
And I'm like,
go to his channel,
just click videos.
I went there,
I'm like,

2093
01:48:31.921 --> 01:48:34.080
who is this?
I'm like,
oh that person's like kind of on the left.

2094
01:48:34.650 --> 01:48:36.450
Someone broke it down once on Facebook.

2095
01:48:36.451 --> 01:48:39.720
They took literally every interview I've ever done and it actually leaned,

2096
01:48:39.721 --> 01:48:40.620
mostly left.

2097
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:44.460
It's like a split between like slightly left in a little bit libertarian.

2098
01:48:44.461 --> 01:48:44.950
And they,

2099
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:48.150
they do the same thing to me where they'll take select videos and then be like,

2100
01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:52.220
look at this video,
Tim dead.
And I'm like,
did you watch it?
You know?

2101
01:48:52.230 --> 01:48:55.560
So actually a really good example of this back when I'm comedy was watching.

2102
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:57.840
You don't want them to watch as a really good point.

2103
01:48:57.841 --> 01:49:01.560
When Comey was testifying a couple of years ago,
he uh,

2104
01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:03.900
I made the video titled Did,
did uh,

2105
01:49:03.901 --> 01:49:07.500
did James Call me lie under oath question mark because conservatives are saying

2106
01:49:07.530 --> 01:49:09.360
he did.
Liberals were saying,
of course not,

2107
01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:13.080
and my liberal friends were outraged that I would dare make a video accusing him

2108
01:49:13.081 --> 01:49:17.250
of lying.
I didn't.
In fact the video concludes he likely didn't.
And here's why.

2109
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:20.820
The reason I post it as a question was so that I was neutral to both factions.

2110
01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:23.010
I'm not going to tell you what he did or didn't do.

2111
01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:25.290
I'm going to ask the question if you're interested,

2112
01:49:25.530 --> 01:49:27.690
I can then walk you to why I believe a certain thing.

2113
01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:31.350
They were upset that I didn't make a video outright defending them even though I

2114
01:49:31.351 --> 01:49:34.470
did.
Yeah.
They wanted the title to definitively say conservatives are stupid.

2115
01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.680
James Comey is not a lie around like it was a really neutral title,

2116
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:40.320
but they got angry about it.
Bow Forever,
man.

2117
01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:43.540
Or they're not going to stay with you as a fellow south sider.

2118
01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:46.380
I watch your shows because you reminds me of hanging out with my buddies at the

2119
01:49:46.381 --> 01:49:49.700
park.
What parks did you hang out at?
Keep up the great work.
Both of them.

2120
01:49:50.290 --> 01:49:53.710
They don't,
they don't park southwest side of Chicago.
And um,

2121
01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:57.880
Westlawn uh,
Tim,
I'm so proud of you.

2122
01:49:57.881 --> 01:50:01.090
You stood your ground and held their feet to the fire.
Dave,
love you to fight on.

2123
01:50:01.091 --> 01:50:05.110
Okay.
We've got another just generic.
I love you.
Thank you.
Thanks for doing this.

2124
01:50:05.111 --> 01:50:08.020
Important job.
Thank you.
We already did the wrestling one.
Thank you.

2125
01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.630
Let me scroll the other way.
Um,

2126
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:13.840
Kudos for yesterday's podcast.
Question.

2127
01:50:13.841 --> 01:50:18.790
Is there any politician openly discussing anti monopoly laws in the digital

2128
01:50:18.791 --> 01:50:22.120
space?
I'm looking at Twitter,
Facebook,
Google,
Amazon,

2129
01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:26.530
and their kin de facto monopolies.
Well,
I guess I'm not sure.
I think,

2130
01:50:26.531 --> 01:50:29.760
I think you know when,
when,
when jump is kind of talking about it,
right?
But I,

2131
01:50:29.761 --> 01:50:33.790
I feel like jump Trump Trump gets his opinions and from Fox News,

2132
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:36.940
like you literally will tag Tucker Carlson and Hannity after he hears them.

2133
01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:39.820
And I,
I look,
I gotta be honest.
I don't blame him.
I don't expect him.

2134
01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:42.400
He's a president and he's going,
he's doing work.
Yeah,
the left has,

2135
01:50:42.401 --> 01:50:43.510
wants to apply.
He's not doing work,

2136
01:50:43.511 --> 01:50:45.610
but I'm sure at the end of the day turns on the news.
That's what he hears.

2137
01:50:45.611 --> 01:50:49.270
And then he tweets about it.
So He's,
he's a few steps behind the rest of us.

2138
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:50.860
So I think he is concerned.

2139
01:50:50.861 --> 01:50:54.190
He mentioned the executive order on free speech on campuses.
I've seen,
uh,

2140
01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:58.990
I think,
um,
um,
Jonathan Haidt was critical of it,
but by Weinstein was positive.

2141
01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:00.310
So there's,
there's some debate here,

2142
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:03.490
but when I saw Jack Dorsey testifying before Congress,

2143
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.020
they had no idea with how they're talking about.

2144
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:07.450
There was like one good interview where the guy said,

2145
01:51:07.451 --> 01:51:10.930
why is Twitter defaulting only democratic politicians when you sign up in DC?

2146
01:51:10.931 --> 01:51:14.050
And Jack was like,
uh,
I don't know.
Well that's also,

2147
01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:17.800
but that's also why to me regulation that we don't have to get back into it.

2148
01:51:17.801 --> 01:51:19.060
But it's like,
that's why that makes some sense.

2149
01:51:19.061 --> 01:51:22.270
The idea that the government could understand what a tech company would have to

2150
01:51:22.271 --> 01:51:26.050
do.
Like I pay my property taxes on a California state website.

2151
01:51:26.051 --> 01:51:30.220
It looks like prodigy 1996 you're like that.
They'd come in and be like,

2152
01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:32.850
we know the tech,
Twitter,
Twitter is Twitter as much government.

2153
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:36.700
Twitter is much easier to regulate because in terms of when you first sign up,

2154
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:39.010
you get recommended Democrats.
They could say,
okay,

2155
01:51:39.070 --> 01:51:42.180
get rid of that because that's favoring one side.
If he can't solve the solution,

2156
01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.220
get rid of it.
When it comes to actual content on Twitter,

2157
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:48.280
it's a reverse chronological feed.
You can still follow whoever you want.

2158
01:51:48.281 --> 01:51:49.510
You'll see what they post when they post it.

2159
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:52.190
Well that's assuming they're not shadow banning and doing a bunch of others.

2160
01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:54.130
That's what I mean.
We have reasoning,
so if that's the,

2161
01:51:54.190 --> 01:51:56.080
if the regulation is Twitter,

2162
01:51:56.470 --> 01:52:00.610
you must abide by free speech as set forth by this as,

2163
01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:05.140
as as a precedent set forth by the Supreme Court.
Therefore,
you know,

2164
01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:08.110
if something is illegal law enforcing,
we'll take care of it.

2165
01:52:08.170 --> 01:52:09.640
It'll be taken down with a lot,
like,
you know,

2166
01:52:09.641 --> 01:52:12.040
a lawful order or whatever that could,
that could,

2167
01:52:12.041 --> 01:52:13.780
that could work because Twitter doesn't have any more,

2168
01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:16.900
that's not super complicated.
They are trying to do algorithmic feeds,

2169
01:52:16.901 --> 01:52:20.770
which I think is a bad idea of global idea.
No.
Jeez.
All right.

2170
01:52:21.190 --> 01:52:26.020
Um,
do either of you agree with radios banding Michael Jackson now in the wake of

2171
01:52:26.021 --> 01:52:29.340
leaving?
Other than that,
so it hasn't,
it's Neverland.
I haven't seen it yet.
Yeah,

2172
01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:31.510
I haven't seen it.
I mean,
I've heard we knew,

2173
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:37.030
I mean south park and how many episodes where Michael Jackson was like,
you know,

2174
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:40.990
doing weird things with the kids.
Like,
you know,
separate that from the artists.

2175
01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:44.140
Do I think Brie Larson is snooty?
I do.
Um,

2176
01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:47.000
is that the reason why I chose to skip Captain Roberts?
We're going,
it's not,

2177
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:50.420
it's because you combine that with the marketing of the film and I was worried

2178
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:54.740
I'd sit through another last Jedi.
Yeah.
So you know,
with Chris Evans,

2179
01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:56.750
I really don't like the things he posts.

2180
01:52:56.751 --> 01:52:59.700
He comes off as someone who thinks he's smart and he's not like he was,

2181
01:52:59.710 --> 01:53:02.930
he uses obscure small words to make it seem like it's got a big vocabulary.

2182
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:05.100
Are you telling me he could possibly be worse than Rafal?

2183
01:53:05.110 --> 01:53:08.940
Cause Ruffalo is unbearable.
And I told him really the hope.
Now I'm like Ah,
but,

2184
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:13.160
but you know,
I separate the from narratives.
So my job was terrible.
And look,

2185
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:15.980
you know,
when you go back in time and start making,
getting,
you know,

2186
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:18.440
raising your arms and wiggling in the air because maybe it's called outside as

2187
01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:23.150
offensive today.
You know what I think it is?
Honestly,
it's because,

2188
01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:26.300
uh,
the far left and right mean different things depending on what you're talking

2189
01:53:26.301 --> 01:53:27.620
about.
Economics or culture,

2190
01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:32.510
far left and far right often are used to refer in most instances I believe

2191
01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:35.360
traditional versus progressive.
So the far left,

2192
01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:40.220
the extremists and progressive culture want to purge history.
It's,
it's what,

2193
01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.030
it's what I believe that is in China.
What does,
I don't remember what it was.
Um,

2194
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:46.400
the culture evolution,
I think where they're like,

2195
01:53:46.401 --> 01:53:49.790
let's get rid of the old and build the new.
So they want to purge baby,

2196
01:53:49.791 --> 01:53:52.550
it's cold outside.
They want to get rid of old songs because they were offensive.

2197
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:56.300
Even though we understand the era of and we've gotten rid of these things.

2198
01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:59.990
It's also the height of pomposity to think that all,
I mean you,

2199
01:53:59.991 --> 01:54:01.190
you said this earlier basically,

2200
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:05.980
but to think that the thousands of years of human history that it was also wrong

2201
01:54:05.981 --> 01:54:09.620
and,
but you,
you have somehow gained the insight,

2202
01:54:09.621 --> 01:54:13.670
well all those morons before you couldn't figure out and if only you had the

2203
01:54:13.671 --> 01:54:17.510
power over.
This is one of my favorite points to make in this conversation.

2204
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.380
The,
in the,
uh,

2205
01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:24.200
in English common law we have the presumption of innocence and that's actually,

2206
01:54:24.450 --> 01:54:25.340
that's actually in the Bible.

2207
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.350
So when you look at where society is today and one of the most important tenants

2208
01:54:30.351 --> 01:54:33.230
of a free society,
liberal democracy in our English common law,

2209
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:37.370
the idea that we would say it is better that 10 guilty persons escape than one

2210
01:54:37.371 --> 01:54:40.880
innocent suffer is not an original idea from Blackstone.

2211
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:41.930
It's bites on formulation.

2212
01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:44.720
It's actually biblical in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

2213
01:54:44.721 --> 01:54:47.030
And I believe his name was lot.
I,
uh,

2214
01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:50.000
so there's a lot of people I know on the left where like the Bible is Hokey bs.

2215
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:53.060
It's like,
I agree a lot of it is,
but also don't forget,

2216
01:54:53.061 --> 01:54:56.930
a lot of our institutions today started there and brought us to a certain point.

2217
01:54:56.931 --> 01:55:00.890
The story was simple.
God was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.
And he said,

2218
01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.770
for the sake of 50 righteous people,
I want to destroy it.
And then he asked,

2219
01:55:03.771 --> 01:55:07.460
what about 30,
what about 20?
And God said,
even for one righteous person,

2220
01:55:07.461 --> 01:55:11.890
I will not destroy the city.
And that taught us a long time ago.
That Bible,
the,

2221
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:12.471
the old,

2222
01:55:12.471 --> 01:55:16.070
the old testament is full of crazy things we do not want to employ today.

2223
01:55:16.190 --> 01:55:20.330
And modern religions don't like modern Judaism and Christianity do not adhere to

2224
01:55:20.331 --> 01:55:21.440
like stoning people.

2225
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.180
But we do still maintained the presumption of innocence and the right,

2226
01:55:25.181 --> 01:55:26.990
the protecting the righteous,
you know,

2227
01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:29.090
meet even if it means all the bad people get to go free.

2228
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:34.370
So the point I want to make is we built our society.
We haven't,

2229
01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:36.410
we haven't just destroyed everything in our wake.

2230
01:55:36.411 --> 01:55:37.820
We're not burning the bridge behind us.

2231
01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:40.910
We're getting rid of the bad things and keeping the good things and there are

2232
01:55:40.911 --> 01:55:45.060
people that are so extreme to the left,
they want to destroy everything.
Baby.

2233
01:55:45.061 --> 01:55:46.650
It's cold outside is a classic song.

2234
01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:48.870
We understand why it can make some people angry,

2235
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:51.920
but for the most part it really doesn't.
It's fake outrage.
Yeah.
You know,

2236
01:55:51.930 --> 01:55:54.660
and they want to get rid of it until like we can keep these things.

2237
01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:57.900
And the other important issue is to,
when it comes to the,

2238
01:55:57.930 --> 01:55:59.850
like the statute debate of confederate statues,

2239
01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:01.680
I usually take a rather centrist approach.

2240
01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:04.470
Why don't we put it in a museum and then put a placard there explaining what

2241
01:56:04.471 --> 01:56:07.890
history was and why we changed it.
Because then you maintain your history,

2242
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:10.920
the stat sectors in a museum where people can still learn about their history

2243
01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:13.710
and then people can say,
we've changed as a society,

2244
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:15.780
but we always need to remember our past.

2245
01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:19.800
I think that's a very unfair position I would be for,
you could just put,

2246
01:56:19.801 --> 01:56:22.470
you could even leave them there in some cases and still put the statue,

2247
01:56:22.471 --> 01:56:26.310
but at least,
or you know,
put up,
put up a plaque of explaining there.
There's a,

2248
01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.980
uh,
uh,
looney tunes,
I think it was,
maybe it was Disney.

2249
01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:32.910
A cartoon was up on Youtube of historical cartoons that were like black face and

2250
01:56:32.911 --> 01:56:36.060
really offensive.
And there's a disclaimer saying,
please remember,

2251
01:56:36.061 --> 01:56:38.520
this was from a different time and we understand why these things are offensive

2252
01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:41.070
and wrong,
and to pretend like this didn't exist,

2253
01:56:41.071 --> 01:56:44.010
which would be to pretend our racist history also didn't exist.

2254
01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:46.890
And we don't want to do that.
I agree.
Yeah,
absolutely agree.

2255
01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:49.050
Well also it's that they'll come for everything.
You know,

2256
01:56:49.051 --> 01:56:51.690
the creators we have really guide now are saying they're not going to make gay

2257
01:56:51.691 --> 01:56:52.860
jokes anymore.
So what do you,
well,

2258
01:56:52.861 --> 01:56:54.990
you're not going to engage with whether you still going to make black jokes or

2259
01:56:54.991 --> 01:56:57.990
you can still look and make Jew jokes and what can we do?
You know,
they,

2260
01:56:58.200 --> 01:56:58.891
they're not doing it.

2261
01:56:58.891 --> 01:57:01.820
And who decided they're right in the sense that they are that I think,

2262
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:04.650
do they flip on that?
Well,
I think it was fake news actually.

2263
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:07.070
It was fake news that they're getting rid of poo in the company.

2264
01:57:07.090 --> 01:57:09.120
The producers were like,
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
we're not what you're talking about,

2265
01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:12.300
dear God,
I hope you're right.
But here's,
here's the thing.
When the story broke,

2266
01:57:12.301 --> 01:57:13.460
they were gonna get rid of Arpu.
Yeah.

2267
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:16.170
There was actually a backlash among the regressive left.

2268
01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.510
I don't wanna say the regressive left,
but social justice activist saying,

2269
01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:22.110
you're getting rid of a strong migrant business owner.

2270
01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.170
Like Apu wasn't a negative stereotype.

2271
01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:28.380
He was a successful business owner about immigration.
He was homeless,

2272
01:57:28.381 --> 01:57:29.260
friend yelled,
he was.

2273
01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:31.170
He's actually the heart of that and there's a whole freaking town.

2274
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:34.170
There's an episode about a proposition to send him home and it became a citizen

2275
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:37.860
so quick.
A lot of,
exactly.
A lot of people were like,

2276
01:57:37.861 --> 01:57:41.090
here you have one of the most positive depictions of an Indian American migrant

2277
01:57:41.091 --> 01:57:44.940
who successfully runs a business and because some people are upset by it,

2278
01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:48.450
they're going to get rid of it when some people actually appreciate it.
Yeah.

2279
01:57:48.451 --> 01:57:51.000
I'm curious though,
we'll have to just Google this after,

2280
01:57:51.001 --> 01:57:55.350
but I think they said it was real because then Hank Azaria said he won't do the

2281
01:57:55.351 --> 01:57:58.650
voice anymore because they got to him and he's a white guy even though he's the

2282
01:57:58.651 --> 01:58:01.400
greatest,
you know,
voiceover actor of a generation,
as you said,

2283
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:03.830
I shouldn't have done it or I won't do,
they don't get,

2284
01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.660
they never returned the money.
Right.
So he's not returning all the games.

2285
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:12.690
I'll do one more on that issue.
You know why fake news will never stop money.

2286
01:58:12.691 --> 01:58:15.360
You publish fake news story.
You make all the money.

2287
01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:19.290
You wish your attraction two days later,
you keep all the money.
Yeah.
All right.

2288
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:22.210
Uh,
okay.
Let's do a,
we'll do two more.
Uh,

2289
01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:26.100
Tim made a point about how people are scared about appearing racist and jumping

2290
01:58:26.101 --> 01:58:27.570
ship to other platforms.

2291
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:32.490
This may be a double edged sword that breeds SJW thinking for the people who

2292
01:58:32.491 --> 01:58:37.491
stay on Twitter over compensating for their anti racism resulting in shoe color

2293
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:40.500
equals racist.
That's actually pretty interesting.

2294
01:58:40.590 --> 01:58:45.590
Like w so the idea is that you don't want to leave to go to say gap or something

2295
01:58:45.911 --> 01:58:47.890
like that,
that people will say you're racist.

2296
01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:52.360
So then you stay on Twitter and then over time I suppose you sort of get dumbed

2297
01:58:52.361 --> 01:58:54.580
down into just now you still want clicks,

2298
01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:58.350
so then you just do what you gotta do it again.
I don't know what,

2299
01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:00.100
what I do if I'm understanding the question probably,

2300
01:59:00.101 --> 01:59:04.450
but I do know is that gap is growing.
Dissenter is dissenter is I got to say,

2301
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:06.990
you know dissenters brilliant.
Don't descend Torres.

2302
01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:08.290
I know it just came out through the,

2303
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:13.030
it's a browser extension that creates a comment section for any website.

2304
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:17.080
And when I heard they were doing that,
I went,
Whoa,
that was really,
really smart.

2305
01:59:17.081 --> 01:59:17.914
It's so simple.

2306
01:59:18.190 --> 01:59:21.740
Now there is an issue in that the value of Twitter for me is the news feed.

2307
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:23.890
They don't care about the stupid opinions of the crazy people.

2308
01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:27.310
But seeing the breaking news is really important for me.
It's one of my sources.

2309
01:59:27.311 --> 01:59:30.640
So Gab doesn't work for that.
Gab Gab is good for the people who use Gab.

2310
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.150
And I also want to stress too,
I don't care for the fake news.
Uh,

2311
01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:37.600
the best I could understand is that when I did my research,
a study was done,

2312
01:59:37.601 --> 01:59:40.690
found gabs hate speech is about 5% of all posts.
Twitter as,

2313
01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:44.530
as 2.4 somewhere in those numbers gap is not that much worse.

2314
01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:47.170
And my understanding is it's predominantly like Trump supporters.

2315
01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:50.860
They got bad actors for sure.
Yeah.
Twitter has substantially more bad actors.

2316
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:55.540
That weird thing when the,
when the guy shot up the the temple and uh,

2317
01:59:55.570 --> 01:59:58.330
was that Not Philadelphia?
Oh,
the Twitter user.
Yeah.
I'm blanking.

2318
01:59:58.331 --> 02:00:01.190
The Twitter user who did it?
[inaudible] he was a Twitter user,
but they,

2319
02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:05.110
but all stories were about his gab again,
because he was also a gap user.
Right.

2320
02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:08.080
That was the point I was trying to make.
He was on Twitter.
Who's on Facebook,

2321
02:00:08.081 --> 02:00:09.440
you know?
Yeah.
All right.
I'm gonna,

2322
02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:12.340
I'm gonna ask a deep dark one right now to end this thing,

2323
02:00:12.341 --> 02:00:14.620
but then we'll try to end it in a little positive.
No,

2324
02:00:14.621 --> 02:00:18.610
but I do get this question often that public or things to please Tim.
Do you,

2325
02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:19.900
do you think,
uh,

2326
02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:23.230
we could be looking at a potential civil war or information where,
I mean,

2327
02:00:23.231 --> 02:00:25.130
I guess we're in it.
Well,
the inflammation wars happening.
Yeah.

2328
02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:27.010
That's why I date and society's lying about us.
Yeah.

2329
02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:30.380
But I think it's really funny when I mentioned,
you know,
cause I'll,

2330
02:00:30.381 --> 02:00:32.950
I'll absolutely say yes,
there's going to be some kind of civil war.

2331
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:35.770
We may be in it.
And um,
it's funny,

2332
02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:39.520
most people don't freak out because they understand,
I'm not like a prepper.

2333
02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.950
I'm not saying that we're going to be,
you know,

2334
02:00:41.951 --> 02:00:43.930
all the buildings will be destroyed and it'll be like Syria.

2335
02:00:43.931 --> 02:00:46.180
I'm saying there's gonna be some kind of insurgency.
You know,

2336
02:00:46.181 --> 02:00:48.160
we had the guys show up at the school in Eugene,
Oregon,

2337
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:50.680
smash the Patriarchy and chill,
pull that a concealed gun,

2338
02:00:50.681 --> 02:00:54.070
fire two rounds at a cop a week later.
Protesters at the far left came and said,

2339
02:00:54.071 --> 02:00:57.400
you killed our comrade.
A week later someone planted a bomb at a police station.

2340
02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.910
You made a good point by the way that these things were extremely underreported

2341
02:01:00.911 --> 02:01:02.380
because Oh,
absolutely.
Theme there.

2342
02:01:02.381 --> 02:01:05.590
They were all coming from the left and then when the guy planted the bomb and in

2343
02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:08.740
Houston on a statue and then tried to act like it wasn't by drinking the

2344
02:01:08.741 --> 02:01:11.020
explosive,
the liquid,
you know,
he's using for it.

2345
02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:13.330
So we had the escalation of violence.

2346
02:01:13.690 --> 02:01:15.790
We have people marching through the streets with guns.

2347
02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:19.720
We now have far left and uh,
yes to an extent,

2348
02:01:19.721 --> 02:01:22.370
far right groups that it's actually,
I'll say this,
I,
I'm,

2349
02:01:22.371 --> 02:01:25.330
I'm not super familiar with the far right groups that are prominent and
marching.

2350
02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:28.360
There are right wing groups that are marching around and libertarian groups,

2351
02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:31.870
but you do have far left communist factions that are armed and marching around.

2352
02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:37.180
One important point though is that I have seen people associated with the left

2353
02:01:37.181 --> 02:01:38.020
and the right who are,

2354
02:01:38.110 --> 02:01:42.320
who have guns at and they have more respect for each other than anyone else.

2355
02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:45.860
So it was an interesting thing.
I saw a rally in Texas.

2356
02:01:45.861 --> 02:01:48.320
There was a guy that was a left wing protesters here to right wing protests are

2357
02:01:48.321 --> 02:01:51.650
both armed and they were laughing and smiling at each other asking about,

2358
02:01:51.651 --> 02:01:54.350
you know,
because I think the gun give them a common connection.
They were,

2359
02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:57.260
they understood the importance of the training,
the discipline,

2360
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:59.690
what the point I want to make is,
uh,

2361
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:04.610
I think we're going to see some kind of insurgency people point to the weather

2362
02:02:04.611 --> 02:02:05.240
underground and say,

2363
02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.000
we had this before my understanding of the weather underground.
It was,

2364
02:02:08.001 --> 02:02:09.860
it was shocking.
It was late night.
No,

2365
02:02:09.861 --> 02:02:13.130
people were around while someone planted a bomb at a police station in Eugene,

2366
02:02:13.131 --> 02:02:15.470
Oregon.
And they,
it was real.

2367
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:19.060
And it was during the day when people were there and the guy mowing the lawn saw

2368
02:02:19.061 --> 02:02:22.120
it.
They had to come in and deal with it.
Um,
you know,
we,

2369
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:25.380
so I think the,
the,

2370
02:02:25.850 --> 02:02:28.580
the nightmare scenario for me is for one,
what are we seeing right now?

2371
02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:31.790
Chase Bank,
shutting people down?
Only a couple of counts so far.

2372
02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:35.720
Mastercard has shot a couple.
Uh,
I believe at least one person,
maybe more,

2373
02:02:35.721 --> 02:02:39.260
I could be wrong.
Patrion Twitter banning people are moving to Gab,

2374
02:02:39.261 --> 02:02:41.990
but people are moving to mind as people are moving to other platforms bit.
Shoot.

2375
02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:46.490
So I've,
I've,
I talked about the emergence of a parallel society on Twitter,

2376
02:02:46.491 --> 02:02:49.310
at least right now.
Like Jack Dorsey mentioned Megan Phelps,

2377
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:52.760
the Westboro Baptist Church got to interact with people and it pulled her out of

2378
02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:57.360
the church they're doing away with that.
They are guaranteeing that uh,

2379
02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:00.110
the way it was,
it was actually explaining this,
so I mentioned this,

2380
02:03:00.111 --> 02:03:01.040
but it was Joey salads,

2381
02:03:01.041 --> 02:03:04.610
the youtuber who went through that whole redemption process.
He said,

2382
02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:05.510
when you ban people,

2383
02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:08.180
you're taking like some dude who just smokes pot and putting them in prison with

2384
02:03:08.181 --> 02:03:10.670
some murderers.
Like what do you think is going to do to those people?

2385
02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:13.760
So you've got someone on Twitter who was banned for saying men aren't women,

2386
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:15.560
and then they're like your band.

2387
02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:18.800
The only place they can go is where there's actual white supremacists and Nazis.

2388
02:03:19.190 --> 02:03:21.440
What do you think is going to happen to those people when they're surrounded by

2389
02:03:21.441 --> 02:03:25.530
this?
And it's the only community that engages with them.
And that's why,
uh,

2390
02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:26.930
I liked,
I like telling the story of Joe.

2391
02:03:26.931 --> 02:03:30.570
I did an interview with him recently when,
uh,
if you,
you know,
Joey sales is,

2392
02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:33.080
he did that video where you hired black people to smash your Trump card.

2393
02:03:33.370 --> 02:03:35.450
It's horrible,
horrible,
terrible,
terrible thing to do.

2394
02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:38.930
And when he tweeted at me the first time,
I got so angry this fake news guy,

2395
02:03:38.931 --> 02:03:42.110
cause he represented the fake news people,
I hated so much doing the same thing.

2396
02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:45.590
And then I realized this guy is trying not to be that guy anymore.

2397
02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:46.580
If I don't let him,

2398
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:50.150
he's going to go back to being the bad guy if you don't give them a chance.

2399
02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:51.080
And he got a chance.

2400
02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:55.070
And the important thing here is he went from making these extremists rage bait,

2401
02:03:55.071 --> 02:03:55.641
fake news,

2402
02:03:55.641 --> 02:04:00.110
racist videos to like one of his latest videos was him wearing a wig and using a

2403
02:04:00.111 --> 02:04:04.880
bait purse that sprayed someone with milk,
like the most hokey,
PG 13 silly prank.

2404
02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:06.650
And I'm like,
there you go.

2405
02:04:06.770 --> 02:04:10.190
The videos he's making now are so mainstream and normal and Hokey,

2406
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:12.020
he realized what he was doing was wrong.

2407
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:14.390
What he said to me was he didn't realize how far he had gone.

2408
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:16.490
He kept doing it and doing it and doing it was getting worse and he didn't

2409
02:04:16.491 --> 02:04:18.860
realize how bad it was getting.
And then,
you know,

2410
02:04:18.861 --> 02:04:21.340
it's only because he was able to come clean and people let him,

2411
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:24.190
he did get banned from Youtube that now he's uh,
he's just,
uh,

2412
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:28.520
like probably a normal conservative.
He makes silly videos.

2413
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.440
Where would he be if he was banned?

2414
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:35.150
He'd be hanging out on the dark corners of the web with the people who liked him

2415
02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.950
being fed,
constant negative and racist opinions.

2416
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:41.790
And you are the summation of the people who surround you.
So that terrifies me.

2417
02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:43.410
And what's even worse,
as Jack said,

2418
02:04:43.411 --> 02:04:46.980
I fear that the darkness and I know it's happening and that's when I said the

2419
02:04:46.981 --> 02:04:50.340
snowflake doesn't blame itself.
All of these companies are doing it.

2420
02:04:50.610 --> 02:04:54.120
They are creating.
So the reason I bring this up right now is it may be early,

2421
02:04:54.210 --> 02:04:57.770
it may never happen,
but we are looking at the beginning with banks,

2422
02:04:57.771 --> 02:05:02.490
banning people with patriots,
with,
with social networks,
parallel networks,

2423
02:05:02.491 --> 02:05:04.830
emerging subscribe.
Stars are really good example.

2424
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:08.990
This is the formation of a parallel economy where people are using foreign,
uh,

2425
02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:12.570
credit card processors now because the mains than the American ones won't do it.

2426
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:16.170
Now you've got people who are completely on a separate economic system and they

2427
02:05:16.171 --> 02:05:17.670
can still interact for the time being.

2428
02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:21.210
But what happens when your credit card doesn't work anymore and you can't go to

2429
02:05:21.211 --> 02:05:23.660
any regular store.
So now you're,

2430
02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:27.360
you can only go to certain stores and these people aren't going to just die.

2431
02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:29.940
They're not going to give up on life.
They're going to say,

2432
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:34.120
you people have kicked me out.
I don't like you.
You're my enemy.
You're gonna.
So,

2433
02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:38.910
so it looks like the pattern is obvious in my opinion.
If they don't stop,

2434
02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:42.630
you will at least end up with hundreds of thousands of people excise from

2435
02:05:42.631 --> 02:05:46.200
society if we're not already there.
And what happens when they say,

2436
02:05:46.201 --> 02:05:49.230
I want to have a rally.
They say,
oh,
these people are coming from Gab.

2437
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:51.430
They must be neo.
So they show up with clubs and bats.

2438
02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:54.720
What are you allowed to do with Nazis?
Exactly.
And then these people come back.

2439
02:05:54.721 --> 02:05:57.660
So we've ever been guns to protect ourselves.
There was already a guy,

2440
02:05:57.661 --> 02:05:58.650
I think it was in Portland,

2441
02:05:58.950 --> 02:06:01.320
who when a bunch of protesters were marching towards him with his hands up and

2442
02:06:01.321 --> 02:06:05.070
drew his weapon on him.
He got charged.
He got in trouble.
But the,

2443
02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:09.510
here's the important takeaway on whether or not a civil war will happen when we

2444
02:06:09.511 --> 02:06:13.980
read history.
It's condensed.
We read in 1938,
the seven in 1939 this happened.

2445
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:18.420
But for the people who lived it,
nothing happened six months later.

2446
02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:23.520
It was a slow,
gradual increase.
It may be in a hundred years that they say,
wow.

2447
02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:25.740
The second civil war,
civil war started on,
you know,

2448
02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:28.220
a 2016 after Trump got elected and,
uh,

2449
02:06:28.230 --> 02:06:31.050
the protestors showed up at his inauguration.
That was when it all started.

2450
02:06:31.590 --> 02:06:34.590
We're in it,
we can't see it.
We're in the forest,
you know,
we don't,

2451
02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:39.390
we don't realize so.
So we'll look,
I will give me negative,

2452
02:06:39.391 --> 02:06:43.050
positive,
negative,
positive.
There would be no,
it's all,
it's all negative.

2453
02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:46.350
What I mean to say it was a positive was that when you saw a guy like Joey

2454
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:49.910
Salads you,
oh yeah,
yeah,
no,
no.
There are good people out there willing to,

2455
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:51.120
the positive open up.

2456
02:06:51.330 --> 02:06:53.640
The positive when it comes to Joey is that he wasn't banned.

2457
02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:55.920
And so because he wasn't,
he said,

2458
02:06:55.980 --> 02:06:59.910
I'm going to do better and he did and now he's making these silly,

2459
02:06:59.911 --> 02:07:01.990
he makes some PG 13 videos where it's like,
you know,

2460
02:07:01.991 --> 02:07:03.360
pranks on my girlfriend and stuff.

2461
02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:07.110
But it's like so dramatically different from where he was getting out of
control.

2462
02:07:07.470 --> 02:07:11.070
And it's only because he was in band.
He was able to,
to become,
you know,

2463
02:07:11.071 --> 02:07:14.250
pulled back into the,
to the mainstream.
But if they just had to get rid of them,

2464
02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:17.010
you think that,
do you think he's gonna want to be homeless and starving?

2465
02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:18.270
He's going to try and figure out how to make money.

2466
02:07:18.271 --> 02:07:19.490
He's going to go on cryptocurrency.

2467
02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:21.960
He's going to go hang out with people who are willing to support him and he was

2468
02:07:21.961 --> 02:07:24.660
doing some stupid racist stuff.
So who do you think's going to support him?

2469
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:25.860
We can't,
we can't have that.

2470
02:07:25.861 --> 02:07:29.640
We need to welcome people back into society and give them a chance to be part of

2471
02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:34.290
the mainstream and the norm.
I think we are seeing the gradual,

2472
02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:38.560
like it's,
it's,
it's likely,
in my opinion,
I think,
I think we,
we don't,

2473
02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:40.980
we don't realize we're in it.
We don't,
we don't realize we're in a forest.

2474
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:42.430
We just see trees around us.
You know what I mean?

2475
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:45.530
<v 2>It'll be a damn shame because we will look back and for all the people that they</v>

2476
02:07:45.531 --> 02:07:47.480
get so bad and we all hate each other and everything.

2477
02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:48.650
These are the good old days.

2478
02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:51.820
If that happens and I will do everything I can to make sure

2479
02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:57.120
<v 1>criticism that I hear a lot from people is that when I first went on Rogan,
uh,</v>

2480
02:07:57.130 --> 02:08:01.060
the first time and said that what's going on with Twitter as prop may maybe one

2481
02:08:01.061 --> 02:08:02.590
of the biggest problems we're facing today,

2482
02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:05.830
I saw comments from people who hate me who are like,
that's the stupidest thing.

2483
02:08:05.831 --> 02:08:07.990
Tim Pulls a moron.
He thinks Twitter's had important.

2484
02:08:08.650 --> 02:08:12.550
Kevin Hart lost hosting the Oscars because he tweeted something.

2485
02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:17.620
The Oscars are a major cultural event that was impacted because of one joke he

2486
02:08:17.621 --> 02:08:20.110
made on a platform.
So I think to myself,

2487
02:08:20.111 --> 02:08:23.500
maybe it is exaggerated and then I think to myself,
you know what it actually is.

2488
02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:25.030
I'll,
I'll give you another quick anecdote.

2489
02:08:25.031 --> 02:08:28.900
I was driving down a Roosevelt Avenue in Chicago,

2490
02:08:29.050 --> 02:08:32.320
going into the suburbs and I looked in my mirror and I saw a squad car and I

2491
02:08:32.321 --> 02:08:36.190
said,
Ooh,
I should get off the road right now.
He might pull me over.
Oh,

2492
02:08:36.191 --> 02:08:39.340
I'm being paranoid.
He then turns,
gets into the left turn lane,

2493
02:08:39.690 --> 02:08:42.400
puts his left signal on,
he pulled in front of me,
sped up,

2494
02:08:42.401 --> 02:08:44.920
and I thought to myself,
he wasn't going to pull me over.

2495
02:08:45.190 --> 02:08:48.790
Maybe I should get off the road.
That just in case nat,
he pulled me over.

2496
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:50.320
So I thought from then I was like,

2497
02:08:50.321 --> 02:08:52.780
maybe if my intuition tells me that something's about to happen,

2498
02:08:52.781 --> 02:08:55.990
I should pay attention to that.
And I will say this too.
I,

2499
02:08:56.410 --> 02:08:58.750
I've been wrong about a few things.
Like I said,

2500
02:08:58.751 --> 02:09:01.510
I thought the Republicans going to sweep the midterms.
It was a bit mixed.

2501
02:09:01.511 --> 02:09:03.520
They took the Senate and um,

2502
02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:06.460
but I've consistently said we're going to see more violence.

2503
02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:10.930
Things are going to get worse.
And it's been,
it's been sporadic,
so I don't,

2504
02:09:10.931 --> 02:09:12.580
I don't know if I can say I'm right or wrong yet,

2505
02:09:12.970 --> 02:09:16.810
but I think with the people marching around with guns,
with,
you know,

2506
02:09:16.811 --> 02:09:18.430
the ever increasing escalation of violence,

2507
02:09:18.431 --> 02:09:21.400
we just had some proud boys plead guilty to the mob violence in New York.

2508
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:25.490
Then it was like gang Vons or something.
I'm hoping it's not true.
Uh,

2509
02:09:25.491 --> 02:09:27.040
I don't know what the percentage would be if I was going to give it a

2510
02:09:27.041 --> 02:09:31.150
probability.
I lean.
I would just say this,
I believe it's a greater than chance.

2511
02:09:31.151 --> 02:09:35.550
We will have an escalation of civil conflict continually and I don't thinks

2512
02:09:35.551 --> 02:09:38.690
going to stop,
look when you,
when you,
uh,
I,

2513
02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:40.060
I was talking to my brother about this.

2514
02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:44.770
If you want to truly understand why you come to the point of sale of civil war

2515
02:09:44.771 --> 02:09:48.550
or conflict or insurgency,
I want you to go to one of these progressive leftists,

2516
02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:53.290
look them in the eye and say a biological male can never be biologically female

2517
02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:57.760
and they can't.
There is nothing in their brain that will ever comprehend that.

2518
02:09:58.270 --> 02:10:01.150
I've,
I have people from occupy Wall Street who are now posting on Facebook.

2519
02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.193
This guy said,

2520
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:06.760
I can't believe people think male and female are objective things that exists.

2521
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:10.000
I think these people are just stupid.
And so I sent him some research and I said,

2522
02:10:10.001 --> 02:10:13.260
look at these statistics.
Intersex is 1.7%.
That's from the intersects,
you know,

2523
02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:16.450
lobbying groups.
And he said,
I can't believe you actually think this is real.

2524
02:10:16.451 --> 02:10:18.790
You're,
you're crazy.
Or just stupid.
And I'm like,

2525
02:10:19.090 --> 02:10:24.090
if there is something as basic as I can actually look at a a man and a woman and

2526
02:10:24.521 --> 02:10:25.630
know which ones the men and woman,

2527
02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:29.170
I can't actually look at the earth being round without some special tool or
math.

2528
02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:31.680
<v 2>Yeah.
These are the people that tell you that the conservatives don't believe in</v>

2529
02:10:31.681 --> 02:10:32.480
science too.

2530
02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:34.130
<v 1>Right?
And we</v>

2531
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.770
<v 2>know the earth is round.
We can't see with our state,
with our eyes,</v>

2532
02:10:36.771 --> 02:10:39.410
but we know it from our community and science.

2533
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.540
I can look at a man and woman and tell you which one is which.

2534
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:43.850
And not every case I,
I respect that.

2535
02:10:44.210 --> 02:10:47.360
But if you get to a point where there's someone who believes so fundamentally

2536
02:10:47.361 --> 02:10:50.870
that something that is real isn't what happens when it comes to,

2537
02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:54.840
when it comes to blows.
One of my favorite lines on this is Douglas Murray,

2538
02:10:54.841 --> 02:10:58.860
who I'm sure you're familiar with.
I asked him,
um,
you know,
what,
what does he,

2539
02:10:58.861 --> 02:11:01.830
how does he envision this sort of same question.
And he said,
you know,

2540
02:11:01.831 --> 02:11:02.880
one day the barbarians,

2541
02:11:02.881 --> 02:11:06.830
we'll be at the gate and we'll be debating what pronoun to call them.
Yeah.

2542
02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:08.810
That kind of gets there.
We'll listen if there's a,
literally,

2543
02:11:08.811 --> 02:11:12.040
if there's a little sliver of hope here,
I absolutely think you're part of it.

2544
02:11:12.041 --> 02:11:14.190
And then watching you grow through this whole freaking cold has been,

2545
02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:17.670
has been awesome.
So,
uh,
let's keep trying to fix this thing.
Right?
Why not?

2546
02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:21.960
<v 1>Yeah.
I just don't know.
I just don't,
I'm not hopeful though.</v>

2547
02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:26.520
After that conversation with Jack,
I'm like,
damn,
not hopeful.
Um,

2548
02:11:27.010 --> 02:11:27.990
it's,
it's,
it's nuance.

2549
02:11:27.991 --> 02:11:30.900
There's some things I think he listened to and maybe he'll do right,

2550
02:11:31.170 --> 02:11:34.860
but I really feel like all of his lieutenants are smug,

2551
02:11:35.250 --> 02:11:38.910
condescending,
arrogant.
We know what's right.

2552
02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:42.990
We're going to do it anyway.
I'm like,
welcome to the tyranny.

2553
02:11:42.991 --> 02:11:47.370
It's the end for more rip Tim Pool.
It's just slashed him cast,

2554
02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:49.440
uh,
on Youtube.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yes.

2555
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:53.910
It's youtube.com/tim cast and you're going to get a new beat any one of these

2556
02:11:53.911 --> 02:11:56.540
days.
I actually know this isn't,
this is that one is new.
Yeah.

2557
02:11:56.610 --> 02:11:59.790
It's not saying when I have just a bunch of different ones.
Yeah.
Similar style,

2558
02:11:59.791 --> 02:12:03.310
different companies.
It depends on the color of shirts I'm wearing,
you know,

2559
02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:08.100
catch all the beanies and all the truth at youtube.com/tim cast.
All right.

2560
02:12:08.101 --> 02:12:08.550
Thanks guys.
