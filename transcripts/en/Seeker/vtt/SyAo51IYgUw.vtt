00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.720
CRISPR could be responsible for a new era
of genetically perfected plants, animals,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.480
and even humans…but what the heck is it?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.150
Hello imperfect humans, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.890
A few years ago, something called Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.110
or CRISPR burst onto scene.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.580
It worked so well scientists began issuing
ethical statements about its use.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.230
CRISPR cuts DNA strands with unprecedented
accuracy and simplicity, allowing geneticists

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.739
to directly edit any of Earth's organisms
however they like.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.721
CRISPR could be used to engineer disease-free
organisms, formulate high-yield crops, or

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.440
even cure genetic and hereditary human conditions.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.719
Of course, it could theoretically also be
used to let parents pick their kid's sex,

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.149
eye color, height, or whatever.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.390
In the end, CRISPR is, as one Nobel scientist
said to the Independent, "jaw-dropping" in

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.120
its efficiency and simplicity.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.370
It all began in the late 80s when some Japanese
scientists were looking at bacterial DNA.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.959
They spotted repeated palindromic patterns
-- a palindrome is a mirrored set of characters

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:08.470
like racecar or noon (though DNA sequences
only use A,C,T, or G).

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.520
In the 2000s, scientists realized these repeating
characters were part of an ancient bacterial

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.619
immune system!

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.869
The palindromes were framing the DNA of viral
invaders!

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.990
This viral DNA is used by bacteria’s immune
system like a "most-wanted poster!"

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.790
It would detect an attack, go to the "most
wanted poster" section of their DNA, figure

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.479
out which virus was attacking, and create
an RNA defender to fight back.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.229
Now that the RNA knew what to attack it needed
a way to do so.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.799
Which is where Cas9 comes in.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.990
CAS9 or CRISPR associated protein 9 is an
enzyme that unwinds DNA and cuts it up.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.570
Now, the trick is, that cutting process works
with more than just viral DNA.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.590
Once scientists figured out the process, they
learned how to use it to cut out and replace

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.909
any DNA sequence.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.760
I know it's confusing, but think of it like
our own immune system -- the RNA are like

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.860
antibodies, tagging the invaders, and the
CAS9 eliminates them like our white blood

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.749
cells do; except instead of the cellular level
it's on the molecular level.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:08.749
That's tiny.

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.930
After word got out, scientists everywhere
began to make their own RNA targets, wrap

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.050
them in CAS9 and send them out to cut DNA.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.180
Like our own private RNA army.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.370
CRISPR-CAS9 is so accurate it can recognize
a few as 20 base-pairs, meaning scientists

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.720
could cut single genes out of a DNA strand.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.520
After it’s cut, the strand self-repairs,
disabling the gene.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.730
But, if scientists inject replacement DNA
it fills the space instead.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.990
This allows us to swap in DNA wherever we
like.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.140
Want corn with genes to fight bacteria?

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.140
Cool.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.140
Want fish that glow?

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.970
Grab some DNA from phosphorescent algae and
toss it in there.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.750
This technique is so simple, it's scary...it’s
paving the way for widespread genetic engineering,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.620
and it’s kicked off a media frenzy.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.100
Like when Chinese authorities announced they'd
edited human embryos, though they'd not allowed

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100
them to grow.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.100
WTF China!?

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.510
Craig Mello, is the co-Laureate of the 2006
Nobel Prize for medicine and he told The Independent,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.800
"It's a triumph of basic science," and claimed
it was even more important than the discovery

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.660
that had won him the Nobel Prize.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.780
But because it is so simple, scientists are
calling for ethical oversight, and the need

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.270
to align science with "public support."

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.750
Now, CRISPR/Cas9 isn't perfect, sometimes
the process will target the wrong section

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.810
of DNA and cut there, but a new paper in Nature
describes how scientists altered the CAS9

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.540
enzyme reducing "off-target mutations to undetectable
levels."

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.030
So, they improved on evolution, and now it's
perfect.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.500
And even more super scary.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.640
Wanna know more about how these Chinese scientists
altered the human embryos?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:04:02.470

perfected couple Julia and Julian did over

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.380
