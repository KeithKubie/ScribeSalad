00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.847
Absolute value signs are sort of like a type of parenthesis, in that when we use

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:07.800
them with expressions, we simplify the part of the expression that's inside the

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.576
absolute value signs, before we deal with our entire quantity in relation to

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:15.324
other things. So, I'd like you to find the absolute value of each of these

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:19.344
quantities, and when you do that, first simply what's inside the absolute value

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:22.151
signs, and then take the absolute value of that number.
