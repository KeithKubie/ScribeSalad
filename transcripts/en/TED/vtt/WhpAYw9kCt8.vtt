00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.800
"How much pain medication are you taking?"

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.960
That was the very routine question
that changed my life.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.376
It was July 2015,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.776
about two months after
I nearly lost my foot

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.400
in a serious motorcycle accident.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.896
So I was back in my orthopedic
surgeon's office

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.920
for yet another follow-up appointment.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.936
I looked at my wife, Sadiye;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.200
we did some calculating.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.360
"About 115 milligrams
oxycodone," I responded.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.616
"Maybe more."

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.695
I was nonchalant, having given
this information to many doctors

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.616
many times before,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.000
but this time was different.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.416
My doctor turned serious

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.856
and he looked at me and said,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.256
"Travis, that's a lot of opioids.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.800
You need to think
about getting off the meds now."

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.576
In two months of escalating prescriptions,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.480
this was the first time
that anyone had expressed concern.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.856
Indeed, this was the first
real conversation I'd had

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.640
about my opioid therapy, period.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.536
I had been given no warnings,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.176
no counseling,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400
no plan ...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
just lots and lots of prescriptions.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.256
What happened next really came to define
my entire experience of medical trauma.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.136
I was given what I now know
is a much too aggressive tapering regimen,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.080
according to which I divided
my medication into four doses,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.400
dropping one each week
over the course of the month.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.800
The result is that I was launched
into acute opioid withdrawal.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.456
The result, put another way,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.680
was hell.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.616
The early stages of withdrawal
feel a lot like a bad case of the flu.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.416
I became nauseated,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.176
lost my appetite,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.136
I ached everywhere,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.720
had increased pain
in my rather mangled foot;

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.040
I developed trouble sleeping
due to a general feeling of restlessness.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.056
At the time,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.000
I thought this was all pretty miserable.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.096
That's because I didn't know
what was coming.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.976
At the beginning of week two,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.240
my life got much worse.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.120
As the symptoms dialed up in intensity,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.976
my internal thermostat
seemed to go haywire.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.856
I would sweat profusely almost constantly,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.816
and yet if I managed to get myself out
into the hot August sun,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.640
I might look down and find myself
covered in goosebumps.

00:02:35.537 --> 00:02:38.776
The restlessness that had made
sleep difficult during that first week

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.120
now turned into what I came to think of
as the withdrawal feeling.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.816
It was a deep sense of jitters
that would keep me twitching.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.440
It made sleep nearly impossible.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.320
But perhaps the most
disturbing was the crying.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.776
I would find myself with tears coming on

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.536
for seemingly no reason

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.800
and with no warning.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.456
At the time they felt
like a neural misfire,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.880
similar to the goosebumps.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.936
Sadiye became concerned,
and she called the prescribing doctor

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.160
who very helpfully advised
lots of fluids for the nausea.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.816
When she pushed him and said,
"You know, he's really quite badly off,"

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.016
the doctor responded,
"Well, if it's that bad,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.920
he can just go back to his
previous dose for a little while."

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.080
"And then what?" I wondered.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.240
"Try again later," he responded.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.176
Now, there's no way that I was going
to go back on my previous dose

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.680
unless I had a better plan for making
it through the withdrawal next time.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.200
And so we stuck to riding it out
and dropped another dose.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.360
At the beginning of week three,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.880
my world got very dark.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.016
I basically stopped eating,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.816
and I barely slept at all

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.680
thanks to the jitters
that would keep me writhing all night.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.736
But the worst --

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.141
the worst was the depression.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.536
The tears that had felt
like a misfire before

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.760
now felt meaningful.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.896
Several times a day
I would get that welling in my chest

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.640
where you know the tears are coming,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.136
but I couldn't stop them

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.080
and with them came
desperation and hopelessness.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.816
I began to believe
that I would never recover

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.200
either from the accident
or from the withdrawal.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.935
Sadiye got back on the phone
with the prescriber

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:37.216
and this time he recommended
that we contact our pain management team

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.936
from the last hospitalization.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.536
That sounded like a great idea,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.870
so we did that immediately,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.069
and we were shocked
when nobody would speak with us.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.896
The receptionist who answered
the phone advised us

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.856
that the pain management team
provides an inpatient service;

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.616
although they prescribe opioids
to get pain under control,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.720
they do not oversee
tapering and withdrawal.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.560
Furious, we called the prescriber back
and begged him for anything --

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.056
anything that could help me --

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.680
but instead he apologized,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.696
saying that he was out of his depth.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.096
"Look," he told us,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.616
"my initial advice to you is clearly bad,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.256
so my official recommendation
is that Travis go back on the medication

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.000
until he can find someone
more competent to wean him off."

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.096
Of course I wanted
to go back on the medication.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.080
I was in agony.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.736
But I believed that if I saved
myself from the withdrawal with the drugs

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.427
that I would never be free of them,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.696
and so we buckled ourselves in,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.054
and I dropped the last dose.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.216
As my brain experienced life
without prescription opioids

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.640
for the first time in months,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.600
I thought I would die.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.936
I assumed I would die --

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.016
(Crying)

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.256
I'm sorry.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.200
(Crying)

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.080
Because if the symptoms
didn't kill me outright,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.120
I'd kill myself.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.216
And I know that sounds dramatic,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.976
because to me,
standing up here years later,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.856
whole and healthy --

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.160
to me, it sounds dramatic.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.720
But I believed it to my core

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.840
because I no longer had any hope

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.741
that I would be normal again.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.456
The insomnia became unbearable

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.480
and after two days
with virtually no sleep,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.280
I spent a whole night
on the floor of our basement bathroom.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.616
I alternated between cooling
my feverish head

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.320
against the ceramic tiles

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.200
and trying violently to throw up
despite not having eaten anything in days.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.056
When Sadiye found me
at the end of the night

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.376
she was horrified,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.800
and we got back on the phone.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.536
We called everyone.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.376
We called surgeons and pain docs
and general practitioners --

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.936
anyone we could find on the internet,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.000
and not a single one of them
would help me.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.400
The few that we could
speak with on the phone

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.640
advised us to go back on the medication.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.216
An independent pain management clinic
said that they prescribe opioids

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.440
but they don't oversee
tapering or withdrawal.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.456
When my desperation
was clearly coming through my voice,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.760
much as it is now,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.336
the receptionist
took a deep breath and said,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.616
"Mr. Rieder, it sounds like perhaps
what you need is a rehab facility

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.880
or a methadone clinic."

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.496
I didn't know any better at the time,
so I took her advice.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.896
I hung up and I started
calling those places,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.336
but it took me virtually no time at all

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.176
to discover that many of these facilities

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.616
are geared towards those battling
long-term substance use disorder.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.016
In the case of opioids,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.656
this often involves precisely not
weaning the patient off the medication,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.896
but transitioning them
onto the safer, longer-acting opioids:

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.976
methadone or buprenorphine
for maintenance treatment.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.960
In addition, everywhere I called
had an extensive waiting list.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.720
I was simply not the kind of patient
they were designed to see.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.096
After being turned away
from a rehab facility,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.640
I finally admitted defeat.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.160
I was broken and beaten,

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.840
and I couldn't do it anymore.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.440
So I told Sadiye that I was
going back on the medication.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.736
I would start with
the lowest dose possible,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.189
and I would take only as much
as I absolutely needed

00:08:38.213 --> 00:08:40.813
to escape the most crippling
effects of the withdrawal.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.656
So that night she helped me up the stairs

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.655
and for the first time in weeks
I actually went to bed.

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:49.535
I took the little orange
prescription bottle,

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.000
I set it on my nightstand ...

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:53.880
and then I didn't touch it.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.376
I fell asleep,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.336
I slept through the night

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.616
and when I woke up,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.960
the most severe symptoms
had abated dramatically.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.936
I'd made it out.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.400
(Applause)

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.496
Thanks for that,
that was my response, too.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.320
(Laughter)

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.160
So --

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.560
I'm sorry, I have to gather myself
just a little bit.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.176
I think this story is important.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.456
It's not because I think I'm special.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.536
This story is important
precisely because I'm not special;

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.440
because nothing that happened
to me was all that unique.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.976
My dependence on opioids
was entirely predictable

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.896
given the amount that I was prescribed

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.560
and the duration
for which I was prescribed it.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.176
Dependence is simply the brain's natural
response to an opioid-rich environment

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.016
and so there was every reason
to think that from the beginning,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.760
I would need a supervised,
well-formed tapering plan,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.936
but our health care system
seemingly hasn't decided

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.200
who's responsible for patients like me.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.696
The prescribers saw me
as a complex patient

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.216
needing specialized care,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.696
probably from pain medicine.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.456
The pain docs saw their job
as getting pain under control

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.536
and when I couldn't
get off the medication,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.256
they saw me as the purview
of addiction medicine.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.416
But addiction medicine is overstressed

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.680
and focused on those suffering
from long-term substance use disorder.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.160
In short, I was prescribed a drug
that needed long-term management

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.976
and then I wasn't given that management,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.840
and it wasn't even clear
whose job such management was.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.480
This is a recipe for disaster

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.256
and any such disaster would be interesting
and worth talking about --

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.640
probably worth a TED Talk --

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.296
but the failure of opioid tapering
is a particular concern

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.760
at this moment in America

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.440
because we are in the midst of an epidemic

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.320
in which 33,000 people died
from overdose in 2015.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.160
Nearly half of those deaths
involved prescription opioids.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.936
The medical community has in fact
started to react to this crisis,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.496
but much of their response has involved
trying to prescribe fewer pills --

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.136
and absolutely,
that's going to be important.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.416
So for instance,
we're now gaining evidence

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.416
that American physicians
often prescribe medication

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.976
even when it's not necessary

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.216
in the case of opioids.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.216
And even when opioids are called for,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.520
they often prescribe
much more than is needed.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.496
These sorts of considerations
help to explain why America,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.136
despite accounting for only five percent
of the global population,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.240
consumes nearly 70 percent
of the total global opioid supply.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.176
But focusing only
on the rate of prescribing

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.520
risks overlooking
two crucially important points.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.616
The first is that opioids just are

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.560
and will continue to be
important pain therapies.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.216
As somebody who has had
severe, real, long-lasting pain,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.960
I can assure you these medications
can make life worth living.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.176
And second:

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.136
we can still fight the epidemic
while judiciously prescribing opioids

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.736
to people who really need them

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.320
by requiring that doctors properly
manage the pills that they do prescribe.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.816
So for instance,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.160
go back to the tapering regimen
that I was given.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.016
Is it reasonable to expect

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.880
that any physician who prescribes opioids
knows that that is too aggressive?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.656
Well, after I initially published my story
in an academic journal,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.840
someone from the CDC sent me
their pocket guide for tapering opioids.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.576
This is a four-page document,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.840
and most of it's pictures.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.976
In it, they teach physicians
how to taper opioids in the easier cases,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.736
and one of the their recommendations

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.000
is that you never start at more
than a 10 percent dose reduction per week.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.096
If my physician had given me that plan,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.040
my taper would have taken several months
instead of a few weeks.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.576
I'm sure it wouldn't have been easy.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.960
It probably would have been
pretty uncomfortable,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.640
but maybe it wouldn't have been hell.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.776
And that seems like
the kind of information

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.520
that someone who prescribes
this medication ought to have.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.320
In closing,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.616
I need to say that properly managing
prescribed opioids

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.800
will not by itself solve the crisis.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.000
America's epidemic
is far bigger than that,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.016
but when a medication is responsible
for tens of thousands of deaths a year,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.240
reckless management
of that medication is indefensible.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.936
Helping opioid therapy patients
to get off the medication

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.976
that they were prescribed

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.440
may not be a complete solution
to our epidemic,

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.440
but it would clearly constitute progress.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.456
Thank you.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.320
(Applause)
