NAZMUL IDRIS: Hi everyone, and
welcome to "UX Design for

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.990
Developers." My name is Nazmul,
and I'm a developer.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.410
IZABEL IDRIS: And I'm Izabel,
and I'm a designer.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.210
NAZMUL IDRIS: In the first
episode of the show, we

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.690
provided you with a brief
overview of the user centric

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.070
design process, and why it's
important for developers to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.990
understand.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.150
But we really didn't spend too
much time going over any

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.270
specific details.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.860
So in this episode, we're going
to actually use the

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.240
process, and go through it in
a pretty good amount of

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.530
detail, to actually show
you how we can

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.950
better design products.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.250
We're going to continue using
the example of building a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.760
mobile pizza ordering
application to illustrate how

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.650
this process works.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.730
The mobile pizza ordering
application is a good example,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.570
since everybody's familiar
with ordering pizza, and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.190
everybody loves it.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.850
And it also allows us to
highlight the process, rather

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.570
than the product.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.730
So you can use this process to
build any type of product,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.660
whether it's something physical,
or an API, or an

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660
application.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.040
So to get started, let's imagine
that we have a startup

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.580
that creates local, artisanal
pizza and sells it online.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060
And we also have a
retail presence.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.750
Now let's say that our goal is
to use technology to deliver a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.820
better pizza experience for
our discerning users.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.600
And that includes ordering pizza
and, also, the actual

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.760
ingredients of the
pizza, and so on.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.950
So I'm going to, now, switch to
the slides and show you the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.830
four steps that we're going to
follow to enable our startup

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.640
to create an application with
a really amazing user

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.160
experience.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.670
So the very first thing we need
to ask ourselves is, what

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.890
is the goal.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.110
Why are we doing this?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.420
Why are we building
this application?

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.800
Why is our startup doing
what it does?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.950
So setting business goals early
on, and defining success

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.370
metrics for whatever product it
is that we're building, is

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.520
really, really important.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.050
So once we have an idea of why
we're doing what we're doing,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.380
the second step is everybody
talks about satisfying users.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.280
So who is our user?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.150
We have to understand
who our users

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.510
are by creating personas.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.130
So once we have an understanding
of our users,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.090
the next thing we have to do
is ask how these users are

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.650
going to use our application
in different scenarios.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.060
And those are called
use casees.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.500
So we're going to go through
and actually

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.420
create a bunch of those.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.630
And finally, we're going to take
features, which we're all

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.180
used to as developers.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.110
And then, we're going to frame
the features in the context of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.950
use cases and personas and then
make sure they tie back

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.600
into the original goals that
we have already defined.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.805
And then, when we finally
integrate all these pieces, we

00:02:36.805 --> 00:02:39.790
will have a much, much better
designed, solid, holistic type

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.090
of a product.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.240
Now what we're not going to talk
about is UI specifics, or

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.800
which mobile platform,
like Android or iOS,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.910
we're going to use.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.430
Because we're in a really
early stage in design.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.490
And those types of discussions
should really be tabled for a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.360
later time, when we have the
personas and the use cases

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.330
better scoped out.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.900
So now, how do we define the
goals of this project?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.870
At the start of the project, we
should just think about why

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.510
we're building an application
for our startup, instead of

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.760
really focusing on the what.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.060
As developers, we tend to really
fixate on features and

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.090
how features are going
to be implemented.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.560
So we have to have some
discipline and actually back

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.520
away from that and just
focus on the why.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.150
Now, let's ask questions.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.860
The following questions,
actually,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.610
will help you identify--

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.940
will help us identify--

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.140
why we're doing this.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.310
So why are we building
this application?

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.360
What problems will it
solve for our users?

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.280
And how will it improve on any
pre-existing solutions?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.160
And finally, what is
our special sauce?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.600
What do we do better than our
competitors, and what makes us

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.150
really unique?

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.820
So now if we go back to the
slides, this slide actually

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.230
talks about the goal.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.180
So we're going to go through
and answer some of those

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.360
questions I just asked and
basically come up with a

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.110
specific set of goals that our
business and our product has

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.150
to deliver.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.850
So first of all, why are we
building this application?

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.140
We're building this application
to satisfy users

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.120
who are hungry for pizza.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.400
So it's important not to get
derailed by strong opinions

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.950
from individuals in sales, PM,
or leadership and lose

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.410
perspective of this.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.700
Sometimes, applications seem
like they're built in the

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.550
service of certain buzzwords
that your

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.800
investors might be into.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.490
But that's not a
very good idea.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.720
So every design decision that
we make should be in the

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.970
service of the user.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.710
Another thing to keep in mind is
that we have to understand

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.180
what is important to users when
they're ordering pizza.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.450
So dietary restrictions
come into play.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.190
People care about convenient
delivery windows.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.270
People care about quality
versus price.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.940
People care about the ease
of ordering versus

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.160
customizability.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.130
And of course, people care that
it should be easy to pay.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.530
So those are all parts of the
goals that we're assembling,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.190
that we're going to actually use
to evaluate our design in

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.740
this episode.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.800
And one last thing is an
abstract kind of a goal.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.160
And that is, what is
our special sauce.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.540
So our special sauce for this
made up startup is the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.420
following-- we support
local farmers.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.050
We use sustainable
ingredients.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.660
And we use sustainable business

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.630
practices to create pizza.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.030
And we enable our users to
feel connected to their

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.940
community, and make them feel
good when they do business

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.830
with us, because they're
giving back

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.980
to their local community.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.810
Again these are very,
very nontechnical,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.740
pretty abstract goals.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.440
But by the end of this episode,
you'll see how we can

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.420
actually tie that to features.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.320
Now design has to be in the
service of our business, as

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.030
well as our end users.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.220
So aside from great-tasting
pizza and easy ordering via

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.340
our mobile application, this
personal connection to our

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.340
business will keep customers
coming back.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.640
The user centric design process
serves to remind us

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.930
that we're designing for people
who make decisions

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.420
based on emotion.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.360
So abstract goals like this can
be our special sauce that

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.950
delivers delight to our
intended audience.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.650
However, it has to be
weaved into our

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.756
product using good design.

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:25.830
So Izabel, now that I'm done
talking about goals, do you

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.250
want to talk a little
bit about personas?

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.970
IZABEL IDRIS: Yeah, sure.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.900
So now that we have our goals
outlined, let's talk about who

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.620
the user is.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.200
We often hear people say, we
need to make design decisions

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.900
and development decisions
that are in

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.070
service of our end user.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.420
So who is this user?

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.500
There is no real, one user.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.280
Instead of users, we're going
to think about personas.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.250
So personas are conceptual
models that represent the

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.160
demographics, the attributes,
and the pain points of a

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.570
certain segment of
a population--

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.400
of the pizza-eating population,
in our example.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.260
So we really need to choose
personas that represent our

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.930
business goals.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.290
And then, we're going to
optimize our user experience

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.870
based on these personas,
moving forward.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.710
So what are some examples
of real people in this

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.050
pizza-eating population that
I'm just talking about?

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.640
Some people will eat anything.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.300
And then, other people have
dietary restrictions.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.430
Some people think pizza should
be healthy, and other people

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.660
think pizza is just junk food
that you order when you don't

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.240
have time to cook.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.120
Some people spend a lot of
money on pizza, and some

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.320
people are completely
value-conscious, and they just

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.670
want it as cheap as possible.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.000
Some people expect to order
pizza over the phone and then

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.130
have it delivered
and pay cash.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.760
And then, other people want a
really seamless ordering flow,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.400
an automated approach.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.060
So let's say that's some
information about our pizza

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.330
eating population.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.010
So as a startup, which one of
these-- what part of this

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.610
population--

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.510
are we going to support?

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.930
How do we turn that population
into an actual persona?

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.760
So we would want to support
people who think that pizza

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.260
should be healthy.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.520
Why?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.020
Because our startup focuses on
quality, local ingredients.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.170
So we want to focus on people
who spend a good bit of money

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.200
on pizza, because one of our
goals is for our startup to

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.800
support local farmers and local

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.310
community, and not to outsource.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.690
We would also want to support
people who want a seamless,

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.520
automated approach, because
the whole point is we're

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.700
building a mobile app.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.350
And we want to use technology to
really facilitate a better

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.080
ordering experience.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.860
So based on that population,
or that demographics

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.810
information, those are
some people that

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.500
would make up our personas.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.150
So personas really serve to
help us during the entire

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.880
product development
life cycle.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.669
It helps us with things like
this-- we can prioritize user

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.140
stories in our backlog and
answer the question, would it

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.410
be more important to implement
feature A, or feature B. So we

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.800
look back at our personas.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.530
And then, that can help us
decide, OK, we should

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.390
implement this user
story first.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.720
It can also help us identify
corner cases that can waste a

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.930
lot of time.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.110
So we can answer the question,
would 95% of our users

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.330
actually use the feature in this
way, or is this going to

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.810
be something that just 1%
of the users would use.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.120
And also, one of the more
intangible things is it can

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.580
really help remind us, as
developers, why we're here,

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.410
why we're coding, during
really long sprints.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.710
So when we reference the
personas' attributes, and

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.750
their pain points, it really
puts a human context around

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.560
what we're all doing here.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.170
So let's take a moment and
look at the slides.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.930
We're going to go through
a few personas.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.650
We're going to use the user
centric design process.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.720
This is one persona
for our startup.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.450
So let's take a minute, and
look at Casey Smith.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.250
Her tagline is "Give me control,
healthy options, and

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.030
quality."

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.300
So if you notice,
Casey Smith--

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.660
she shops on Amazon.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.240
So she's already an
online shopper.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.750
She's pretty educated
and tech savvy.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.520
And she likes to use
Google Wallet.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.470
So we can tell that a seamless
checkout experience would be

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.490
really important for her.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.050
And of course, she values
high quality pizza.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.630
So now we're going to go to our
second persona, which is

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.500
Sally, Sally Jones.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.080
And her tagline is "Save me
time, surprise me with

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.850
something new." So let's take a
minute and look over Sally.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.270
We can tell she's also educated
and tech savvy.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.860
And she shops at the farmers
market weekly.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.180
So she likes local, artisanal
ingredients.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.650
She likes social networking.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.940
And she also likes high quality,
healthy pizza.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.460
We're going to go to the third
persona, which is Bob Brown.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.800
His tagline is "Save me money,
and keep it old skool." So

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.935
let's take a moment to look
over his persona.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.500
So we can see that Bob prefers
to pay with cash on delivery.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.210
And he rarely shops online.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.800
And he's a value shopper
that wishes

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.770
pizza wasn't so expensive.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.030
So I think it would make sense
to support Casey and Sally,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.790
but to drop Bob as a
persona that our

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.290
startup should support.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.740
Because his persona
really doesn't fit

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.230
our business goals.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.370
And if we tried to optimize a
user experience that supported

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.540
Casey and Sally, it probably
wouldn't be a good

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.435
experience for Bob.

00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:12.910
And if we tried to create a
user experience that would

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.060
really work for all three of
them, it would be good for

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.070
none of them.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.410
So it's really important that
we select the right personas

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.620
from the very beginning, before
we start any design or

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.520
any development.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.780
So we can remove any
the wrong personas.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.730
And we can't satisfy
everybody.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.040
All right, so now, I'm going
to talk a little

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.290
bit about use cases.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.750
Use cases are the scenarios that
describe the when, the

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.820
where, and the how that Casey
and Sally are going to use our

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.560
app to order pizza.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.160
So from use cases, we can
actually start and build our

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.940
feature list.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.120
So when we think of use cases,
think about the different

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.790
physical, social, and emotional
contexts that our

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.970
personas are going to be in when
they order pizza, to go

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.280
from being hungry to
being satisfied.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.790
So now we're going to go back to
the slides, and we're going

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.720
to look at our first use case.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.790
So the use case for Sally--

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.540
we're going to look at the
when, where, and the how.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.050
So let's just take a moment
to look at the slide.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.760
So basically, Casey prefers
to pay with credit card.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.850
And she's kind of
a picky eater.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.760
And she places her
order from home.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.300
So we're just going to go to the
second use case for Sally

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.830
and just take a moment
to look over that.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.580
So this is the use case for her
placing a group order for

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.810
friends while she's at home.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.140
So she likes to use carrier
billing to place this order.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.950
And she doesn't really have
any dietary restrictions,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.300
because she likes all kinds
of different ingredients.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.860
So we're going to go to
a third use case.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.230
And this is also for Sally.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.100
So this is when Sally
would be at work.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.160
And she wants to order about
30 pizzas or so.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.810
And it's going to be for
all of her coworkers.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.820
And all of them want to pay
differently, and they want to

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.750
check out differently, and they
want to really customize

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.490
this huge order.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.550
So I would recommend that we
remove use case number three,

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.810
because it doesn't support
our business goals.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.300
So one of our business goals
was to balance the ease of

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.910
ordering and the
customizability.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.450
So if you think, how would I
build a flow, how would the

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.450
screens actually look in order
to build this application.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.230
So if we were to support use
case number three, it would be

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.040
really difficult to support the
first two use cases and

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.760
balance ease of ordering and
customizability because it

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.870
would be very difficult to
support all of these multiple

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.160
checkout and payment forms.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.530
And also, use case number three
really doesn't support

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.130
one of our goals, which
is to feel connected

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.530
to our local community.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.570
So now I'm going to move over
to give it over to Nazmul.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.250
NAZMUL IDRIS: Thank you.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.650
So now that we have our personas
and use cases sorted

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.520
out, it's time to tie
features to them.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.680
Now one of those abstract,
non-technical goals that we

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.010
had was that we wanted to
support local farmers, use

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.370
sustainable ingredients
and business

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.210
practices to create pizza.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:14.390
And also we wanted to allow this
application to connect

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.480
users with their community.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.870
So how on earth do we take these
abstract goals and tie

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.220
them to technology and features
that fit the use

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.400
cases and personas that we've
actually outlined so far?

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.150
One example of doing this would
be to gamify the menu.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:37.290
That means that when a user is
assembling their pizza, and

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.810
they're selecting different
ingredients, we could have a

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.790
little score, from one to
five, that grades each

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.950
ingredient based on the
localness or the

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.245
sustainability.

00:14:46.245 --> 00:14:50.350
So for example, if you have a
lot of ingredients that score

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.250
really highly on sustainability,
then, when you

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.320
assemble your order, you will
have an order that ranks

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.230
really high-- it gets a really
high sustainability score.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.400
So this really encourages a user
that's into this sort of

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.310
thing to pick seasonal
ingredients over less

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.130
sustainable choices that
they might actually

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.740
desire at the moment.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.280
So it's important to surface
this information in the user

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.950
experience so that
it can help the

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.770
user better make decisions.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.030
So once they've assembled their
order, and they have a

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.320
score, and it's a pretty good
score, then they might want to

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.520
brag about it.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.050
So then, we can enable this
order to be shared on the

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.800
Google+ platform.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.930
So we can do this by simply
taking the order, with the

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.730
score, and just sharing it.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.060
We can share that as a link,
and it'll show up in the

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.980
user's friends stream.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.993
So let's say I create order, I
have a sustainability score of

00:15:43.993 --> 00:15:45.420
four or something.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.130
I can just share it
to my stream.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.530
And then, everybody in my circle
will actually see that.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.050
Now let's say I wanted to take
it to the next level.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.440
I wanted to provide some
engagement and interaction

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.620
beyond just an image or
a link that's shared.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.780
What I could actually do is
create a web application that

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.670
behaves as an interactive
infographic that I can

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.860
actually, basically create,
let's say, an order ID for

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.760
this order.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.610
And then I can pass that, as a
deep link, to something called

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.550
the Google+ interactive post.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.770
So from my mobile application,
I've created the order, I've

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.690
placed it, I have a score, I
want to share the order.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.700
I actually create an
interactive post.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.540
And what that does is,
I take that order ID.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.000
I pass it to Google+, which
generates an interactive post,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.500
which shows up on--

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.850
all the friends I have
in my circles--

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.840
it shows up in their stream.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.690
And then, when it's rendered
in their stream, it says

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.490
something like, Nazmul
shared this order.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.030
Here's his sustainability
score.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.030
And then, click on this button
if you want to learn more

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:57.450
about sustainability, and how
his order ranks amongst other

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.270
people who have placed orders
in the local area.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.350
So it almost turns into an
interactive kind of a game,

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.520
but you're getting more
information out of it.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.300
So we are engaging other users
and making it so that I'm not

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.270
just bragging about my score.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.040
But they're also getting an
opportunity to learn more

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.210
about who else cares about
sustainability in their local

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.150
region and also, how they're
making an impact, how they're

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.819
actually being more sustainable,
and connecting

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.670
with their community, by
encouraging other people to

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.950
learn more about businesses,
for example, that were all

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.410
about sustainability, that they
wouldn't have even known

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.390
about, if I hadn't shared
that infographic.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.520
IZABEL IDRIS: So your business
basically allows the users to

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.980
connect with their
local community.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.440
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.490
IZABEL IDRIS: And they're going
to appreciate that.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.340
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.750
And also, it puts sort of a
new spin on ordering food,

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:52.500
because it encourages
participation from my friends.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.040
So it's like, I create
an order.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.080
You see it.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.120
You're inspired by that.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.870
You're like, oh, I can
beat that score.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.620
So then, you create
another order.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.050
And then, we all kind
of get into it.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.370
And then, as a community, we can
all get fat eating pizza,

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.370
but really healthy pizza, and
also giving back to the

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.340
community, while we're gorging
ourselves on pizza.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.770
IZABEL IDRIS: And of course,
it'd be great way to spread

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.970
the word about your business.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.380
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.760
IZABEL IDRIS: It's kind of viral
marketing, through G+.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.650
NAZMUL IDRIS: It is, exactly.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.520
And also, even if I wasn't
interested about pizza, let's

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.400
say some random person is
looking at my public posts.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.570
And then, let's say I shared
this as a public post.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.930
Then, they'll run across
this infographic thing.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.280
They might start engaging
with that.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.610
And then, just through this
random infographic about

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.470
sustainability on how
sustainable my pizza is, in

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.200
Mountain View, they start
learning about this business.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.120
They start learning about
sustainable farming and all

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:43.920
this good stuff.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.430
So anyway, all this, put
together, creates an

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.130
experience that connects our
user with their community and

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.870
also creates opportunities to
get new users engaged in

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.930
product and business, which
was our stated goal at the

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:57.980
beginning of the show.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.500
And so this illustrates how,
again, we take the design

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.560
process, and how these seemingly
nontechnical,

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.830
abstract goals can end up
becoming one of the most

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.310
important, compelling
differentiators--

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.620
the most important things that
resonate with the user when

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.810
they actually interact
with our application.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.100
And in this example, because
we have a startup that also

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.650
has a retail outlet, we would
hope that this thinking, and

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.990
this design thinking around
sustainability, would also

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.810
reflect in we actually operated
the retail stores--

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.360
which, obviously, we're not
going to get into for this

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.776
particular episode.

00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:36.120
So before we wrap up, I
actually had one final

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.710
question for you.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.410
As a designer, where do you see
companies skipping one of

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.870
these steps, or more than one
of these steps, in the user

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.880
centric design process?

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.610
Where do they go wrong in
following the process?

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.590
IZABEL IDRIS: I think the most
important step that companies

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.160
are skipping is the first
one, the goal setting.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.440
This needs to really come from
the leadership of the company.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.420
They need to set the goals for
what their company and what

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.490
their product stands for.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.540
They need to define their
special sauce.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.860
And from there, each of the
product teams can actually

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.020
define their personas
and use cases.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.840
And I think that product
managers, developers, and

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.260
designers are all looking for
that from leadership.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.360
And if they don't have that,
it's really hard for them to

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.950
know where to start from.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.810
I personally believe that most
companies can build much

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.830
better products than they do.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.460
They just really need to take
the time to ponder on and

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.560
define and really express
their uniqueness.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.390
And this might sound a little
bit touchy-feely or designery,

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.710
but we really need to remember
that, in the end of the day,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.560
we're building products
for people.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.820
And people make emotional
based decisions.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.630
NAZMUL IDRIS: So essentially,
to summarize--

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.370
if you don't care about what
you're building, then that

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.040
shows through.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.180
And users can tell.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.530
IZABEL IDRIS: Yep.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.180
If you don't care about what
you're building, your users

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.140
are going to be able
to feel that.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.810
There's really no way
to fake that.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.110
So I'm going to leave you guys
with a quick little exercise,

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.080
once you're done watching
the video.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.080
Maybe take the time to think
about the product, or the

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.020
feature, that you're
implementing right now.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.960
And do you think that it maps
back to your personas and the

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.470
use cases that have
been defined?

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.670
And if you're not sure what
those personas and use cases

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.590
are, check with your designers,
or your product

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.670
managers, and see if you can
get a hold of those.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.460
So we're actually going to
create a post on our G+

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.630
community for this episode.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.340
And feel free to leave comments
on that post.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.726
And let us know how you did, and
maybe, what you learned.

00:21:22.726 --> 00:21:24.390
And I think that's it.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.640
And we're going to wrap up.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.420
And thanks for watching this
episode of "UX Design for

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.550
Developers."

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.090
NAZMUL IDRIS: And remember,
design is everyone's

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.340
responsibility.
