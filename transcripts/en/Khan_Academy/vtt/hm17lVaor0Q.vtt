00:00:00.161 --> 00:00:03.434
- If we have a rectangle
with base length b

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:07.257
and height length h, we know
how to figure out its area.

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:11.193
Its area is just going to be the base,

00:00:11.193 --> 00:00:14.682
is going to be the base times the height.

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.594
The base times the height.

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:19.412
This is just a review of
the area of a rectangle.

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:21.570
Just multiply the base times the height.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.104
Now let's look at a parallelogram.

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:28.128
And in this parallelogram,
our base still has length b.

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.471
And we still have a height h.

00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.121
So when we talk about the height,

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.810
we're not talking about the
length of these sides that

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.906
at least the way I've drawn
them, move diagonally.

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:41.074
We're talking about if you
go from this side up here,

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.287
and you were to go straight down.

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:44.979
If you were to go at a 90 degree angle.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.254
If you were to go
perpendicularly straight down,

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:48.831
you get to this side, that's going to be,

00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.173
that's going to be our height.

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:53.708
So in a situation like this
when you have a parallelogram,

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:55.108
you know its base and its height,

00:00:55.108 --> 00:00:58.207
what do we think its area is going to be?

00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:02.014
So at first it might seem
well this isn't as obvious

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:03.920
as if we're dealing with a rectangle.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.606
But we can do a little visualization
that I think will help.

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:11.289
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take a chunk of area

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.967
from the left-hand side,
actually this triangle

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.647
on the left-hand side that
helps make up the parallelogram,

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:18.554
and then move it to the right,

00:01:18.554 --> 00:01:21.405
and then we will see
something somewhat amazing.

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.747
So I'm going to take this,

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:26.264
I'm going to take this
little chunk right there,

00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:28.712
Actually let me do it a little bit better.

00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:33.334
So I'm going to take
that chunk right there.

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:36.789
And let me cut, and paste it.

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.960
So it's still the same parallelogram,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.257
but I'm just going to
move this section of area.

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:42.472
Remember we're just thinking about

00:01:42.472 --> 00:01:45.991
how much space is inside
of the parallelogram

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.556
and I'm going to take
this area right over here

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:51.558
and I'm going to move it
to the right-hand side.

00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:53.656
And what just happened?

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:55.280
What just happened?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.051
Let me see if I can move
it a little bit better.

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:59.195
What just happened when I did that?

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:04.193
Well notice it now looks just
like my previous rectangle.

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.490
That just by taking some of the area,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.943
by taking some of the area from the left

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:09.293
and moving it to the right,

00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:11.237
I have reconstructed this rectangle

00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:13.017
so they actually have the same area.

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:14.897
The area of this parallelogram,

00:02:14.897 --> 00:02:16.325
or well it used to be this parallelogram,

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:19.221
before I moved that triangle
from the left to the right,

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.952
is also going to be the
base times the height.

00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:26.815
So the area here is also the area here,

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:29.513
is also base times height.

00:02:29.513 --> 00:02:32.303
I just took this chunk of
area that was over there,

00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:33.943
and I moved it to the right.

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:35.438
So the area of a parallelogram,

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:38.754
let me make this looking more
like a parallelogram again.

00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:40.767
The area of a parallelogram

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.438
is just going to be, if you
have the base and the height,

00:02:44.438 --> 00:02:47.867
it's just going to be the
base times the height.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.949
So the area for both of these,

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:54.285
the area for both of these,
are just base times height.
