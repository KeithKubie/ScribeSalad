00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:16.816 align:start position:0%
  First track I'm

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.651 align:start position:0%
  is the track that runs
  under the shopping montage

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.186
at the beginning of the episode.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:21.721
 - Let's go shopping.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:24.257 size:88% position:44%
  ("Ketamine and Ecstasy" by
  Clap Your Hands Say Yeah)

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.027
(high five clap)

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.097 size:88% position:44%
  First one's fine, I think.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.765 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, your ass
  looks incredible.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:34.367 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The band's called
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.537 align:start position:0%
 and the song is song is
 called "Ketamine and Ecstacy."

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.172
Because who could pick just one?

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.773
 Next two tracks we're
 featuring in the recap

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.341 align:start size:88% position:13%
 are both tracks
 from the party scene

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:43.643
later on in the episode.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.678
 First one's from the
 slow-mo entrance.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.413 align:start size:88% position:13%
 The producer's
 name is Whiskers Po

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.415 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and the track is
 called "First Class."

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:51.117
 Whiskers Po is a New
 Jersey-based producer

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.654 align:start position:0%
making music in every genre
from Jersey Club to deep house.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.090 size:84% position:42%
  "First Class" is actually
  some of his earlier work

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.658 size:88% position:44%
  and is technically
  juke or footwork

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.626 align:start size:88% position:13%
if we were gonna get
specific with the genre.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.762 size:88% position:44%
 It's got these two sections
 to it, one of which is fast

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start position:0%
 and speedy, and the other
 which is mellow and laid back.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.767
 And the mellow and laid back
 part was the perfect thing

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.369 align:start position:0%
 to run underneath this
 slow-mo entrance of the party.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:14.340
 ("First Class" by Whiskers Po)

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.482
 The third and final track in
 this recap is another track

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.550 align:start size:88% position:13%
 from the party scene
 of the episode.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.285
The song is called "Yo Sweets,"

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:28.054
 and the artist is Najee The 1.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.689 size:84% position:42%
  "Yo Sweets" is a
  really dope track

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.591 align:start size:88% position:13%
 that's got a lotta
 character and swagger

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.392 size:88% position:44%
 and this is another
 scene in the season

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.062 align:start position:0%
  where Abbi's kinda
  letting her fun side out.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.497 size:84% position:42%
  So in the context
  of a party scene

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.832 align:start position:0%
 with the hip hop and the
 body shots and the fat asses,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.667
I just thought it was
a perfect thing to run.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.837
 ("Yo Sweets" by Najee The 1)

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.607
(crowd cheering)

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:55.181
(high five clap)

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:01.087 align:start size:88% position:13%
Najee The 1 is a rapper
I've had my eye on

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.522
for a little while now.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.056 align:start position:0%
 He deserves all the success
 that's coming to him.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:06.025 size:84% position:42%
  "Yo Sweets" is a
  really dope track

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:08.161
and I was really happy to be
able to include it in the show.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.629
 Hope you enjoyed this episode,

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.498 align:start position:0%
 this is one of my favorite
 episodes in the season so far.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:15.034
Keep your asses fat and
I'll see you next week.
