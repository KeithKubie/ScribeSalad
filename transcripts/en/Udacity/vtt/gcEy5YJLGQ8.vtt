Here's the code for the Refresh button in

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.060
the forecastfragment menu XML file. We want it to

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.160
appear in the overflow menu, so we set showAsAction

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.280
as never. We also declare the string. You can

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.560
find the string here in the strings.xml file, which

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.810
is located in the values folder, which is in

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.230
the res folder. You can get your strings.xml file

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.340
translated into different languages. This adds additional values folders,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.364
under Res. For example, you would have

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:33.230
values-es, for Spanish, values-fr for French. And

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.450
within each of those values folders, you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.660
would have a strings.xml file, which would

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.940
contain the localized strings for that language.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.170
Since translation does cost money, as a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200
pro tip, you can mark strings that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.210
you don't need translated using translatable=false. For example,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.560
if it's a proper name or if it's for debugging like this one,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.180
then you can indicate to the translator that they can skip over this strings
