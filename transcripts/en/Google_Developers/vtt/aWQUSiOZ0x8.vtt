JAKE KNAPP: Thank you guys
for coming to our talk.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.010
I know there's a lot of
other amazing talks going

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.370
on at this moment right
now at I/O. We almost

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.100
didn't come to this talk because
there's so many good ones.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.622
So super appreciate it.

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:14.080
We're going to talk to you guys
today about design sprints.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.910
And you actually totally
scored by coming to this talk

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.327
because it's not just one
talk, but two, two in one.

00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:22.410
And first we're going to
talk about design sprints

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.190
at Google Ventures
with startups,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.100
and then we're going
to hear about designs

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.890
sprints at big Google.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.870
So first of all
Daniel and I are going

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.480
to talk to you about what
we do at Google Ventures.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840
So Daniel and I are design
partners at Google Ventures.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.630
And we're going to tell you
how to prototype and test

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.660
pretty much any product
in just five days.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.330
So Daniel take it away.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.920
DANIEL BURKA:
Well, before I even

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.503
get started I want
to talk to you guys

00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:47.964
about a problem I've got.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:49.630
Unfortunately it's a
really big problem.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.850
In fact, it's a Super
Mario scale problem,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.290
a really big Super
Mario scale problem.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.890
I love Mario.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.497
I have since it first came out.

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:01.080
And so you can imagine, this is
going to date me a little bit,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.175
but I was super excited
when they announced the DS

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:06.660
and announced that they were
making the new Super Mario

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.070
Brothers where you could
become giant Mario.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.770
And so at the time I was
living in eastern Canada,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.802
way off on the edge
of the continent,

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:17.385
in a little place called Prince
Edward Island where I grew up.

00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:20.009
And I didn't have a whole lot of
disposable income at the time,

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.630
but it was just after
Christmas, and I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.570
had gotten some cash
gifts from some family.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.230
And I was thinking,
aw, you know,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.050
I could totally get
one of those things,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.710
and it would be awesome.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.450
I already had a little
sneaking suspicion

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.400
that I had maybe a bit of an
addiction problem with Mario,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.641
but I decided, you know what?

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:36.140
Screw it.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.250
I'm going to go get one anyway.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.940
And so I drove up
to this place called

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.829
the Future Shop
in Charlotte Town.

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.620
I swear to God it's
called the Future Shop.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.960
It's like Best Buy.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.160
And it was no less
inviting in January

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.050
then as this photo, which
I grabbed off Google Maps,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.820
is now.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.659
This is the actual shop,
a real photo of it.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.950
And so I went in there, and
I threw down my hard earned

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.450
money.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.314
And it was awesome.

00:01:59.314 --> 00:02:01.230
It was just everything
I imagined it would be.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.920
So I played it.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.836
And I played it a lot.

00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:06.190
I played it every single day
for about three months straight.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.444
I beat every single level.

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:10.860
And then I beat every single
level plus the secret levels,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.380
then every single level
plus the secret levels

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.000
with all the coins
on every level.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.900
And then on the DS you could
have three different lives

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.420
per game.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.220
And so I beat it once.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.886
I beat it again.

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:20.799
And then I beat it
again even faster.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.090
And it was at the end of March.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.740
And I was just about to reset
the device so I could do it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.820
three more times, and I
was like, oh, fuck this.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.430
And I put in a box, and
I mailed it off my sister

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.300
in Los Angeles.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.760
And I never saw the
damn thin again.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.240
But unfortunately I
was out about $170

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.240
that I didn't
really have to burn

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.840
and three months of my life.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.460
I swear to God, I played
hours of this game.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.380
JAKE KNAPP: Well, to throw into
sharp contrast what an idiot

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.870
Daniel is I want to tell
you a story of my own.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.990
And this also involves Nintendo.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.720
This is from a simpler time.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.337
So if you remember when
Nintendo looked like this.

00:02:54.337 --> 00:02:55.670
Raise your hand if you remember.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.480
Oh, OK.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.660
Awesome.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.368
All right, great.

00:02:57.368 --> 00:03:00.852
I'm glad that some
of you are also old.

00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:02.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.260
JAKE KNAPP: So my story
takes place in the year 1986.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.270
And it's actually a
story about my wife

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.660
who was nine years old in 1986.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.190
As was I, although I didn't
know her at the time.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.180
And like all nine year olds
in the United States in 1986,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.630
I don't know about Canada, but
everyone wanted a Nintendo.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.800
And this is what the
Nintendo looked like.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.970
It was a big box.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.824
And everybody was
so excited about it.

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:28.990
But it costs a lot of money.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.120
So it cost $199, which if you
adjust that for inflation it's

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.270
over $400.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.640
It's a lot of money at any
time if your nine years old.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.659
Actually, Daniel, I don't
know for you Canadians.

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:43.700
Hopefully this will help.

00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:47.470
DANIEL BURKA: I have to
deal with this all the time.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.149
Thanks.

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:49.690
JAKE KNAPP: This is
actually how much

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.965
maple syrup you can buy for $200
in case you guys were curious.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.690
And leaders is spelled
the Canadian way.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.060
Craftsmanship here.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.740
So anyway, my wife
is very industrious.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.460
And she scrimped and saved.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.175
She did chores around
the neighborhood,

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:05.580
and she saved up her allowance.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.410
And finally, finally
she had $200.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.030
She was ready to
make the purchase.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.020
And then right at the last
minute she got cold feet.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.510
She was like, oh my gosh,
I saved up all this money,

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.279
I don't know if I should do
this, I'm only nine years old.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.755
I don't know if she thought
that, but she wasn't sure.

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:25.470
And so she made this really
unusual arrangement that for $4

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.810
she would rent a Nintendo
from her neighbor.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.935
And she'd have it all day
Saturday, all day Sunday.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:32.393
She could play it as much as
she wanted, all the games, you

00:04:32.393 --> 00:04:33.880
know, the laser gun, everything.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.050
And I think that what
my wife envisioned

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.500
was something like this.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.870
So this is a photo from
Nintendo on the box at the time.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.810
And this is kind
of like captures

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.640
the scene of excitement that
everyone had about Nintendo.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.240
If you look closely
at these brothers

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.660
you'll notice that
they don't even

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.770
seem to notice Super
Mario Brothers is actually

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.060
a one player game.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.170
But that's what it was like.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.520
I mean, it was so great.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.710
And so she pictured
this, and she

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.754
pictured the family
gathered, and everybody,

00:05:02.754 --> 00:05:03.920
you know, watching her play.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.610
And the reality
was more like this.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.444
And this is not a photo.

00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:09.860
This is an artist's
interpretation

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.690
that my wife was really
excited about when she saw it.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.220
But this is what it was like.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.090
She's up till 3:00, 4:00 AM,
you know, eyes bloodshot,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.479
barely sleeping, playing
Nintendo the entire time.

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.020
And by the end of the weekend
when she gave the Nintendo back

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.320
she realized I cannot
handle owning a Nintendo.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.880
And she came to this
realization after just $4

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.600
and 48 hours of her time.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.740
This idea of renting before
you buy we think also

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.840
applies to product development.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.340
And that's the
essence of what we're

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.911
going to talk to
you about today.

00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:42.660
DANIEL BURKA: So the
way that we typically

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.680
see design and development
done at startups

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.800
is that you come up with
an idea, a hypothesis,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.200
something that might be
really great for your product.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.640
And then you build the
lightest weight version of it

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.880
that you can, you
know a simple V1.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.930
You really boil it down.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.790
Launch it into the wild,
measure the results,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.385
learn from those results, and
then iterate around the circle.

00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:06.760
Also from our experience this
is actually not a great way

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.200
to operate as a startup.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.072
And what really happens
in the real world is

00:06:11.072 --> 00:06:12.905
you frequently are
starting with a bad idea.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:13.624
And that's fine.

00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:15.540
I mean, that's the whole
point of a hypothesis

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.180
is something you're not sure
of that you want to test.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.430
But then you spend a lot of
time actually building out

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.310
that idea, and this
invariably takes

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.564
much longer than
you think it will.

00:06:24.564 --> 00:06:26.230
You've now invested
the time, and so you

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.563
feel like there's no going back.

00:06:27.563 --> 00:06:30.490
Aw, we better launch this
thing and see what happens.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.110
And where you're expecting to
have really nice statistics

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.040
and learn whether or
not something works,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.160
it's usually much muddier
than you hope it will be.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160
And what's that quote?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.520
There's lies, damn
lies, and statistics.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.860
And then when you're supposed
to be iterating again,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.110
you actually just move on
to the next shiny idea.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.790
And your products
out in the while.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.040
And it's gumming up the works.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.956
You've got all this code
now in your code base

00:06:52.956 --> 00:06:54.130
that you no longer want.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.100
It's really hard to
go back at that point.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.150
So we're trying to
do at Google Ventures

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.440
is we're trying to
shortcut that process.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.435
Over the course of a week we
ideate and flesh out an idea,

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:08.580
we prototype it,
and then we test it.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.525
And we call that a
five day design sprint.

00:07:11.525 --> 00:07:14.080
JAKE KNAPP: I want to tell
you just a super fast bit more

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.860
about Google Ventures in case
you're not familiar with it.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.070
You probably have
heard of Google.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.070
If you haven't, you should
totally check it out.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.230
It's a create search engine.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.860
But Google Ventures is actually
a small, separate company.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.810
So about 50, 60 employees.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.140
And basically what happens
is Google gives us money,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.230
and we in turn invest
it in startups.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.410
So we've invested in
250 startups so far.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.370
And as design partners
Daniel, and I,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.730
and the other three design
partners on the team,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.850
it's our job to help those
companies make the best

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.520
products possible so
they'll be successful.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.900
And we've done this with
countless different companies.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.970
But the story that I want
to tell you about today

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.080
is actually about
a coffee company.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.320
So Blue Bottle Coffee.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.420
I'm not sure how many of
you have heard about it.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.297
Somebody.

00:08:00.297 --> 00:08:01.880
So actually a coffee
company, not just

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.046
a clever name for a startup.

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:06.350
But if you're not familiar,
they have a number of shops

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.340
here in San Francisco, a
bunch in New York City.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.960
And if you were to go to the
ferry building, which is not

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.737
far from here-- If
you're from out of town

00:08:13.737 --> 00:08:15.070
you should totally check it out.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.860
There's a bunch of shops inside
the ferry building for tourists

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.742
and commuters, and
there's one in particular

00:08:19.742 --> 00:08:22.200
that always has a long line
kind of going down the hallway.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.740
And it's not the store
that sells only mushrooms.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.440
It's actually Blue
Bottle Coffee.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.370
And here's the line.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.880
And in fact, if you look
closely at that line

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.338
you might recognize
a familiar sort

00:08:31.338 --> 00:08:32.834
of praying mantis style figure.

00:08:32.834 --> 00:08:34.250
DANIEL BURKA: A
praying mantis who

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.143
only apparently owns one shirt.

00:08:36.143 --> 00:08:38.909
Nice.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.995
JAKE KNAPP: That's
my favorite shirt.

00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:42.667
DANIEL BURKA: It looks good.

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:44.750
JAKE KNAPP: As I was saying
before I was so rudely

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.160
interrupted, it's
a fantastic cafe.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.550
And they have this
beautiful interior design

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.060
some wonderfully friendly,
knowledgeable baristas,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.142
and great coffee.

00:08:55.142 --> 00:08:56.520
Their shops are very successful.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.895
It's a successful business.

00:08:57.895 --> 00:08:59.267
But they have a problem.

00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:00.350
it's with their web store.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.808
They felt like it could be a
bigger part of their business,

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.820
and it wasn't living
up to what they wanted.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.700
So after we invested in them
they came to our design team

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.450
and said, could you
help us out with this.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.460
So we decided to
do a design sprint.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.980
And the first thing we
do in a design sprint

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.190
is to manufacture a deadline.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.620
One reason why people like
to ship early and ship often

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.510
is because shipping
creates a deadline.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.880
It helps us get things done.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.580
I don't know about
you guys, but I'm

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.300
kind of a natural
procrastinator.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.290
And the deadline that
we create in our sprints

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.330
is also external facing, but
we do it with user studies.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.790
So on Monday, the first
day of the sprint,

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.160
we'll schedule five
customers outside to come in

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.924
and interview.

00:09:36.924 --> 00:09:38.590
And they're going to
look at a prototype

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.130
that we haven't designed yet.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.840
So right away we're like,
oh my gosh, the fuse is lit.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.892
Like we have to
get something done.

00:09:44.892 --> 00:09:46.350
Another key for us
on the first day

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.900
is getting all the right people
in the room for the sprint.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.740
And there are more right
people at most companies

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.050
than you'd think.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.795
It makes sense to
have the people who

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:57.420
are going to be
working on the product,

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.630
and building it,
and designing it.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.910
But we've also found
it's critical to have

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.450
the founder, the decision
makers, the people who really

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.420
understand on the ground
how the product works,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.027
and how customers are
interacting with it.

00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:12.110
We all need to work together,
because in this case

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.500
understanding how you
sell coffee beans online,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.350
it's actually not
straightforward.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.840
I didn't know how to do it
heading into the sprint.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.750
And so another thing
that we do on day one

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.117
is to look at things
out in the world

00:10:23.117 --> 00:10:24.950
and see if we can find
interesting patterns.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.590
So we look at a bunch of
successful coffee websites,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.750
and we saw this
pattern right away

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.190
that coffee is organized
quite commonly by region.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.430
So you can see it here.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.780
Latin America, Africa.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.340
Here it is again,
Africa, the Americas.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.540
Again here.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.335
This is the menu at Starbucks.

00:10:41.335 --> 00:10:43.710
Starbucks obviously knows a
thing or two about marketing.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.020
You can see Guatemalan
coffee, Colombian.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.812
And actually would you
guys raise your hand

00:10:47.812 --> 00:10:49.645
if you know the difference
between Guatemala

00:10:49.645 --> 00:10:50.680
and Colombian coffee.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.480
Does anyone here
know the difference?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.250
OK.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.850
So a couple of you do
know, which is awesome.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.670
But the rest of you
should not feel bad

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.474
because as it turns out
normal humans don't get this.

00:11:01.474 --> 00:11:03.890
I mean, most of the people in
this room didn't understand.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.765
DANIEL BURKA: Heck, we
even had a guy came in

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:07.797
for one of the user
studies who told us

00:11:07.797 --> 00:11:09.380
that he roasted his
own beans at home.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.671
So he's buying green beans,
he's roasting them himself,

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.090
and then brewing his own coffee.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.420
And even he sheepishly
admitted when we asked him.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.410
He's like, ah, when I
go to a cafe I never

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.869
know really what
the difference is.

00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:21.368
JAKE KNAPP: We're like, dude,
like you roast your own beans.

00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:22.830
If you don't know nobody knows.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.810
And don't feel bad.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.529
So this is like a
big challenge for us.

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:28.070
Like how should we
organize the beans

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.940
and help people decide what
to have shipped to their home

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.182
if people don't
understand the regions?

00:11:33.182 --> 00:11:34.890
We asked Blue Bottle,
because they really

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.550
wanted to take the
in-store experience

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.500
and kind of bring it to the web.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.720
And we said, well, like how do
you guys do this in the store?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.300
If somebody comes in and
they're looking at all

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.830
these brown paper bags, and
they want to buy some beans,

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.140
how do you guide them
through that decision?

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.723
And they said, oh,
well, when somebody

00:11:46.723 --> 00:11:49.372
asks for a suggestion we turn
around and say, how do you

00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:51.580
make your coffee at home,
because whether you make it

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.500
in a French press, or a Chemex,
or a drip machine that's

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.600
going to help us recommend
a great roast for you.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.730
And I remember when
they said that.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.710
I was looking at Daniel
and his eyes got big.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.180
And it was as if this
beam of inspiration

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.852
like shown in from outside.

00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:08.060
DANIEL BURKA: Just like that.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.690
Exactly.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:09.350
JAKE KNAPP: It was
just like that.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.950
This is a photograph,
so you know

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.460
that it's exactly
how it happened.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.074
And that kind of insight
actually only comes to us

00:12:16.074 --> 00:12:17.740
because we have the
whole team together.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.220
We have people who understand
every part of the product.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.080
And that turns out to be true
across all kinds of companies.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.230
So on the second day we've got a
bunch of insights from day one.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.380
We want to come up with a
bunch of different solutions

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.505
to compete with each other.

00:12:28.505 --> 00:12:31.615
So we don't just take one idea
and run with it off the bat.

00:12:31.615 --> 00:12:33.240
And the way we do
that is with drawing.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.170
But I want to make
sure you understand

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.670
we're not doing
group brainstorming.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.470
So we found that group
brainstorming just

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.696
does not yield high
quality results.

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:42.570
Instead what we want
are individuals spending

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.300
a long time, so an hour, two
hours, sketching very detailed,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.250
very well thought
through, and very

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.650
divergent opposing solutions.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.580
By the end of the day we've got
10, 12 different designs that

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.080
are all very detailed, and
they compete with each other.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.560
They can help us pick from a
number of different options.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.490
That choice though
is not so easy.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.222
And if any of you know, you
may have been in meetings

00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:05.930
like this where you're
kind of discussing

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.513
things, and
intellectualizing, and try

00:13:07.513 --> 00:13:09.460
to imagine like
which solution will

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.310
work best in the real world.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.200
And, you know, we want to get
some wisdom from everybody,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.420
but we also don't want
design by committee.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.450
And the way we kind of hack
the decision making process

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.600
is something we call
weighted voting.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.280
So first we'll give
everybody as many

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.360
as they want of these
little blue stickers.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.750
And you put the stickers by the
parts of ideas that you like.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.510
So very quickly
we get a heat map

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.430
on all these
drawings of the parts

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.630
of the ideas that work best.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.670
Next, we talk to the company
about how they make decisions.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.744
In this case, James the
founder, Katie the COO,

00:13:43.744 --> 00:13:45.410
they're the ones who
really need to make

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.140
the call on which
prototype we build,

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.430
on which design goes forward.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.460
So we give them a number
of these very big red dots,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.190
and they have a
limited quantity.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.220
In this case they
pick three designs.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.890
So first there's this idea
of recreating the cafe.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.715
So what if we literally took
the interior design of a Blue

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:05.110
Bottle Cafe and made a
website that looked that way?

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.750
The second idea is storytelling.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.350
Over the last day
and a half we've

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.760
heard all of this great
knowledge and expertise

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.409
from talking to the
Blue Bottle folks,

00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:14.950
and we wonder what
happens if we just

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.496
write a lot of that
stuff on the website.

00:14:17.496 --> 00:14:18.870
And then third,
there's that idea

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.830
of organizing beans by the way
you brew your coffee at home.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.830
Problem is we've got like
three different ideas,

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.050
and we still have to
make a prototype, right?

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.990
So we decided to
do, in this case,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.440
is what we call a Battle Royale.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.020
We're going to pit the three
prototypes against each other,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.600
and we're actually going
to build all three.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.315
Problem is, it's
already Thursday,

00:14:37.315 --> 00:14:39.820
and we only have one
day, and it seems

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.839
like there couldn't
possibly be enough time.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.380
DANIEL BURKA: So
we're going to build

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.787
three prototypes
in a single day.

00:14:44.787 --> 00:14:47.120
And we're not going to stay
up until 4:00 in the morning

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.820
to do it.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.610
We've got a few fancy tricks
in order to get there.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.930
The first, is that when we
were doing the sketching

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.080
we were not just sketching
individual screens.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.600
We were sketching little
three step or four step flows.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.684
So when we unpack the
ideas that we want to make,

00:15:01.684 --> 00:15:03.475
we're able to lay them
out in a storyboard.

00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:05.790
And this is, running
from the top,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.010
a storyboard of the
15 or 20 screens

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.440
that a user will run through.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.690
And we can just translate
those right onto the board.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.360
And then, as Jake
was saying earlier,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.120
when people were
doing the sketching

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.660
they weren't BSing it.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.039
They were taking the
time to write real copy.

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:21.830
They were putting where
the image might be,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.920
where buttons might be, what
realistic micro copy there's

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.640
going to be.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.130
And so we're able to just
take it from low fidelity

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.270
and push it up to a
much higher fidelity.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.260
And to move to that
level of fidelity

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.250
we actually choose
intelligent tools.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.850
And we're not working
in Photoshop generally.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.090
We often work in
Keynote for instance.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.220
This is a Keynote mock from
the Blue Bottle sprint.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.100
And we find it gives us that
Goldilocks level of fidelity.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.860
It's neither so
basic that users know

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.810
that they're in a
prototype, but it's also

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.800
not a good enough tool to do
production design where we're

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.830
spending a lot of
time polishing buttons

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.190
and making everything
look exactly perfect.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.735
We just want it to be good
enough to suspend disbelief.

00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:05.350
Keynote also has the advantage
that many people on the team

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.290
can contribute to it.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.150
It's a low barrier
to entry design tool.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.070
And then we use things
like Keynotopia,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.150
which is a little toolkit
that you can buy first

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.990
for Keynote to drag and drop
form elements into the mocks,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.890
so we're not redoing things
from scratch every time.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.440
It helps us move
really, really fast.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.390
So in the end we've taken
these three different ideas

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.780
and stitched together
15 to 20 step

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.020
prototypes of each one of them.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.375
We've got this one under the
brand Telescope Coffee that

00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:34.530
is exploring the storytelling,
Lindon Alley Coffee, which

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.370
is doing this kind of
skeumorphic version

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.000
of the store, and Potting
Shed Coffee, which

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.100
is doing the filtering
interface for choosing coffees.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.990
JAKE KNAPP: So it's Friday.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.720
And all week long this
fuse has been shortening.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.240
Now the bomb's going to go off.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.806
This is an amazing
drawing that I

00:16:51.806 --> 00:16:54.620
did in Keynote of an explosion.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.437
But it's time for us to
find out which prototype

00:16:57.437 --> 00:16:58.270
is going to succeed.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.030
So we're doing the research.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.630
And I want to talk
for just one second

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.570
about research, because
a lot of companies,

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.150
both small and large, are
reluctant to do user research.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.869
And one big barrier
is that people

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.150
feel like it's going to be
really hard and complicated.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.824
People think, ah, I need to
have a behavioral psychologist

00:17:15.824 --> 00:17:17.240
on our team to run
the interviews,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.834
and we need a special room
with like a one way mirror,

00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:21.619
and like a laser eye tracker.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:24.390
And the reality is you
really don't need much.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.250
This is our very fancy set up.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.950
It's a laptop.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.610
And on the laptop we're
running Keynote full screen.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.530
We've pasted a browser
bar on the slide

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.030
so it looks like you're
running a browser.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.600
And there's a webcam.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.310
And using GoTo
Meeting, or Apple TV,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.030
will project into another room
so that the rest of the team

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.170
can watch while one
person from our team

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.280
conducts the interview
with these customers who

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.360
we've recruited.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.510
So we do five one
on one interviews.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.080
And each interview we're
showing the customers the three

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.730
prototypes.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.896
We're showing them the
existing Blue Bottle website,

00:17:54.896 --> 00:17:56.230
so we get kin d of a baseline.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.070
And what's great
about this is we

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.391
get really good, really deep
data from just those five

00:18:01.391 --> 00:18:01.890
users.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.750
We'll hear a lot about why
things work and don't work.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.110
We'll get a sense from
watching people react about

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.230
whether they understand
parts of the designs.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.010
So the results of
our Battle Royale

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.350
are clear at the end of Friday.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:19.400
And this idea of recreating
the cafe totally bombed, which

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.860
is disappointing
to me personally

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.040
because it's the
design I worked on.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.680
But it's actually
really good news

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.600
if you're Blue Bottle,
because they didn't

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.930
have to build, and
launch, and then

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.080
wait to get those
results from the wild.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.350
And you remember that this
was an idea that we really

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.070
liked before we tested it.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.730
So it's great.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.260
We dodged a bullet.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.750
And it turns out that both
this idea of storytelling

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.930
and the idea of sorting
by how you brew at home

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.127
were very successful.

00:18:45.127 --> 00:18:47.460
And that's also kind of cool
because both of those ideas

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.194
were a bit risky.

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:50.610
Putting a lot of
text on a website

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.940
isn't what you suspect
will normally work.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.940
And nobody else was
organizing coffee in that way,

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.870
so if they just
had one shot at it

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.574
they might not have
taken those risks.

00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:02.740
Now they had the confidence
that these ideas worked,

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.310
and they went ahead and did the
ship early, ship often thing.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.700
And so they designed
the full site.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.870
And here's what it looks
like in the wild today.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.640
So you can see you organize the
coffee by how you brew at home.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.870
And you might recognize
this from the sketches.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.790
A lot of that copy
is still there.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.930
You see this really
long block of text.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.450
And conventional wisdom, don't
put a lot of copy on the web.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.750
People aren't going to read it.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.780
Turns out, we know that
it builds confidence

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.670
that these guys
are legit and they

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.890
know a lot about the coffee.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.490
They launched this website,
and it did quite well.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.530
So they doubled the
time spent on site,

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.280
and in turn they doubled their
sales growth, which is great.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.530
That's exactly what
they were hoping

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.300
for from this part
of their business.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.087
But you may be thinking
like this is just a website.

00:19:43.087 --> 00:19:45.170
DANIEL BURKA: So we've
done these types of sprints

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.450
with many different companies.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:47.600
Part of the reason
we chose Blue Bottle

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.820
is because it's a pretty
simple story to tell,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.790
but it's also a pretty simple
app when you look at it.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.680
You know, everybody's designed
an e-commerce site before.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.210
We've done lots and lots of
mobile prototypes as well.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.860
This is an example
from a sprint we

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.459
did with a company
called Cluster.

00:20:01.459 --> 00:20:03.250
So you can see we're
using a similar method

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.380
to sketch it out,
similar ideation.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.120
Here we're designing in
Keynote, piecing it altogether,

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.740
and then we're dragging it into
an app called Flinto, which

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.080
is an excellent mobile
prototyping tool, which

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.190
means that we can
get it onto device.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.120
And we've developed two
comps here in a single day.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.161
As you can see,
they look and feel

00:20:23.161 --> 00:20:25.410
a lot like a real mobile
app, even though they're just

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.190
static images stitched together.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.940
They've got buttons
and transitions.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.180
The title bar stays still.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.804
It's good enough to
suspend disbelief

00:20:32.804 --> 00:20:34.720
so we can get really,
really valuable feedback

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.470
from the users.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.940
And the second brand,
same kind of idea,

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.760
all put together
in a single day.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.380
And the set up is really
similar for user studies too.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.520
Just a document camera
over top of the device.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.121
And we have the person actually
interacting on a phone.

00:20:51.121 --> 00:20:52.840
We've done iPad prototypes.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.250
This is a company called FitStar
that does a mobile fitness app.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:05.330
And here we were
actually prototyping--

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.160
I'm not sure this
is going to go.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.980
We were actually
prototyping motion and sound

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.750
on this prototype.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.450
And so there's
actually video playing,

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.527
and we were recording audio
during the prototyping phase.

00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:18.610
So we were actually
prototyping an audio interface

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.150
where you're stepped back three
or four feet from the iPad,

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.570
and it's giving you
instructions out loud.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.600
And that was a really
interesting study that we did.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.910
See if we can get to
the next slide here.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.480
Maybe if I press it harder.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.980
JAKE KNAPP: This
is pretty exciting.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.104
I'm going to go try to
physically press the button.

00:21:35.104 --> 00:21:36.889
DANIEL BURKA: All right.

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:37.430
I don't know.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.540
My technique might be off.

00:21:43.216 --> 00:21:45.632
JAKE KNAPP: Guys just talk
amongst yourselves for a moment

00:21:45.632 --> 00:21:46.132
here.

00:21:46.132 --> 00:21:49.785
I'm sure we'll be
ready to go in no time.

00:21:49.785 --> 00:21:50.660
DANIEL BURKA: Oh boy.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.279
Jake's the funny one.

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:54.320
JAKE KNAPP: Yeah, so a
skeleton walks into a bar.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:54.860
And he says--

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.650
DANIEL BURKA: Oh
here we go Jake.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.149
It's moving.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:57.842
JAKE KNAPP: I'd like
a beer and a mop.

00:21:57.842 --> 00:21:58.800
DANIEL BURKA: Oh geesh.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.780
JAKE KNAPP: Thank you.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.379
Thank you for
laughing at that joke.

00:22:02.379 --> 00:22:04.670
DANIEL BURKA: So you can see
a bunch of video and audio

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.300
as well.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.010
And then the examples
I just gave you,

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.980
everything I've shown
you thus far has all

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.570
been consumer stuff.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.020
And so it's easy to recruit
users for consumer things,

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.760
because they're similar to
us, and there's lots of people

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.660
all over the world who
fit that demographic.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.220
But we've actually done work
with many different startups

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.220
in many different areas.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.470
We've recruited people like
geneticists and oncologists,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.160
woodworkers, truckers even
for one of the studies

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.710
that we did, and 80 other
companies across a wide variety

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.100
of industries, everything
from small startups

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.370
to big enterprises.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.740
JAKE KNAPP: So we're
investing in these companies,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.420
and we want them
to be successful.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.336
We think this is an
excellent process for them

00:22:44.336 --> 00:22:46.729
to use to build
confidence quickly.

00:22:46.729 --> 00:22:49.270
And if you guys are interested
in running a sprint like this,

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.200
there's kind of three
key ideas that I

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.447
think you ought to remember.

00:22:52.447 --> 00:22:54.030
One of them is
creating time pressure.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.030
It turns out that you can
manufacture a deadline

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:56.925
in a lot of ways.

00:22:56.925 --> 00:22:59.259
The second is getting
into a prototype mindset.

00:22:59.259 --> 00:23:01.800
And we try to figure out how to
build something high fidelity

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.370
as quickly as possible, rather
than building something real.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:06.830
Just creating a
veneer of reality.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.800
And finally, getting in this
mode of doing quick research,

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.830
which really doesn't have
to be very complicated.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.240
We hear this phrase a lot
around Silicon Valley,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.150
and I don't think it's
necessarily like a bad idea,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.910
but we just want to edit it
a little bit, because what

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.650
everybody really
ought to be doing

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.850
is learning early
and learning often.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.589
And when you do
it that way you'll

00:23:27.589 --> 00:23:30.130
find that you can really build
great products with a lot more

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:36.500
confidence, or as my wife
would say, rent before you buy.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.530
If you guys are interested
in running sprints

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.380
we've written a series
of blog posts about how

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.410
to run your own
sprint, everything

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.882
from the kind of pins you
should buy to all the way

00:23:46.882 --> 00:23:48.340
through to how to
run the research.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.684
If you go to gv.com/designsprint
you'll find the whole series.

00:23:51.684 --> 00:23:54.100
We've heard from a lot of
people who never actually talked

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.040
to us, and successfully runned
sprints using that DIY guide.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.080
And thank you very much.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.290
That is the end
of the first talk.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.220
Now, you may have one lingering
question about design sprints,

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.030
which is like if I
work at a big company,

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.446
like this is great
at the startup,

00:24:10.446 --> 00:24:12.040
but how do I make this work?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.720
And I actually created
the design sprint process

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.800
when I worked at Google.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.520
And I ran a bunch
of different sprints

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.020
with a bunch of
teams across Google.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.519
But I wasn't sure
if it could really

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:24.660
stick in a large
organization, which Google is.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.380
Nadya Direkova is a staff
designer and design evangelist

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.320
at Google.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.750
And she's taken the design
process, made some hacks to it,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.050
made some hacks to
Google's culture,

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.690
and been able to do over
80 sprints on some really

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.320
awesome products.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.850
I'm very excited to
introduce you to Nadya.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.750
And she's going to tell you
how it's done at Google.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.557
So without further
ado, here's Nadya.

00:24:49.557 --> 00:24:50.640
NADYA DIREKOVA: Thank you.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:56.870
Thank you, Daniel.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.220
Thank you, Jake.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.420
I'm really excited
to be here today.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.880
I've been looking forward
to this because very rarely

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.870
do we get a chance to talk about
how we do design at Google.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.820
And with the design
sprints we have

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.380
something that's
really cool and unique.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.880
Is it cool and unique because
design matters for all of us.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.940
And speed matters.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.560
If you're a startup up,
you're running out of money

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.350
as soon as you raise them.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.930
And if you're a
large company you

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.190
might have a team
and a goal that

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.410
is so large that by the
time that you meet it

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.750
it becomes obsolete.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:41.510
By combining speed and design
we are creating design sprints

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.870
to help a number of products
advance their goals.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.090
That helps us avoid
wasting time, money,

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.120
and precious ideas.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.690
It is true what Jake said.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.840
I have done 80 design sprints.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.180
And perhaps I should
warn you, it's

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.920
an addictive way of working.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.460
Once you start you don't know
where you're going to end up.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.560
I have not done these
sprints by myself.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.710
In every case there's
been a talented team

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.170
that worked with me
to compile their goals

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.580
and to decide how and
where they want to end up.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.980
So today I want to share with
you some stories about sprint

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.490
at Google X, sprints
at Google at scale,

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.000
and I want to give you
five hacks about how

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.260
you might be able to
do your own sprints.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:31.030
Let's start with
Google X. As you know,

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.980
X is the new product laboratory,
and we developed things

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.660
like the self driving cars.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.640
That was also the first
large sprint that I did.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.380
The team came to
me, and they said,

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.840
we want to create a shared
vision of how this product can

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.840
be not just an amazing
scientific discovery but also

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.320
an amazing product for people.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.350
As I started talking
to them I realized

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:55.220
that an interesting thing is
that by the nature of their job

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.080
each of them are focused
on different time frames.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.050
Some people are focused
on the short term,

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.110
and some people are
focused on the long term.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.090
In addition, what
was going to be

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.750
available for the team in terms
of technology and capacity

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.140
changes over time.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.480
So what's available today,
tomorrow, and in four years

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.220
from now really expands.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:20.150
The technology frontier for
anyone expands over time.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.730
So how do you create the
shared vision for something

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.870
that changes so much,
and where people already

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.300
perceive it in different ways?

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.420
What we did is create
two teams in parallel.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.980
In five days we were able
to create even more output

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.920
by sending one team
with requirements

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.910
for working two years
from now, and another team

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.730
working with requirements
for four years from now.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.840
They were able to create
really exciting vision videos,

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.910
and show the team kind of
like a postcard of what

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.070
might be happening in the future
and help make better choices.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.960
That was one week out of many,
but a very interesting week.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.500
One day I walked into
campus and I saw this.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.270
And I thought what is this?

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:08.540
This is one of the
balloons for Project Loon.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.950
The team is sending
these balloons in the air

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:14.120
in order to help
distribute internet

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.220
for parts of the world
that don't really get it.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.180
It's an amazing project.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.240
It gives me a sense of wonder.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.100
At the same time what
was really important

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.520
for them to create
great antennas so

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.560
the signal that's
sent from the air

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.540
can be received on the ground.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.560
So the talented design team at
the design kitchen at Google X

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.640
ran a design sprint.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.290
They came together.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.240
They explored different ideas.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.720
And they made prototypes,
like hardware prototypes,

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.720
like various different kinds
of antennas that they can test.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.540
What's interesting about it
is that if you put an antenna

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.030
on a conference room table, you
cannot tell if it's too large,

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.540
too small, or if
it's easy to install.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.670
It doesn't give you
a lot of information.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.540
So you actually
have to try putting

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.160
the antennae on different
pieces of something

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.990
that kind of looks like a house.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.370
And, in fact, they built
a house mock up in order

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.160
to be able to do that like that.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.670
How cool is that?

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.390
If you go to your
team and say, let's

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.180
build a house so we
can test our ideas,

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.717
they might think you're crazy.

00:29:16.717 --> 00:29:18.300
But that might also
be the right thing

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.091
to do if you want to
test your idea if it's

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:22.420
related to something like that.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.130
Glass is another team
that uses sprints

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.300
internally as one
of the toolkits.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.540
But they also pioneered
the idea of design sprints

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.010
for developers, for you guys.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.290
So the Glass development
team invites developers

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.610
to come and learn
about the platform.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.160
What are the design
requirements?

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.280
How do you make
something good with this?

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.680
They had a chance
to try the hardware,

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.380
to come up with different
ideas, and quickly

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.410
put the ideas from a Post-it
into something that's

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:52.760
like a functional prototype.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.430
It all happens in
about four hours.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.160
The sprint is not very long.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.910
And they logged their ideas.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.240
And now they can see
what they've made.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.590
And they can get feedback too.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.690
Quick learning.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.180
Exciting experience.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.960
So you see how this works
pretty cool for a product

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.780
lab like Google X. But
does it work at scale?

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.940
If you have a huge team and a
huge goal how does it happen?

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.510
Indeed, we have
found that sprints

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.720
have become very popular with
teams across the company.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.090
It's become one of the ways
in which the teams work,

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.610
from Google Fiber to Hangouts.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.625
In fact, if you have used
Hangouts to call your mom

00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:31.940
please thank Jake over here.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.180
The guy created the
idea of design sprints

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.850
at Google working with
team, and he used the sprint

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.560
to create an early version
of what became Hangouts

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.790
as a product.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.590
The team that's
working on Hangouts

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:48.900
is also using design sprints
to redesign and launch new UIs.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.070
So if that's not a design
feat, I don't know what is.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:57.110
The sprints here helped us
work with teams of four people,

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:00.910
and up to teams of 175.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:01.810
I'm not kidding.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.380
We literally had
that many sprinters

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.432
in a recent sprint
one month ago.

00:31:06.432 --> 00:31:08.390
I want to share a video
with you that gives you

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.820
a sense of what it's like to
be a part of this large sprint,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.290
where teams are running
in parallel in order

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:19.460
to meet goals in a very
shortened time frame.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.800
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.430
-Great design happens
within constraints.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.740
And those constraints
are good because it

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.900
helps narrow your focus.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.400
There's something about
pressure, and in many cases

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.450
conflict, that
creates good things.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:44.370
-So in our context a sprint is
a very focused, intense period

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.490
where we have a team of
people coming together

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.230
from different
disciplines and focusing

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.100
on solving a specific
design problem.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.025
-Too often there's a process
where one group works

00:31:56.025 --> 00:31:58.690
on something, and then they
hand it to the next group,

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.790
and then that group hands
it to the next group.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.330
And something gets
lost in translation.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.830
So this is a mechanism where
we can all get together

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.430
on the same page, and you get
much more tangible results much

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.102
more quickly.

00:32:11.102 --> 00:32:15.285
-The ability to kind of leapfrog
the traditional design process

00:32:15.285 --> 00:32:16.965
is incredible.

00:32:16.965 --> 00:32:18.840
-I think a lot of people's
idea of creativity

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.860
is you have this
freedom, you know,

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.650
leaning back in your chair
and just imagining things.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.150
And it's really not
like that anymore.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.840
-Watching what was
going on yesterday,

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.065
there was a lot of arguing.

00:32:29.065 --> 00:32:31.042
There was a lot of
dissatisfaction,

00:32:31.042 --> 00:32:33.320
and they had to figure
their way through that.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.240
And so today they're actually
testing their prototypes

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.802
and changing tack a little bit.

00:32:38.802 --> 00:32:40.260
And that's kind of
the magic of it.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.730
When you see these transitions
that these teams go through.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.470
-A lot of what comes
out of sprint week

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.480
is this intangible
camaraderie that

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.070
helps us work better together.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.010
But the second part
are the projects.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.245
-What we're trying to do here
is create very high quality

00:32:57.245 --> 00:32:59.945
deliverables that turn
into real products.

00:32:59.945 --> 00:33:02.692
-An actual artifact at
the end that you can then

00:33:02.692 --> 00:33:06.850
take to engineering to build,
or you can take to customers

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.810
to get more feedback on.

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.050
We hope that there will
be a lot of the projects

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.290
that people are working
on that will get picked up

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.430
in some form or another.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.645
But there's really no losers.

00:33:17.645 --> 00:33:21.350
When you participate in a sprint
you either win or you learn.

00:33:24.556 --> 00:33:25.510
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.593
NADYA DIREKOVA: All right.

00:33:26.593 --> 00:33:27.170
Win or learn.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:28.693
That's the spirit of the sprint.

00:33:28.693 --> 00:33:31.250
You win when you get to
make something awesome

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.030
and get totally shocked
at how fast you can run.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.930
And then you learn if
you create something

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.280
that advances your goals.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.010
You know how to do
it better next time.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.640
So you might have
your design process

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.090
and your own way of working.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.920
I want to share five
hacks with you that

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.470
will help you
compress your design

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.700
process from a large piece
to something that's short,

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.140
a week or less.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.080
We're hoping that these
hacks will help you.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:04.270
First is to be aware that the
sprint is something to design.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.130
It's worth putting
the effort into it,

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.080
and here's the workflow
for a typical sprint.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.110
There's work before,
during, and after.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.800
Before the sprint
you want to make sure

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.179
that you're solving
the right problem.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.060
It doesn't matter if
you create something

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.219
that no one wants
to use or it's not

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.409
useful in your organization.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.420
So you need to focus
on a challenge.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.600
You want to create a team.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.600
Bring the right people together.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.600
Schedule the sprint so that it
makes sense and every minute

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.020
is planned.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.650
During the sprint it's about
letting the teams experience

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.050
the right set of design
methods and research methods.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.250
And it's about working
as fast as you can,

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.320
helping resolve the
conflicts, looking

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.570
for that deeper insight.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.159
After the sprint it's
all about making sure

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.659
that the results are
pointing towards launch.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.560
You want to be successful.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.090
I want to draw
your attention here

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.740
to how much effort is
involved before and after.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.919
Many people skip that
part, and they only

00:34:59.919 --> 00:35:01.335
focus on the middle
of the sprint.

00:35:01.335 --> 00:35:04.960
It's so exciting, let's just
run and make amazing things.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.080
You want to make sure
that you're prepared,

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.820
and that you're pointing towards
launch before and after so

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.800
that you can be successful
in order to create.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.440
Now, here's another hack.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.380
Because the design sprint is
a unique way of working we

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.930
have also created a new role.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.420
We call that the sprint master.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.240
This is the person who's going
to be the CEO of the project

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.480
and make sure for the duration
of the sprint everybody's

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.300
working at an amazing pace.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.925
Now, this is not a
duck with a snorkel.

00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:37.200
It's a ninja.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.420
These people are awesome.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.420
So here's Jin.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.290
He's the designer and
the sprint master.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:43.980
Here's Marty.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.485
He's a designer and
the sprint master.

00:35:46.485 --> 00:35:49.600
Ellen, Lauren, and Dave.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.950
What they have in common is
that they're awesome designers,

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.160
but they also are prepared
to be sprint masters,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.690
and they can take
their team and make

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.300
them totally shocked in how
much they can achieve together.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.680
We found that by measuring
the satisfaction of sprints

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.370
that had and didn't
have trained sprint

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.810
masters that the
second kind was better.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.860
People are more satisfied
with participating

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.470
in a sprint that's well crafted.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.500
So the reason also that
sprint masters matter

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.220
is that if you have a team
that's only sprinters,

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.550
the most predictable
outcome is that they end up

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.882
in different directions.

00:36:24.882 --> 00:36:26.340
You need the sprint
master in order

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.310
to create the sense of a
common goal, of a shared

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.025
goal, and a shared dream,
and let them run fast.

00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:35.050
And the sprint
master ensures that.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.670
Designing the team is another
and very interesting part

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:38.740
of it.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.010
Now, you know from Jake that
working with designers, PMs,

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:44.470
engineers, everyone
is really crucial.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.380
What happens if you're
missing someone?

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.180
Say you need to add the
researcher to your team

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.870
because you don't have one.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.890
The sprint is an opportunity to
redefine who is on your team.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.000
You can invite the researcher
from your larger organization,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.670
or find someone
from the industry.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.460
No one wakes up
hoping that they're

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.620
going to have a boring day in
which they do not contribute

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.890
decidedly anything
towards mankind.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.970
So when you invite
someone to a sprint

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:12.790
they have a chance
to do something cool,

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.310
and generally people say yes.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.080
I've been surprised on how many
people I've been able to invite

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.160
and enrich the team.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.380
Another hack is
about accountability.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.570
I put these brackets
here because I

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.720
call these
accountability brackets.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.170
It's about starting
and ending something.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:31.835
Just like in software you
don't start and forget

00:37:31.835 --> 00:37:34.380
to end something because it
doesn't compile if you don't

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.070
have the right braces, these
accountability brackets

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.510
help remind us about what
to do at the beginning

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.670
and at the end.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.620
No matter what your
design processes is

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.670
we recommend that you start
and end with user research.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.970
At the beginning you
want to open the bracket

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.290
and talk to users,
learn about their needs.

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.090
It is always amazing the
sense of empathy and discovery

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:54.510
that you can get from that.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:58.140
Like the time Daniel kind of
got this shining light over him

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.690
because he observed
what people are

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:03.090
like when they go to
the store to buy coffee.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.170
And you want to end
with user research.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.350
You just created something.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.940
You finished, closed
Photoshop, or you

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.760
closed your
prototype and coding.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.634
And now you can bring
that to people and ask,

00:38:11.634 --> 00:38:12.780
is that meeting your goals?

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.300
There's always interesting
things to learn.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.850
The other hack
around accountability

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:21.152
is how to optimize
the executive time.

00:38:21.152 --> 00:38:22.610
Now, we saw that
at Google Ventures

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.400
the executives are often a
part of the entire experience.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.230
What happens if your
executives are not

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.390
available, or not available
for the whole time?

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:32.540
You can invite people
and your executives

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.670
to visit you at the
beginning of the sprint.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.650
You can interview them
for about 20 minutes

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.740
and learn about their
goals so that your team can

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.070
be aligned with where
they want to go.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.280
As a bonus, you can bring
them in in the middle

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.110
to get a check in.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.590
Are we going the right way?

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.440
And then afterwards
you want to make sure

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.030
that resources are committed
so that your sprint is going

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.890
and continuing way
beyond the [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.455
that you created it for.

00:38:55.455 --> 00:38:57.540
Now, if you're a
designer it might

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.170
feel intimidating to
go to an executive

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:01.510
and invite them to a sprint.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.080
I understand.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.396
But think about it from the
executive's perspective.

00:39:05.396 --> 00:39:06.770
They don't wake
up in the morning

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.760
hoping to have a boring day.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.886
By going to a sprint,
even in 20 minutes,

00:39:10.886 --> 00:39:12.760
they get a chance to
participate in something

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.560
special, energizing, impactful.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.120
So it might be worth
it for them too.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.160
So starting and ending
with someone's time,

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.490
someone who'll be approving
your work, is very important.

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.270
So with that we learned
about stories and sprints

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:32.740
from Google X, across Google,
and we learned some hacks.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:33.820
That's great.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.800
But something's missing here.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.570
I promise.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.350
There's something that
you haven't heard yet.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.230
You cannot learn about
design by listening to me.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.510
Talking and thinking about
it is only so helpful.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.500
I would like to invite
you to some sprints.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.930
I'm so glad you're excited.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:56.040
Tomorrow at 9 o'clock there'll
be a sprint with Glassware.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.260
The Glass team is putting
a sprint for you guys.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.340
And at 11:00 the legendary
team at Google Ventures

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.210
will be running a sprint
for you guys as well.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.480
These will not be
five days experiences.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:06.980
I promise.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.820
AUDIENCE: Yay!

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.903
NADYA DIREKOVA: There'll
be two hours in which you

00:40:09.903 --> 00:40:12.370
have a chance to learn about
the basics of the methodology

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.550
and to test and learn
something quickly.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.290
Later this summer we
would like to welcome you

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.870
to additional sprints for
Glassware Material Design that

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.180
got announced today,
and for Android Wear.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.500
You can sign up.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.680
And if you're interested
in this way of working,

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.750
let us know at this form.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:36.240
designsprints with an S 2014.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.100
Let us know and bring your team.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.540
I want to leave you
with this message.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.000
Make great things.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.440
And you might as
well do it fast.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.906
The world needs you.

00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:55.334
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.155
NADYA DIREKOVA: OK.

00:41:00.155 --> 00:41:01.515
JAKE KNAPP: Do we have time for?

00:41:01.515 --> 00:41:02.500
NADYA DIREKOVA: Let's check.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.030
JAKE KNAPP: Oh, we do.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.880
We have four minutes.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.735
NADYA DIREKOVA: We have four
minutes for your questions.

00:41:05.735 --> 00:41:06.030
JAKE KNAPP: Fast questions.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.440
NADYA DIREKOVA: Take it.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.900
JAKE KNAPP: Right there.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.600
Yeah.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.184
First hand up.

00:41:09.184 --> 00:41:11.141
NADYA DIREKOVA: There's
two mics here and here.

00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:13.215
So you can line up and
give us your questions.

00:41:13.215 --> 00:41:14.090
JAKE KNAPP: Oh sorry.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.340
DANIEL BURKA: Or just yell
it out, and I'll repeat it.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.091
AUDIENCE: How do you go about
selecting users for your user

00:41:19.091 --> 00:41:21.206
testing at the
end of the sprint?

00:41:21.206 --> 00:41:22.330
JAKE KNAPP: Great question.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.740
So how do we go about
selecting users for our studies

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.950
at the end of the sprint?

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.658
The method that we
use at Google Ventures

00:41:27.658 --> 00:41:30.250
is actually mostly Craigslist.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.900
We'll post an ad on Craigslist.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.590
We'll get 200, 250
responses in a major city.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.430
And what's really important is
that we have a screener survey.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.890
So we'll use a
Google survey to ask

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.370
them to answer a bunch of
questions that doesn't reveal

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.161
exactly what we're
looking for, and then we

00:41:45.161 --> 00:41:46.710
get a spreadsheet
we can go through.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.250
The way you structure
that survey,

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.625
the way you write that ad is
really important so that you

00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:53.450
don't get, you know-- You
want quality customers that

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:55.370
match exactly what
you're looking for.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.670
And there's some posts on there,
if you follow that same link,

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.910
gv.com/designsprint, you can
find your way to some posts

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.592
about how to do that.

00:42:03.592 --> 00:42:05.550
For some customers, just
to add one more thing,

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:08.176
if you need a certain
kind of expert user

00:42:08.176 --> 00:42:09.550
we'll usually rely
on the company

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.610
to use their connections.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:12.200
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.270
My question will be what are the
general questions that you will

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.210
be asking the users on
the interview session

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:21.560
after you have the prototype?

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.980
I mean, you must have
a template questions

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.630
to facilitate your
design to the users.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.200
What are those templates
and general questions?

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.220
Thanks.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.630
JAKE KNAPP: The best source
for those questions is also

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.160
gv.com/designsprint.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.250
But to give you a
little tantalizing

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:38.650
hints of what it's like
the key is actually

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:42.300
to structure the interview
guide right to the prototype.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.310
So you want to get people
reacting rather than giving you

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:45.810
feedback.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.840
You want them to be moving
through the prototype

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.050
as though it was real.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.730
And the best way to do that
is actually a little nuanced.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.480
So I'll totally direct you
to check out the blog posts

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.805
for all the detail about
writing those questions.

00:42:58.805 --> 00:42:59.430
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.870
You guys spoke about two
pretty different scenarios.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.870
You spoke about
sprinting as individuals,

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.650
whereas you talked
about bigger groups

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.000
and sort of teams that sprint.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
My question is when you have
groups that sprint together,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.334
do you interfere at all with
the dynamics of that group?

00:43:13.334 --> 00:43:15.791
Because sometimes you have,
you know, really strong voices,

00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:17.599
and really shy voices,
and stuff like that.

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:19.890
Do you at all interfere with
the dynamics of the group,

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.650
or do you just kind
of let it happen?

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:24.120
NADYA DIREKOVA: The question
is whether in large groups

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.620
trying to interfere or not?

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.520
That's the role of
the sprint master.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.170
I don't call it interference.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:32.057
I call it leading.

00:43:32.057 --> 00:43:33.640
JAKE KNAPP: We also
want, when there's

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.889
a dynamic about how decisions
are made in the company,

00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:37.646
we want to understand
it and expose it.

00:43:37.646 --> 00:43:39.020
We want to ask
them how it works,

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.920
and make sure that the
way we make decisions

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.780
mirrors that so
that we don't create

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.292
a false sense of collegiality.

00:43:44.292 --> 00:43:46.500
DANIEL BURKA: A lot of the
decision making stuff Jake

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.340
was showing with
the stickers, you

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.790
know, we're not standing
around arguing with each other,

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.380
because then the person with
the loudest voice can win.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.540
We're stopping, doing a
lot of individual thinking,

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.600
and then voting individually.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.370
So people are much more
independent of each other,

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:06.130
and not susceptible to
so much group think.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:07.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.440
What are some of your tips
for enforcing deadlines

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.940
when you need to wait
for significant data

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.300
to make intelligent iterations?

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.880
JAKE KNAPP: Well, I mean that's
a pretty complex question.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.480
I think that what significant
data is defined as

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.080
is like-- I don't
know what you mean.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.390
We think that you can
get really good data

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:29.891
from a lot of different ways.

00:44:29.891 --> 00:44:31.890
And one of them is these
kinds of user research.

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.570
There are other
ways to get it fast.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.195
And I understand sometimes there
are certain kinds of decisions

00:44:36.195 --> 00:44:38.190
that you can only get
from a real world launch.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.820
But our framework,
our lens, is what

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.544
is the fastest way we can test
this hypothesis that we have.

00:44:45.544 --> 00:44:48.210
There's something we don't know,
and how can we get to an answer

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.260
as quickly as possible?

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.200
We need to test it somehow.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.860
And if we think of it as
a prototype and a test

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.790
it opens up a new
world of possibilities.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.248
When you think the
only way you can

00:44:58.248 --> 00:45:00.020
get data is to
launch and measure

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.720
a live product, or a fully
functional live product,

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.430
it limits you.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.150
So without detail
it's hard for me

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:07.900
to not give that kind
of hand wavy answer,

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.310
but I think the key
for us is always

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:14.629
thinking what's the fastest
way to answer the unknown.

00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:16.504
NADYA DIREKOVA: We'll
take one more question.

00:45:16.504 --> 00:45:18.360
AUDIENCE: What tools
or modifications

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.440
can you suggest for working
with a distributed design team?

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.996
So if they can't physically
be there to put stickies

00:45:23.996 --> 00:45:25.495
do you have like
tools they you use?

00:45:25.495 --> 00:45:27.120
JAKE KNAPP: The best
tool is a plane.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.960
If you can just get them there
that would work the best.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.335
Nadya, do you have
any experience

00:45:31.335 --> 00:45:32.360
with this that's worked well?

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.120
NADYA DIREKOVA: You
can do Hangouts.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.620
I mean, it's best
if you're together

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.161
because you really
feel that bonding.

00:45:36.161 --> 00:45:41.120
But you cam work in a virtual
way using like virtual tools.
