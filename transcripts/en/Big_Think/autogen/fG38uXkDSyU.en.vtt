but that's no reason to be gloomy and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
but that's no reason to be gloomy and
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.800
but that's no reason to be gloomy and
that's become a mantra in some sense and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
that's become a mantra in some sense and
 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.359

it seems particularly appropriate when

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
it seems particularly appropriate when
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.010
it seems particularly appropriate when
you think about the universe because the

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020
you think about the universe because the
 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.660
you think about the universe because the
universe first of all does isn't here to

universe first of all does isn't here to
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.759

make us happy it isn't here to please us

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
make us happy it isn't here to please us
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769
make us happy it isn't here to please us
and it doesn't give a damn what happens

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779
and it doesn't give a damn what happens
 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.389
and it doesn't give a damn what happens
to us and the far future the universe is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
to us and the far future the universe is
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.399
to us and the far future the universe is
likely to be miserable as I talked about

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:34.409
likely to be miserable as I talked about
 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.869
likely to be miserable as I talked about
in my last book and I point out my new

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879
in my last book and I point out my new
 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.119
in my last book and I point out my new
book could even be more miserable so in

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
book could even be more miserable so in
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.369
book could even be more miserable so in
a purposeless universe that may have a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
a purposeless universe that may have a
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.099
a purposeless universe that may have a
miserable future you may wonder well how

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109
miserable future you may wonder well how
 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.829
miserable future you may wonder well how
can I go about each day and the answer

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839
can I go about each day and the answer
 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.259
can I go about each day and the answer
is we make our own purpose we make our

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269
is we make our own purpose we make our
 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.889
is we make our own purpose we make our
own joy we are here by a cosmic accident

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
own joy we are here by a cosmic accident
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229
own joy we are here by a cosmic accident
as I've tried to show that it's a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
as I've tried to show that it's a
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.969
as I've tried to show that it's a
remarkable accident that's allowed you

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979
remarkable accident that's allowed you
 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.399
remarkable accident that's allowed you
and I to be here to talk us to think and

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409
and I to be here to talk us to think and
 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.649
and I to be here to talk us to think and
appreciate the beauty and splendour of

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659
appreciate the beauty and splendour of
 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.430
appreciate the beauty and splendour of
the universe

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
the universe
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.649
the universe
so the fact that that the universe

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659
so the fact that that the universe
 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.599
so the fact that that the universe
itself may have no purpose doesn't

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:05.609
itself may have no purpose doesn't
 

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:06.920
itself may have no purpose doesn't
affect our purpose in fact it's the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
affect our purpose in fact it's the
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.499
affect our purpose in fact it's the
incredible height of solids is 'm to

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509
incredible height of solids is 'm to
 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.990
incredible height of solids is 'm to
assume that without us the universe

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
assume that without us the universe
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.179
assume that without us the universe
doesn't matter and that if the universe

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
doesn't matter and that if the universe
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740
doesn't matter and that if the universe
is purpose purposeless

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
is purpose purposeless
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.980
is purpose purposeless
we don't matter we make our own purpose

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
we don't matter we make our own purpose
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.779
we don't matter we make our own purpose
and it seems to me life is more precious

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789
and it seems to me life is more precious
 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.990
and it seems to me life is more precious
because it's temporary and accidental

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
because it's temporary and accidental
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.450
because it's temporary and accidental
and we should take advantage of that and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
and we should take advantage of that and
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.109
and we should take advantage of that and
we have evolved brains and that allows

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
we have evolved brains and that allows
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.989
we have evolved brains and that allows
us to ask questions not just about how

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999
us to ask questions not just about how
 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:35.300
us to ask questions not just about how
the universe works but how we should

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
the universe works but how we should
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.340
the universe works but how we should
behave now it's a long philosophical

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
behave now it's a long philosophical
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.899
behave now it's a long philosophical
debate about whether you can get aught

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
debate about whether you can get aught
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.599
debate about whether you can get aught
from is and maybe you can never get off

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609
from is and maybe you can never get off
 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.279
from is and maybe you can never get off
from is and maybe reason it's a slave of

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289
from is and maybe reason it's a slave of
 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.169
from is and maybe reason it's a slave of
passion but one thing seems clear to me

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179
passion but one thing seems clear to me
 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.899
passion but one thing seems clear to me
that without knowing what is you can

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
that without knowing what is you can
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.239
that without knowing what is you can
never get too OTT or if you do the art

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249
never get too OTT or if you do the art
 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.219
never get too OTT or if you do the art
that you get to is silly if you don't

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
that you get to is silly if you don't
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.899
that you get to is silly if you don't
know the consequences of your actions

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
know the consequences of your actions
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.999
know the consequences of your actions
which is really what science tells us

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
which is really what science tells us
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.059
which is really what science tells us
then you can't assess how to behave and

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069
then you can't assess how to behave and
 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.179
then you can't assess how to behave and
so understanding empirical phenomena is

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
so understanding empirical phenomena is
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.849
so understanding empirical phenomena is
a central plays a central role in

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859
a central plays a central role in
 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.160
a central plays a central role in
leading a better life it seems to me and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
leading a better life it seems to me and
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.020
leading a better life it seems to me and
it should play a central role in public

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
it should play a central role in public
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.380
it should play a central role in public
policy so that we as a society can make

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
policy so that we as a society can make
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.850
policy so that we as a society can make
sound decisions about how to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
sound decisions about how to
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.330
