00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the solution that we hear is that you can do a vertex cover

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
with just three vertices, so here's one example.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.200
You could select this one which would cover all of those edges here.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.000
Now we could select this one, covering all those edges.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And, finally, we could select the one down here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So all edges are covered selecting just three vertices,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.500
and there are alternative solutions but none that contain less than three vertices.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Now what about over here--here we can find

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
a very small vertex cover using just two vertices.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.500
This vertex here, we just don't even need to care about

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000
because it has no edges that it's connected to.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We can select this one here--it covers all of those edges.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And we can select, for example, this one here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Or not only for example because this is actually the only possible smallest solution.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
So now we did this exercise to see if vertex cover could have any relation

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
to clique or independent set.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.300
So let's have a look back at which vertices were contained

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.000
in the largest possible clique in this network,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and those were four vertices--it was this one here, this one here,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
this one, and this one.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Not any really apparent relation between the two problems.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This one over here, however, is more interesting

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because in the largest possible independent set, we had those four here.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So it could seem like vertex cover--those two green vertices here--

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is exactly the opposite of independent set,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so if you have found the largest possible independent set,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
then you have found the smallest possible vertex cover.

00:01:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And, indeed, it's actually not that difficult to see that this is always the case.
