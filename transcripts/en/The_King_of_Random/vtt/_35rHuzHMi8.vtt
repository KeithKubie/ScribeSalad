This video is sponsored
by the Casper Mattress.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.879
In today's video,

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.650
we're taking a look at
what happens when you combine

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.440
super glue with
a warm borax solution.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.120
The result will surprise you!

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.880
And I'm not saying that in the clickbait way.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.160
I mean it surprised the heck out of me,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.500
so it will probably surprise you, too.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500

[Music]

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.880
[Music]

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.069
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.550
We'll dissolve some borax
into some hot water,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.880
and then we'll add super glue to it
in increasingly large quantities.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.840
We'll then watch what happens

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.660
when we introduce
a large quantity of our super glue

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.020
into the borax solution very rapidly.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.910
First, let's get a pot of hot water,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.160
and add our borax.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.300
[Music]

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.980
Warm borax solution,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.100
and an eyedropper full of
cyanoacrylate or super glue.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.019
[Music]

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.569
The super glue catalyzes immediately
on contact with the boric acid,

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.010
and it comes out in
these really cool patterns

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.829
that just kind of look like
pieces of plastic floating through water,

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.460
or maybe pieces of coral,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.460
or something organic.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.460
I don't know.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.619
It's really bizarre.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.060
At this point,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.620
they're also completely catalyzed,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.950
they're not sticky anymore.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.530
There's no super glue leftover,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.180
it's just catalyzed plastic.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.440
Not terribly durable,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.780
it feels kind of hard,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.630
but you can usually
just tear them apart

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.060
if you're determined.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.500
We've seen that
the super glue turns white

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.020
when it hits our borax solution,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.160
and I think we can add
a little bit of color

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.760
using some alcohol ink.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.640
[Music]

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.030
You can see that it mixes in
quite well with the super glue.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.520
It doesn't cause it to catalyze
or anything like that.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.399
So, now let's see what happens

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.740
when we drip some of
the orange super glue

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.100
down into our pot.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.079
[Music]

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.840
We definitely have managed
to dye the superglue,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.620
and dye the plastic that forms,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.340
and inject it down
into the borax solution.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.180
You may have also noticed that
it was going a tiny bit slower this time,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120
and that's actually due to the heat.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.540
It reacts a lot
quicker in very warm water,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.540
and now this has been out here

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.820
for just long enough
to start cooling down.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.380
To scale this up one step,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.340
let's make a slightly
larger batch of our borax solution,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.460
and then fill this tray.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.860
I want to see if
we can draw cool designs

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.420
using the super glue
right into the liquid.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:30.420
[Music]

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.040
It's not the prettiest
crown I've ever seen,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.800
but it'll do.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.520
The King of Random Crown,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.600
a little bit different from
how we're used to seeing it maybe.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.040
That really just looks like
crystal growth or coral or something.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.360
We've got this big glass cookie jar,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.720
and we're going to fill
this up with hot borax solution.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.060
We're then going to dye some
of our cyanoacrylate glue,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.780
and fill a small
water balloon with it.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.720
We'll suspend that water balloon
underneath the borax solution,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.980
and then pop the balloon instantly,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.420
exposing all of that glue
to the borax solution around it.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.960
This should be fun.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.420
Guys, I want to take a quick minute,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.260
and talk about Casper,
the sponsor for today's video.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.640
We should be spending
one third of our lives in bed,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.560
so why not make sure that
bed is super comfortable.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.700
If you are looking to
upgrade your quality of sleep,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.130
you can now get $50 off
of selected mattresses from Casper.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.540
Just go to
CASPER.COM/THEKINGOFRANDOM

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.640
and enter promo code
THEKINGOFRANDOM.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.710
The Casper brand mattress
is carefully engineered

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.520
with several types
of layered memory foam

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.420
to give you just the right
combination of support,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.780
and sinking in.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.360
Even though this is a nice,
thick, very squishy mattress,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.180
they do manage to smash it down,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.630
small enough that it fits
an impressively small box

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.720
when it arrives.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.220
It is still a decent-sized box
because it's totally a mattress,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.440
but it looks way too
small to be holding this.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.820
When you're buying a Casper mattress,

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.210
you're buying directly from the company,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.220
you're cutting out the middleman,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.090
and you save on those costs.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.400
You don't have to pay someone else
to be storing it in their warehouse,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.760
and then showing it off,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.620
and then all of the salesmen
fees and stuff like that.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.560
You're just getting the Casper mattress
directly from the people who make it.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.480
After you get your mattress,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.280
you have a 100-day sleep on it trial,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.450
which means you get to have
this bad boy for over three months,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.390
making sure that it
is the mattress you love.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.380
And if you don't like it,
they have a no-hassle free return.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.580
Thank you to Casper
for providing my mattress,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.169
and for sponsoring today's video.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.420
Remember, you can now get $50 off
of selected mattresses by going to

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.379
CASPER.COM/THEKINGOFRANDOM

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.300
and entering the promo code,
THEKINGOFRANDOM.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.520
I'm trying to use about a half
of the super glue in the one balloon.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.580
[Music]

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.360
Perfect.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.720
Okay, three, two, one.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.740
No!

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.340
It didn't have enough pressure!

00:04:50.340 --> 00:05:04.080
[Music]

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.660
Whoo!

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.040
[Music]

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.140
Orange and pink.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:19.580
[Music]

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.560
All right! Well, it's going
to have that much air in it.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.219
Okay, so I'm going to put it under,

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:25.500
squeeze, and then stab it.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.740
[Music]

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.860
Oh, that's amazing!

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.760
[Music]

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.340
Little pockets of the glue got trapped.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.960
It was just activating as they pull,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.700
and leak their way forward.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.800
A piece of my glove got glued
in place onto the balloon.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.440
That, is the result of the super glue

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.920
catalyzing,
catastrophically,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.300
and immediately with the borax solution.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.160
It's kind of weird.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.599
It feels as if you took
like thin plastic bags

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.900
and then melted it down into a blob,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.279
so there's like really rigid parts
but then the edges of it are like very

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.340
flimsy-thin plastic still.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.660
I'm trying to just tear it in half.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.660
[Music]

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.640
Ahhh!

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.020
[Music]

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.460
I dip it down into
the borax solution,

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.990
because I don't know
if there's gonna be bits of it

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.229
that haven't catalyzed,

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.021
and I don't want to get
those all over my hands,

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.280
and glue my gloves together.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.280
Expands a lot!

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.840
That is way bigger than
the balloon I put down in there.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.499
And this thicker portion is actually
the line along which the balloon ruptured,

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:38.499
So, we have it,

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:39.499
it tore open right here,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.669
and right here,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.280
and then these pieces were a little
slower to move out of the way,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.440
as the whole thing expanded.

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.810
So yeah, you can sort of see
that egg shape of the balloon,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.480
and then all the pieces
that erupted out of it.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.620
That is a really cool reaction
with a really cool result.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.440
You know looking at it,

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.979
I'm not sure if I like
the exploding balloon better,

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:00.139
or the leaking balloon better.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.060
They gave us these
like cool snake things.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.080
Both of them, I thought
turned out really well.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.120
This first one with the orange plastic

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.420
didn't have the same
result as the second one.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.259
That's because something
about the cyanoacrylate glue

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.980
makes the latex rubber of
the balloon not be very stretchy.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.180
So, even though it was full
of liquid and underwater,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.240
it didn't really have
any pressure to pop apart.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.120
So, when I stabbed it,
it didn't rip open,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.520
it just sort of started
leaking out of that one hole.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.571
That's why for the second one,

00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:31.610
I was actually squeezing
the balloon as I hit it with the needle.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.580
And that made it
tear open all at once.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.040
Guys! The fun is not over,
there's more for you to see.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.680
That box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.090
and you should go check that out.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.909
The box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:43.909
you should be watching next.

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:46.040
And this bomb in the middle
will subscribe you to our channel

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.540
so you never miss a video.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.740
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:49.749
and we will see you in the next one.

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:50.540
Talk to you then.
