problem of course the basal problem was
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.970 align:start position:0%
problem of course the basal problem was

the question was not quite this son but
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.990 align:start position:0%
the question was not quite this son but

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.529 align:start position:0%
but essentially this son 1 plus a 1 over

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 align:start position:0%

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840 align:start position:0%

and so to get this enclosed form this
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.250 align:start position:0%
and so to get this enclosed form this
was<00:01:06.000><c> the</c><00:01:06.090><c> problem</c><00:01:06.330><c> to</c><00:01:06.390><c> get</c><00:01:06.540><c> it</c><00:01:06.630><c> in</c><00:01:06.720><c> closed</c><00:01:06.900><c> form</c>

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
was the problem to get it in closed form
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.510 align:start position:0%
was the problem to get it in closed form
and<00:01:07.470><c> this</c><00:01:07.830><c> was</c><00:01:08.010><c> famously</c><00:01:08.549><c> solved</c><00:01:09.060><c> by</c><00:01:09.210><c> Euler</c><00:01:09.689><c> in</c>

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
and this was famously solved by Euler in
 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.250 align:start position:0%
and this was famously solved by Euler in
1735<00:01:11.520><c> and</c><00:01:11.909><c> he</c><00:01:12.330><c> showed</c><00:01:12.630><c> that</c><00:01:12.659><c> this</c><00:01:12.900><c> was</c><00:01:13.110><c> equal</c>

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
1735 and he showed that this was equal
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.210 align:start position:0%
1735 and he showed that this was equal
to<00:01:13.680><c> PI</c><00:01:14.490><c> squared</c><00:01:14.880><c> over</c><00:01:15.090><c> 6</c><00:01:16.049><c> now</c><00:01:16.320><c> of</c><00:01:16.650><c> course</c><00:01:16.770><c> Euler</c>

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
to PI squared over 6 now of course Euler

did<00:05:51.090><c> that</c><00:05:51.120><c> was</c><00:05:51.300><c> cuz</c><00:05:51.509><c> I</c><00:05:51.570><c> wanted</c><00:05:51.930><c> to</c><00:05:52.080><c> estimate</c>

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 align:start position:0%
did that was cuz I wanted to estimate
 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.399 align:start position:0%

through quite a few I have a list here
 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.350 align:start position:0%
through quite a few I have a list here
what<00:06:14.099><c> I</c><00:06:14.130><c> did</c><00:06:14.400><c> was</c><00:06:14.639><c> I</c><00:06:14.849><c> went</c><00:06:14.969><c> through</c><00:06:15.210><c> those</c>

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
what I did was I went through those
 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.290 align:start position:0%
what I did was I went through those
numbers<00:06:15.810><c> and</c><00:06:16.400><c> I</c><00:06:17.400><c> checked</c><00:06:17.819><c> whether</c><00:06:18.150><c> the</c>

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
numbers and I checked whether the
 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.659 align:start position:0%
numbers and I checked whether the

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 align:start position:0%
combinations were co-prime so in other
 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
combinations were co-prime so in other
words<00:06:20.940><c> I</c><00:06:21.150><c> asked</c><00:06:21.690><c> what</c><00:06:21.840><c> was</c><00:06:21.930><c> their</c><00:06:22.139><c> greatest</c>

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 align:start position:0%
words I asked what was their greatest
 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
words I asked what was their greatest
common<00:06:22.889><c> divisor</c><00:06:23.639><c> of</c><00:06:23.880><c> the</c><00:06:24.659><c> three</c><00:06:24.870><c> numbers</c><00:06:25.050><c> and</c>

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 align:start position:0%
common divisor of the three numbers and
 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.670 align:start position:0%
common divisor of the three numbers and
if<00:06:25.740><c> that</c><00:06:25.889><c> greatest</c><00:06:26.460><c> common</c><00:06:26.520><c> divisor</c><00:06:27.000><c> was</c><00:06:27.300><c> want</c>

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
if that greatest common divisor was want
 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.860 align:start position:0%
if that greatest common divisor was want
then<00:06:28.680><c> there</c><00:06:28.889><c> co-prime</c><00:06:29.340><c> if</c><00:06:29.909><c> it</c><00:06:30.150><c> was</c><00:06:30.330><c> something</c>

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 align:start position:0%
then there co-prime if it was something
 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.939 align:start position:0%
then there co-prime if it was something
of<00:06:30.930><c> a</c><00:06:30.990><c> higher</c><00:06:31.110><c> than</c><00:06:31.349><c> one</c><00:06:31.530><c> then</c><00:06:31.710><c> they're</c><00:06:31.830><c> not</c>

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 align:start position:0%
of a higher than one then they're not
 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.140 align:start position:0%
of a higher than one then they're not
going<00:06:32.219><c> quite</c><00:06:32.400><c> so</c><00:06:32.550><c> I</c><00:06:32.580><c> just</c><00:06:32.729><c> went</c><00:06:32.880><c> through</c><00:06:32.909><c> and</c><00:06:33.090><c> I</c>

going quite so I just went through and I
 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
going quite so I just went through and I

checked them all all the different
 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.740 align:start position:0%
checked them all all the different
combinations<00:06:34.760><c> so</c><00:06:35.760><c> let</c><00:06:35.969><c> me</c><00:06:36.029><c> do</c><00:06:36.150><c> I've</c><00:06:36.570><c> gotta</c>

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 align:start position:0%
combinations so let me do I've gotta
 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.750 align:start position:0%
combinations so let me do I've gotta
count<00:06:36.990><c> this</c><00:06:37.169><c> now</c><00:06:37.349><c> really</c><00:06:37.710><c> I</c><00:06:38.150><c> haven't</c><00:06:39.150><c> haven't</c>

count this now really I haven't haven't
 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.010 align:start position:0%
count this now really I haven't haven't
check<00:06:39.910><c> this</c><00:06:40.030><c> I</c><00:06:40.180><c> didn't</c><00:06:40.420><c> check</c><00:06:40.600><c> that</c><00:06:40.660><c> and</c><00:06:40.930><c> all</c>

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 align:start position:0%
check this I didn't check that and all
 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.390 align:start position:0%
check this I didn't check that and all
that<00:06:41.050><c> the</c><00:06:41.320><c> estimate</c><00:06:41.620><c> came</c><00:06:41.770><c> out</c><00:06:41.920><c> right</c><00:06:42.100><c> so</c><00:06:42.310><c> this</c>

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
that the estimate came out right so this
 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
that the estimate came out right so this
is<00:06:42.460><c> real</c><00:06:42.760><c> times</c><00:06:43.150><c> the</c><00:06:43.390><c> election</c><00:06:43.810><c> stuff</c><00:06:43.930><c> so</c>

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 align:start position:0%
is real times the election stuff so
 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
