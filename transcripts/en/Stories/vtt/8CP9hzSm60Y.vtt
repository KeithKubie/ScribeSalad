[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:03.168
NATHAN SAWAYA: Lego has given
me the title really unique

00:00:03.168 --> 00:00:06.410
customer, because I buy
hundreds of thousands of Lego

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.751
every month.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.110
I used to practice corporate
law in New York City--

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.800
mergers, acquisitions,
real exciting stuff.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.099
And I would come home after
a long day at the law firm,

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.640
and I would need
some sort of outlet.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.348
And I would draw.

00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:25.520
I would paint.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.887
And sometimes I would sculpt.

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:28.720
It was just one day I
thought about this toy

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.350
from my childhood, Lego bricks.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.960
Could I sculpt large scale
sculptures using this toy?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.640
And so I started experimenting.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.640
And I dug out all the old bricks
I had from when I was a kid

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.370
and just tried to replicate
things I saw in my apartment.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.840
And I put together a
website which became really

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.670
my virtual gallery.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.260
People started contacting
me and saying hey,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.176
can you build me this?

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:53.510
Can you build me that?

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.350
Actually when my website
crashed from too many hits

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.800
that I realized ah,
there's something to this.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.820
And I decided to
make that change.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.304
And I left the law firm behind
to play with bricks full time.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.099
The reaction from friends
and family was interesting.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:12.640
And there was some people who
were a little negative about it

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.620
and thought I was crazy.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.390
I didn't know how
long it would last.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.310
I thought, maybe I'll be
able to pay rent next month,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.850
but I don't know if I'll
have a job after that.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.560
During those down times when
I didn't have something,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.320
didn't have a
commission, that's when

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.116
I would create art for myself.

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:31.990
And that's really what
"The Art of the Brick"

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.880
became, this exhibition of
art that I created on my own

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.610
that now tours the globe.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.240
The time that it takes
to create a sculpture

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.450
really depends on the size
and complexity of the piece.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.560
So a life size human form can
take up to two to three weeks.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.210
Something smaller could be done
maybe in a few days or a day.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.950
The longest I've ever
worked on something

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.750
is about three months
for a sculpture

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.420
of a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton
that was about 20 feet long.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.910
Recently I spent two months
working on a Batmobile.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.630
The bricks I use in my art
are the very same bricks

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.630
that people can
purchase at a toy store.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.530
I don't paint them.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.520
I don't have access to special
colors or special shapes

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.550
and sizes.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.550
And we're in my art
studio today where I have

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.420
over 5 million Lego bricks.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.400
When you look at my
sculptures up close,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.460
you see all those sharp
corners and right angles.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.230
And then you back away from
it, and all those corners,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.440
they blend into curves.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.440
And that's kind of the
magic of using Lego bricks.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.240
You know, you don't have
to find one career path.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.990
There are many ways to get
to where you want to go,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.960
even if you don't know
where that is right now.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.979
You can always
change what you are.

00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:52.980
NARRATOR: To see how
close pro snowboarder Mike

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.970
Basich chases storms in
his mobile, tiny home,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.999
watch this next video.

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.540
MIKE BASICH: The
view always changes,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.790
which has been really fun.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.373
You just pull up
the side of road,

00:03:02.373 --> 00:03:04.460
all of a sudden you
have lakefront property,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.030
international forest.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.710
Next one you're on a little
creek or out in the desert.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.540
The landscape's just amazing.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.400
It's like having real
estate that's priceless.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.030
Everyone misses
home at some level.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.930
You never get
homesick with this.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.180
NARRATOR: Thanks for watching.
