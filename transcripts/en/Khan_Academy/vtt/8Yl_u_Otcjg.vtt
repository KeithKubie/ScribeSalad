00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.370
Let's see if we can evaluate
this indefinite integral.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.230
And the clue that
trig substitution

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.400
might be appropriate is
what we see right over here

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.280
in the denominator
under the radical.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.200
In general, if you see
something of the form

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.929
a squared minus x squared, it
tends to be a pretty good idea,

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.470
not always, but it's a good clue
that it might be a good idea

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.156
to make the substitution x
is equal to a sine theta.

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:23.530
Because if you do
that, then this

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.540
will become a squared
minus a squared sine theta.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.680
And if you factor
out the a squared,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.550
you can start leveraging-- this
is a squared-- you can leverage

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.170
one of the most
basic trig identities

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.940
that this right over here
is cosine squared theta

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.134
and maybe simplify
the expression.

00:00:40.134 --> 00:00:41.550
Now, you're probably
saying, well,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.530
this 8 minus 2x squared,
it's not as obvious

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.610
that it's a squared
minus x squared.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.800
But we could simplify this.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.258
Or I guess we can
write it in a way

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:50.780
that it starts to
have this pattern.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.350
You can rewrite 8 minus 2--
let me write it right under it.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.570
You could write 8
minus 2x squared

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.629
as, if we factor out a 2, as
2 times 4 minus x squared.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.340
And now this very clearly
has a pattern a squared

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.040
minus x squared.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.600
You could write this as 2 times
2 squared minus x squared.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.520
So in this case, a
would be equal to 2.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.350
So let's make that substitution.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.040
Let's make the
substitution that x

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.010
is going to be equal
to 2 sine theta and dx

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.910
is going to be equal to
2 cosine theta d theta.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.350
So what's this part under
the expression going to be?

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.683
Well, we already started
simplifying it right over here.

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:41.790
It's going to become 2 times
2 squared minus x squared.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.310
x squared is 2 sine
theta, so x squared

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.440
is going to be 2 squared
sine theta squared.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.850
And now we can factor
out the 2 squared.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.610
So this is going to
be 2 times 2 squared

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.800
times 1 minus sine
squared theta.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.250
2 times 2 squared, well
that's just going to be 8,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.500
times cosine squared theta.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.270
That's what we have
under the radical.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.140
So let's do that.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.480
Let's rewrite this
thing up here.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.840
So we're going to
have-- and I'll

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.700
take the pi outside
of the integration.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.940
So we're going to
have pi times dx.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.800
dx is 2 cosine theta d theta.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.810
So it's going to be--
let me make it clear.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.350
So dx-- I want to
do that in blue.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.090
dx right over there is
2 cosine theta d theta.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.680
So let me write
that, 2 cosine theta.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.180
And I'll write the
d theta out here.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.346
I could have written
it in the numerator.

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:42.720
And then here in
the denominator,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.890
I'm going to the square
root of this business,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.990
the square root of 8
cosine squared theta.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.450
So the square root
of that is going

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.890
to be 2 square roots of 2.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.250
The square root of 8
is 2 square roots of 2.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.240
So let me write this.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.865
So let me make it
clear what I'm doing.

00:02:56.865 --> 00:02:59.670
So this right over here is going
to be the square root of this,

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.730
which is 2 square roots of 2.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.900
That's the square root of 8.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.730
And the square root
of cosine squared

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.540
theta is going to
be cosine theta.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.160
Now, you might be
saying, hey, wait,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.440
if I take the square root
of something squared,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.190
then wouldn't that just be the
absolute value of cosine theta?

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.290
In order to take away
the absolute value,

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.470
I'd have to assume that
cosine theta is positive.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.600
But we can make that assumption
that cosine theta is positive,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.700
because if we look right here at
this part of our substitution,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.950
if we wanted to solve for theta,
you'd divide both sides by 2,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.900
and you'd get x of 2 is
equal to sine of theta.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.456
Or we could say that theta is
equal to arcsin of x over 2.

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:48.380
Now the arcsin function, as
it is traditionally defined,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.390
will return theta that is
between negative pi over 2

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.510
and pi over 2.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.870
And in that range,
cosine of theta

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.895
is always going to be positive.

00:03:57.895 --> 00:03:59.770
So we don't have to
write the absolute value.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.380
We know cosine
theta is positive.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.910
So now we can start to simplify.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.550
Cosine theta cancels
out with cosine theta.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.990
This 2 cancels out with this 2.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.310
We can bring this square
root of 2 outside.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.560
And so we are left with
pi over this square root

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.709
of 2 times the indefinite
integral of just d theta.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.700
And this is just going
to be equal to pi over

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.660
the square root of 2
times theta plus c.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.810
And we're almost done.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.420
We just have to rewrite
this in terms of x.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.726
And we already know that theta
is equal to arcsin of x over 2.

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:39.962
So we can say that this
indefinite integral,

00:04:39.962 --> 00:04:41.670
or the antiderivative
of this expression,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.700
is going to be pi over
the square root of 2

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.790
times arcsin of x over 2 plus c.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.415
And we're done.

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:53.706
Some people like a square
root of 2 in the denominator.

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:55.700
If you want to remove
it, you can multiply this

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.640
by square root of 2
over square root of 2,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.950
and that will simplify it.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.866
But right now, I'll just
leave the denominator

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:04.160
in irrational form.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.071
And this right over here
is our antiderivative.
