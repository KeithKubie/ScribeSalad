[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.280
-Good afternoon, everybody,
and thank you for joining us

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.940
and the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.030
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.370
I'm Dean of the
Institute, and I am

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.020
delighted to welcome you today
to our conference on women

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.940
in biotech.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.280
The Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.790
is a unique
intellectual community

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.250
where scholars, scientists,
and artists work

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.560
at the forefront of
their disciplines

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.320
and across academic boundaries.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.060
It fosters an
intellectual climate

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.150
of both daring and
rigor, characteristics

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.080
that are shared with the
fast-evolving field of biotech.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.880
At Radcliffe, we are also
deeply committed to sharing

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.570
advanced work with the
public through conferences

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.660
like this one.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.080
We at Radcliffe are proud
of our rich tradition

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.830
of programming in the sciences.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.530
That tradition hearkens
back to Mary Ingram Bunting,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.110
the fifth president
of Radcliffe College

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.760
and founder of our forerunner,
the Radcliffe Institute

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.990
for Independent Study.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.170
Bunting was a microbiologist.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.050
More recently, my
predecessor as dean

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.850
was a computer
scientist, Barbara Gross,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.350
who I'm so pleased to
have with us here today.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.190
I also want to acknowledge
and extend sincere thanks

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.480
to Dr. Nancy Hopkins of MIT.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.490
Nancy, who's also here
in attendance today,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.930
inspired this
conference, just as she

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.190
has inspired and encouraged
women in the sciences

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.830
through her life and her work.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.160
I also want to thank
our panelists, who

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.920
have come from lecture
halls, labs, and boardrooms

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.560
to think about women in
biotech with us today.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.410
Radcliffe's deep
commitment to the sciences

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.580
manifests itself in a
number of ways this fall.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.420
We have many
impressive scientists

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.880
among the year's 50 fellows.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.880
Our annual science
symposium will

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.680
consider the past,
present, and future of DNA

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.140
on Friday, October 2.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.940
And we will continue
our inquiry into

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.790
genetic and
microbiological questions

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.220
over the course of this academic
year with our science lecture

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.290
series.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.670
You can see these events and
many more of our fall offerings

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.300
listed on the calendar
cards that we've

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.780
placed on your chairs.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.335
And we also encourage you
to check out our website

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:35.730
to keep apprised of the
many opportunities we

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.020
offer to engage with
interesting, important, and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.210
timely issues.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.070
The topic of biotech is
intriguing for many reasons.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.330
Since Stanford scientist
Herbert Boyer teamed up

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.340
with venture capitalist
Robert Swanson in 1976

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.920
to found the
Genentech Corporation,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.910
biotech has been at the nexus of
cutting-edge laboratory science

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.970
and venture capital.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.230
The commercialization of
recombinant DNA technology

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.300
has altered relationships
between universities,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.220
government, and industry.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.380
In our daily lives,
it has changed

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.000
and will continue to change
in profound ways how we eat,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
how we grow things,
and how we heal.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.420
Another reason that biotech
is an exciting field

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.360
is that there are women
in leadership positions,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.730
and there have been
from the very beginning.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.420
When H. Stewart Parker
graduated from the University

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.250
of Washington in
1981, she was hired

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.740
as the very first employee
of the Immunex Corporation

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.100
in Seattle.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.290
From that start, she went on
to serve the biotech industry

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.360
as vice president of corporate
development, president, CEO,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.300
director, chairman,
and lobbyist.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.980
Her career makes
the point that right

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.790
from the start of the
biotechnology industry, there

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.400
have been women leading it.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.290
I know that we have some of
them in the audience here today,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.260
and we will hear from
others as we listen

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.450
to this afternoon's panels.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.670
But how many are there?

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.940
In 2001, a study revealed
that women made up about 10%

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.010
of senior leadership
in top biotech firms.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.060
That study acknowledged that
the number was a little low.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.470
But it also exuded
confidence that, with so many

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.070
scientifically talented
women in the pipeline,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.300
those numbers were sure to soar.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.550
In some ways numbers
have climbed.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.010
More women than men now attend
college, more women than men

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.130
study biology at the
undergraduate and graduate

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.030
levels, and more than half
of all biology PhDs today

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.640
are earned by women.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.610
Women are not as
well represented

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.400
on science faculties
and universities,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.000
but they make up an
increasing proportion

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
at the assistant rank.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.210
So 26% of biology
faculty at MIT are women.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.660
At Harvard, women constitute
30% of tenured and tenure

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.030
track biology professors
within the faculty of Arts

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.060
and Sciences.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.450
While all these changes have
been happening in academia,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.140
the practice of
science itself has

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.370
been altering in some other
quite significant ways.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.120
Most notably,
scientific research

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.340
has been increasingly
privatized and commercialized.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.570
What that means is that today's
most significant advances are

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.840
just as likely to happen in
a privately owned lab geared

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.460
toward profit as they are
in a nonprofit, educational,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.840
or governmental setting.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.560
Corporate, particularly
venture capital sponsorship,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.570
means that big
breakthroughs and big money

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.730
are now very likely to be
made in the same place.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.780
So how many women
are in that place?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.210
How have all the
optimistic predictions

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.600
made in 2001, that the
10% percent number was

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.760
about to take off, panned out?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.260
Well, a study of
senior leadership

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.200
in top biotech firms in
2014 found that women

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.900
comprise-- are you ready-- 10%.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.580
Where that 10% can be
found is also revealing.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.350
Massachusetts Biotech
Research Council data

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.570
showed that most senior
women are in communications,

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.490
human resources, and
development-- important roles

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.330
to be sure, but still not
the same as directors,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.250
chief financial officers,
or chief executives.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.020
Studies show that
the absence of women

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.080
does not arise from any lack
of ambition on women's parts,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.560
and this is very important.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.120
In a 2014 survey of
industry leaders,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.830
equal percentages
of men and women

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.100
identified being named to
a board as a personal goal.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.040
Yet, while 59% of
the men surveyed

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.930
had been invited to join a
board, only 16% of the women

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.200
had.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.820
But don't worry, the
2014 study assures us.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.700
There are so many talented
women in the pipeline

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.330
that the numbers are
about to skyrocket.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.700
The numbers we're supposed
to do that in 2001.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.080
But now, almost a
decade and a half

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.180
later, they still have not.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.160
So where are all those eagerly
awaited women in biotech?

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.290
Thanks to the work
of Nancy Hopkins,

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.550
we have learned that they are
not on boards of directors

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.160
or on scientific
advisory boards.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.500
Hopkins used data from a
Kauffman Family Foundation

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.820
report to demonstrate that only
about 5% to 8% of those bodies

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.960
consist of women.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.290
So what is stopping up
this pipeline of women

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.170
in the biotech industry?

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.110
One recent incident that got
a lot of press offers a clue.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.450
Dr. Tim Hunt of the
UK holds a Nobel Prize

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.300
in physiology and medicine
for his work on cell division.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.059
At the World Conference
of Science Journalists

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.390
in South Korea this
past June, Dr. Hunt

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.929
stated publicly that--
and I'm quoting him--

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.447
"girls were nothing but
trouble in science."

00:08:42.447 --> 00:08:44.530
And here's what he said.
"Three things happen when

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.550
they are in the lab.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.010
You fall in love with them,
they fall in love with you,

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.810
and when you criticize
them they cry."

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.050
End quote.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.820
Well, that kind of
attitude could well

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.600
be part of what is blocking
the promised pipeline.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.650
Women facing
prejudice in science

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.200
is not a new topic, of
course, and concern about it

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.990
is not new either.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.560
In 1994, the journal Science
ran a three-part series on women

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.900
in science.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.480
At that time, editor-in-chief
Daniel E. Koshland reflected,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.590
and I'm quoting him,
"Although many formal barriers

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.870
to women's participation
in science have fallen,

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:27.260
cultural attitudes and
antagonism remain."

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.320
Nobel Laureate Hunt certainly
proves that statement

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.360
to be true.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.180
Koshland further wondered
more than 20 years ago

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.470
in another quote,
"if society can

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.920
afford to be underutilize
the abilities of half

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.760
of its citizens."

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.090
More recently, a
team of researchers

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.340
led by Laurel Smith-Doerr,
who's here with us

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.210
today, found that, and I
quote, "Women are currently,

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.550
and have historically
been, underrepresented

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:59.450
in top leadership positions in
biotech policymaking, research,

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.760
and management.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.540
Without equal input
from both men and women

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:09.440
in decision-making, solutions
to today's intractable problems

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.740
are unlikely to be optimal."

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.650
Even more bluntly,
the study warned,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.640
and I quote, "We are missing
out on talented leadership

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.270
and on diversity
in leadership that

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.360
could be readily achieved."

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.540
Missing out indeed.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.990
A recent independent report
entitled "The Bottom Line--

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.760
Corporate Performance and
Women's Representation

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.780
on Boards" found that
companies, including Fortune 500

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.420
companies, with three or
more women on their boards

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.840
outperformed their counterparts
with fewer women in all ways,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.640
including financial success.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.260
That evidence deserves
a wide hearing,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.280
and it is likely that one of the
significant pressures keeping

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.950
women out of biotech boardrooms
is the dependence of startups

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.680
on venture capitalists, who
may take risks in certain areas

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.180
but who are risk adverse in
others like gender equity.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.620
Let's make sure that money
talks in this conversation.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.030
We seem, in conclusion,
to be facing

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.130
a clear problem of
talent under-utilization

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.920
in the burgeoning
world of biotech.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.630
No field, no country,
no society can

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.780
afford to squander the talents
of half of its population.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.020
Science certainly cannot.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.090
At Radcliffe, we have known
that to be true all the way back

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.130
to the days of Mary Bunting.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.670
So what better place
to ask questions

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.540
about where women in biotech
have been, where they are now,

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.450
and where we want them
to be in 10 years time?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.650
I hope we will leave this room
today not only with a deeper

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.480
understanding of the obstacles
to women's participation,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:59.120
but also with new insight into
how we can turn things around.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.300
To get our conversation started,
I'd now like to hand things

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.650
over to Professor Dan Carpenter.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.180
Dan is the faculty director
of social science programs

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.640
at the Radcliffe Institute, and
he is also the Allie S. Freed

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.440
Professor of Government in the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.697
So, Dan.

00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:20.106
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.780
-Thank you, Liz.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.700
I'm proud that Radcliffe today
hosts a conversation that

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.810
brings some of the best
and brightest minds

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.020
from academia, industry,
and other domains

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.790
to talk about a critical
problem facing not only

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.670
our system of science but also
our economy and one of its most

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.780
important industries.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.934
Dean Cohen has just outlined
the parameters of that problem,

00:12:53.934 --> 00:12:55.600
and you're going to
hear much, much more

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.590
in the hours that follow.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.570
We at Radcliffe
recognize, of course,

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:03.380
that the gender gap in
biotech is a complex problem,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.620
and that the facts on
the ground are changing

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.850
as we meet and speak today.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.200
Our panelists
indeed are also well

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.250
aware of the fluid
nature of this problem,

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.640
and of course of the enduring
structural disparities that

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.800
continue to shape the
biotechnology industry.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.840
The Radcliffe Institute excels
at the interdisciplinary.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.920
There's a lot of talk
at various universities

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.820
about breaking out
of boxes, busting out

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.360
of silos, a lot of talk about
the importance of getting

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.280
interdisciplinary.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.820
But in my 20-year
experience in the academy,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.470
there is not a single place that
does it as well as Radcliffe.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.690
And that's the kind
of event that we're

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.804
going to bring to you today.

00:13:47.804 --> 00:13:49.720
Some of the panelists
you will hear from today

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.260
are life scientists who
have had scientific training

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.400
and experiences in the life
sciences industry for decades.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.600
The social science panelists
you will hear today

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.880
are trained sociologists,
psychologists, and management

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.370
specialists, and
they have themselves

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.500
spent decades studying
this industry in-depth

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.476
and others like it.

00:14:09.476 --> 00:14:11.350
We're going to hear from
scientists, but also

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.540
from those who study the
careers of scientists.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.610
We're going to hear from biotech
entrepreneurs, but also those

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:22.180
who study, systematically
and with very granular data,

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:27.620
the operations and successes
or failures of biotech firms.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.080
Before turning to
the first panel,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.540
let me transition
by way of a story.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.980
I've written some on the
Food and Drug Administration

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.390
and on food and drug law and
the regulations governing

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.710
the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.600
in a few years ago I had
the privilege of serving

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.690
on the United States
Institute of Medicine,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.310
or IOM, committee
examining issues

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.220
in the pharmaceutical industry.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.220
The report was commissioned
by the Food and Drug

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.790
Administration,
which regulates all

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.290
of the companies and the
people who invent and produce

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.510
the products that together make
up the biotech world that we

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.710
know.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.850
When it came time to deliver
the report to the FDA,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.770
my colleagues and I met with
the commissioner of the FDA

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.580
and the top staff of the agency.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.940
On one side of the
table, the IOM committee.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.990
On the other side, the FDA.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.240
Not in an adversarial setting,
but in one of deliberation

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.630
where the roles of each side
were clearly delineated.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.930
Here's what I
remember so clearly.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.460
Not a single person on the FDA
side of that table that day

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.280
was a man.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.000
Not just the commissioner,
Margaret Hamburg,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.590
but also the various
associate commissioners,

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.830
the scientific staff, the
legal staff, and the others.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.210
I wasn't the only
one who noticed this.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.840
As one of my fellow
committee members--

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.930
there were several of them-- had
spent a lot of time at the FDA,

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:54.480
he turned to be and said,
20 years ago, Dan, we

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.300
would have been sitting
across from a lineup of guys,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.770
and a much less stellar
crew than this one, at that.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.880
I'm not going to
name that gentleman,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.070
but I think he was
probably right.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.140
Now keep in mind this.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.240
The business biotech model
rests and will continue to rest,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.600
no matter what changes happen
under current legislation,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.560
on company sponsors persuading
the FDA that their products are

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.490
safe and effective.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.060
Quite beyond the important
ethical, social, and economic

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.130
issues at stake today, there
is a business and management

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.330
issue.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.260
Unless we think the
gender diversity

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.400
has nothing to do with the
ability to make a case,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.430
how sustainable a business
model, how sustainable

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.240
an arrangement, is it
for an industry whose

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.730
higher echelons are
populated overwhelmingly

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.200
by men to make a
business life or death

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.040
case to an agency
increasingly staffed

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.790
by the best and brightest women?

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.820
I'll leave that
for you to ponder.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.710
Our symposium today proceeds
in two parts, the problem

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.800
and possible solutions to it.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.420
The first is entitled "Defining
and Analyzing the Problem."

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.270
That's the panel to my left.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.240
Then after a break,
"Solutions and Strategies--

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.430
What Works and What Has Not,"
followed by closing remarks

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.599
by my esteemed colleague,
Janet Rich-Edwards.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.150
To kick off the first panel
on problem definition,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.619
I'm going to turn to
Professor Monica Edwards, who

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.250
has written some of the most
insightful early work-- I'm

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:30.730
sorry, Monica Higgins-- on
the early biotech industry.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.700
She is Kathleen
McCartney Professor

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.320
of Education Leadership
at the Harvard Graduate

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.840
School of Education.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.773
Monica, thank you and welcome
to the Radcliffe Institute.

00:17:39.773 --> 00:17:40.272
-Thank you.

00:17:40.272 --> 00:17:43.506
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.191
-Good afternoon, everybody.

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:47.815
Good afternoon.

00:17:47.815 --> 00:17:48.540
-Good afternoon.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.550
-There we go,
warming ourselves up.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.760
Because we are
all here to tackle

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.550
the challenges, the problem,
and to think of some solutions

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.690
to move us forward
in this space.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.470
I want to thank the
Radcliffe Institute

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.540
for inviting all of us.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.830
Thank you so much.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.530
Looking forward to an
exciting afternoon.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.880
My name is Monica Higgins
I'm a faculty member,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.530
as Dan said, right across the
green there at the Harvard

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.560
Graduate School of Education.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.630
Delighted to be here.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.340
You actually have the bios
of the panelists right

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.360
in your program, but I'm going
to introduce them very briefly.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.900
And then I'm going to ask
them to introduce themselves

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.270
via their ideas
and their work, OK?

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.690
So first of all,
immediately to my left

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.450
we have Laurel Smith-Doerr, who
is a professor of sociology.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.950
She's also the Director of
the Social Science Research

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.220
Institute at the University
of Massachusetts in Amherst,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.250
and she has done some
fabulous research

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.550
using lots and lots
of data looking

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.580
at academics in science,
and really looking

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.760
at gender gaps over time.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.210
I've been an admirer
of her academic work

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.660
for a very long time, so we
welcome your large-scale kind

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.570
of perspective on this problem.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.470
And then Deborah
Dunsire, who takes

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.430
a very different
perspective of course,

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:12.380
because she comes from practice
and has spent years working

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.460
in the field in this industry.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:19.490
She is the President and CEO
of Forum Pharmaceuticals.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.930
And prior to that,
she was the CEO

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.530
of Millennium Pharmaceuticals
for many years.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.880
So to say that she
has broken through

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.510
is quite the understatement.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.530
So appreciate having you
here, and looking forward so

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.030
much to hearing your thoughts
on this problem and just

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.460
your own experience as well.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.020
Alison Wood Brooks comes to
us from the Harvard Business

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.820
School.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.660
She's a faculty member there.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.770
And she takes a
different approach

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.450
to thinking about this.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.000
Her perspective is more of
a psychological perspective.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.180
She studies person
perception, social cognition.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.375
She's very interested in
kind of the early phases

00:19:57.375 --> 00:20:00.000
of entrepreneurship-- how do you
get your good ideas out there?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
How do you make pitches?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.880
And are there
gender differences?

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.370
And while she's not especially
focused on biopharma,

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.410
you're going to hear from
her and her research,

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.340
and we're going to think
about how her work actually

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.500
applies to this, the
complexities of this field.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.090
So she provides a
different angle, as well.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.079
Now, all of us are
taking a learning stance.

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:21.620
And we're here for
different reasons.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.450
I know we have scholars,
practitioners, people

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.440
curious in the room.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.050
From my perspective--
so I'm an academic,

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.770
but about 10 years
ago I published

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.760
a book called Career Imprints--
The Creation of Leaders

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.560
Across an Industry.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.670
And I was focused on biotech.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.420
And I looked at how the
health care company called

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.150
Baxter Travenol spawned
a disproportionate number

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.770
of entrepreneurs, I
argued, at the dawn

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:53.050
of the biotech industry-- so
back in the 1970s, early '80s.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.020
And the thing of it was that
the people I was studying

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.430
were all men.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.460
In fact, my colleagues
over at HBS,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.210
where I was before
the ed school,

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.900
nicknamed this project
the "Baxter Boys" project.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.000
They're all guys, all men.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.950
And you could say, well, Monica,
this was during the 1970s.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.890
Of course you didn't have very
many women in senior leadership

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.260
positions anyway.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.000
And in fact, Rosabeth
Moss Kanter's book,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.050
Men and Women of the
Corporation, came out in 1974.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.280
So OK, maybe there were
some structural barriers

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.280
at that time.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.990
But listening to Liz and
thinking about the numbers,

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.310
we know that there is
still under-representation.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.720
So the first panel today, we
are really here to try and get

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.027
a handle on this.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:36.860
What are some of the
underlying root causes?

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.550
But also just to
understand it better

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.920
before we move to
the second session.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.840
So the game is that I am
going to turn the floor over

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.340
to our three panelists,
and I'm going

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.070
to ask them for
their views on what

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.560
is the problem as they see it.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.147
And they will have
15 minutes each.

00:21:57.147 --> 00:21:59.480
Some of them have slides and
some don't, and that's fine

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.670
and they're welcome up here.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.270
And so they'll have 15
minutes with no interruptions

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.184
whatsoever in between--
so no questions at all.

00:22:07.184 --> 00:22:09.100
And so we'll just hear
from them back to back.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.440
Then I get a chance to ask
them questions first off.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.430
So I'm probably
going to ask just one

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.730
question of each of
them, because we really

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.070
want to hear from you.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.650
So the way that's
going to work is

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.280
there's a mic right in
the middle of the floor.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.790
And after I ask my
questions-- and that

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.990
will take about
10 or 15 minutes--

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.794
we're going to
turn it over to you

00:22:28.794 --> 00:22:30.960
and you're going to come
to the middle of the floor,

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.334
and you're going
to go to the mic

00:22:32.334 --> 00:22:34.940
and you're just going to state
your name and your affiliation

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.690
and your question.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.230
So for example,
Monica Higgins, I

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.870
am a professor at
the ed school, and I

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.130
have a question for Deborah.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.830
OK?

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.650
That we can get in
a lot of questions.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.740
And then I will signal
when it's the very end,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.590
the last question.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.220
We'll move to a close and then
we'll continue the conversation

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.600
over break, OK?

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.790
So again, welcome.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.210
Thank you all for being here.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.031
And Laurel, take it away.

00:23:00.031 --> 00:23:03.879
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.050
-Great.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.480
So thanks for the
kind introduction,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.430
and thanks to Liz and
Dan for the invitation,

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.160
to all the organizers.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.260
I'm really excited
about this event today.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.930
And so I've been invited to talk
about some of my past research

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.325
on gender equity in biotech.

00:23:25.325 --> 00:23:27.780
I'm a sociologist, so
I'm very interested

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.880
in the social contexts in
which people find themselves.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.320
My research has looked at
which social contexts are

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.260
conducive to gender equity,
and so I'll talk today

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.710
about a sociological
question of where

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.210
women find more opportunities
in the life sciences,

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.840
looking particularly at
the types of organizations

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.770
that are more conducive
to gender equity.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.740
And so it was great
that Liz kicked us

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.650
off with thinking
about what's going

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.770
on at the very top of
biotech organizations.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.140
I'm going to start by talking
more about what's going on

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.010
in the labs and how women have
more authority in certain kinds

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.820
of lab settings than others.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.400
And then I'll get to the
question of the leadership

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.820
and founders of firms.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.945
So here we go.

00:24:11.945 --> 00:24:14.700
Let's see if I can-- great.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.630
So I'm starting from
organizational theory,

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.040
particularly from Woody Powell's
contribution, in which he

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.500
contrasted forms of economic
organization, two of which

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.900
are network organizations
and hierarchies.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.470
So where hierarchy's main
mode of communication

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.300
is routines in the network
form, communication

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.390
happens through relationships.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.750
Conflict is resolved
in hierarchy

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.670
more by rank and authority--
so boss says who wins.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.200
In the network
organizations, it's

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.930
more by reputation
and reciprocity.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.510
And where hierarchy
has a more formal tone,

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.910
network organizations
are more open-ended

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.170
and tend toward
collective benefits

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.290
rather than following the rules
to move up the job ladder.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:59.150
And in the life sciences,
which is where I did my study,

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:04.520
biotech firms that
work on human therapies

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.790
are how we measure
network organization--

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.080
so the sort of small
entrepreneurial biotech firms--

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.070
in contrast to the
more hierarchical,

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.170
large, multinational
pharmaceutical corporations

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:19.600
and universities, which
are more hierarchical.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.230
And so the question is, what
does that kind of variation

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.780
mean for women in science?

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.700
And there are two
different kinds

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.390
of hypotheses in the
social science literature,

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.440
so it kind of goes both ways.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.050
On the one hand,
there is research

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.520
that says bureaucratic
rules are better

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.470
for combating discrimination--
so the threat of a lawsuit.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.290
And there's some
research, for example,

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.910
on minorities in
the Army that shows

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.100
that having a
bureaucratic structure

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.930
can actually be good
for racial integration

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.560
in large bureaucracies.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.260
On the other hand, social
scientists like Kanter,

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.620
who Monica just
mentioned, have long

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.040
noted informal organization
does not always

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.560
match the formal organization.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.340
So the larger the
bureaucracy, the larger

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.840
the shadow side that's cast.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.770
And that can make more room
for informal stereotypes

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.770
and sort of the
old boy networks.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.580
So here I was faced with this
literature that said, well,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.166
maybe on the one hand it's
better to have bureaucracy,

00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:20.790
and on the other hand
maybe it's better

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.450
to have these kind of
network organizations.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.080
So of course, being
a good sociologist,

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.015
I turned to the data.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.570
So I'm going to talk a
little bit about some data

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.530
that I collected long ago,
which began my dissertation.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.350
So I feel like maybe I'm
turning into the historian.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.956
Liz gave us the current stuff
and I'm going back in time,

00:26:42.956 --> 00:26:44.330
given that some
of these findings

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.750
are now from what
people consider

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.240
the early days of biotech.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.540
But the organizers told me
that this context of the past

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.840
still has some relevance
for our basic understanding

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.390
of social processes and
the theory would still

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.310
be interesting and relevant
for our conversation today.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.800
So the first set of
findings I'll tell you about

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.220
are for life scientists working
in the 1990s through 2000.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.020
And this is a national
sample of scientists,

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.180
and I did a smaller
set of interviews

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.080
during that time with scientists
working in the Western United

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.160
States.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.550
And then the second set
of data comes from work

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.120
that I did with Kristin
Whittington, where she matched

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.180
patent data to my sample to
see if we could find a gender

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.690
gap in patenting across
the different kinds

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.530
of organizational settings.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.500
And then finally, I'll tell you
about a study of Massachusetts

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.917
biotechnology firm
founders and leadership

00:27:34.917 --> 00:27:36.750
that was sponsored by
the Immigrant Learning

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.130
Center in 2007.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.171
They wanted to know about
foreign-born founders,

00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:41.920
but they let me add a
question about women

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.320
founders in the survey.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.240
So what do I find?

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.150
So for the first question, about
what's going on in the labs

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.850
and who's really
leading the science,

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:58.200
in these models controlling for
the years since PhD was granted

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.920
and the prestige of
the PhD program--

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.170
which is a whole other story
that I can answer questions

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.000
about-- we can see
the usual gender gap

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.960
in hierarchical settings of
academia and the large drug

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.600
companies.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.920
Women scientists'
odds of leading a lab

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.650
are lower than their
male colleagues.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.300
But women are more
likely to have leadership

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.760
roles in biotech firms.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.360
And so I found that the
magnitude of that effect

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.720
was quite large, that women in
biotech were almost eight times

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.550
more likely to lead
than women PhDs

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.860
in more hierarchical
settings like academia

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.116
or multinational
pharmaceutical companies.

00:28:33.116 --> 00:28:34.740
And there was no
significant difference

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.150
for men in the probability
of being the head of the lab

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:44.150
and determining where
the science was going.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:48.280
All right, and then in terms
of patenting in these analyses

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.310
that I did with
Whittington, we found

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.080
that patent
productivity in biotech

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.770
also exhibited greater
gender equity compared

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.390
to more hierarchical settings.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.370
So on these slides-- I don't
know if you can read it

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:04.755
in the back, but the light
grey bar is men's propensity

00:29:04.755 --> 00:29:08.980
to patents and the black bar is
women's propensity to patent.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.360
And you can see that there
are large significant gaps

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.220
for the large
industrial settings.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.300
That's the first set
of bars, is for pharma.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:22.600
The second set is government
and nonprofit and research

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.730
hospitals.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.534
The third set is academia.

00:29:25.534 --> 00:29:27.450
And then the only place
where there's actually

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.430
no significant difference-- even
though it looks like women are

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.030
out-patenting their
male colleagues,

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.270
it's actually not a significant
difference-- there's gender

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.500
parity in the biotech firms.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.690
So we can see that
this is a place where

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.620
we do find some
gender equity when

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.375
we're talking about scientists
who are in the labs.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.254
So I wanted to understand
why this was, right?

00:29:51.254 --> 00:29:52.670
Here are these two
different kinds

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:56.160
of organizations, network
organizations and hierarchies.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.000
And what is it that makes for
greater equity in these kinds

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.920
of biotech firms?

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.190
So I turned to my
interview data and I

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:07.590
identified three
different reasons

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:14.180
why my respondents talked about
the equity in biotech firms.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.840
The first was flexibility.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.130
And so this first quote is
from a female respondent

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.480
who had been an academic
and unexpectedly

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.900
did not receive tenure,
but was very successful

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.380
in biotech management.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.550
And for confidentiality
reasons I cannot identify her,

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.900
but you would know her name.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.320
So she is describing how
women are not just forced out

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.080
but sometimes voluntarily leave
academe for biotech, at least

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.730
in this period during the 1990s.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:47.870
And a lot of the reasons
why, at least she said,

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.600
her women colleagues
left academia

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.810
was because they had
more of a choice, more

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.710
flexibility in who
they could work

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.560
with in the biotech industry.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.350
So here's the quote.
"A friend of mine

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.830
left a tenured position at--
I can't say the university--

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.590
elite university to
go to a biotech firm.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.560
She called the university
department under--

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.670
and she named this guy, which
I don't give his name here--

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.852
under so-and-so an autocracy.

00:31:13.852 --> 00:31:16.435
She just wanted to do science,
didn't care about the prestige,

00:31:16.435 --> 00:31:18.617
and could do science
at the biotech firm

00:31:18.617 --> 00:31:20.700
working with who she wanted
to rather than dealing

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.550
with this guy.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.550
The second theme that I
heard in many interviews--

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.860
so this is just one
example of many interviews

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.840
that talked about
the same trend--

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.080
was the transparency in biotech.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.830
So this is a quote
from a senior scientist

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.280
at a very profitable
biotech firm talking

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.000
about her experience
there as opposed

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.570
to her academic experience.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.550
She said, "I could tell
you from my experience

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.657
in academia many a true story
about political infighting."

00:31:49.657 --> 00:31:51.240
And she went on to
give some examples,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.370
which I don't give here.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.170
"At this biotech firm we
are not compartmentalized

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.480
and get to work with many
good scientists both here

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.240
and outside the
firm, and we choose

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.520
who to work with based on
non-financial considerations

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.880
like how good they
are in their field."

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.410
So these kind of transparent,
permeable boundaries of biotech

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.194
seem to shine light
on perhaps some

00:32:14.194 --> 00:32:15.360
of the political infighting.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.980
And the reputation that people
have for collaboration matters,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.970
and because of that visibility
that, at least these response

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.600
argued, aids in gender equity.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.480
The third kind of theme that
came from the interviews

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.870
was about collective rewards.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:36.310
So this is a quote
that discusses

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.310
how collaboration
in biotech also

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.600
means that scientists
are rewarded

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.480
for their collective
contributions,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.900
that there are some mutual
benefits, which may also

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.530
mean some flexibility
for life events.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:55.590
This particular scientist had
just filed an important patent

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.030
and sent off the paper to the
New England Journal of Medicine

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.730
the day before she
delivered her baby.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.146
And her project team really
kept her in the loop.

00:33:05.146 --> 00:33:06.770
They gained a lot of
resources from it,

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:10.100
but she was part of
that collective reward

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.400
that they got for this major
breakthrough that they made.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.920
And doing that
allowed her to have

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.000
some social capital
with her collaborators,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.790
and they sort of took up the
slack will she was taking time

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.337
off to be with her baby.

00:33:22.337 --> 00:33:24.170
So she said, "While I
was on maternity leave

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.750
here at this firm I
could keep in touch

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.620
with my colleagues who kept
the project moving forward.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.240
And she contrasted
that to academia.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.150
"When I was a postdoc,
people collaborated somewhat

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.140
on the fringes of
their work but still

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.810
have their main turf, which
they guarded carefully."

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.151
So she's contrasting
academic life science,

00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:43.900
where collaboration,
sure, it's important,

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.770
but the collective
goals and the rewards

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:50.020
are not central to actually
the life of the organization

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.630
in the same way that she
identified in biotech firms.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:58.370
All right, so on to the
question about the founders.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.965
What about the people
who start up firms?

00:34:00.965 --> 00:34:02.840
And this was a study,
again, in Massachusetts

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.716
with about 300 different firms.

00:34:06.716 --> 00:34:08.670
This was research
that I conducted

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.825
with Jim McQuaid and Dan
Monte here in Massachusetts.

00:34:12.825 --> 00:34:14.449
And what we found--
just in case you're

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.030
curious about the
foreign-born founders; that's

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:21.300
another really important kind of
diversity in entrepreneurship.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.860
So here you can see that
that first turquoise

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.150
bar is, at the time, the
percent of life scientists

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.239
who were foreign-born working
in the US was about 21%.

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.690
And 42% of the firms
we surveyed had

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.400
at least one immigrant founder.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.960
So here's another data point for
the importance of immigration,

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.530
just as a little side note.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:46.120
And then there's less
gender equity, though,

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.830
at the founder level.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.060
In our survey, at least, of
New England biotech firms,

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.870
about 21% had at least
one woman founder.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.730
So maybe we're doing
better in New England

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.820
than in some other studies.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.950
And so that dark green
bar on the far right

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:08.160
shows that shows that, and
it's in contrast to the taller

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.370
dark green bar that shows
that 42% of the national life

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.700
science labor force are women.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.220
So women are
underrepresented certainly

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.670
in founding biotech
firms, even here.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.850
Although, it's also relative.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.520
There's definitely
room for improvement

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.720
in thinking about who are the
founders of biotech firms.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.000
But at least in terms of
patenting and leadership

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.450
in the labs, women
life scientists

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:37.470
seem to be finding some ways
that biotech firms allow

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:41.760
for more equity than in
more hierarchical settings.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.760
All right, so I always get
asked, what's going on now?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.400
And so I had the
privilege of being

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.130
able to be an outside reader
on a recent dissertation that

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:56.860
was just filed by Janine
Pickering at Swinburne

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.850
University in Australia.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:04.150
And in her research
on Australian biotech

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.190
she found much the same thing
that I did in the United States

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.920
long ago.

00:36:14.699 --> 00:36:16.490
And she actually had
salary data and showed

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:19.750
that there were significant
gender gaps in pay in academia

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.830
that were not there
in biotech firms.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:28.580
She also found authority gaps
like I did in academia, but not

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.640
in biotech firms.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:35.160
Now, the one thing that her
study raised for me, though,

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.950
and I think would be
interesting to talk about

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.430
maybe during the
later discussion,

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:45.800
is that in both
academia and industry,

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.060
she found that jobs were much
more precarious now than they

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.270
were at the time I was studying.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:56.730
So we have fewer
tenure-track jobs.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.301
It's much harder to get them.

00:36:58.301 --> 00:37:00.550
I don't have to tell you the
statistics about how long

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:02.940
it takes for life scientists
to get their first NIH

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.995
award if they're academics.

00:37:04.995 --> 00:37:07.120
And so I think that's
something to think about too,

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.130
is the larger political economy
in which biotech is operating.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:16.610
So just a few thoughts
to end with-- one

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.220
practical implication
of this research

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.030
is that environment matters.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.240
Organizations that
foster transparency,

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.580
collaborative flexibility,
and collective rewards

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.740
rather than a rigid chain
of command foster equity

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.280
and innovation.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.020
But also, the general
economic climate matters.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.360
If flexibility happens
to mean that none of us

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.625
have job security, then
that is not necessarily

00:37:42.625 --> 00:37:44.250
a good tradeoff.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.740
Another implication is that
the rules and practices

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.080
of organizations should
not be taken for granted

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.670
or thought to be genderless.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.590
Awareness matters,
so unconscious bias

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.890
flourishes when it's hidden.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.940
And so we need to
be aware of what

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.150
the structures are leading to.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.900
And finally, I just
want to make the point

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.260
that diversity matters.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.070
Not all women are
the same, and so we

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.950
need further support for
foreign-born women scientists.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:15.580
So in that study of immigrant
founders, almost all of them

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.451
were men.

00:38:16.451 --> 00:38:17.950
And so I think we
need to think more

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:21.180
about the intersection
of nationality and race

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.075
and gender.

00:38:22.075 --> 00:38:24.355
So thank you so much
for your attention.

00:38:24.355 --> 00:38:28.315
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:32.407 --> 00:38:33.490
-Good afternoon, everyone.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:37.360
It's great to see you here,
and it's a real privilege

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.050
and pleasure to be here.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.960
So I'm going to
be talking to you

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.720
from maybe the operational
side of the business.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.970
It's so inspiring
and somewhat daunting

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.920
to be surrounded by
people who have devoted

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.800
their lives to really studying
in-depth and understanding

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:02.150
the detail of the experience
that I simply live day to day.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.040
So I don't offer you
a lot of real data,

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.590
but I offer you a lot
of years of experience

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:14.700
of living in the biotech
and pharma world.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:22.140
And so I think we all know that
there is a paucity of women.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.350
We have many qualified
women, but we don't have them

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.800
in the leadership positions.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.230
And it's across the
organizations really,

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.200
but goes right from
the board of directors

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.870
through the C-suite to
the senior management.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.860
But indeed, not really
at the entry level.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:42.030
And I'll talk a little bit
about that in different settings

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.960
that I've worked in.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.950
I'm one of those people
in pharma and biotech

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.510
whose career has sort
of gone backwards,

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:53.560
from working at a very large
company, Sandoz Novartis for 17

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.020
years, to a more middle-sized
company, Millennium,

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.340
where I was the CEO.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.630
And now I'm at a much
smaller company, FORUM.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.750
So I've gone smaller
and smaller and smaller.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:09.690
And I do see the differences
for women in those larger

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:10.875
hierarchical organizations.

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.540
I was saying, wow, there it is.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.790
It's there.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.720
It's being studying.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.580
And I've lived it.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:23.550
And when I think about large
organizations like Novartis,

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.480
first of all there's
a lot of people.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.330
And in those organizations,
the entry-level

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:35.020
is actually probably
more women than men.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.830
Interestingly, we have to
then start to separate out.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:42.090
That includes both the
scientific disciplines

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.930
and the commercial
and what we call

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:48.500
G&amp;A disciplines, the general and
administration-- finance, HR,

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.010
communications.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.490
And when I think about
my own experience,

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.150
where the women are,
we're coming more

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:58.610
into those commercial
and G&amp;A disciplines.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.620
And I think, as
you pointed it out,

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:06.210
HR, communications, some of
those entry-level on finance

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:07.920
side-- lots of women.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.430
On the sales side, in the
commercial sales functions

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.920
for big pharma-- and
for biotech, by the way,

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.650
commercial biotech--
probably more women than men.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.080
And that extends
around the world.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.030
I was on the board of Takeda
Pharmaceuticals in Japan.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.040
And if we think we have a
gender diversity problem,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.860
Japan is truly staggering
for where their women are

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.620
versus where our women are.

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:42.820
But even there, the entry-level
for the company at the sales

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.380
force side is 52% women.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.280
And so when we look at
the scientific side,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.040
we do see that even
at the entry level

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.660
we've got less women
coming into those jobs.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:03.410
So the sciences are probably,
in big pharma, imbalanced

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:08.710
to the tune of maybe instead of
being 50% it's more like 30%.

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.670
And I think that's probably
true in biotech too

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.920
when I look at the
entry-level scientists

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.480
and I think about who I've
seen in my experience.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.710
So one of the things
we need to understand

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:24.120
is why, even at the entry
level, is that true, where

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.610
we know how many women are
qualifying and achieving

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:32.140
at the level that could bring
them into those jobs having

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.770
finished-- usually we're
hiring people who've

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:38.370
completed post-docs-- into
those scientific disciplines

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:41.400
in the lab and the clinic.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.740
And particularly in
the lab sciences,

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.100
we're seeing less women
at the entry level.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.920
In the clinical disciplines,
actually, it's not true.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:54.350
So in regulatory affairs,
in clinical development,

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.600
pharmacovigilance, we're
actually seeing more women.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.050
You'd probably see
at the entry level,

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.610
clinical operations, 60% women.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:10.520
So there's definitely more of
an issue in my own experience

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:18.254
in those hard science, lab
science, PhD science areas

00:43:18.254 --> 00:43:19.920
than there are in the
clinical sciences,

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.240
where we're recruiting
people who've

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:28.220
been nurses, people with
bachelor's degrees in biology

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.140
into those more
clinical disciplines.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:36.450
And as we go into biotech, we
do see more women in the labs

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:41.520
and we see more women
rising up in lab management,

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:47.500
but still not at the rate that's
equivalent to their proportion,

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.850
even at the entry level.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:50.900
So there's still a
problem, even in biotech.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:56.170
But certainly, I can verify
from the operational side

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:58.040
that the research is
absolutely factual.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.080
There's more of a chance for a
woman to lead a lab in biotech

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.600
than there is in big pharma.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.760
And that just
exaggerates as we go up.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.730
So then I asked myself,
where are the women?

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:11.790
What's happening to them?

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:16.000
What's taking them
out of the experience?

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.420
And I think if I, maybe for
that start at the C-suite,

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.850
what takes women
out of the C-suite?

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.900
Why don't they get there?

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.270
And one of the issues
is where do they

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.700
come into organizations, right?

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.970
So for an organization,
to run the organization

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:39.590
you've got to have experience
in the mainline functions

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.510
of the organization.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:45.140
And those in a
pharma, in a biotech,

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:51.050
include to some extent
the research, a lot more

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:54.480
the clinical, and
then the financial.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.200
I'd say those are some
of the most critical.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.110
And then, of course,
the commercial.

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:01.700
So some of the
places where women

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.110
tend to go in these
organizations--

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:09.270
into communications, HR,
to the general council

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.370
or the legal aspect--
are not the paths

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:16.180
that most typically lead you
to have the experiences that

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.220
lead to the CEO-level.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.680
It will lead to the
C-suite as the General

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.770
Counsel of the Chief
Human Resources Officer,

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:29.610
but it won't take
you to the CEO role.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.120
So what I often find
myself advising women is,

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.610
you have to be
doing the work that

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.280
is most critical in the
pillars of the corporation.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.180
So figure out where that is.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.830
I think another that
I've observed career-wise

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:52.990
over years of advising women
versus men, because I obviously

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:57.900
have advised lot of men also,
is that women have a tendency

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.030
to perfectionism.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.920
And so they want
mastery before they

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.570
believe they're ready to
take on something different.

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:10.930
And men don't have the
same need for 100% mastery.

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:15.150
They feel that once they're
at sort of the 80% level

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:22.000
it's time to add more, move
on, get a different experience.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.100
So that for me has been
an interesting observation

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.330
of the different genders.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.836
And they're broad
generalizations.

00:46:29.836 --> 00:46:33.510
I can only give you
what I've observed,

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:35.580
but they do hold true.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.357
And what that leads to for
women is a couple of things.

00:46:38.357 --> 00:46:39.940
One is that they
keep their heads down

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.950
and they get the
work done, and they

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:46.124
believe that good work
will be noticed and tapped

00:46:46.124 --> 00:46:46.790
on the shoulder.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:50.310
And believe me, good work
is absolutely noticed,

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.110
and people are very
grateful for it.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:57.920
But it doesn't
necessarily get advanced.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.240
What has to happen is people
have to ask for and make known

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.480
their desires for advancement.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.700
And women are much less
comfortable with that,

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.140
in general, than men.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.080
They feel, if my boss
thinks I'm good enough,

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.280
he'll-- because they're often
"he's"-- will advance me.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:23.160
And I often say to
them, maybe we need just

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.670
to send you out
into the sales force

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:29.285
for awhile to learn that
things don't just happen,

00:47:29.285 --> 00:47:32.102
and that the quieter you are,
the more people will believe

00:47:32.102 --> 00:47:33.560
you're satisfied
with where you are

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.000
and simply leave you there
doing beautiful work that they

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.120
love to rely on.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.930
So men will tend to ask more.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.900
The other thing
that I observe is

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.860
that women are carrying
often two jobs, right?

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.370
They're handling a
lot on the home front

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.420
and they're handling a
lot on the work front,

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.940
so they tend to come
in, get their work done,

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:01.270
and be going to
relieve the babysitter,

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:07.170
make sure the meal is taken
care of, that their home life is

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:08.620
in order.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:12.450
And so they don't take as
many opportunities networking.

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:15.800
And I think some of these
are on my next slide,

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.430
in the what-do-we-do category.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:22.190
And so I'll often
advise women, you

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:27.190
do need to be able to devote
time to enabling people

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:33.377
to know you in a setting that
isn't just your single job.

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.960
So the concept of
networking-- and I'm

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.020
not talking about playing golf.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.430
I'm really talking about
going to industry conferences,

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:49.540
going to industry events, going
to your specialty conference--

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.220
whatever it is you're
in, where you'll

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.830
meet people who are further
ahead in their journey

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.910
in that particular career.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:01.650
Being in this type
of environment,

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.480
there are so many
places where one

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.310
can interact with other
people, particularly

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.080
in the biotech and
pharma space, who

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.630
are at a different
stage of their career.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.480
But you have to be able
to devote some of the time

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.300
to that.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.790
And I find that
women versus men tend

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.930
to balance their time
differently and balance

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:24.490
their priorities differently,
because we all only have

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.610
24 hours in every day.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:34.430
So I think that's one of
the observations I've had.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.780
I say to people a
lot along the way,

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:41.970
build your base of
experience, and getting

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:44.820
into roles that are
pivotal to the corporation,

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:48.820
externally-facing so
that they do take you out

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.540
of the office that
represent the corporation.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:58.650
And then really, getting
budget-oriented roles--

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:02.760
so owning a budget.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.350
And that's from
various sub-departments

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:11.410
within the big scientific
areas, the clinical ops area--

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.410
not only in the
finance area, right?

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.800
Those are not the only
people who manage budgets.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.710
So managing budgets
and managing people,

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.740
even if they're small groups--
very important experiences.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.280
And then, seek out
those role models

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.690
and take advice from them.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.930
I had a thought as you
were talking, Monica,

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:31.430
about the Baxter Boys.

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.620
And I don't know
very much about them,

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.500
but what flashes into
my mind is once they've

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.570
seen one of their
colleagues do it,

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.870
it's much easier to
imagine yourself doing it.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:44.260
And I think that's what we've
had as a difficulty for women,

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.300
is they haven't
seen how it's done.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.790
When I came to
Millennium 10 years ago,

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.970
I think I was probably
the only female CEO

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:56.080
at that time in
the biotech space--

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.290
probably not ever, but
just at that moment.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:02.900
Now I can count up,
there's probably 11 or 12

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.460
that I personally know.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:10.870
And that creates the
beginnings of the role-modeling

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:14.790
for other women to say,
hey, Nancy Simonian.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:17.090
She's the CEO at Syros.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:20.220
I know that she's a doc.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.380
I know that I know her.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.310
I've come across her.

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:24.620
I can go and talk to her.

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:28.320
And seeking that is
really, really, important.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.710
Becoming an external
thought-leader--

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:33.350
if you're in an
organization become

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:37.790
part of your trade association,
your scientific group,

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.180
and be a thought-leader.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:45.090
Become a program advisor or
take on a role that puts you out

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:48.920
in front where your voice is
heard, because people search

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:53.770
on that when they're recruiting
for boards, for lab heads,

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:56.200
for all of those kind of things.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.880
And then, network
across the sectors,

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.220
academia to the venture
capital to industry

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.330
to the clinical sector.

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:07.700
We've got a unique
ecosystem, but you can't just

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.640
stay in your own little world.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.090
Networking across
those-- and there really

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.770
are great opportunities
for it here--

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.780
I think is important
to broaden the mind

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:24.160
and to help women see what
opportunities are out there.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.570
And I think the other thing
that women don't tend to do

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.890
is specifically ask for
advice at a particular time.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:35.120
Now, I don't think about mentors
as people who are constantly

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.360
with you along your career.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.300
That can be so, but often
it's just at a point in time

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:45.790
I'd like to advance my career
from a physician on a project

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:48.200
to a chief medical officer.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.730
Speak to a chief
medical officer.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.630
Ask about their
career progression.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.230
See what you can learn.

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:58.340
So it can be a very time-bound
thing to get mentoring.

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:04.100
And then specifically seeking
board experiences-- again,

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.310
sometimes women
wait to be tapped.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:12.070
But I'd urge people to go out
and ask for what you want.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.400
Speak to people you know who
are running a company and say,

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.760
gee, I'm really interested
in being on a board.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.320
Help me understand what would
I have to do to do that.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.540
What are my gaps?

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.610
Why isn't it possible for me?

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.850
And I find with a
lot of senior women

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:33.090
I have to say to them, gosh,
you're a chief human resources

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:37.130
officer but that isn't what
board governance looks for.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:39.280
It looks for line experience.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.320
Getting that advice
earlier in her career

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.080
might have been pretty
helpful to that lady.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:44.630
Ask.

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:46.730
Ask the question.

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:49.280
And then for women who
are in the sciences

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.870
and who come up with
innovation or patents

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:56.650
or the potential for
patents-- go and seek advice.

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.380
Go to a boot camp.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.320
Get some training
in entrepreneurship.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:03.292
It's out there,
particularly here in Boston.

00:54:03.292 --> 00:54:05.750
And then if you have to, learn
by interning-- not giving up

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:09.110
your full-time job,
but offering to help

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:12.550
at a company or a
venture capital firm.

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:14.160
Hey, can I come alongside?

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.350
And it is nights and
weekends, and that's sometimes

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:17.230
a problem for women.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.250
But come alongside
and offer to help.

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:21.670
You'll learn while you do it.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:25.740
So those are some of the
things that I've experienced

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.660
over the years that can help.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:33.630
But I think women need
to express their wants

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:37.510
and be prepared to take that
flier that men are often

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.310
prepared to take where
women will shy back from it

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.130
and wait to be asked.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:44.360
Ladies, we can't
wait to be asked.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.879
Thank you.

00:54:45.879 --> 00:54:49.871
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:54.362 --> 00:54:55.859
-Hi.

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:56.857
-Good afternoon.

00:54:56.857 --> 00:54:57.360
-Yes.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.010
Oh, that's really good.

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.780
It is such an honor
and humbling privilege

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.520
to be here, following
two academic legends

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.590
and an industry legend.

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:09.600
And then there's me.

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.430
My name is Alison Wood Brooks.

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.210
I am a faculty member
at the Harvard Business

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.610
School across the river.

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:20.344
I'm so honored to be here at the
gorgeous Radcliffe Institute.

00:55:20.344 --> 00:55:21.510
I've never been here before.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:22.640
It's just beautiful.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.320
And I've never received such
organized and enthusiastic

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:25.820
emails.

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.940
So thank you all
for coming today.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.730
It's a privilege.

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:35.140
Our job on this panel is
to talk about the problem,

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:38.690
so the title of my talk
today is "Why are women

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:40.070
underrepresented as leaders?"

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.660
And I'm going to
provide you with two

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:45.500
ideas from my own research.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.630
First, are women really
under-represented

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:48.770
in high-level positions?

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:51.620
We heard some amazing
data from Liz on this,

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.830
so I'm going to just repeat
it to make sure that we're all

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:56.230
on the same page.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:57.830
The answer is yes.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.940
Less than 20% of full professors
in the natural sciences

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.250
are women.

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:06.220
Less than 5% of Fortune
500 CEOs are women.

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.980
Less than 15% of executive
officers are women.

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.537
And less than 11% of US
firms would VC backings--

00:56:13.537 --> 00:56:15.370
so that's funding for
their companies-- have

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:18.300
been founded or led by women.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.530
So the answer is yes,
women are underrepresented.

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:23.350
Liz also said an
interesting stat,

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:26.570
that companies that
are lead with three

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:30.756
or more women on their executive
boards tend to perform better.

00:56:30.756 --> 00:56:33.130
I have a colleague who's doing
research right now looking

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:37.120
at the board compositions
at Fortune 500 companies

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.510
and the gender and
racial compositions.

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:41.260
What she's found is
that there's something

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:45.690
magical about the number
two-- two women on a board.

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:48.210
It's bad to have zero,
because then you're

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:49.920
obviously failing at diversity.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.780
It's bad to have
one, because then you

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.100
have the one token woman.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.680
So right now in our
culture the thing

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.280
is to have two women
on your board--

00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.740
so just something
to think about.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:07.440
OK, so today I'm going
to talk about two ideas

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.330
about why we're facing
this gender gap at the top.

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:14.480
And I want to provide
you with a framework

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.890
to think about the problem.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:19.410
It's comprised of two factors.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:21.480
The first category
of factors I'm

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.810
going to call
demand-side factors.

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:26.070
This is how people
perceive and react

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.340
to women in the workplace.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.670
A psychologist might call
this interpersonal factors,

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.250
how we perceive women
and react to them.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.620
The other category I'm going
to call supply-side factors.

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.240
This is what a psychologist
might call intrapsychic.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.350
It's what's going on in
women's minds themselves.

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:47.110
It's how women think and
behave in the workplace.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:51.030
So I'm going to talk about two
projects, one in each category.

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:52.710
The first falls
into this category

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:56.590
of demand-side factors, how
people perceive and react

00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:59.640
to women in the workplace.

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.630
So the first paper
asks, is there

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:05.420
gender-based discrimination
in entrepreneurship?

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:08.850
So this is a specific context.

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:11.720
To address this question
in our research,

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.490
we analyzed the
entrepreneurial pitches

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:17.360
given at the three largest
entrepreneurial pitch

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:22.460
competitions across the
United States for three years.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:26.240
Compared to the female
entrepreneurs in our sample,

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:31.868
male entrepreneurs were 60%
more likely to achieve success.

00:58:31.868 --> 00:58:33.800
Success meant winning
the competition,

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.100
getting funding
for their company.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:40.310
OK, so it wasn't just
that they were men.

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:43.580
They were also handsome.

00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.080
OK?

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.320
So physically attractive
men were significantly more

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.240
likely to get funding than
were the ugly ducklings.

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.162
And that's compared
to all women, right?

00:58:54.162 --> 00:58:56.120
So physical attractiveness
didn't matter at all

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.010
for the women.

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.710
It's like you see a
girl pitching a company

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:02.030
and you dismiss her out of
hand because she's a woman,

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.900
but then I'm really going
to focus on these men.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.490
When I see the Tom Brady
pitching the company,

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:08.260
that's the winner.

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.108
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.950
OK, so this is what we
call correlational data.

00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:18.610
It's not causation,
because it's just

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.030
observational in the world.

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:24.850
So as scientists, we want
to establish causation.

00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:31.170
Is being a man actually
causing you to get funding?

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:34.180
So we wanted to do this
experimentally in the lab

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:37.660
as well, because it's possible
that maybe handsome men really

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:40.250
are better at pitching
their companies.

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.950
So let's find out.

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:43.590
We asked six other
people to watch

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:47.120
a series of entrepreneurial
pitch videos

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.110
in a controlled
web-based experiment.

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:50.610
And here's how we set it up.

00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:54.570
They heard either a female
voice or a male voice

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.940
narrating each pitch video.

00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.890
And we only manipulated
the narrator's gender

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.180
by hearing the voice
of a man or a woman,

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:06.320
or their physical attractiveness
because we presented photos

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.910
of them, and they were pre-rated
as high or low attractiveness.

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:14.180
And the content of the
pitches was identical.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.930
They saw the same video, the
same images, the same graphs.

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:20.070
The script was identical.

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:23.560
We even trained the vocal actors
to do the same inflections

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.320
as they read the pitch script.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.160
And then the participants
chose which company

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.700
they wanted to fund with
their own real money.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.880
So they had their
own skin in the game.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.420
Here's what we found--
same pattern of results

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:42.590
as in the entrepreneurial
pitch competition.

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:45.700
When you heard a man
narrating the pitch video

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.660
and saw an attractive
photo of him,

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.660
people were much
more likely to invest

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:55.980
in that company than when they
saw the ugly duckling male

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.970
or what they saw either
an attractive female

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:01.080
or an unattractive female.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.950
So now we've got causal
evidence of this effect.

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:06.240
So here's the summary.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.500
Male entrepreneurs,
especially attractive ones,

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.790
are more likely to
receive investor funding

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:15.210
than are female entrepreneurs.

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:17.240
This is based on
their gender and

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.720
their physical
attractiveness, and not

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.460
on the content of their ideas.

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:29.290
OK, so this is an example
of a demand-side factor.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.710
Here we're seeing very
stark gender discrimination

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:34.840
in entrepreneurship.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.140
When people ask us why
we find these findings,

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:41.620
we've posited that there's
a sort of lack of fit.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.540
When we imagine a
successful entrepreneur,

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.240
we imagine a handsome,
assertive man,

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.054
and we do not imagine a woman.

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:51.470
This goes back to
Deborah's point.

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:53.094
There just aren't a
lot of role models.

01:01:53.094 --> 01:01:55.380
We're not imagining a
woman as an entrepreneur,

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.800
and then when we see a
woman pitch a company

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.160
there's this lack of fit.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.660
You don't seem like
an entrepreneur,

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.710
so I'm not going
to invest in you.

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:06.606
So for the second idea that I'm
going to share with you today

01:02:06.606 --> 01:02:08.480
we're going to shift to
the other categories,

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.650
supply-side factors.

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:13.890
This is what I called
intrapsychic, in your own mind.

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:15.836
So what's going on
in women's minds?

01:02:15.836 --> 01:02:17.210
How does it affect
how they think

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:20.860
and behave in the workplace?

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.140
So the second paper
asks, do men and women

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.200
view professional
advancement differently?

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.850
This paper is coming
out in like two days,

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:32.070
so keep your eyes
peeled in the media.

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.840
OK, so I want to do a
little thought experiment

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.020
with all of you.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.010
If I asked you,
what are your core

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.680
goals in life--
and by core goals

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.290
I mean things that
occupy your thoughts,

01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:44.810
things that you
deeply care about,

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:48.619
or things that motivate
your behavior and decisions.

01:02:48.619 --> 01:02:51.160
So right now just kind of close
your eyes and think about it.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.640
What are your core
goals in life?

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.150
If I were to answer this
question I would say something

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:03.420
like, I want to be
a supportive spouse,

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:07.020
I want to take great care
of my six-month-old baby,

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.190
I want to successfully
breastfeed,

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:13.300
I want to publish papers,
I want to run every day,

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.680
I want to stay fit, I want to
be in fashion and be stylish,

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.220
I want to be a good friend,
a good daughter, et cetera.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.000
The list goes on and on.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.070
So we asked a huge sample
of people this question,

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:31.350
and women listed more
goals than men overall.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.590
A smaller proportion
of women's goals

01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:39.110
were related to
achieving power at work.

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:41.290
And these findings
held whether people

01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:44.280
made a list of their
goals, whether we

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.700
asked them to select goals
from a list that we created,

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.330
a predetermined list, or
whether we asked people

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:52.820
to reject goals that were
not important to them

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.130
from our predetermined list.

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.890
So this finding is very robust.

01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:59.302
Women are listing
many more things,

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:01.510
and therefore it makes sense
that they have less time

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.380
and attention to devote
to any one of those goals,

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.760
including their
work-related goals.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.560
This finding is
probably making you

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.270
feel a little bit
angry at me, but I want

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:14.120
you to hold onto that anger.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.500
I'm excited to
have a discussion.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.270
OK, so here's the second
part of this paper.

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:20.770
I want you to imagine
you're offered

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:23.490
a promotion for a
higher-powered position at work.

01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:25.860
And for the undergrads
in the audience,

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.437
imagine that you're offered
a great, high-power position

01:04:28.437 --> 01:04:29.145
after graduation.

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.430
Now, if I asked you
to rate how much

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.600
you expect each
of these outcomes

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.460
to come along with that
promotion, what would you say?

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.964
We provided these outcomes
to our participants

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.380
when they thought
about promotion.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.250
Some of them were negative--
like stress or anxiety,

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:52.940
difficult tradeoffs, burden or
responsibility, and conflict

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.860
with other life goals--
and some of them

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:57.800
were positive, like job
satisfaction, money, status,

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.220
power.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.810
Here's what we found.

01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:03.070
Men and women reported
equivalent levels

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:05.190
of positive reactions.

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.750
So men and women are
imagining the same good things

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.620
to come out of
high-power positions,

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.470
but women are thinking
of more negative things.

01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:17.080
Men and women rated the
promotion as equally

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.990
attainable-- amazing-- but women
rated the promotion as less

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:23.040
desirable.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.210
This follows logically.

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:25.700
If you're imagining
more negative

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.920
outcomes to be associated
with the promotion, the.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.460
Promotion is therefore
less desirable to you.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.890
Compared to men, women are
less likely to actually accept

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:41.214
the promotion

01:05:41.214 --> 01:05:42.630
Before I go on, I
just want to say

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:46.490
this was across nine studies
with over 4,000 participants--

01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:48.800
women of all different levels.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.760
We had executives
who were currently

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.380
in high-powered positions,
average working adults,

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.600
and college students,
undergraduate women.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.080
So it seems like a
very pervasive effect.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.030
So there's a big,
fat, juicy disclaimer

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:06.490
that I want to say along
with these findings.

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:10.680
These findings are
descriptive, not prescriptive.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.960
That means that we don't know
if these participants are

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.540
right or wrong.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.680
They just are.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.090
These are their
preferences, right now.

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:22.100
It's possible that men
and women are correctly

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.960
predicting the unique
experiences they're

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.760
poised to encounter when they
reach positions of power,

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.770
or women are overestimating
the negative consequences

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:33.530
associated with
power, or men are

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:35.830
underestimating the negative
consequences associated

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:37.020
with power.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.610
We don't know the
answer to that.

01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:41.610
It's extremely important.

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.807
And I hope that
people in the audience

01:06:43.807 --> 01:06:45.765
will do the research to
answer those questions.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.880
OK, so why are women
underrepresented as leaders?

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.630
I've provided you with two
ideas here, two examples,

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:54.710
I should say.

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.700
One was a demand-side factor.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.420
Entrepreneurs face
gender discrimination.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:03.630
People are less likely to invest
in pitches given by women.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.970
I also gave you a
supply-side factor example.

01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:09.090
Women want different
things in life.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.020
It turns out they want
more things, which

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.510
means they have less time
and attention to devote

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:16.120
to their work-related goals.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.140
And it's important to note that
demand-side factors influence

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.090
supply-side factors,
and supply-side factors

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:24.210
influence demand-side factors.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.440
They're not independent.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.900
They are inextricably linked.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:32.980
If I see a high-power
woman being mistreated,

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.460
it will make me have
different preferences.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:39.900
And then how I behave will
influence how people around me

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:43.690
view women generally and
how they react to them.

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:44.620
So that is the end.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.840
I want to say thank you so,
so much to my co-authors

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.081
and to all of you.

01:07:48.081 --> 01:07:51.849
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:57.650
-Terrific.

01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:59.970
Thank you so much.

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:01.000
I've been taking notes.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.130
I have so many questions.

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:05.080
But I'm going to be brief.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.800
OK, so I'm going to
restrict myself and think

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.870
about questions that
cross a little bit, OK?

01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:12.040
So starting with Laurel.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.840
So Laurel, I noticed
you were taking notes

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.080
throughout as well.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.979
We academics!

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:20.420
But anyway, as you were
listening to Deborah,

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.810
some of her arguments have to
do with-- she said pipeline--

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:28.979
but different roles that
individuals, women, take

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:29.740
versus men.

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.642
And so I was wondering,
in your own research

01:08:31.642 --> 01:08:33.100
or the doctoral
students' research,

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.930
whether you saw
differences either

01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:37.399
within academia in
particular-- that's

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:40.620
really where a lot of your
work has been-- or biotech.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.660
Because most of your
research was juxtaposing

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.270
the two, whether there are
differences within the roles

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:47.609
that people take on and
whether there's anything

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:49.760
we could learn from
there, whether it's

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.479
biology versus chemistry.

01:08:51.479 --> 01:08:53.562
Are there different
kinds of pieces

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:55.520
to the puzzle that have
to do with roles rather

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.770
than the larger
opportunity-structured networks

01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:59.770
versus hierarchies
that might lend insight

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.589
into the problem from
your perspective.

01:09:01.589 --> 01:09:03.880
-And so do you want me to
answer, or are you going to--

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.590
-No, I'm going to ask
you to answer that.

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:07.779
Just you, and right now.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:13.621
-I want to follow the protocol.

01:09:13.621 --> 01:09:14.120
Great.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:14.979
That's a great question.

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:15.479
Thanks.

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:18.047
And I was really fascinated
by Deborah's discussion

01:09:18.047 --> 01:09:19.880
about the difference
between line and staff,

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.979
which of course is really
important to understanding

01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:25.189
who makes it up into
leadership roles.

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:28.100
But something else
that your comments

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.310
made me think about,
especially juxtaposing the HR

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:37.490
sort of legal kinds of roles
with the more scientific roles,

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:40.890
is I think really an interesting
question about something

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:43.729
that sociologists study a lot,
which is gender segregation.

01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:46.529
And so we know that
occupational segregation

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:50.020
is a huge amount of what
accounts for the pay gap.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.520
And so in my study, which
I should have clarified,

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.660
I was looking just
at life science PhDs.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.760
So I was only looking at
people who had their PhDs-- so

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:05.510
comparing people who have
the same qualifications,

01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:08.890
and many of whom are from
the same doctoral programs,

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:14.270
in academia and in
pharma and in biotech.

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:17.770
But I think that this question
about how do we segregate--

01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:20.780
and it also relates to what
Allison was just saying,

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:22.730
about how do we
self-segregate too.

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:25.150
So there's a lot of
interesting research.

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:28.100
For example, a study by a
sociologist, Maria Charles,

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:31.800
that finds that in international
studies of how do women

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.510
choose majors.

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:36.570
In less developed
countries, women

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:40.740
are much more likely to go
for engineering and natural

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.560
sciences.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.270
But when there's
more of a choice,

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:50.520
that's when women choose
to go into social sciences

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.610
and humanities.

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:55.220
And so there's something about
the structure in which we're

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.452
making our choices and sort
of self-segregating that

01:10:58.452 --> 01:11:00.410
needs further examination,
is what I would say.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.900
-Great.

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:01.160
Thanks.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:01.850
Very helpful.

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:03.020
Very helpful.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:07.230
Deborah, I can't help
but ask the question

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:08.980
with the setup and
the introduction

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.550
that we had about the optimism.

01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:14.680
And you are clearly
somebody who's optimistic.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.980
And yet also, listening
to Allison, and even

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.760
your own remarks about
women not seeking

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.309
out help,
self-sponsorship, or seeing

01:11:23.309 --> 01:11:24.600
the negative side and so forth.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.700
And I know this bleeds over
into the second session,

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.480
so I apologize.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.220
But I know that's where you're
at and what we can learn from.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.550
What are your thoughts
on maintaining

01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:41.150
that optimism, first of
all, which clearly you have?

01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:46.310
And secondly, do you see
changes over the years?

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:48.810
Are you optimistic, I guess?

01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:51.320
-Well, I think I'm an
optimist by nature,

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.120
so let's just say that.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.810
But I do see changes
over the years.

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:59.300
And one of the changes that
I am really encouraged by--

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.070
and I'm not sure it's getting
exactly to this panel--

01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:04.640
is the change in young men.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.950
And young men--
young compared to me,

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:12.890
not necessarily that young--
are much more interested

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:15.770
in balanced life.

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:22.520
I'm seeing more young men who
will want the type of work that

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:26.020
allows them to do
some of the things

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:33.190
with their family that make them
say, no, I don't necessarily

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:34.810
just want a bigger job.

01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:37.450
I want to be a part
of my children's life.

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:41.270
And also, in that
upcoming generation,

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:46.560
there are more families with
two working spouses where

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.150
tradeoffs have to be made.

01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:54.270
And it's not always the
woman who's trading anymore,

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:59.780
as it used to be maybe
at least 20 years ago.

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.900
That's definitely
evolved over time.

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:07.600
So I think we're
moving into a time

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.440
where both women and men
might have-- unfortunately,

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.930
your research is
making a liar of me--

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:18.440
that maybe women and men are
going to have more goals.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.770
And it was so interesting.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.020
Your work is so interesting.

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.560
And it resonates with
me, because I think about

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.560
and I think of the
context in which men

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.560
make those decisions
often is the context of,

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.720
yeah, I can think
about the upsides

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:35.720
because I'm not trading
away as many downsides,

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.430
because there's somebody else
in my life who takes care

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:44.730
of making sure my kids are great
and everything's functioning

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:48.440
and they're getting
fabulous input.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.660
I feel like our family
ecosystem, together

01:13:53.660 --> 01:14:01.470
with my often non-working
spouse and me, is stable,

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:06.950
so they can focus on much more
so-- pop psychology, probably.

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:12.720
And you can all criticize
me, but I'm not the academic.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.690
And maybe it will shift
a bit more over time.

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:20.490
And I think women are-- I've
made decisions in my career

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:23.560
where I wouldn't go
for the bigger job

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.150
because of the mother
I wanted to be-- not

01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:31.620
because my husband isn't
fabulously supportive

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.230
and absolutely would have
helped me make it happen,

01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:38.410
but because of who I wanted
to be for my children.

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:42.090
So commuting-- we want to
keep our high-schoolers in one

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:46.770
place, and many people-- never
mind just men, men and women--

01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:49.020
will make a decision to commute.

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.700
I didn't want to,
and it was nothing

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.030
to do with my husband
and his support.

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:56.140
So I don't feel
victimized or put upon.

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:57.300
It was me.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.810
I wanted to be there.

01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:05.820
So yes, we do make decisions
with the broad set of goals,

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.310
and keeping what
we want in balance.

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:10.020
I just feel that's great.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:15.200
So I want women always to feel
empowered to make the decision.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.390
There's no absolute need to
always want the bigger job.

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:24.050
But if you want it, we need
to create the ecosystem where

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:26.190
you can go for it as a woman.

01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:29.730
And it's not just going to
be your voice or your looks

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.466
or your gender that
has you dismissed.

01:15:32.466 --> 01:15:35.680
-It takes a village, really.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:40.300
Alison, I know you haven't done
work specifically in this area,

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.065
but now you've been thinking
about the particulars.

01:15:43.065 --> 01:15:46.800
And I'm just wondering
if you can just

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.150
riff with us a little bit.

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:51.730
If you've thought about
the wonderful social-psych

01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:54.350
experiments that you've seen
or you've done yourself,

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.240
is there anything
about this context

01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.020
that you can think about
that might particularly

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.020
put kind of an accent at the
end of some of your results?

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.410
Or maybe it isn't quite
so stark in this context.

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:10.810
And we know you're not
specifically studying this,

01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:14.070
but we'd still love to hear
the benefits of your thinking

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:15.310
as you're absorbing this.

01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:16.600
-Absolutely.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.810
I think the entrepreneurship
findings are particularly

01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:23.570
relevant for this
audience, because I

01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:28.240
think the effect would be
particularly strong in contexts

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.600
that are sort of hard sciences.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.020
There's a lot of math,
complexity, uncertainty.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:40.020
It's in contexts like that
where these quick, go-to

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.790
discriminatory rules,
people use them more often.

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:49.229
So for example, imagine a woman
is pitching a makeup company.

01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:50.770
People would be more
likely to listen

01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:52.770
to her in that
context as opposed

01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:58.150
to pitching some pharmaceutical
drug or another biotech type

01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:02.650
of idea that one might
say traditionally

01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:06.400
or historically is a sort
of male-typed context.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.740
The lack of fit between the
entrepreneur and the content

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.940
is even more dramatic.

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:16.760
But that means that the
opportunity to be a badass

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:23.150
and be a star in those
domains is even larger.

01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:23.910
-Excellent.

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:26.230
Another optimist on the panel.

01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:29.080
OK, we turn now to you
for your questions.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.170
So just line up
right at the mic.

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:34.800
Make sure you just state
your name, your affiliation,

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.160
and you can direct your
question to one or more

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:37.991
of our panelists.

01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:38.490
Thank you.

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:41.480
-I'm Joanne Kamens, the head of
Addgene, a nonprofit biotech.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.200
So I've been able to take
both my woman's desire

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.100
to do woman-like nonprofit-y
things and lead a biotech.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.626
So finding that middle balance.

01:17:50.626 --> 01:17:52.250
Alyson, I guess this
is mostly for you,

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.280
but I think for
all the panelists--

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.810
I was very interested
in everything you said,

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:59.760
but the intersection
between this supply-side

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.830
and the demand-side factors.

01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:05.950
So I speak to hundreds of
women scientists every year.

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:08.350
I do career speaking
for postdocs.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:15.020
And my question is, the implicit
bias toward how women should

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:20.030
behave as moms and as women--
speaking quietly, politely,

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:22.480
raising their children as
the primary parent, all

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:26.930
those things-- is that affecting
women's desires, do you think?

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:29.677
Or is it women's desires
that are the problem?

01:18:29.677 --> 01:18:31.760
So we say to women, you
need to learn how to golf.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.770
You need to ask.

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:34.430
We have to ask more.

01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:38.360
We have to do all these
things to overcome the bias.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.050
But has the bias caused-- like,
am I supposed to feel guilty?

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.580
I don't.

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.640
Maybe that's why I've been
successful in my career.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.431
I've got a husband.

01:18:45.431 --> 01:18:47.310
He can do half.

01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:50.590
But so many women I know, they
feel guilty and the men don't.

01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:53.710
Even the ones who are
starting to contribute 50-50,

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:55.740
they don't feel guilty.

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:59.300
Is that society telling
us, or is that how we are?

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.350
-Thank you.

01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:01.590
-That's such a deep question.

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:03.000
I wish I knew the answer.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.500
I think my intuition is
that the bias is making

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:10.300
us feel that way, because
this research is a snapshot

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.330
of our culture right now.

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:17.100
And if we were to run those
same studies 50 years ago or 50

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.780
years from now, I
think and hope that we

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.610
would have found very
different results 50 years ago,

01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:26.220
and I hope that we find
different results in 50 years.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:30.150
Right now I think we're still
in a time of cultural shift

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:31.010
gender-wise.

01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:33.900
It was not that
long ago that women

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:39.620
could be nurses or teachers or
nothing, or a stay-at-home mom.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:42.180
So I think we're still
in a dramatic time

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.890
of cultural shift,
and right now I

01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:50.390
think the guilt that women
feel is likely a result of bias

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:51.990
and not the other way around.

01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:54.750
But I think that the
scientifically correct answer

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:55.895
is we don't know.

01:19:55.895 --> 01:19:57.715
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:03.890
-Hi, I'm Jenny [INAUDIBLE], and
I'm actually a psychologist.

01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:07.090
I run my own talent management
and executive coaching firm,

01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:09.270
and I'm actually in the
process of conducting

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:12.190
some qualitative research
right now with rising

01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:15.090
women scientists, because I do
a lot of coaching in this space

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:16.840
and have seen a lot
of women feeling stuck

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.230
at that middle management
level-- so looking

01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:20.710
at some of these factors.

01:20:20.710 --> 01:20:25.880
And Alison, my question is for
you, because your comment about

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.890
do they want to get
to that next level

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:29.940
is one of the questions
I'm looking at,

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.960
motivating and
demotivating factors

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.760
as well as organisational
systems that support or impede.

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.610
And part of what I'm
hearing is the women

01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:41.140
say they want influence, they
want to expand their impact,

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.670
they want to do good
work and feel satisfied,

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:46.960
but they are very concerned
about the tradeoffs.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.180
They are concerned about
the work-life balance.

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:51.850
And my question for you
is, in your research,

01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:56.430
did you find any
age-related changes?

01:20:56.430 --> 01:21:01.634
So in the 20s, are the concerns
less in terms of the negatives?

01:21:01.634 --> 01:21:03.050
Are they a little
bit less worried

01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:06.150
about the time factor, the
travel issues, et cetera.

01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:06.890
-Great.

01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:07.550
Excellent.

01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:09.820
And I'd love to hear from
Deborah on this, as well.

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.620
Do you want to go
first, Deborah?

01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.650
-No, go right ahead.

01:21:11.650 --> 01:21:13.550
-So we had the same
hypothesis, which

01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:17.270
is why we went after high-level
executives, working adults,

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:22.260
and college kids-- I'm
sorry, college students.

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:24.200
And we thought that
college students would

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.170
have more progressive
views, and maybe they

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:31.191
hadn't been infiltrated
by biases quite yet.

01:21:31.191 --> 01:21:33.190
But it seems like we
didn't even go young enough

01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:34.850
with our sample.

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:38.030
Even college
students are thinking

01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:42.210
ahead to what's my life going
to be like as a working adult.

01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:45.090
In fact, I think women
in college in particular,

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:47.810
it's really on their
minds about how am I

01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:50.070
going to be a
high-powered CEO and have

01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:52.150
a beautiful, wonderful family?

01:21:52.150 --> 01:21:55.585
And I don't think the answers
are clear, probably because

01:21:55.585 --> 01:21:56.710
of what Deborah was saying.

01:21:56.710 --> 01:22:00.220
There aren't a lot
of role models.

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.340
-Yeah.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.980
I think that is
exactly right, and I

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.760
think that what I often have
to say to people is they say,

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.520
I want to be home
with my family.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.650
I don't want to take a
job in another city that's

01:22:14.650 --> 01:22:17.590
better, because I've got
my support systems here.

01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:21.560
And that's great and fine,
but what I counsel them is you

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:26.230
need to own up to
what that costs you.

01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:31.380
You can't ask to have the same
experience at the end of it

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.740
as the man, often, who
has made those moves,

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:40.080
has gathered those extra
experiences, has been out there

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.460
being a thought-leader,
being prepared

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:44.150
to travel on the weekend.

01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:47.270
So you will be very delayed.

01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:51.210
So when your kids
are self-sufficient

01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:53.140
and you want to do
that, you will not

01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:54.530
have the experience base.

01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:59.080
So let's just all be clear about
that, because it is in that way

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.050
a meritocracy-- not
exclusively; there are biases.

01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:08.300
But at a minimum, the women
have to have to the same levels

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.610
of experience.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.850
You can't do it with less.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.650
-Thank you.

01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:14.540
Yes?

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.040
-Hi.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:15.721
Good afternoon.

01:23:15.721 --> 01:23:17.220
Thanks for being
with us here today.

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.110
My name is Zachariah
[INAUDIBLE],

01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:22.320
and I am a master student
at the Harvard Graduate

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.670
School of Education.

01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:28.190
Prior to coming to HGSE, I was
an early childhood teacher,

01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:33.020
teaching primarily pre-K and
K. And I saw in the classroom

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:36.330
how both boys and
girls already had

01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:40.720
such a strong socialized
sense of gender norms,

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:44.440
whether it's this color is for
girls or boys can't play this,

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.310
or you can't play with me
because you are a boy or girl.

01:23:49.861 --> 01:23:51.360
I was mindful of
these, and I always

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.490
struggled with how to
effectively encourage

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.320
the right kinds of
interpersonal skills

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:05.500
so that when they grew up, both
genders would have a chance

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.930
to succeed professionally.

01:24:06.930 --> 01:24:10.070
I really had that
in mind long-term.

01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:15.180
So my question is, what
specific interpersonal skills

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:20.330
and internalisation are
necessary for young girls

01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:23.160
to be able to succeed
in the workplace?

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.560
-Thoughts on that?

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.677
-I'll dive in.

01:24:26.677 --> 01:24:27.990
-Yeah.

01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:30.890
-I think one of
them is confidence

01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:33.960
and being able to speak up.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.200
What I find with
women frequently

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.405
is that they will offer
a perspective in almost

01:24:40.405 --> 01:24:43.740
an apologetic way.

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:46.510
Sometimes there's
a physical apology.

01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:48.740
I had to take one
woman aside and say,

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:51.900
stop presenting like this.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:55.240
Stand up and face your audience.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.591
And so there's
physical attributes

01:24:57.591 --> 01:24:58.590
that come along with it.

01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:02.440
There's vocal and
verbalization attributes.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.300
Women will say "I feel."

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:07.000
Men will say "I
think" or "I know."

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.820
And I don't know
where those come from,

01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:13.090
but they're pretty prevalent.

01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:16.020
So I think that
confidence, the ability

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:21.370
to speak clearly and
articulately in a debate,

01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:25.790
and to take on conflict--
not in a combative way,

01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:29.020
but to feel comfortable
defending a point of view.

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.480
Now, I'm talking to
rooms full of PhDs

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.910
who've all defended
dissertations,

01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:36.560
so you know how to do that.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.400
But in an argument where
you're not the expert

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.880
necessarily, how do you
feel comfortable holding

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.350
onto a point of view?

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:48.050
How do you feel comfortable
insisting on being heard?

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:50.430
Because women will
often back off when

01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:52.180
somebody interrupts them.

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:55.060
Men simply either don't
allow it to happen

01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.460
or will come back at it.

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:58.920
So there are, I think,
behaviors that we

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:04.500
can help our young women right
from the very elementary learn,

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:08.310
and practices that we can
teach them to help them.

01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:11.200
It can't overcome all the
bias, but it can sure help.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.599
-Laurel has some thoughts.

01:26:12.599 --> 01:26:13.974
-I'm working on
a paper right now

01:26:13.974 --> 01:26:15.890
in the chemical
sciences that looks

01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:20.270
at lab presentations of
graduate student men and women.

01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:23.090
And we found a very large
crisis of confidence

01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:25.980
in the women graduate students.

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.200
But the context matters, right?

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.420
And so we find that the PIs
are interrupting the women

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:35.000
and helping them,
answering for them.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.142
They don't do that
for the male students.

01:26:37.142 --> 01:26:38.850
There's also this
joking manner that they

01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:40.920
have with the male students,
like, oh, you know.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.800
It's very light.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.230
And it's very serious
for the women students.

01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:48.800
And so the situation, the
interactional situation,

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.642
is different for
the women students

01:26:50.642 --> 01:26:51.600
than it is for the men.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.230
So I would say
that teachers maybe

01:26:55.230 --> 01:26:57.120
need to think about
what kinds of classroom

01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.320
contexts they're creating, that
it's not just on the students.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.250
So I come from Amherst,
and in our public schools

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:09.130
there, which are very
gender non-normative place

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:11.425
in Massachusetts.

01:27:11.425 --> 01:27:13.550
The boys and girls play
soccer together all the way

01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:17.170
through elementary school,
and that's not in all places.

01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:22.620
So if you have less gender
segregation at the early level,

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.700
I'm curious to see what happens.

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.620
I'm hoping those
girls will then be

01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:29.730
able to forge new
paths later on, too.

01:27:29.730 --> 01:27:30.930
So thanks for your question.

01:27:30.930 --> 01:27:31.880
-Helpful, thank you.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.611
-Thank you.

01:27:33.611 --> 01:27:35.610
-And I'm going to ask you
guys to keep it brief,

01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:38.000
because we're
clicking down on time

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.510
and I see a long line there.

01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:40.710
-OK, I'll try to be brief.

01:27:40.710 --> 01:27:41.210
[INAUDIBLE]

01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:44.040
I'm in the private sector in
a hierarchical environment,

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.500
so I see that perspective.

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:49.180
And so my question
is for Deborah.

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.705
Monica said that it
requires a village.

01:27:51.705 --> 01:27:53.310
But before it
requires a village,

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:55.056
we've identified
who it requires.

01:27:55.056 --> 01:27:56.930
It's the people in power
in the hierarchical.

01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:58.680
That's where the
majority of the jobs are.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.450
But when we look who's
here, they're not here.

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:06.022
So how do we get
them to be engaged

01:28:06.022 --> 01:28:07.230
in part of this conversation?

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.320
-Some of us are here.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:16.772
Just because [INAUDIBLE]
doesn't mean we're not here.

01:28:16.772 --> 01:28:22.280
-I think the question is that
the male CEOs of corporations,

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.230
why are they not here?

01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:27.030
And I think they
are being alerted

01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:30.930
to it and within their own
companies need to take action.

01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:34.360
So I think what we need to go
do is go to the business sector

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.250
and have the same kind of
meetings within the business

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:42.805
sector as well so that we're
attacking it on all levels.

01:28:42.805 --> 01:28:43.980
-Great, thank you.

01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:44.770
Yeah?

01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:45.270
-Hi.

01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:47.600
My name is Anna Ward,
and I was most recently

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.900
senior vice president and
general counsel of a company

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:54.440
where I also headed HR-- so up
through the pink career ladder.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.760
I love pink, by the way.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.820
But because I hit
the ceiling as GC

01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.840
and they wouldn't allow me to
get operational experience,

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.380
which is a problem.

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.220
I'm going to launch
my own company here

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:07.530
as an entrepreneur.

01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:12.930
And so Alison, your
data, though interesting,

01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:17.370
doesn't offer any solutions
other than to hire

01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:22.230
a hot young guy, which I'm
totally open to, by the way,

01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:22.805
OK?

01:29:22.805 --> 01:29:23.690
I'm just saying.

01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:26.221
-I can just see the
Twitter feed light up.

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:31.000
-And I believe it.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.870
I don't doubt that
there's a problem,

01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:35.050
but I want to focus
on those solutions.

01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:38.210
And so what I would ask is,
what would you advise me,

01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:41.850
as a female entrepreneur
launching a company here

01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:42.350
in Boston?

01:29:45.670 --> 01:29:47.800
-Hire a hot young guy.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.610
No.

01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:49.910
No, it's an excellent question.

01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:52.410
This is the question
that keeps me up at night

01:29:52.410 --> 01:29:56.570
and why this type of research
is slightly dissatisfying,

01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:59.750
because it's easy to
identify problems.

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:02.539
It's a lot harder to
identify solutions.

01:30:02.539 --> 01:30:04.080
I'm going to punt
that that question,

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.130
because the next panel is
talking all about solutions

01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:10.170
to these kinds of problems.

01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:12.730
-We probably also need other
people on the other side.

01:30:12.730 --> 01:30:15.670
I noticed in your
picture all the judges--

01:30:15.670 --> 01:30:16.660
-Correct.

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:20.870
-Unless that just
happened to be the case?

01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:22.780
-My name is Cassandra Smith.

01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:28.420
I'm founder of Athena Biomedical
Research Organization focused

01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:32.820
on prevention of mental
illness through nutritional

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:37.760
interventions and with
early detection of inborn

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.180
errors of metabolism.

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:42.341
And I don't know
why I'm so nervous.

01:30:42.341 --> 01:30:45.670
-You're among friends.

01:30:45.670 --> 01:30:48.810
-My question-- and some
of this is anecdotal,

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:52.690
but I noticed that
there were very few

01:30:52.690 --> 01:30:58.920
American women who were on the
editorial boards of journals.

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.730
And what do I want I
say American women?

01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:08.390
Like third, fourth,
et cetera generations.

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:15.600
Most of this is
anecdotal observations,

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:21.600
but when Dan Koshland was
chief editor of Science,

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.760
he had 100 people on
the editorial board.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.550
90 were men.

01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:29.970
10% of those were at
foreign institutions.

01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:33.110
He had 10 women.

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:38.600
90% of those were at
foreign institutions.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:48.330
So that kind of says to me,
are these men in science,

01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:53.980
they can deal more easily
with these foreign women.

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:58.210
And I've seen it in
other situations.

01:31:58.210 --> 01:32:03.210
Are they doing this because it's
easier to deal with these women

01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:06.030
than to deal with us?

01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:08.280
-Wow.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.270
-So there's work
by Katrina Zippel,

01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:16.200
who is an expert sociologist
at Northeastern here.

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:19.150
And she's done some work that
looks at the intersection

01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:23.040
of nationality and gender.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.690
Her research shows
some of what you're

01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:27.970
saying, that the
interaction context is very

01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:32.000
different for women who are
from foreign countries who

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.981
are scientists than for
domestic women scientists.

01:32:37.981 --> 01:32:38.480
It's real.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:42.210
-I think that's somehow
how people are interacting.

01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:46.190
One fast question--
what about tallness?

01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:47.481
-What about what?

01:32:47.481 --> 01:32:47.980
-Tallness.

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:49.820
Height.

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:51.390
-I'm so fascinated by height.

01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:53.710
-I've actually noticed
this in biotech.

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:56.510
[INAUDIBLE]

01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:59.220
-Very high heels.

01:32:59.220 --> 01:32:59.720
No, I know.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.830
It's a variable that
actually could matter a lot.

01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:03.740
We haven't even
looked at that yet.

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:04.365
-Great, thanks.

01:33:04.365 --> 01:33:04.864
-Hi.

01:33:04.864 --> 01:33:05.950
My name is Laurel Wright.

01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:08.730
I'm a PhD student
in biology at MIT.

01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:12.740
And Deborah, some of the
characteristics and actions

01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:15.920
that you were talking about--
when I think about that

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:22.190
anecdotally, some of these
badass women, I think,

01:33:22.190 --> 01:33:26.600
sometimes are perceived
differently than men who--

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.635
-Are badass.

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:28.160
-Are badass.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.360
And I was wondering
from the sociologist

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:34.990
if there are data that
kind of support that idea.

01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:37.300
Women who have these
certain characteristics,

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:40.450
are they discriminated
against in a different way

01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:44.119
than men who have the same
kind of characteristics?

01:33:44.119 --> 01:33:45.660
-Alison, you might
want to take this.

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.743
There's lab studies on it.

01:33:46.743 --> 01:33:48.690
-Yeah.

01:33:48.690 --> 01:33:52.240
First I want to say that
truly badass women who

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.410
make it to the top get a
sort of perceptual boost.

01:33:56.410 --> 01:33:58.080
Because people
realize that they've

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:03.300
navigated all of these landmines
and persisted and succeeded,

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:07.350
there is actually a boost
in respect and perceptions

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:10.920
of competence for women who
can go and pitch their ideas

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.970
and succeed and women
who kind of navigate

01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:16.440
their way through
all of these biases

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:20.460
and discriminatory things.

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:23.410
There is a lot of
research about backlash

01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:25.680
is what you're describing.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.760
Women who display agentic
or assertive behaviors

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:31.300
are seen as bitchy
and cold, and men

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:34.170
who displayed agentic
and assertive behaviors

01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:36.430
are seen as leaders.

01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:40.280
This is the sort of baseline
type of gender research

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:46.210
that we know is happening
right now in our culture.

01:34:46.210 --> 01:34:48.150
-Deborah, have you
seen this work?

01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:48.960
You clearly have.

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.440
So thinking about
the social context

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.660
in which women are displaying
agentic and assertive

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.200
behaviors, what are the
conditions under which

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.770
that actually does work?

01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:02.470
Because it's clear
that a lot of people

01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:05.920
here are thinking
about how either we

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.080
can create the context,
as my sociologist friend

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.840
here would say, or how
can we change behavior,

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.320
as my social psychologist
friend would say?

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:17.610
So I'm just wondering if you've
seen the marrying of the two

01:35:17.610 --> 01:35:19.140
and under what conditions.

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:22.060
-I think the answer is not
going to help a whole lot,

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:24.900
and where I see
it function based

01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:29.490
is when you get past the
tipping point in organizations

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:34.130
where there's not that
tiny minority of women.

01:35:34.130 --> 01:35:38.410
So when there's more of a
balance within organizations,

01:35:38.410 --> 01:35:41.500
you see that there's the
same spectrum of women

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.790
as there are of men in
terms of their behavior.

01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:47.600
Sometimes somebody who's
outspoken and assertive

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.610
is a bitch, excuse me.

01:35:50.610 --> 01:35:51.970
Others are not.

01:35:51.970 --> 01:35:53.470
And it's the same with men.

01:35:53.470 --> 01:35:56.180
Some of the assertive
behaviors are actually

01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:58.680
very productive and
functional, and some of them

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.340
aren't in organizations.

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:06.300
But you can only see that and
not get the one generalization

01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:09.690
when there's more of a balance.

01:36:09.690 --> 01:36:14.710
So finding a place, when
you're examining potentially

01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:17.100
a career in industry,
being in a place

01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:21.140
and actually observing
what is the gender balance.

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:26.230
You're more likely to be able
to manifest those behaviors

01:36:26.230 --> 01:36:30.820
without as much backlash if
there is more gender balance

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.480
within the organization.

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.260
Just as a
top-of-my-head comment.

01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:35.340
-Thanks.

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:37.190
Great.

01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:37.690
-Hi.

01:36:37.690 --> 01:36:38.898
My name is Renee [INAUDIBLE].

01:36:38.898 --> 01:36:41.080
I'm head of research
at a small biotech

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:45.020
here in Cambridge that focuses
on biological data sciences.

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:48.100
And this has been
very engaging and has

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.850
gotten me thinking about the
constitution of the management

01:36:51.850 --> 01:36:55.130
team of my company over the last
10 years that I've been there.

01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:59.870
And it's gone from 0% women to
50% women, which is fantastic.

01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:01.580
I think it's a very
meritocracy-driven

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.150
organization.

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:06.260
There have been five women
on the management team.

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:10.270
And one of the things that I
noticed was out of this five,

01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:12.850
four of us have come
up through the ranks.

01:37:12.850 --> 01:37:15.240
So we started at
entry-level positions.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:19.340
And my question is really, is
that a requirement for women

01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:20.530
in leadership positions?

01:37:20.530 --> 01:37:23.190
Must we demonstrate
our capabilities

01:37:23.190 --> 01:37:29.970
within the organization in
order to attain that level?

01:37:29.970 --> 01:37:32.330
-I'm trying to think
through very quickly

01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:35.420
my experience of the
women that I know that are

01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:38.040
in very senior positions.

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.920
And I think there are a
predominance of them that

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:44.170
have been with the
companies long time,

01:37:44.170 --> 01:37:48.850
but there are definitely more
in the last maybe five years

01:37:48.850 --> 01:37:52.260
that have been hired
in from the outside.

01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:58.270
So perhaps that's in my teeny,
tiny, insignificant data

01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:59.830
sample.

01:37:59.830 --> 01:38:02.580
There's a bit of a shift
that women can actually

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:06.220
move now into those more
leadership positions.

01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:11.170
I actually did a study on this
same topic about 10 years ago.

01:38:11.170 --> 01:38:13.645
From our ranks, there were
hundreds of women there.

01:38:13.645 --> 01:38:15.625
And I led a study
because no women

01:38:15.625 --> 01:38:19.090
were getting promoted into group
leader positions from within.

01:38:19.090 --> 01:38:22.499
They were all being
hired from without.

01:38:22.499 --> 01:38:24.040
And we did a study,
both a perception

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.010
study, only on one
company, and actually

01:38:27.010 --> 01:38:28.000
looking at the numbers.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.286
And the reasons turned out to be
that if you came into a company

01:38:31.286 --> 01:38:32.702
when you were early
in your career

01:38:32.702 --> 01:38:34.930
and you didn't display the
features that we needed,

01:38:34.930 --> 01:38:37.405
you were remembered
as that little girl.

01:38:37.405 --> 01:38:39.880
No matter you had
accomplished, the perception

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.025
was you were still that
little girl that you

01:38:42.025 --> 01:38:44.087
came in as 10 years
ago, and you were never

01:38:44.087 --> 01:38:47.870
going to get promoted.

01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:50.646
so you were never going to
get promoted from within.

01:38:50.646 --> 01:38:52.020
And all of these
women were being

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:54.490
hired from without
until we pointed it out.

01:38:54.490 --> 01:38:57.660
And leadership changed some of
their criteria for promotion

01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:01.560
and attempted to put in some
transparency and bureaucracy

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.276
to allow women to be
promoted from within.

01:39:04.276 --> 01:39:07.100
And two women were then the year
later promoted to group leader.

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.770
But we had to demand
it-- demand it.

01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:11.180
-Provide evidence.

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:13.980
Yeah, great question.

01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:14.840
-Hi.

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.770
I got the height gene, lucky me.

01:39:17.770 --> 01:39:19.230
So I'm Lisa Levy.

01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:21.180
I'm a long-term
diversity consultant

01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:25.680
with a lot of deep expertise in
gender norms and gender roles.

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.600
So my question is, why don't
we ever ask about why men say,

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.970
I can't be the
father I want to be?

01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:36.050
It's amazing that that's not
a part of our conversation

01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:39.880
even all these years in, because
even if you have someone else

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.230
doing it all,
you're not doing it.

01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:45.330
And you can only get that
one-on-one even more so,

01:39:45.330 --> 01:39:48.650
I would argue, with your family
than what you could do at work.

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:51.700
So that's a question I'd
just love your feedback on.

01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:55.550
And the second question is,
what responsibility do you

01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:59.840
think men have given we know
organizations are profoundly

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.390
privileged towards men?

01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:04.170
We wouldn't have the
data over all the years,

01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:06.820
and that's not changing
at the very top.

01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:11.530
What responsibility do you
think men have to be allies

01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:17.162
or to do something proactively
to make it more equitable?

01:40:17.162 --> 01:40:18.620
-So I'm going to
give our panelists

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:21.390
the choice of answering
one of your questions.

01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:24.240
I think the first
one may be broader

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.250
than perhaps this panelist
would even choose to speak to,

01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:32.440
but you have the choice if you'd
like to address one of them.

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.826
-I'll address the first one.

01:40:33.826 --> 01:40:34.720
-Excellent.

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:39.690
-So masculinity studies
show that the male gender

01:40:39.690 --> 01:40:44.890
role is a lot stricter than
the female gender role.

01:40:44.890 --> 01:40:49.030
So girls can be tomboys,
but boys can't be sissies.

01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:52.190
And so transgressing
that, there's

01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:54.730
a lot more punishment
that men face.

01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:58.260
And so I think that's also
true for fatherhood probably

01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:02.500
as well, that transgressing
the work role--

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:04.440
-The second one
I'll be very brief.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.190
I think the
responsibility for men

01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:09.500
is a responsibility
to the business.

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:12.200
And I'll come back to the
performance of companies.

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.170
This is not a fairness issue.

01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:17.130
It's not a politeness.

01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:21.500
This is a business issue,
diversity of all types.

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:25.360
Gender diversity, racial
and ethnicity-- we have to,

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.750
as business leaders, do that.

01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:30.564
And I think that case has not
been sufficiently persuasively

01:41:30.564 --> 01:41:31.105
communicated.

01:41:33.930 --> 01:41:34.640
-Excellent.

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.640
Thank you.

01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:38.020
We have time for
one more question.

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:38.520
OK?

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.155
So you are on.

01:41:39.155 --> 01:41:39.780
-I'll be quick.

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:40.780
-Thank you.

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:41.995
-My name is [INAUDIBLE].

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:44.190
I'm a stem cell
biologist at Harvard.

01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:45.300
I'm a postdoc.

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:48.400
My question is for Laurel.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.530
It's regarding this networks
and the hierarchy thing.

01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:56.150
So I definitely work
better in a team.

01:41:56.150 --> 01:41:59.790
So my question is, do
we not like hierarchies,

01:41:59.790 --> 01:42:04.520
or is it that we never got to
the really powerful positions?

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.142
-Good question.

01:42:06.142 --> 01:42:08.250
Yeah, I think it looks
pretty good from the top

01:42:08.250 --> 01:42:12.160
when you're in a
hierarchy, right?

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.700
And I don't think it's anything
that's essential to women,

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.460
that they're more collaborative.

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:20.860
That's not something, at least
that I've found in my research.

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:25.660
But that more
collaborative structure

01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:28.270
allowed for more gender equity.

01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:31.130
And maybe it's because of the
broader culture that we live

01:42:31.130 --> 01:42:34.830
in, but I like your question.

01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:37.360
Sounds like an area
for future research.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.330
So I'd like to
thank our panelists.

01:42:40.330 --> 01:42:43.680
