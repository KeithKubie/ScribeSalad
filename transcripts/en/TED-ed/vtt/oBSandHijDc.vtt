00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:09.043
For most of human history,

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:13.252
medical workers sought 
to treat diseases or cure them.

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:16.146
The rise of vaccination 
in the 19th century

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.300
enhanced the potential to prevent people

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.651
from contracting illnesses
in the first place.

00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:24.305
But only in recent decades did it 
become possible

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:30.063
to ensure that a particular disease
never threatens humanity again.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.605
The story of smallpox,

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.687
the first and, so far, the only disease

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:37.484
to be permanently 
eradicated from the world,

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:43.623
shows how disease eradication can happen
and why it is so difficult to achieve.

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:47.825
Smallpox emerged in human populations
thousands of years ago

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.914
as a contagious virus that spread rapidly,

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:54.604
primarily through close, 
face to face contact,

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:57.302
causing fever, aches and rashes.

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:59.940
It killed up to 30% of its victims

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.466
and often left survivors with life-long
disfiguring scars.

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.515
The devastating impact 
of smallpox was so great

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:12.595
that several cultures had religious 
deities specifically dedicated to it.

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:14.224
In the 20th century alone,

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:19.791
it is estimated to have killed
more than 300 million people worldwide.

00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:22.386
With the effective 
deployment of vaccination,

00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:25.054
the number of cases began to decrease.

00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:27.464
By seeking out infected individuals,

00:01:27.464 --> 00:01:28.910
isolating them,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.256
and vaccinating their contacts 
to prevent further transmission,

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:36.655
scientists realized that the spread
of the disease could be haulted.

00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:40.960
In fact, because smallpox could
only survive in human hosts,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.689
vaccinating all of an infected persons'
potential contacts

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.740
would stop the virus dead in its tracks

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.311
and eliminate it from that region.

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:51.921
Once this strategy had succeeded

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:55.352
in ridding most industrialized countries
from disease,

00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:59.887
health officials realized that eradicating
it worldwide was within reach.

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:01.842
But this was not an easy process,

00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:06.437
proving especially difficult in places
suffering from poor infrastructure

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:08.623
or civil wars.

00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:10.643
The eradication effort took decades

00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:13.829
and involved millions 
of people working together,

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.823
from world leaders
and international organizations

00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:19.806
to rural doctors and community workers.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.075
In India, one of the last 
strongholds of the disease,

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:28.764
health workers visited every one
of the country's 100 million households

00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:30.559
to search for cases.

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.813
Through this unprecedented 
worldwide effort,

00:02:32.813 --> 00:02:35.870
in which even rival 
superpowers cooperated,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.107
smallpox was finally 
declared eradicated in 1980,

00:02:40.107 --> 00:02:45.407
saving approximately 40 million lives
over the following two decades.

00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:46.693
There were several factors

00:02:46.693 --> 00:02:50.389
that made smallpox
an ideal candidate for eradication.

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.494
First, humans are essential
to the smallpox lifecycle,

00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:57.191
so breaking the chain 
of human to human transmission

00:02:57.191 --> 00:02:59.991
causes the virus to die out.

00:02:59.991 --> 00:03:04.906
In contrast, many other pathogens,
like ebola or the bubonic plague,

00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:07.288
can survive in animal carriers,

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:11.398
while the bacteria that cause tetanus
can even live in the soil.

00:03:11.398 --> 00:03:14.251
Secondly, individuals 
infected with smallpox

00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:18.818
displayed a characteristic rash,
making them easy to identify,

00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:20.676
even without a lab test.

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:22.899
The lack of such practical 
diagnostic tools

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:28.041
for diseases with non-specific symptoms,
or that have long incubation periods,

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:32.472
such as AIDS,
makes their eradication more difficult.

00:03:32.472 --> 00:03:35.490
Third, the availability 
of a smallpox vaccine

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.860
that provided immunity 
for five to ten years in a single dose

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.918
meant that there was 
an effective intervention

00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:44.971
to stop the virus from spreading.

00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:47.819
And finally, the initial success
of several countries

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.680
in eliminating the disease 
within their borders

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.575
served as a proof of principle
for its eradication worldwide.

00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:58.393
Today, the same criteria 
are applied to determine

00:03:58.393 --> 00:04:02.083
whether other diseases 
can be similarly eliminated.

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:05.880
And even though smallpox remains
the only success story thus far,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.957
several other pathogens 
may be next in line.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:12.784
Great progress has been made
towards eradicating guinea worm disease

00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:15.642
simply by use of water filters.

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:17.160
And vaccination for polio,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.976
which previously disabled hundreds
of thousands of people each year

00:04:20.976 --> 00:04:25.211
is estimated to have prevented 13 million
cases of paralysis,

00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:30.196
and 650,000 deaths since 1988.

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:34.538
With a 99% drop in infections
since the eradication effort began,

00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:36.676
one final push is all that is needed

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:41.246
to ensure that polio 
will never paralyze another child.

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:45.804
Disease eradication is one public health
effort that benefits all of humanity

00:04:45.804 --> 00:04:49.396
and challenges us to work together
as a global community.

00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:51.489
Beyond eliminating specific diseases,

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:55.115
eradication programs benefit 
local populations

00:04:55.115 --> 00:04:57.589
by improving health infrastructure.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.255
For example, Nigeria recently 
used facilities and personnel

00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:06.841
from their polio eradication program
to effectively control an ebola outbreak.

00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:09.705
Further more, globalization 
and international travel

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:13.203
means that even a single infection
anywhere in the world

00:05:13.203 --> 00:05:16.284
can potentially spread to other regions.

00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:20.101
By helping to protect others,
we help to protect ourselves.

00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:25.279
Disease eradication is the ultimate gift
we can give to everyone alive today,

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:28.296
as well as all future 
generations of humanity.
