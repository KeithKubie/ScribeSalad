00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.840
Small children sometimes behave in stunningly unfair and shocking ways.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.180
They scream at the person who is looking after them,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.960
angrily push away a bowl of animal pasta,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.820
throw away something you've just fetched for them,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.040
but we rarely feel personally agitated or wounded by their behavior.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.180
The reason is that we don't assign a negative motive to a small person.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.000
We reach around for benevolent interpretations.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.280
We probably think they're getting a bit tired,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.320
or perhaps their gums are sore,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920
or they're upset by the arrival of a younger sibling.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.920
This is the reverse of what tends to happen around our lovers,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.920
where we easily imagine deliberate slight stupidity and evil.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.000
But if we employ the infant model of interpretation,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.960
our first assumption about our partners would be quite different.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.780
Maybe they did that annoying or hurtful thing

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.440
because they didn't sleep well last night and are too exhausted to think straight.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.440
Maybe they've got a sore knee.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.220
Seen from such a point of view,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.040
adult behavior doesn't magically become nice or acceptable,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.040
but the level of offense is kept safely low.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.100
Being benevolent to one's partners in a child [way]

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.960
doesn't mean infantilizing them.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.440
This is no call to draw up a chart detailing when they're allowed screen time

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.120
or to award stars for getting dressed on their own.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.240
It means being charitable in translating the things they say in terms of their deeper meaning.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.080
"You're a bastard!" might actually mean "I feel under siege at work",

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.440
or "You just don't get it, do you?" might mean "I'm terrified and frustrated that I can't explain myself".

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.120
The partner's child theory insists that it's not a unique failing of one's partner to discover that they retain a childish dimension.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.000
It's a normal, inevitable feature of all adult existence.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Indeed, you're the same.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.960
That's why some of the moves we execute with relative ease around children

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.920
must forever continue to be relevant when we are dealing with another grownup.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.840
Of course, it's much harder being kind around another adult whose 'in a child' is on display than it is being with an actual child.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.200
That's because you can see how little and undeveloped a toddler or five year old is

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.080
and so, sympathy comes naturally

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:26.000
but we need to look beyond the adult surface of our partners and imagine the turmoil, disappointment, worry and sheer confusion

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.440
in people who outwardly appear strong and grownup

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.000
but aren't so much.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.060
We're so alive to the idea that it's patronizing to be thought of as younger than we are.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.380
We forget that it's also at times, the greatest privilege for someone to look beyond our adult self

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.340
in order to engage with and forgive

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.620
the disappointed, furious, inarticulate or wounded little person

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.620
who resides within.
