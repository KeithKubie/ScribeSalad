00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.940
AAH!

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.620
???: You thought my terror was over?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.460
You thought there was no more torture to confront?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.500
Well, you were wrong.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.080
NC: Low-fat Jesus, what is that?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.180
???: The time has come to finished what you started years ago.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480
NC: Why aren't I used to stuff like this already?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.420
Oh, God.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.080
*Sigh*

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.120
Roger: Hello.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.560
Something amiss?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.400
NC: No, security guard that I didn't even know worked here, except...

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.100
a mystery.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.920
Roger: Oh yeah?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.920
And what mystery is that?

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.780
NC: Well, the last time I reviewed a Scooby-Doo movie,
it nearly killed me.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.320
Creating a rift in the space-time continuum from an angel named Roger that I killed in a Christmas special years ago (links here).

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.420
Roger: Ahhh...

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.900
so there's only...one person who could be responsible for this...

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.160
NC: Yes.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.160
And I have no idea who that person is.
Roger: Seriously...?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.020
NC: But I know the wild, wacky,
mystery-solving group who can figure it out.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.180
Roger: Do they involve...hijinks?
NC: Of course.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.980
Roger: Goofy antics?
NC: Naturally.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.540
Roger: Crazy misadventures?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.860
NC: I feel these are all variations of the same thing, but yes!

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.080
Roger: And who might they be?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.920
*Click*

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.260
NC: Get me Gus, Lassie and Jules.
Roger: What?

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.400
~We know, we know~

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.300
~You thought it'd be Scooby-Doo~

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.900
~Don't go, we'll show~

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.440
~Us still doing the review~

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.060
~We love, the show~

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.580
~And the satires they do~

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.440
~Here's one, of them~

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.780
~And you have to admit it,
that we psyched you out in the end~

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.240
Shawn: So, what do you recommend, Jules? *Sigh*

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.480
Jules: I think reviewing the movie will help you led you to the culprit.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.520
Roger: But I'm right he-
Gus: I think we should get the hell out of heeeeere!

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.040
Shawn: God, I love the sound of your voice.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.260
What do you say you and me do an 8 year cock-tease,
on par with "The Office"?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.180
Jules: What do you say, you stop doing your aging Zack Braff impersonation?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.980
Lassie: Listen Spencer, you'd better get to doing this review,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.440
so I can go back to being a stick in the mud to your comedic antics.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.360
Shawn: Lassie, please, you're scaring my black sidekick.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.780
Gus: I'm not scared, Shawn!
Shawn: Will you get over here?!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.120
Roger: Eeexcuse me?
Shawn: Alright.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.520
I'll review this movie, but only if have callbacks to the 80's that people in their 20's and 30's would get.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.380
Gus: That doesn't sound familiar?
Shawn: No, we try to get the millennials too. Watch.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.740
Pokémon sucks. *Booing* Still got it. *More Booing*

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.140
You better go with 'em Gus, while I uphold the status quo.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.560
Gus: Alright, but I'm still scared. You know I always dance when I get scared.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.200
*Funky music*

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.560
Shawn: Wow. He went with THAT dance?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.780
Roger: Hey, look, um...this really isn't that hard of a mystery to solve.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.800
Y'know, the answer might be right in front of yo-
Wait how did you change your clothes so fast?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.880
NC: Well again, like Psych, costume changes are kind of like blinking around here.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.080
We probably stole even more from that show than The Mentalist. If that's possible...

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.340
Roger: Well...if you're looking for someone to blame for making you watch this movie, just know...

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.140
he's probably closer then you realiiiiiize!

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.940
NC: Don't you have a door to be in front of or something?

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.200
Roger: ¡Tu madre, pendejo!

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.500
NC: Some people never open their eyes.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.600
The film opens with a ray of hope,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.000
seeing how it was written by the director of Guardians of the Galaxy, James Gunn.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.060
But it's quickly dashed, when you see it was directed by Raja Gosnell.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.480
Which, as we all know,
is the human incarnation of the phrase "No refunds."

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.880
And yes, all the same actors came back for this.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.720
OK, you have no excuse. You know how bad the first film was!

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.920
Don't you know these movies are turning out fans like this?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.940
Fans: "Hi! We love you! We have you tattooed on our chest!"

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.840
Oh, Christ, more Buffy fans.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.540
Hey, stop eating that plug, Scooby Doo, you seem to have fans as well!

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.440
*barking*

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.080
If you'd like to see how this movie's making your kid DUMBER as he grows up,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.440
this movie comes complete
with a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.080
So, we see your kid WAS going to be a successful district attorney, but, after that joke-

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.520
Oh, he's an injury lawyer for Chippendale Pole Dancers!

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.420
But, at least this movie shut him up 
for an hour and a half!

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.220
Heather: "Heather Jasper-Howe, at the grand opening of the new Coolzonian Criminology Museum."

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.060
She did it.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.600
Yeah, your literal first guess is right.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.340
Alicia Silverstone playing a pretty reporter in a Scooby Doo movie, for seemingly NO reason at all.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.200
Who else could it possibly be?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.740
*cheering*

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.060
No no, don't try to cut to a fakeout. We know it's her!

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.720
Why else would she act in this career-ending final nail?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.840
She's not even holding the microphone up to the person she's interviewing!

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.600
I've never seen someone so DESPERATE to be found guilty in my life!

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.020
Roger: Everything OK? Any ideas coming to your head?

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.540
NC: Ugh, I'm fine, Tamara!

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.700
Daphne: "Guys, c'mon! Remember what I told you."
Shaggy: "Never pick your nose in public."

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.960
Scooby: "Roh?"
Daphne: "No, but that's good too."

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.660
Scooby: "Rimage is everything!"
Daphne: "Yes! Image is everything."

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.680
NC: Then why are you wearing a dress made out of Dino's pubic hair?

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.320
Fred: "Mystery Inc. is proud to donate the costumes of criminals we've unmasked."

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.500
NC: So, the team is opening an exhibit at the museum of all the costumes involved in the mysteries they solved.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.840
And give 'em some credit, they are ones from the actual cartoon, and they look pretty close.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.360
What isn't from the cartoon is Velma having an attraction to...a guy?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.180
OK, now I KNOW you've never seen the cartoon in your life!

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.320
I think it's pretty obvious that she's been playing for the other team since she was a little kid.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.640
~There's something 'bout the way thaaat...~

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.400
NC: Let's see, what year did this come out? 
Yeah, he's gonna trip.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.500
Patrick: "WHOA!!" *trips*

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.400
NC: 2004, when all comedies were made up of...5 jokes.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.520
Yeah, you just know how Seth Green got in this movie.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.400
Seth Green: Hey, can I cast all of you in Robot Chicken?

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.020
Linda Cardellini: Only if you'll suffer with us during Scooby Doo 2.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.880
Seth: Oh, trust me, I'm making a sketch on this!

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.500
Patrick: "...so maybe you'd wanna go together?
Like a date? With me?"

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.640
Velma: "I- me- I..I..I can't, Patrick... uh...
mystery is my mistress... I must heed her sweet call."

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.180
NC: Y'see, she didn't say boyfriend, she said mistress,
where are the hashtags on this one?!

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.140
But somebody interrupts their Castlevania exhibit to start trouble.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.860
Evil Masked Figure: "MYSTERY INCORPERATED!"

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.880
NC: I have come to spoil the Turtles' "Coming out of their Shell" Tour!

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.560
MF: "This is only the first rung on the ladder of your demise!"

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.040
NC: You know, this is why you never hire Destro to be a party clown.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.220
*screech*

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.140
NC: He manages to bring the pterodactyl to life
and it ends up stealing the costumes away.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.220
But it seems Scooby and Shaggy are blamed for letting him escape.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.900
Shaggy: "Y'know, Scoob?
We could act like real detectives!"

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.120
NC: Why don't you start by not having every face you
 make look like Egoraptor's trying to eat his own chin?

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.260
Scooby: *Trying to copy Shaggy's words in his own gibberish talking*

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.960
Shaggy: "We will be awesome detectives!"

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.060
NC: So Shaggy decides to solve the mystery himself...

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.500
..oh, I mean, Shaggy and SCOOBY decide to solve the mystery themselves.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.220
Sorry, it's SUCH a good effect I have to remind myself how much he's REALLY there!

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.420
I mean, you feel like you could just reach out and touch the pixels!

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.460
God, the CGI in this is terrible.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.140
Why can't we go back to practical effects,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.220
like when they go into a flashback showing the original pterodactyl suit-

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.780
Special effects are dead!

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.980
Daphne: Jacobo's cell mate was released from prison 2 months ago.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.440
Fred: "The Black Knight Ghost."

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.080
NC: So they go to the opening of their own credits,
again, a nice little homage.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.100
But who cares! These little kids have some killer insults.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.020
Kid 1: "Nice job last night..."
Both: "Losers!"

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.640
NC: That is some stellar kid writing right there!

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.960
God help you if they say something complementary followed by "Not"!

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.520
Daphne: "Quick! We need to think of a comeback..."

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.900
NC: To what? Babies learning how to talk have better insults than that.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.300
Daphne: "Hey! Shut up!"

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.460
Shaggy: "Good one!"

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.980
NC: No, really, compared to giving the thumbs down and saying "loser", that IS a good one!

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.100
But not as good as the joke I'm SURE you can't see coming.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.160
Shaggy: "He just said 'We'd pay the price'!"

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.980
Fred: "Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy. What could possibly happen by ringing the doorbell?"

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.880
NC: I'm... lost from the exploration of possibilities that can come from this.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.820
Maybe... world peace suddenly breaks out?
Or maybe a cure for all known diseases is discovered?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.060
Or, I dunno, maybe something bad happens?
All 5: *screaming*

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.380
NC: How's that scale for your kid coming, by the way?!

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.440
Oh, look at that! He was about to get into Harvard University,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.620
now he's working at a Walmart Subway, serving cow snot as meat!

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.560
Just be happy you didn't show him
 the movie with subtitles!

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.140
*screaming*

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.560
NC: Boy, for a guy who spent time in jail,
he has a pretty big budget for a mechanical dungeon.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.840
I guess working in prison
for 69 cents a day went a long way...

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.900
But Daphne uses her makeup to get them out.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.300
Daphne: "A little blush... a pore strip... and..."

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.660
Shaggy: "Alright Daph!"
Daphne: "I enjoy being a girl."

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.920
NC: A nearly 30, quarter-life-crisis surviving girl.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.780
Seriously, we should stop calling them "Meddling Kids",

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.240
and refer to them as "Meddling mortgage payers on the verge of opening a Roth IRA".

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.980
And their "mangy dog!" probably deceased by now.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.660
*creepy music*

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.060
So, while touring through Danny Elfman's house,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.820
they come across another monster 
costume that's come to life.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.500
*fighting sounds and grunts*

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.360
The star of Astaroth compels you.
The star of Astaroth compels you!

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.900
Daphne tries to fight it off, as Velma tries to deduce where it's weakness is.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.760
Wait, this is 2004! We've already used ONE of the five jokes that's used everywhere,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.380
surely, the second one must be...

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.020
( Crotch Shot )

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.640
Black Knight: "Right... in the round tables..."

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.500
NC: I hope you didn't want him to pass high school,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.000
because now he's drinking paint behind a Sherwin Williams!

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.640
Climb the ladder!

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.620
They get back home to find Seth Green is there,
waiting to ask a nervous Velma out on a date.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.880
So Daphne puts her in-
JINKIES H. CHRIST!

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.060
Ok, I'm gonna overlook the lesbian thing so that I can imagine for a moment that I can actually get that.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.760
DAMMIT! That always ruins everything!

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.460
So, while dressing like a sexy traffic cone
with the head of Sarah Palin,

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.700
Scooby and Shaggy sneak out to a bar
where all the old villains they uncovered hang out.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.180
Now, the curious thing about this idea is...
it's actually kinda funny!

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.400
In fact, I dare even say
the writing for this film is not...that bad.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.000
Some of these jokes are surprisingly kinda clever.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.640
Like the stretch Mystery Van,
or the fact that Scooby has a full name.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.940
TV Presenter: "Norville 'Shaggy' Rogers,
and Scoobert 'Scooby' Doo,"

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.980
NC: Even lines like this clearly show there's some intelligence.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.780
Velma: "I have always found a criminal's inclination to incorrectly use the anirothic pronoun in place of the relative..

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.580
...delightfully absurd."
Patrick: "Me too!"

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.180
NC: But here's the problem. The delivery on them is usually off.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.200
Take this for example. Shaggy needs an excuse for why him and Scooby need to separate,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.100
so he acts like Scooby has rabies.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.380
Shaggy: "Like, he's got rabies!"
Scooby: "Rooohhhh!"

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.920
Shaggy: "We're just gonna go outside to get some... uh... fresh air."

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.940
NC: Now that's a funny idea. Going to an extreme, when a simpler excuse would have been fine.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:29.100
But the directionless reactions, the bland shot layout, even cutting away too early... None of it is presented right.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.960
This could've gotten a laugh,
but now it comes off as awkward and confused.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.460
In fact, the film is so uncertain of where the humor is supposed to be focused on

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.060
that they try to overcompensate with WAY too many sound effects!

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.640
*wacky sound effects*

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.220
THAT'LL mask the fact that we have 
no idea what we're doing!

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.140
Look at this scene. Scooby and Shaggy are in disguise,
and a woman flirts with Scooby.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.900
He's supposed to flirt back and be funny,
but it just comes of as terrifying.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.080
Woman: "Hey, handsome!"
Scooby: "Rello, baby." *kissy-face*

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.220
That alone should get an R Rating!

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.600
Scooby: "Reylllo, baby." *kissy-face*

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.560
Ian Malcolm from "The Fly": "Ugh, that's disgusting."

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.780
*crashes*
Old Man Wickles: "Watch out, idiot!"

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.500
NC: Oh my God, I wonder who's behind THAT mask...
Oh, it's just Peter Boyle.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.420
Wickles: "Get outta this game, while you got a chance.
All of us here ain't nothing to admire."

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.520
NC: This is the place for the survivors of Pluto Nash.
Together, we are strong! Alone, we are suicidal.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.460
Wickles: "If I see those twerps...
I'd tear their eyes outta their skulls!"

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.060
*whimper*
"heheheh..."

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.000
NC: The face everybody makes
before they walk out of this movie.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.280
Y'know, it IS a Raja Gosnell film,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.600
shouldn't there be a dick-piercingly bad music number right about now?

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:45.280
*Royalty-free music playing over said 
dick-piercingly bad music number starts playing*

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.960
Well, this is exciting!

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.980
Ladies and gentlemen, making his first public appearance,

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.720
The Dog-Faced Hellspawn that has been in everybody's nightmares at some point!

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.440
You thought he was gone for good, but Raja Gosnell has brought him back to eat your dreams!

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.240
Congratulations, your kid forgot what the number 2 means!

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.060
But, apparently, somebody broke into the museum and stole the rest of the costumes.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.180
Kinda wish we got to see that,
instead of this soggy diarrhea...

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.400
Well, at least we know Silverstone didn't do it...

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.560
Heather: "It's my job to unmask those
who pretend to be who they're not..."

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:27.620
Masked Figure: "MYSTERY INCORPERATED!!!
Soon, Coolsville, will be mine!"

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.320
NC: Oh look! He just walked away,
having NO purpose to that scene whatsoever!

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.840
Except, oh, I don't know, trying to trick us into thinking SHE'S not the villain!

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.140
By God, how did they write SUCH a good mystery?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.840
?: So, Critic, you think you can watch this film without giving credit to the one who doomed you!?!

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.720
*gasp*

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.500
Gus: What happened?
Shawn: A ton...

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.940
Gus: Whoa! Somebody cut the rope up there
to make that drop on you!

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.980
Roger: Hey guys! Any obvious clues around here?

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.780
Shawn: Mmmmmmmm.....

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.400
I'm getting a feeling that there's something we should notice about our security guard...

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.420
Jules: What is it?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.260
Shawn: I'm feeling that he has...rope burns on his hand...

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.360
...appeared just after the accident.. mmmm...

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.880
...and... has a name tag that reads "Roger"...

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.260
Roger: Well...

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.100
Shawn: It looks like we figured out who's responsible for this awful crime...

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.280
Cary Elwes, Tim Curry, or William Shatner!

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.040
Gus: Let's figure out which of these awesome celebrity guest stars is behind all of this...

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.180
Lassie: Cuff 'em.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.880
Shawn and Gus: ~We do the happy dance, 
we do the happy dance~

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.720
Jules: Thank you for helping us solve 
this VERY complex mystery.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.940
Shawn and Gus: ~We do the happy dance, 
we do the happy dance~

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.140
Roger: DO YOU NEED TO LICK A 
FROG TO WORK HERE?!

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.340
NC: So, we see Green beating up a guy for information,

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.200
I guess trying to trick us AGAIN 
into thinking he might be the villain.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.160
CLEARLY not Silverstone, because... he walked away!
Eeh, chech- It's impossi- He walked away!

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.360
Patrick: "Gotta put on the tough guy act, otherwise these guys'll...

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.680
..or they'll eat me alive." *chuckles*

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.320
*back and forth Patrick and Shaggy/Scooby screaming*

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.040
NC: And Seth Green just cracked. It's okay. Every actor goes through that being on a Scooby Doo movie.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.520
Remember Boyle's cracking moment?
Boyle: "heheheh..."

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.960
NC: Just be lucky he wasn't around a car.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.300
Speaking of which, they follow Boyle to an abandoned lab,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.560
where they come across a bunch of various formulas.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.020
Shaggy: "Look at those weird letters, Scoob..."
Scooby: "Raggy?"

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.480
NC: Oh Christ. It's Winnie the Tentacle Porn!
Could things get any more perverted?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.700
*sexy music plays*

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.240
NC: I WANNA GO HOOOME!!

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.840
Congratulations movie, you gave Shaggy boobs!

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.780
Was...this your goal? To give Shaggy boobs?!

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.260
Was... that the whole reason for this film existing?

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.720
The only time the words "Shaggy" and "Boobs" should go together is in a British porno.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.520
And even then, with a restraining order against Raja Gosnell!

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.920
Oh look, he's Taz now...

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.760
Stupid.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.780
And... now he's a genius.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.100
Albert Einscoob: "Oh, I long for the blissful 
ignorance of my former self.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:32.080
Chasing cats, licking my own rear end,
eating my own vomit! Oh, those were wonderful times!"

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.200
NC: I think we just saw Gosnell working through
some personal stuff there...

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.420
The rest of the gang meets up,
and they see where the costumes are brought to life.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.180
AAAH! THE POSTER TO THE THING!

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.360
Shaggy: And I'm being calm!!

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.680
*slaps*
Shaggy: "I needed that."

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.620
*slaps again*
Shaggy: "I needed that too!"

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.060
*punches*
Shaggy: "YOU'RE PUSHIN' YOUR LUCK, SCOOB!"

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.000
NC: And I think that was Matthew Lillard cracking on the movie.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.340
Just imagine he's not talking about he dog,
he's talking about the whole film.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.820
Matthew: YOU'RE PUSHING YOUR LUCK, SCOOB!
NC: Pretty credible.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.940
They run away from the rejected Zelda henchmen
and try to escape,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.520
not realising that they've unleashed the monsters,
and the city blames them.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.280
Heather: Heather Jasper-Howe,
with an emergency update,

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.960
NC (HJH Impression): "Reporting live, from Zardos."

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.540
Heather: "A monster army has invaded Coolsville."

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.900
NC: Eh, to be fair, they look more realistic than 
the new Ghostbusters movie.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.440
So they go to their old clubhouse,
where they used to be kids,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.420
because...nobody will look for Mystery Inc.
at a place called "Mystery Inc."!

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.940
And they remember when they were all in high school...

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.640
...a mere 20 years ago.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.040
Fred: "It all seemed so easy back then."

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.160
Daphne: "We solved mysteries for the love of it,
not to prove anything to anyone."

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.300
NC: I think that is the literal definition to solving a mystery.
Proving things to everyone.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.260
No wonder you suck at what you do,
you don't even know what you do!

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.800
But the monsters find them and continue to chase them down.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.460
But luckily, they give 'em the slip.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.360
*cartoon bonk*

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.860
*You can hear a faint "Scooby Doo!" in the background*

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.400
Waaiit, that's not a baby!

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.180
I guess it's better than crashing into THIS billboard...

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.040
Pterry the Pterodactyl: Dude!

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.840
NC: They come across the Black Knight yet again, and even though Daphne defeated him before and knows exactly how to take him down,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.620
Fred decides to take him on!

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.380
Funny, because that weapon would've been very handy fighting the electricity monster.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.240
Well, now you're both screwed because Fred needed to make his dick feel a little bigger.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.220
Fred: Daph, you okay?
Daphne: Guess this is it, huh?

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.020
NC: No, this is laying on the ground for a few seconds while the monsters are far far away from you.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.820
There's... Nothing "this is it" about that at all.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.820
Scooby and Shaggy come across the pirate ghost,
who breathes fire.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.240
But it's okay, because Scooby farts!

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:06.600
AAAND your kid has eaten his own brain! Congratulations, your Redbox rental has taken a life!

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.160
You could've been been watching Dora's 
Enchanted Forest Adventures.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.140
YOU COULD'VE BEEN WATCHING DORA'S
 ENCHANTED FOREST ADVENTURES!

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:19.440
But, once again, they try to make it look like someone else is the bad guy.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.740
Velma: Stay away from me! I know who you are!

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.140
NC: But that gets resolved when he saves Velma's life.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.360
Thank God she has a shadowy skirt.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.180
Patrick: "You gotta trust me!"
Velma: "I only trust the facts!"

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.600
Velma: "And all the facts say that you're the Evil Masked Figure!"

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.400
Patrick: "What does your heart say?"

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.600
NC: That I have a better career with Disney than Warner Bros. at the point!

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.880
She's saved, but the gang has to face the real mastermind and the monsters in a final battle.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.980
I... Somehow doubt that would freeze oil.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.760
This movie about a talking dog has finally jumped the shark for me.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.640
He is allowed to give, I guess, a badass line.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.260
Masked Figure: "Who do you think you are?!"

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.280
Scooby: Scooby...

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:04.820
Scooby: Dooby...

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:05.960
Scooby: DOO!

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.500
NC: Mother-rucker!

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.920
So the monsters are all destroyed, and it's finally revealed who the mastermind is- No shit.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.660
Daphne: "Lucky for her, she had an assistant helping her along with her evil plans."

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.800
Daphne: "Ned."
Scooby: "Roh?"

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.660
NC: Who is Ned?!

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.340
Oh, the cameraman you almost never saw and was mentioned once, if even that?

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.660
Way to drop those seeds of knowledge, movie!

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.620
But wait, there's even more.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.580
*GASP* Wait, who's that?

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.480
The... pterodactyl guy who never got a line and they said was dead earlier?

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.520
Wow... Not only was that a horribly put-together mystery,

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.800
But you clearly don't know how to use your Tim Blake Nelsons!

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.900
Ned: "You were a dude this whole time?"
Jonathan: "Of course, dummkopf."

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.920
NC: *Snickers* Ok, maybe you know a little bit.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.620
Ned: "But we cuddled..."

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.620
NC: I touched your shaggy boobs!

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.080
But wait, just when you think it's over, they have a Marvel-style end-credits sequence.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.140
Scooby: "Game Boy Advance secret code!"

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.960
NC: EVEN YOUR END CREDITS SEQUENCE SUCKS!!

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.540
If you really wanted to do this right, you'd have Samuel L. Jackson in an eye patch go up to James Gunn and say:

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.500
"I'm here to talk about a proposition."

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.380
Because this is horrible! And the absolute worst thing about it is-

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.440
Shawn: Gus, Lassie, Jules, get in here!

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:41.220
Voice: I see you haven't found the mastermind 
who gave you the movie yet. 
Even though it's pretty friggin' obvious.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:48.080
It's almost like that movie, "Roger Rabbit". 
Or the location of the Jolly Roger.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.260
Because someone is obviously rogering you.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:59.600
*Repeats saying "Roger"* Write this down. 
*Resumes repeating*

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.880
That's all I have to say, please don't be stupid.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.780
Roger: Hi! Any news?
Gus: As a matter of fact, there is, officer!

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.240
Lassie: We know who's behind this ordeal.
Shawn: And that of course is...

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.000
...Jules.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.320
Sorry it had to be this way, my love.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.480
Gus: Let's end this by satirizing something that ties into the show's theme.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.420
Shawn: Let's tap in to the zany, mysterious antics of...

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.420
..."Class Act".

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.480
Roger: No goddamn it, no!

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:39.380
You did everything wrong! 
Everything! First you get the satire wrong, 
then you get the satire IN THE SATIRE wrong,

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:48.320
Then you do these awful impressions 
of one of USA's longest running series! 
For God's sake, your Tim Curry wasn't even white!!

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.640
Shawn: Are you indicating that there's a shortage of white actors in media?

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.720
Roger: Then you tried to solve this bullshit mystery that's so friggin' obvious, and you still get it wrong!

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.380
She's not the one who did it, it was me, Roger!
It was Roger all along!

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:08.000
*Repeats "Roger" over and over*

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.620
*Tired* I'm Roger! I'm the one...

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.120
*Deep breath* Roger.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.100
Shawn: Yeah, we know it was you, Roger.
But she's still the one who did it.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.020
Roger: What?!
Jules: Yeah, I'm definitely guilty.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:29.220
Roger: But... It can't be! I did eve-
Shawn: Ahh, you only think that you did.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:36.980
You see, I know that you laid the DVD there for me, but when I looked away, it was replaced by a slightly different version.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.780
The original, I then noticed, was snuck into Jules's pocket.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.220
My second clue, was a ton that fell on me. I'm sure you tried to drop it first, but Jules cut the rope before you did,

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.400
as I noticed her rope-cutting scissors
she tried kicking under the couch.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:58.880
And finally, when you said write down the name of the culprit,
she didn't write "Roger", she wrote "Jules".

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.660
Roger: But... What was the point of all this?

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.160
Shawn: Because I wanted to give something that the movie didn't: A good mystery.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.060
NC: Sure, Scooby-Doo is a show with silly and not the best-animated,

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.920
But one thing it always had was a good mystery for kids.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.660
It taught them deductive reasoning, problem solving skills, it was a show that made them smarter in every episode.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.220
That was the movie's ultimate failure.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.340
Sure the sets were nice, and there was an occasional funny scene the actors could pull off,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.200
But the effects were awful, the jokes fell flat,

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:39.800
and a multi-million dollar movie couldn't tell a better mystery than every episode of the shoestring-budget cartoon!

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.500
That's what makes it last through all these incarnations!

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:47.700
Not just the silly characters, but the fact that it's making you more observant without even knowing it!

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.700
As the best kind of teaching should be.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:55.040
So I figured, do what the movie was trying to do.
Tell a fake-out mystery that actually faked you out.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:03.200
Roger: Okay! Well, now that that's out there, it's time to explain why I did this and how I came back-

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.140
Lassie: Nah, neither "Scooby-Doo" nor "Psych"
 cared about the motivation.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.340
Gus: Yeah, it's there, but as more of a side note.
Roger: But it's so complex and interesting!

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.540
Shawn: No no no, just... Short and shallow's usually the way to go.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:17.900
Jules: Yes, and I would've gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you pesky kids! And that mangy dog.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.600
Scooby: Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.980
*Everyone but Roger and Jules laugh with canned audience laughter too*

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.480
Shawn: Now that's good satire!

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.280
Roger: What the flying FUUUUUU-?!

Doug: Hey, Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out, this week, we are doing "donatelife.net".

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:42.460
This is a not-for-profit alliance of national organizations and state teams across the US committed to increasing the numbers of donated organs.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:50.680
Over 121,000 people are waiting for an organ, and every 10 minutes, another person is added to the list.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.960
And sadly, so many of those people pass away before they're able to get the organs.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.380
It's honestly a much bigger problem than a lot of us probably assumed.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.980
This is an organization that not only helps those people, but also encourages others to donate.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:14.120
They develop and execute effective multimedia donor education programs, motivate the American public to register now as an organ donor,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:21.060
And assist Donate Life state teams and national partners and facilitating high-performing donor registries.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:30.000
In its 23 years of existence, the Donate Life community has grown donor designation to nearly 129 million registered.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.980
And that's in the United States alone.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.140
That's an amazing number, but we still need more.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:44.260
So check out their website, look at their YouTube videos, become an organ donor if you're not already, and see how many various ways you can help out.
