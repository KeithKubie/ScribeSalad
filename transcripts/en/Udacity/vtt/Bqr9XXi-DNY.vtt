Okay, so I would probably put the field, put a field here on attendees

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.800
and call it Festival. Because, it seems like for, you know, any given

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.440
attendee, they're probably going to go to a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.710
festival, but any one festival's going to have

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.030
a ton of attendees and I don't want to end like a million fields.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.630
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.180
&gt;&gt; Cool.
