00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
Hi I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History and today we're going to talk about one of the worst relationships in American history.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.580
No Thought Bubble, not my college girlfriend and me.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.460
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Your relationship with your high school girlfriend?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.940
Oh Me From The Past, you and I both know that
I didn't have a high school girlfriend.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.900
No, I'm talking about the relationship between
Native Americans and English Settlers.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:28.860
[Theme Music]

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.480
So as you'll no doubt remember from last week, the first English settlers came to the Chesapeake area – now Virginia – in 1607.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.500
The land the English found was, of course, already inhabited by Indian tribes unified under the leadership of Chief Wahunsenacawh, and I will remind you that mispronouncing things is my thing!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.440
The English called this Chief Powhatan because, of course, mispronouncing things was also their thing.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.080
Powhatan was actually his title and the name of his tribe, but to say that the English lacked cultural sensitivity would be an understatement.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.800
So Powhatan didn't get to be leader of over 30 tribes by being a dummy and he quickly realized that:

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.071
1. The English were pretty clueless, when it
came to not dying of starvation, and

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.060
2. They were useful – because they had guns.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.880
So he decided to help them and the English
were indeed grateful.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.360
In fact, colony leader John Smith went so far as to order the colonists to stop stealing food from the Indians.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.620
Aaauugh, in the book business this is known
as foreshadowing.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:27.680
So as previously noted, relationships, whether between individuals or collectives, tend to go well when they are mutually beneficial, and for a while, both the English and the Indians were better off for these interactions.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.240
I mean, you know, post-smallpox.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.020
The Virginia Company existed to make money, and since the Chesapeake lacked gold or silver, making money required trade.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.940
OK, let's go to the Thought Bubble:

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:46.899
We tend to think of trade between Europeans and Natives as being a one-way exchange, like savvy, exploitative Europeans tricking primitive, pure, indigenous people into unfair deals.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.999
But that isn't quite accurate.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.240
Both sides traded goods that they had in surplus
for those they did not.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:04.840
The English were happy to give up iron utensils, tools, guns, woven cloth in exchange for furs and, especially in the early days, food, which the Indians could easily part with because they had plenty.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.740
Soon, though, there were problems.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.840
In order to keep up trade relations, Indian men devoted more time to hunting and less to agriculture which upset traditional gender balance in their society.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.700
And European ideas about land use started to overcome traditional Indian ways of life, and that led to conflict.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:31.000
The English liked to fence in some of their land, which kept the Indians off it, and also the English let their pigs and cattle roam freely and the animals would eat Natives' crops.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.660
And as Europeans' appetite for furs grew, Indian tribes began to fight with each other over access to the best hunting grounds, leading to inter-tribal warfare, which suddenly included guns.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.660
But this was still a relatively calm time.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:53.520
Yes, at one point John Smith was captured by the Indians and had to be "saved" by Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas, but this was probably all a ritual planned by Powhatan to demonstrate his dominance over the English.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:02.220
Pocahontas never married John Smith by the way, but she was kidnapped by the English and held for ransom in 1613, and she did eventually marry another Englishman, John Rolfe.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.200
She converted to Christianity and went to England, where she became a sensation and died of disease.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.020
Stupid disease always deciding the course
of human history.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:22.100
Anyway, despite not marrying Pocahontas, John Smith is still important to this story because when he left Virginia for England after being injured in a gunpowder explosion, things between the Native Americans and the English immediately began to deteriorate.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.100
How?

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.220
Well, the English went back to stealing Indians' crops and also began stealing their lives via massacres.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.940
Thanks, Thought Bubble – man, you guys sure
know how to end on a downer.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.300
Although to be fair, there are not a lot of
uppers in this story.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:43.040
So after a period of peace following Pocahontas' marriage to John Rolfe in 1614, dramatized here, things finally came to a head in 1622, when Chief Opechancanough led a rebellion against the English.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.060
It had become abundantly clear that more and more English were going to show up and they weren't just there to trade.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.760
They wanted to take Indian land.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.320
But the English struck back, as empires will,
and the uprising of 1622 ultimately failed.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.780
And after another failed uprising in 1644, the 2,000 remaining Native Americans were forced to sign a treaty that consigned them to reservations in the West.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.440
Well, the west of Virginia, at least.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.640
But the 1622 uprising was the final nail in the coffin of the Virginia Company, which was a failure in every way.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:21.180
It never turned a profit, and despite sponsoring 6,000 colonists, by 1644 when Virginia became a royal colony, only 1,200 of those people were still alive, proving once again that governments are better at governing than corporations.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:32.800
Up in New England, you'll recall that the Pilgrims probably wouldn't have survived their first winter without help from the Native Americans, which of course led to the first Thanksgiving, and then centuries of mutually beneficial trade and generosity– just kidding.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.080
While some of the Puritans that settled in New England – notably Roger Williams – tried to treat the Indians fairly, in general it was very similar to what we saw in the Chesapeake.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.560
Settlers thought Native Americans could be replaced because they weren't "properly using the land."

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.360
Now John Winthrop, who you'll remember from last week, at least realized that it was better to buy land from Indians than just take it.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.360
But Puritan land purchases usually came with
strings attached.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.759
The main string being that the Native Americans
had to submit to English authority.

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.599
Now, the Puritans had a rather conflicted
view of the Indians.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.600
On the one hand, they saw natives as heathens in need of salvation, as evidenced by the Massachusetts seal, which features an Indian saying "Come over and help us."

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:16.620
On the other hand, they recognized that the Native American way of life – with its relative abundance and equality, especially when it came to women – might be tempting to some people, who might want to go native.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:26.960
This was such a concern that in 1642, the Massachusetts General Court prescribed a sentence of three years hard labor for anyone who left the colony and went to live with the indigenous people.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.620
There was even anti-Indian propaganda in the
form of books.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.920
Captivity narratives, in which Europeans recounted their desire to return to Christian society after living with the Indians, were quite popular.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:45.080
Even though some, like the famous Sovereignty and Goodness of God by Mary Rowlandson, did admit that the Indians often treated their European captives quite well.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:53.240
New England's native population lacked an overarching leader like Powhatan, but by 1637, the inevitable conflict between the English and the Indians did happen.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.800
It was called the Pequot War.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:08.340
After some Pequots killed an English fur trader, soldiers from Massachusetts, the newly-formed colony of Connecticut, and some Narragansett Indians, who saw an opportunity to gain an upper hand over the Pequots, attacked a Pequot village at Mystic, burning it and massacring over 500 people.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.080
The war continued for a few months after this, but to call it a war is, in a way, to give it too much credit.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.740
The Indians were over-matched from the beginning, and by the end, almost all of them had been massacred or sold into slavery in the Caribbean.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.960
The War opened up the Connecticut River to
further settlement.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.360
It also showed that Native Americans were going to have a tough time resisting, because they were outnumbered and they had inferior weapons.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:35.100
But the brutality of the massacre in Mystic shocked even some Puritans, like William Bradford, who wrote, "It was a fearful sight to see them frying in the fire."

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.400
But despite the odds, New England natives
continued to resist the English.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.940
In 1675, Native Americans launched their biggest attack on New England colonists in what would come to be known as King Philip's War.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.160
It was led by a Wampanoag chief named Metacom, which was why it is also sometimes called Metacom's War.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.480
The English called Metacom "King Philip" due
to their fantastic cultural sensitivity.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.120
The conflict was marked by brutality on both sides and it nearly ended English settlements in the northeast.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.200
The fighting itself lasted 2 years.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.240
Indians attacked half of the 90 towns the English had founded, and 12 of those towns were destroyed.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.759
About 1,000 of the 52,000 Europeans and 3,000
of the 20,000 Indians involved died in the War.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.380
As I mentioned before, the War was particularly
brutal.

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:18.129
The Battle of the Great Swamp was really just
a massacre of Indians by the English.

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:26.009
And when King Philip was finally killed, ending the War, his decapitated head was placed on a stake in the Plymouth town square, where it remained for decades.

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:27.200
And on the other side?

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.800
Well, to quote Nathaniel Saltonstall, who
lived through the war,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.880
"The heathen rarely [gave] quarter to those that they take, but if they were women, they first forced them to satisfy their filthy lusts and then murdered them."

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.640
Saltonstall went on to describe a particularly brutal way that natives would kill colonists' cows:

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.460
by cutting "their bellies and letting them go several days trailing their guts after them."

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.580
That indigenous people would reserve such brutality for livestock says something really important about this war.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:08:01.740
The Indians correctly saw European colonization as a threat to their way of life, and that included the animals who trampled Indians' land and whose grazing patterns required the English to take more and more territory.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.640
Some of the stories told about Native American brutality also suggest the symbolic nature of this war.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.100
Like, one English colonist was disemboweled
and had a Bible stuck in his body cavity.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:16.980
Supposedly, the natives who buried him explained, "You English, since you came into this country have grown exceedingly above the ground.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.740
Let us see how well you grow when planted
into the ground."

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.640
But it wasn't just the Indians who felt their
way of life being threatened.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:27.590
It's time for this week's Mystery Document!

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.840
The rules here are simple.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.760
I read the Mystery Document.
I try to guess its author.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.200
If I'm right, I don't get shocked with the
shock pen. If I'm wrong, I do.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.800
"The righteous god hath heightened our calamity and given commission to the barbarous heathen to rise up against us

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:53.540
and to become a smart rod and a severe scourge to us in burning and depopulating several hopeful plantations, murdering many of our people of all sorts and seeming as it were to cast us off

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.520
hereby speaking aloud to us to search and
try out our ways and turn again unto the Lord

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.240
our God from whom we have departed with a
great backsliding."

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.560
OK, I don't know this one, so I'm going
to have to piece it together.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.640
Uh, we have a plural narrator, that's important.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.060
Seemingly monotheistic, feels like the heathens
in this context – likely the Native Americans

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.540
– have been sent as a scourge [scorge], or scourge [scurge], as it is apparently properly pronounced.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.380
What, I'm from Alabama, I don't know how to
say a ton of words.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.740
I mean, I just recently learned that you don't check your Ya-HOO! mail, you check your YA-hoo! mail, and Yahoo!'s over already!

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:34.140
All right so plural narrator, scourge, great backsliding uhh Stan, you're going to get to shock me this time, who is it? [Buzzing Sound]

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.460
The Laws of War passed by the General Court of Massachusetts in 1675. Are you kidding?

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.820
From now on, the Mystery Document must always
be written by a single human person!

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.600
I hate this. I hate this so much.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.080
It's worse now, because I've had it before,
so I know it's gonna – GAHHHHHH!!!

00:09:49.080 --> 00:10:00.600
This shows us the way the Puritans understand the world, but it also show us that within 50 years of its founding, Puritans already felt that the mission of their colony – to be a great Christian community – was already kind of a failure.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.280
If they'd been as righteous as they were supposed to be, God wouldn't have sent the Indians to burn their homes and kill them.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.500
So it's important to understand that this was a war to preserve a way of life for both the Indians and the English.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:16.160
And that brings us to another question: What's the point of even telling these bloody stories about massacres and atrocities.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:24.740
One point is to remind ourselves that much of what we learn about American history, like all history, has been cleaned up to conform to our mythological view of ourselves.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:34.720
Native Americans have been so successfully marginalized, both geographically and metaphorically, that it's easy to either forget about them or else to view them merely as people to be pitied or reviled.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:44.220
But it's important to know the ways that they resisted colonization, because it reminds us that Native Americans were people who acted in history, not just people who were acted upon by it.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:51.940
And it also reminds us that the history of Indigenous people on this land mass isn't separate from American history; it's an essential part of it.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.820
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next week.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:02.160
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller, our script supervisor is Meredith Danko, the associate producer is Danica Johnson, and the show is written by my high school history teacher, Raoul Meyer and myself.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.080
Our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.360
If you have questions about today's video,
please ask them in comments.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.910
They will be answered by our team of crack
historians.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:14.560
By the way, our team of crack historians is a team of excellent historians, not a team of historians who study crack cocaine.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.620
Thanks for watching. As we say in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome.
