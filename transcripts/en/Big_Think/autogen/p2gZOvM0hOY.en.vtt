down 40 that's fine too
 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.039
down 40 that's fine too
and try to make the questions be about

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049

questions are where we can really start

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360
questions are where we can really start
 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.920
questions are where we can really start
to explore how we know what's true how

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930
to explore how we know what's true how
 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.450
to explore how we know what's true how
we make claims of truth so this is this

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460
we make claims of truth so this is this
 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.879
we make claims of truth so this is this
is the basis of epistemology how is it

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889
is the basis of epistemology how is it
 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.920
is the basis of epistemology how is it
that we make claims of truth and how

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930
that we make claims of truth and how
 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.719
that we make claims of truth and how
would we begin to know if what we think

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729
would we begin to know if what we think
 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.300
would we begin to know if what we think
is true is actually true and so this

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310
is true is actually true and so this
 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.920
is true is actually true and so this
this is the beginning of the scientific

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930
this is the beginning of the scientific
 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.800
this is the beginning of the scientific
method this is let us begin with a begin

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810
method this is let us begin with a begin
 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.409

with observation pose a question figure

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419
with observation pose a question figure
 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.890
with observation pose a question figure
out what the hypothesis would be that

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900
out what the hypothesis would be that
 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.530
out what the hypothesis would be that
would answer a particular question and

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540
would answer a particular question and
 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.879
would answer a particular question and
then figure out how we would begin to

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889
then figure out how we would begin to
 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.930
then figure out how we would begin to
address the hypothesis that is a

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940
address the hypothesis that is a
 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.990
address the hypothesis that is a
scientific approach to two questions

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000
scientific approach to two questions
 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.719
scientific approach to two questions
that could just be they could be

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729
that could just be they could be
 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.110
that could just be they could be
addressed any number of ways and so I

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120
addressed any number of ways and so I
 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.930
addressed any number of ways and so I
have I have people spend an hour hour

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940
have I have people spend an hour hour
 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.730
have I have people spend an hour hour
and a half sometimes doing this in small

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740
and a half sometimes doing this in small
 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.100
and a half sometimes doing this in small
groups and then we share and then they

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110
groups and then we share and then they
 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.510
groups and then we share and then they
write these down in posters and then we

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520
write these down in posters and then we
 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.770
write these down in posters and then we
go around and talk about some of the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780
go around and talk about some of the
 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.529
go around and talk about some of the
best ones from each group and it's

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539
best ones from each group and it's
 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.840
best ones from each group and it's
amazing it is high-energy so in a class

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850
amazing it is high-energy so in a class
 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.110
amazing it is high-energy so in a class
of 25 or 50 and a group of 25 or 50

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120
of 25 or 50 and a group of 25 or 50
 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.490
of 25 or 50 and a group of 25 or 50
people it's too much really would be

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500
people it's too much really would be
 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.940
people it's too much really would be
better in a group of 10 or 15 probably

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950
better in a group of 10 or 15 probably
 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.990
better in a group of 10 or 15 probably
but still it would be higher energy

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000
but still it would be higher energy
 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.680
but still it would be higher energy
because everyone is vested everyone has

almost always have an answer they think
is right whether or not they have any
