00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is 24.1% up here and 16.3% here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This means that our angular error, this 1.4 degrees

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
can introduce an error in our calculations,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
can skew our calculation by as much as 24%.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Going the other way, it would only skew our error by 16%.
