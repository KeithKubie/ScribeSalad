00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
On this problem, we will look at a small onion network.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have a network with five nodes--R1 through R5--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
where each node has a public and private key.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The question is, if Alice wants to send a message to Bob through our onion network,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
what message will she send to R1 to reach Bob?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The notation here is the notation that we've used throughout the rest of the course where

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
KUB is the public key of Bob and this message is encrypted then using the public key of Bob.
