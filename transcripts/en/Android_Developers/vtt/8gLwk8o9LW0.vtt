00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.240
Hello, I'm Brett Lider, the
Design Lead for Android Wear

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.590
and welcome to the Android Wear
2.0 Developer Preview Tour.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.980
Let's talk about
Android Wear 2.0.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.990
So, as always, Android
Wear starts you out

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.560
on the watch face.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.650
Here I've got a watch
face that's very 1.0.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.340
It's beautiful,
but it doesn't have

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.420
a lot of information and action
on it to help me with my day.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.590
So I'm going to swipe from left
to right on the watch face.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.930
And what that does is
zooms out on the watch face

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.940
and actually helps me
select my next watch

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.690
face, Elements Analog.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.430
Elements Analog is
a watch face that we

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.270
built to demonstrate
the capabilities

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.680
of the complication's API.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.860
I've already customized it with
a set of things that help me.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.910
So let's dig into this.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.000
Maybe I want to change
one of these complications

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.210
from calories to tracking how
much water I've had to drink.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.770
So I just swipe left or
right to zoom out a bit.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.110
I tap on the gear icon.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.440
I tap on the Complications,
the left one,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000
and we've worked with Lifesum,
a third party partner,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.680
to have them be a data
provider for these two things.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.380
So I'm going to switch over
to water as the complication.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.017
And, boom, I've just
changed from calories

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:16.600
to tracking how many
glasses of water,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.430
and it looks like I'm a little
behind on my water today.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.120
But I can just as easily
launch Strava, check out

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.900
what's going on in
my calendar, or see

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.400
what time it is in London.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.970
And each of these
complications is interactive,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.060
in that I can tap
to get more details

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.840
and launch into that app.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.820
Let's keep going.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.980
Let's go over to this next
watch face, Ranger by Zuhanden.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.300
And here, Ranger, which has a
completely different aesthetic,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.330
but its styling,
its complications

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.690
to match that aesthetic, yet
it's using the data providers.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.650
So it's got the time zone in
Boston, where my family lives.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.370
It's also got the
water tracker, and it's

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.540
got the day of the month.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.310
So we really think
that watch faces

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.800
should own the presentation
of their complications

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.800
to make those complications
fit in so nicely with the watch

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.310
face.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.759
So I've got Ranger here.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.610
Let's see what else I might be
interested in for a watch face.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.010
So at the end of the
watch face Favorites,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.140
I've got a list of all
the watch faces that

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.830
are available on the device.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.060
And I'll pick
Elements Digital here,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.206
and now I've added that to my
Favorites, so I've got four.

00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:28.191
Mm, I don't need this
1.0-style watch face anymore.

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.440
So I'm going to get rid of it.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.590
So all I have to do is just
swipe it up, and it's gone.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.900
And now Elements Analog
is my watch face.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.940
So now that we've shown how to
select and discard watch faces,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.970
let's go check out another core
capability of Android Wear,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.890
which is how you get back.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.770
So here I might be deep in my
list of possible watch faces,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.390
and I decide none of these
quite resonate with me,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.530
so I want to go back.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.090
So I'll I have to do is hit
the Hardware button here once

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.840
to go back to the
list of Favorites,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.100
and then once more to go back
to my default watch face.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.550
So hitting the Hardware button
on the side of the device

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.440
is just how you get back,
and it's super fast.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.840
So up next, let's take a look at
what we call the Quick Settings

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.400
shade.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.290
So I'll have to do is pull down
from the top edge of the watch

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.290
face, and I've got
all the controls

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.910
that I might need to
access in a hurry,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.190
especially I want to
focus on brightness.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.300
So we've heard from
users that brightness

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.090
needed to be easier to access.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.180
And so here, that's
what we've done.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.130
So all you have to do
is tap up and down,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.470
and you get a live preview
of the brightness right

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.730
on top of your watch face.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.670
So now I'll hit the Back button
on the side of the watch once

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.610
and then a second time, and
I'm back on the watch face.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.950
Now that we've seen watch
faces and Quick Settings.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.980
Let's check out apps.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.300
So once I'm on the watch face
and the screen is fully on,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.560
all I have to do is
hit the Hardware button

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.040
on the side of the
watch and, boom,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.510
that launches the App Launcher.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.650
Let's try that again.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.660
So I'm on the watch face, and
I just hit the Hardware button

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.710
on the side.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.190
and I'm into the App Launcher.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.060
And so the App Launcher,
as you can tell,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.019
has this round-specific
layout for round watches,

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.329
and it's also going the
scroll bar on the side.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.220
So I can really quickly
and easily maybe even

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.170
fling down to the
app that I want.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.300
And once when I've found
that app, like Strava,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.440
I get zoomed into it.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.910
And so I can interact with
Strava here, go on a bike ride.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.910
And then when I'm done, I
hit the Hardware button,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.860
and I go back out
to the App Launcher,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.350
right where I was before.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.920
And if I leave the App Launcher,
hit the Hardware button

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.850
to go back to the watch
face, and, of course,

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.630
if I had the Hardware again to
go back into the App Launcher,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.820
here's Strava right at the
top of the App Launcher.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.670
So the apps that I use
the most are really

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.800
easy to get to in
the App Launcher.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.340
So let's go back out
to the watch face.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.360
And now let's check
out messaging.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.470
So messaging is something we've
spent a lot of time focusing on

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.170
with Android Wear 2.0 to
make a really, really good.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.930
So if my watch was
in Always On mode

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.750
and I received a
notification from a friend,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.080
that notification comes
up over my watch face

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.800
Always On mode and
shows for a few seconds

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.270
before it goes away,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.410
Then, when I wake
my watch back up,

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.930
that notification will come
and visit my watch face

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.480
for a few seconds
and then go away.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.560
So it doesn't cover
up my watch face,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.270
but I can see that I
got a notification.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.413
So when I'm ready,
I can scroll up

00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:52.288
and start interacting
with that notification.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.990
So here Krystal's
sent me a notification

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.830
during my demo-- awesome.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.690
So, yeah, I'll reply
to Krystal here,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.480
and I think I'll end up using
the keyboard because I want

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.190
to be pretty expressive
and specific,

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.460
but I'm already talking, so I
can't really speak my reply.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.810
So I'm using my
suggestions here,

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.750
which I would say are
indeed pretty good.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.110
And the demo seems to be going
pretty good so far as well.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.520
So I just approve
that and reply,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.200
and I can see that
my message has

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.910
been appended to
our conversation,

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.720
and my conversation's
been persisted.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.157
And Krystal's already
replied-- awesome.

00:06:33.157 --> 00:06:35.240
Well, I'm done with this
conversation with Krystal

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.730
for now, so I'll
hit the Back button,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.650
and I'll be taken
back to the stream.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.191
And I can scroll
down, and I see I've

00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:43.760
got a message from Alexandra,
and I've got some activity

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.780
from Google Fit.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.760
And, as you can see,
as I'm scrolling,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.880
I can see a scroll
bar in thumbnail

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.330
that lets me know exactly
where I am in the stream

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.120
and approximately how
many notifications I

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.280
have to deal with.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.430
So I'll hit the Hardware
button, go back up

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:06.040
to the top at my watch face,
and that concludes our tour.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.910
Thanks, everyone.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.826
Let us know what you
think about the developer

00:07:08.826 --> 00:07:11.750
preview of Android Wear 2.0.
