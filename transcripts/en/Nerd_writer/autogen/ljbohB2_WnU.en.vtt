00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.640
Okay, so what you're listening to right now is the relatively simple,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.960
deceptively bouncy beat to Rihanna's latest single 'Work'.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.160
This beat, which doesn't get much more complicated than this throughout the whole song ,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.180
has a light summery island vibe, which might be the reason why Rolling Stone

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.500
-- a  magazine that has been producing music journalism since 1967 --

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.180
twe  eted on its release:

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480
Now this caused a bit of a stir online because of course this song is not tropical house music,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.320
nor is it descendent from tropical house music.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.960
'Work' is a Dancehall song, a genre that has a rich tradition in Jamaican history.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.740
But a mistake like this is, I think, the perfect excuse to take a closer look

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.580
at  some of the recent trends in popular music.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.280
And we might as well start with this 
term, "tropical house",

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.320
coined sort of as a joke in 2014 by 22 year old Australian DJ Thomas Jack.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.260
Tropical house is a somewhat slower tempo house music

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.200
that often features pan flutes, marimbas, steel drums and other instruments

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.940
originating from the Caribbean or Africa to give the sound a more mellow tropical vibe.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.760
Thanks to Thomas Jack, who by the way is now pretty much over tropical house, and other producers like Kygo,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.000
this subgenre swept rapidly across the world and right into the heart of the commercialized mainstream

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.980
with mega hits like Felix Jaehn's remix of Omi's "Cheerleader".

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.300
And pretty much every hit of Justin Bieber's comeback tour.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.800
I think there's little doubt that these songs are surfing the tropical house wave.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.580
But even these mega hits it could be argued owe their sound to Dancehall.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.540
In fact, you could probably say that about the whole genre. Bieber's 'Sorry', the instrumental beat

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.880
of which is playing under my narration right now, is a perfect example.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.200
The Addictive drum pattern at the heart of this song

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.020
is called "dembow", which takes its name from the 1990 Shabba Ranks' song.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.040
Shabba Ranks was probably the most popular Dancehall artist of the 90s

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.060
and one of the first to gain worldwide recognition.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.020
The producer of Bieber's 'Sorry', Skrillex, has a long history of bringing dancehall into his music

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.280
and would know Shabba Ranks as would his recent collaborator Diplo,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.720
who frequently cites the influence of dancehall in 
interviews.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.000
Indeed, another of Diplo's project, 'Major Lazer', is explicitly a Dancehall group.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.180
[Sound of tape being reversed]

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.200
[Forwaaard. March!]

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.040
For the uninitiated, Dancehall can trace its roots all the way back to the independence of Jamaica in 1962

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.260
after over three hundred years of British rule and the rise of Ska music.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.500
You can go even further back than that since ska is really just a combination of elements

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.980
already found in Jamaican Mento music and calypso music from Trinidad and Tobago

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.460
and both of these have their origins in 
West African tribal music.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.040
Ska takes these traditional rhythms and mixes them with the Jazz and Rhythm 'n Blues

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.440
that was popular in the United States at the time.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.600
Its emphasis on the second and fourth beats in the bar gave the music a jumpy feel.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.060
Great for dancing, which is one of the reasons it took off in Britain in the 1960s as well.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.260
But as the post-independence economic boom in 
Jamaica sagged under rising poverty and rising crime,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.100
Ska eventually slowed down and evolved into Reggae,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.680
a politically-motivated genre of music that would 
culminate in the global popularity of Bob Marley.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.680
['Stir It Up']

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.480
By the time Marley died in 1981, reggae was a worldwide phenomenon.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.640
But back in the cities of Jamaica, musicians began turning to more up-tempo sounds again.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.120
See, one of the crucial development of Jamaican music was the release of what's called "B-side" versions,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.020
which is basically the instrumental track of the song in question on the other side of the record.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.640
Jamaican DJs began singing and essentially rapping over these versions

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.820
and this is the precursor of American Hip-hop but it's also the origin of Dancehall.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.120
Using new technologies, producers dubbed and distorted popular 'riddims' for DJs to perform over.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.980
The same riddim can be used in dozens of songs and that brings us back to 'Work'.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.000
The instrumental to this song, for example, comes from the popular "Sail Away" riddim,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.020
recorded by Richie Stephens first in 1998.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.020
This riddim can also be heard in Beenie Man's 'Bad Man Nah Flee' from 1999

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.800
and Sean Paul's 'Fit and legit'.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.620
Trends in popular music are as fickle as the public is.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.380
Dancehall rose to international fame in the 90s, then faded.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.980
What's interesting to me now is that in 2016 Dancehall seems to be rising again,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.800
but the connection is less visible.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.360
Its signature can be heard encoded into songs that have dominated the music charts for the last year and a half.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.480
But of all these artists, Rihanna is maybe the best ambassador of this sound for an American audience.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.480
Since as a daughter of Barbados,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.660
she lives and breathes this Caribbean influence and the long history it calls into cultural memory.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.480
I have nothing against new genres of music, even something as short-lived

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.600
and perhaps mischaracterized as tropical house.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.160
But I also think that it's important to understand the lineage of popular music.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.580
It has to be said that there are few cultures in that lineage that loom larger than Jamaica.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.940
Its popularity and influence will remain durable, I think,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.540
as long as there are great artists willing to put those 'riddims' to...

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.040
Hey guys, thank you for watching, if you want to uhm, I mean look at this dance, this is some dancing right here.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.340
How could you not pledge a dollar to support this channel by clicking the link that's right on the screen

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.640
For a guy that would dance for you like that, look at that dancing! It's like, he's so white but, you know, he's trying.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.920
