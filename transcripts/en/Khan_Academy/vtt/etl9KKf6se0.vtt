00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:01.385
- [Voiceover] Let's get some practice

00:00:01.385 --> 00:00:03.080
solving some exponential equations,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.485
and we have one right over here.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:09.041
We have 26 to the 9x plus five power

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:10.681
equals one.

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:13.644
So, pause the video and
see if you can tell me

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:15.488
what x is going to be.

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:20.006
Well, the key here is to realize that 26

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:24.266
to the zeroth power, to the zeroth power

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.677
is equal to one.

00:00:26.217 --> 00:00:29.107
Anything to the zeroth power is going

00:00:29.107 --> 00:00:30.907
to be equal to one.

00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:32.822
Zero to the zeroth power we can discuss

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:34.505
at some other time, but anything other

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:39.195
than zero to the zeroth
power is going to be one.

00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:41.947
So, we just have to
say, well, 9x plus five

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.176
needs to be equal to zero.

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:48.083
9x plus five

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:51.143
needs to be equal to zero.

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.115
And this is pretty
straightforward to solve.

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.355
Subtract five from both sides.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:59.662
And we get 9x is equal to negative five.

00:00:59.662 --> 00:01:03.156
Divide both sides by nine,

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:07.324
and we are left with x is
equal to negative five.

00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:08.868
Let's do another one of these,

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.342
and let's make it a little bit more,

00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:12.362
a little bit more interesting.

00:01:12.362 --> 00:01:15.346
Let's say we have the exponential equation

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:20.346
two to the 3x plus five power

00:01:21.044 --> 00:01:24.314
is equal to 64

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:28.237
to the x minus seventh power.

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:30.461
Once again, pause the video,

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:33.943
and see if you can tell
me what x is going to be,

00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:38.390
or what x needs to be to satisfy
this exponential equation.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.811
All right, so you might, at first, say,

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.305
oh, wait a minute,
maybe 3x plus five needs

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:45.425
to be equal to x minus seven,
but that wouldn't work,

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.038
because these are two different bases.

00:01:47.038 --> 00:01:49.140
You have two to the 3x plus five power,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.879
and then you have 64 to the x minus seven.

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.619
So, the key here is to
express both of these

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.662
with the same base, and lucky for us,

00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:01.271
64 is a power of two, two to the,

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.780
let's see, two to the third is eight,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.123
so it's going to be two to the
third times two to the third.

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:09.280
Eight times eight is 64,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.379
so it's two to the sixth is equal to 64,

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.946
and you can verify that.

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:16.607
Take six twos and multiply them together,

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:17.918
you're going to get 64.

00:02:17.918 --> 00:02:19.346
This was just a little bit easier for me.

00:02:19.346 --> 00:02:22.063
Eight times eight, and
this is the same thing

00:02:22.063 --> 00:02:24.477
as two to the sixth power, is 64,

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.056
and I knew it was two to the sixth power

00:02:26.056 --> 00:02:27.519
because I just added the exponents

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.226
because I had the same base.

00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:31.884
All right, so I can rewrite 64.

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.521
Let me rewrite the whole thing.

00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:37.236
So, this is two to the 3x plus five power

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:40.498
is equal to, instead of writing 64,

00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:43.063
I'm going to write two to the sixth power,

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:46.001
two to the sixth power, and then that

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.798
to the x minus seventh power,

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:51.376
x minus seven power.

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:53.616
And to simplify this a little bit,

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:55.381
we just have to remind ourselves

00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:59.339
that, if I raise something to one power,

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.661
and then I raise that to another power,

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.936
this is the same thing as raising my base

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:05.573
to the product of these powers,

00:03:05.573 --> 00:03:07.361
a to the bc power.

00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:11.494
So, this equation I can rewrite as

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:16.494
two to the 3x plus five is equal to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.433
two to the, and I just multiply six

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:24.078
times x minus 7, so it's going

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:26.339
to be 6x,

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:30.629
6x minus six

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.509
times seven is 42.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.943
I'll just write the whole thing in yellow.

00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:40.354
So, 6x minus 42, I just multiplied the six

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:43.117
times the entire expression x minus 7.

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:44.696
And so now it's interesting.

00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:46.380
I have two to the 3x plus 5 power

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.140
has to be equal to two
to the 6x minus 42 power.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.903
So these need to be the same exponent.

00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:58.963
So, 3x plus five needs to
be equal to 6x minus 42.

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:00.762
So there we go.

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:03.073
It sets up a nice little
linear equation for us.

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:07.101
3x plus five is equal to 6x minus 42.

00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:10.437
Let's see, we could get all of our,

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:13.834
since, I'll put all my Xs
on the right hand side,

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:15.692
since I have more Xs on the right already,

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:19.012
so let me subtract 3x from both sides.

00:04:20.032 --> 00:04:22.715
And let me, I want to
get rid of this 42 here,

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:25.696
so let's add 42 to both sides,

00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:28.832
and we are going to be left with

00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:32.696
five plus 42 is 47,

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:35.936
is equal to, 47 is equal

00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:38.496
to 3x.

00:04:39.256 --> 00:04:42.081
Now we just divide both sides by three,

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:47.006
and we are left with x is
equal to 47 over three.

00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:52.722
X is equal to 47 over three.

00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.072
And we are done.
