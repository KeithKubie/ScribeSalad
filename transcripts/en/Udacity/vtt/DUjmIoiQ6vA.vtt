00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's now dive in and understand how to use this cryptic name maximum likelihood estimator.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The reason is because the estimation problem is given data, find the probability p

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which now a simple example was the probability of heads.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Given a fixed p we started in probability, what's the probability of the data.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So let's begin with the second and find a good solution for the first problem--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the estimation problem, and again I'm going to ask you a quiz.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Supposed my data looks like this--I want you now for the different values

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of p to calculate for me what's the probability of the data.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Remember this is exactly the problem we discussed earlier when

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we introduced probabilities of multiple independent events.
