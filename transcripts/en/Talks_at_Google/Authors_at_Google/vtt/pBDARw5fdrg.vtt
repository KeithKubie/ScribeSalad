TORRENCE BOONE: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.120
My name is Torrence Boone.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.490
I lead Google's agency business
across the Americas.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.912
Please join me in welcoming
Toni Morrison.

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:25.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.370
TONI MORRISON: Thank you.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.840
TORRENCE BOONE: Miss Morrison, I
think we'll dive right in to

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.390
your new work, "Home." And how
about you set the stage for us

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.430
in terms of the inspiration
behind the book, how you came

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.790
to bring it to all of us.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.470
TONI MORRISON: Sure.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:01:01.050
I was interested in taking the
skin or the scab off of our

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.555
view of the '50s in
this country.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.120
"I want my country
back," remember

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.940
that, in the campaign?

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.810
Back to where?

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.726
Back to the '50s.

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:23.930
The '50s were understood to be
Doris Day and "Leave it to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.670
Beaver," and everybody
was buying houses,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.020
and post-war money--

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.580
nice, comfortable,
American-dream stuff.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.350
And I didn't think so.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.270
And I thought, what was
underneath there was something

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.760
that was being silenced
or ignored.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.840
One was the Korean War, which
nobody ever talked about.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.210
It wasn't even called a war.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.460
It was called a police action.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.465
And we're still fighting
it, if you recall.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:52.480
There's somebody up there
with guns on one

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.350
side, guns on the other.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.760
And also there was an
overwhelming anti-Communism

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.250
McCarthy thing.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.110
That was there.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.220
It was very strong.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.699
And people lost their jobs.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.070
Some committed suicide because
of the pressure against

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.570
Communism, which I guess is what
the war was about anyway.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.280
North Korea was Communist
and was going to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.540
make South Korea Communist.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.780
Same thing with Vietnam.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.490
So it was a big anti-Communism
thing.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.050
The other thing was, there
was a lot of medical

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.255
experimentation on
helpless people--

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.680
prisoners, army people.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.480
I think we learned about it a
great deal when we learned how

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.650
LSD had been used on soldiers
during the Vietnam War to see

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.140
what effects it had.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.140
And then, of course, we learned
what effects it had.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.820
But there was a lot of
that even before--

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.170
prisoners and poor people
and children and so on.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.415
And experimentation, you may
not remember, but there was

00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:21.825
this scandal, in quotes, about
a black school, Tennessee, I

00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:25.310
think, anyway where
the men who had

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.580
syphilis were being treated--

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.370
treated, in quotes.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.890
Some of them were treated and
some of them were not.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.130
And they didn't treat them all
because they wanted to see

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.910
what the disease looked
like as it progressed.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.870
So that was one, but there
were lots of others.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.550
And particularly in
other countries.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.500
So I had some example of that in
"Home" with the girl who's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.030
working for a doctor who was
an inventor, as he puts it.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.530
So those were the main themes
that seemed to me to be going

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.600
on in the '50s.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.150
And I wanted to identify them
by the narrative, having him

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.770
go through these things so the
reader could get a fresh feel

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.620
of what it was really like in
the '50s, despite what your

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.010
grandmother says.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.040
TORRENCE BOONE: So Frank Money,
who's the protagonist

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.950
in "Home," is this incredibly
complex,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.540
vividly rendered character.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.820
What do you like
most about him?

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.794
What do you like least
about him?

00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:37.320
TONI MORRISON: You know,
I didn't like him.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.680
Really.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.970
I liked talking to him.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.770
You know, when he was talking
to me and telling me to shut

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.790
up, or I didn't know what I was
talking about, and so on--

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.410
that relationship.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.050
And he was all right, but
he wasn't one of those--

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.400
I tend not to really like
the major characters.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.870
I tend to like the little
ones, the little, minor

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.840
characters, like the woman in
the house where [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.250
was, who fed her, the maid--

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.360
I like her.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.290
And she seems complex
and real and lovely.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.870
The others are representative
of problems--

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.840
their problems, the problems.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.450
They're very complex.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.100
And they move from one area to
another, from weakness to

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.650
strength, from ignorance to
knowledge, from A to Z. So in

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.300
the process, I just want to do
them justice, whenever it is.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.720
They're not good or
bad or fun or not.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.890
So I don't really like them.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.640
But I don't mind being in their
company, because they're

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.510
really, really, really
very interesting.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.360
TORRENCE BOONE: So I pulled
out a few images, phrases,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.280
word constructions throughout
the novel that grab me.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.640
And I thought maybe we could do
a little free association,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.300
where I would read these to
you, and you could give me

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.040
your sense of how you came to
bring these words to us, why

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.100
you chose them, sort
of a window into

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.660
the creative process.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.296
So are you ready?

00:06:26.296 --> 00:06:27.546
TONI MORRISON: I am.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.680
TORRENCE BOONE: Maniac
moonlight, militant sunlight,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.820
the malevolent sun, sun's
violent rays.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.070
TONI MORRISON: Yeah.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.820
We think about the sunlight
as, ooh, it's daylight.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.350
Ooh, the sun.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.280
There's a big ball
of fire up there.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.690
And it's not going anywhere.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.210
And it can be very mean,
or it looks so.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:04.270
So I have to say, in addition to
that, I was trying to make

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.330
his going home, his
arrival and this

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.970
little village, wonderful.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.500
Because he hated it, he was
bored with it, and he couldn't

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.190
wait to get out of there.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.855
So now he's going back--
for a good

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.140
reason, to save his sister.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:27.070
But I withheld all the color
from the book until he gets

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.940
close to home.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.075
The first time he sees this
girl's yellow blouse.

00:07:32.075 --> 00:07:37.040
Then when he gets to home, he
says, I didn't know these

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.410
trees were this green.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.260
And what about the flowers--
everything is a flame.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.590
And that, you could tell it's a
raggedy little town, right?

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.430
But that makes the reader feel
the welcome, feel the

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:59.275
loveliness, the home
quality there.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:07.910
But some of the harsher aspects
of that trip was

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:14.980
militant, metal, and vicious
things that we take for

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.150
granted as lovely.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.020
The point of writing is to
take what's common and

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:29.210
estrange it, make it new again,
and to take what's

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.809
strange and familiarize it.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.900
It's a better experience when
language can do that.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.360
TORRENCE BOONE: The quiet seemed
to slither, then boom,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.826
its weight more theatrical
than noise.

00:08:47.826 --> 00:08:48.810
TONI MORRISON: Yes.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:54.690
It is more theatrical,
sometimes, than noise, if

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.580
you're at a certain mood.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.470
And the slither suggests the
threat of being alone and no

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.500
one's there, and you're
in trouble.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.150
And then all of a sudden, it's
like thunder, although you

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.340
don't hear it.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.920
It's just an emotional response
to being alone and

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.620
being afraid.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.380
TORRENCE BOONE: "The
Morrison Case."

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.460
TONI MORRISON: I think I put
the guy's name in there.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:30.620
There was a case, this woman
Lily worked in a theater in

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:37.690
Seattle in the '50s during the
heavy anti-Communist thing.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.940
So there were all sorts
of plays and

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.750
things that were banned.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.710
And this one almost
got on stage.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.790
It was called "The Morrison
Case." And I checked it with

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.680
Google to find out exactly.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.620
And I found the guy and the
play and everything.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.720
Because my editor was saying,
Toni, please, "The Morrison

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.310
Case?" And I said, well,
that's the name of it.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.330
But I had to go and really make
sure by giving him the

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.450
first name of the man who wrote
the play in the history

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.920
of how it was banned.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.890
Because they shut that whole
theater down in the book

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:25.430
because it was pro-Communist or
Socialist or whatever they

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.240
were mad at at the time.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.670
TORRENCE BOONE: Finally, in
reference to Lily-- and this

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.280
is one of my favorite
references.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.145
Frank is obsessed with the
backs of her knees.

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:45.820
TONI MORRISON: Well, you know,
when you write about physical

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:51.940
attraction, the attraction, and
somebody falling in love

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:57.190
or making love, it's just
so unrelentingly,

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.170
relentlessly boring.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.100
Because first of all, if it's
too graphic, [SNORES], you

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.790
just go to sleep.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.030
And besides, it's not my sex
is sexier than yours

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.612
because it's mine.

00:11:12.612 --> 00:11:16.640
So I assume yours is
sexier than mine.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.050
So why don't you do something
different, like associate it

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:27.580
with some feeling or--

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:35.710
when I wrote "The Beloved," I
had these guys watching Sethe

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.850
in a cornfield, making
love to this guy.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.000
They can't see her, but
they can see the

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.390
tops of the corn waving.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:50.030
And then the language goes on
about how slippery the hair,

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.590
and how the sound of the husk
when it's pulled down

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.580
off the corn cob.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.890
So it's all about corn.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.010
And I had a guy say, you know,
I'll never ever see corn the

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.520
same way again.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.270
And in this one,
the same thing.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.900
I know it's B&amp;B--

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.150
boobs and butts--

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.290
but so?

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.510
But I thought, for him,
particularly, there are other

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.650
parts of the male body and other
parts of the female body

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.680
that can pull out a separate,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.020
distinctive, peculiar affection.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.410
So when she reaches up to put
this stuff up, and he's

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.840
looking at her, he sees the
back of her knees, it

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.770
overwhelms him.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.160
Well, something.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.770
But I thought that was charming
because it was part

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.830
as the physique or the body
that nobody pays any

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.545
attention to ever.

00:12:57.545 --> 00:13:00.710
You're going to write
about that.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.720
I'll tell you the great thing--
and this will be the

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.680
end, because you didn't
ask me about this.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.930
This is a triumph--

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.060
for me.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.670
Nobody cares, but I do.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.200
Nobody remembers,
nobody cares.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.770
But I have a moment when he--

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.930
I don't know what he says.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.870
He starts saying, it wasn't just
the sexual relationship

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.720
that I was interested in.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.490
Anyway, he says, how
do I say this?

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.260
How do I, or you, say this
without either using profanity

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.280
or something?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:44.308
So I say, it wasn't just the
kingdom between her legs.

00:13:44.308 --> 00:13:45.558
Is that good?

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:53.990
If you think about it, the
kingdom between her legs--

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.120
what is kingdom?

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.480
Something you attack, mount,
riches, wealth--

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.880
and it's just a world
of stuff.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.700
So I was telling somebody about
that in a restaurant,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.910
this guy who writes.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.340
I said, isn't that wonderful?

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.590
And he said, eh.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.530
TORRENCE BOONE: So your work
takes on these big themes of

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:32.980
humanity, things like love and
class and race and politics,

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.950
identity, among many others.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.370
Share with us any conscious
commentary or insight you were

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.960
trying to shed on these
things with "Home."

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.300
TONI MORRISON: Well, "Home," I
think we mentioned it a little

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.300
bit earlier at lunch, I was
trying to write a book that,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:57.780
as I said, identified these
social aspects of the '50s.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.030
So I have this vet--

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.930
we called it shell shock.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:11.680
But the thing is, I never
say he's black.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.950
Now, that may sound
very simple.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.350
But I have to tell you, the
language is so loaded,

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.760
American English, that you
almost have to pry and

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.190
discover other ways
to say things.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.400
So it's an achievement.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.520
I didn't do it in
the beginning.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.940
I did it somewhat in "Paradise"
because I have a

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.601
bunch of women out there, and
I say, they shot the white

00:15:36.601 --> 00:15:42.180
girl first, and save the
bullets for the rest.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.770
So you go, who is
the white girl--

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:45.860
if you're interested.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.750
But I was able to carve language
so that it is not

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.450
important, not distinguished.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.850
And I don't describe any
of my characters.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.100
I mean, a little bit--

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.710
tall, short, man, woman.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.630
But nobody knows what
they look like.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.580
And the reason is deliberate.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:09.530
Because I want you to do that,
you to see them, imagine them,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.010
underscore them, the same way.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.540
And now I've gone off and
forgotten your question.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.660
TORRENCE BOONE: These big
themes of humanity--

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.120
TONI MORRISON: Oh, yeah.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.640
These big themes.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:19.940
TORRENCE BOONE: Love.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.850
TONI MORRISON: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.686
TORRENCE BOONE: Class,
race, politics.

00:16:24.686 --> 00:16:27.320
TONI MORRISON: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.420
Let's take love.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.290
OK, he finds a safe haven with
this girl in Seattle.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.710
But I didn't want the love--

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.190
there are all kinds of love.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.960
You understand that,
don't you?

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.760
There's national love of your
country, love of your God.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.800
It's not all sexual love.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.370
There's some other stuff.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.080
So I wanted a relationship
between a

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.330
brother and a sister.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.690
I wanted a relationship between
a man and a woman that

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.339
had no baggage--

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.950
mother, daughter, wife, it's
always about something else.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.569
But with a sister, I thought
even though that might be

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:18.300
difficult, it could be
equal, and so on.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.460
The opening lines of "Home"
are about his

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.190
looking at these horses.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.200
And he says, they were so
beautiful, so brutal, and they

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.090
stood like men.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.000
So it's about masculinity.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.780
It's about whatever that
definition is.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.650
He found one definition here,
another definition there.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:47.190
But the security, the pride,
the strength, the beauty,

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:54.260
really, of manhood is that love
that he encouraged and

00:17:54.260 --> 00:18:00.160
found when he went home and
took care of someone.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.230
He didn't have to--

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.970
I mean, it was his sister.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.207
But he had to go there, take
care of her, hold her in his

00:18:06.207 --> 00:18:10.080
arms, take her someplace, and
then stay away because the

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.460
women wouldn't let
him in the house.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.340
That kind of love--

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.670
in addition to the backs of
people's knees, there's this

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.550
other stuff.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.850
And politics is always there.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.610
You could see it in the
confrontation with the doctor

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.840
who was manipulating her.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.620
And the fact that in that little
town, they didn't have

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:41.100
any school or water in--

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.350
where are they, Georgia?

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.740
You ever see these
little places?

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.210
I went down to see one, where
my father was born.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.700
It's--

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.600
nothing.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.640
But anyway, you have to wait to
get fresh water or a water

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.730
pipe or something in some
of these places.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.820
Nevertheless, I wanted
it to be welcoming.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.340
And for him, it's
a safe place.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.210
And that's what home is.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.820
Nobody is out to get
you at home.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.550
It's a yearning always.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.350
I think that's why I was telling
a number of people

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.300
that the French, when they
translated the book, they

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.310
didn't have any word for home.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.560
The French don't.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.230
No, they have house.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.780
They have estate.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.130
They have all sorts of
things, but not home.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:39.890
And home is something very
peculiar for Americans.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.400
And there's a yearning in it,
something special, mystical,

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.375
hopeful, restful.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.490
So it's not even the place.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.630
But when one says home--

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.760
you hear it in songs
all the time--

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.200
it's something very special.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.360
It has nothing to do with
the way it looks.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.060
And that's what I was hoping
would be the feeling when he

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.710
arrived there, knowing that--

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.690
everybody doesn't like
you in your home.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:20.140
Some people really dislike
you in your home.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.240
But no one is going
to hurt you.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.540
And everybody is going
to help you, whether

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.370
they like you or not.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.830
And that's the safety,
the spiritual and

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.600
physical safety of home.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.310
TORRENCE BOONE: That's
fantastic.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:41.490
So shifting gears a little bit,
around the intersection

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.380
of creativity and technology--

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.350
because we're here at Google.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.400
TONI MORRISON: Oh, yes.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.660
TORRENCE BOONE: So I think
everyone would love to get a

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.460
sense of your character
sketch.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.100
If Google were to
be a character--

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.640
TONI MORRISON: A-ha!

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.530
TORRENCE BOONE: --what
would it look like?

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.340
what would it do?

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.090
TONI MORRISON: Well,
I'm not a luddite,

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.660
but I'm getting better.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.075
My son is not saying
anyone, well, Ma--

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.750
please!

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.920
Anyway, I think I know exactly
what Google looks like,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.820
character-wise.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:29.100
And it's like those big, metal,
clawy machines in

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.190
"Transformers." And they do
this, and they go this.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.765
And then when they're
threatened--

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.940
they turn into a little radio.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.630
Or in one case, they turn
into a little car.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.066
And then after you pass them
by, they come up again.

00:21:54.066 --> 00:21:56.070
I can't tell you how
I love that movie.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.945
Because--

00:21:57.945 --> 00:22:00.370
I think I was on an airplane
where one of them was going

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.956
clunk, clunk, clunk.

00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:07.160
And the stewardess went by, and
he turned into a little

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.960
radio that they don't even have
anymore, with little by.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.886
That's Google for me.

00:22:12.886 --> 00:22:16.210
It could be anything, anything
and everything.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.200
TORRENCE BOONE: And how has
technology informed your

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.360
creative process?

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.860
You talked about using Google.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.420
TONI MORRISON: It shortens
research enormously.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.940
Months of time that you would
normally spend in libraries or

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.780
just trying to read
books and--

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:42.426
but this way, it's really
shortened inquiry.

00:22:42.426 --> 00:22:45.398
I was telling them earlier
I was looking for--

00:22:45.398 --> 00:22:49.790
[SCRATCHING], oh, that's
me; sorry--

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:56.840
documentation about who could
not rent or buy property in

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.700
Seattle in the '50s.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.240
And I knew black people
couldn't, but I didn't have

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.150
any real examples.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:08.880
But via Google, I went through
stuff and found these lease

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.920
arrangements where they
said, no, Hebraic

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:18.870
or Afric, all these--

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:25.620
no Hebraic, Afric, Chinese-type
person could rent

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:31.120
or buy any property and couldn't
live there unless

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.810
they were working there.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.730
And that was on the lease.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.440
So when I had this character in
Home looking for a place to

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.140
say, she gets upset because she
can't buy this house, I

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.240
didn't want that to just
be some memory or

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.285
speculation on my part.

00:23:46.285 --> 00:23:49.460
So I would use, obviously,
Google and

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.770
anything for research.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.390
It's very important that way.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.870
And I think we were
talking also about

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:03.470
writing blogs and things.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:09.350
And I was saying, eh, I haven't
seen any good fiction

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.060
writing on blogs.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:19.070
But I have seen very, very good
prose in people who do

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.476
the really good sharp, smart.

00:24:23.476 --> 00:24:24.980
It surprised me a little bit.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.740
Because when I teach creative
writing, as I did for a long

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:37.980
time, at Princeton, I
always was annoyed--

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.810
when they would turn in their
stories, I could tell that

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.080
they had typed them
on a computer.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.010
I can feel it because
they say too much.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.570
And it looks so nice.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.840
It's sort of neat.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.880
Because they don't
write anymore.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.270
But I could always feel
that quality.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.630
And I thought that that would
pass over into fiction writing

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.950
in general.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.620
I don't know whether
it has or has not.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.050
I suspect it has not.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:15.890
As I see poetry sometimes on it,
which is a suggestion that

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.190
technology can aid--

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.405
it's the editing problem
that's--

00:25:21.405 --> 00:25:24.700
the writing is really
just editing.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:31.090
Not just, but almost all of it
is correcting, redirecting,

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:36.270
finding the right word, taking
it out, recasting, over and

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.330
over again until it's right.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:43.240
And it seems a little hard
on the computer.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.892
Because you're so happy with
what you're doing.

00:25:47.892 --> 00:25:50.910
I'll tell you one thing.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.660
You haven't asked me this, but
I'm a really, really, really

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.230
good expert typist.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.950
And now that I'm
sort of vaguely

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:03.120
emailing, I'm doing this--

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.246
these two fingers.

00:26:06.246 --> 00:26:08.100
And I thought, wait a minute.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.280
I know how to use all my
fingers all the time.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.265
So now I have to retrain my
muscle memory on the keyboard

00:26:16.265 --> 00:26:18.900
to know what's--

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.010
I lost it.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.070
I know, what do you use?

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.240
Thumbs, two fingers.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.870
I mean, I lost the whole
thing, and I

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.660
was so good at it.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:33.520
Anyway, technology will help
me in that way too.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.450
TORRENCE BOONE: And what about
the implications for the book

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.000
publishing?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.250
TONI MORRISON: No, that's
going to be great.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.750
Oh yeah, that whole thing
is going to be great.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.390
I mean, I know people say,
uh, the libraries,

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:44.910
what about the books?

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.160
What about the hardbacks?

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.085
It's like when the television
was supposed to

00:26:51.085 --> 00:26:54.236
ruin radio, it didn't.

00:26:54.236 --> 00:26:55.820
Well, I don't think it did.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:03.090
But anyway, this form, the vinyl
was going to be ruined

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.810
because of the 8-track.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:10.110
So I think, my personal feeling,
is that the more

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.950
access to books, the better.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:19.380
Really, I was involved with
some people who were doing

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.350
that instant printing
thing, Espresso, I

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.690
think they called it.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.910
Because they could take it to
Africa, and you could have one

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.940
copy, and the whole village
could read it.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.760
Because books in Africa
cost a month's salary.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.040
So this way it was easy.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:44.170
And access via the screens and
via ebooks, wherever they come

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.340
from, seem to me to
be a good thing.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.630
Now, you don't have to.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.960
I have read books on ebooks.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.890
There's certain books I can't.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.840
If they're really, really
complicated and really, really

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.560
interesting, I can't.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.670
Because I want to write all
over them and do stuff.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.000
They say, yeah, you
can do that.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.580
Yeah, well.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.220
But there are other books that
I do like very much to

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.310
read in that way.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:13.300
So I think it's an
improvement.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.660
TORRENCE BOONE: We're live
streaming this event.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.650
And even in the audience
here, I know we

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.760
have people who are--

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.890
TONI MORRISON: You're
live streaming this?

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.140
TORRENCE BOONE: Yes.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.746
Did we not tell you that?

00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:28.786
TONI MORRISON: I thought that
was later on with--

00:28:28.786 --> 00:28:30.250
TORRENCE BOONE: Well, we're
going to do that as well.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.980
TONI MORRISON: You heard
me say all that-- oh--

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.470
about corn and stuff.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.434
Oh!

00:28:43.434 --> 00:28:51.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:57.010
TORRENCE BOONE: So there are
many writers and aspiring

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:01.040
writers who are listening in,
and even in the audience.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.940
And I know this is a question
that you weren't fond of, but

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.610
you had such an amazing way of
answering it informally when

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.120
we were having lunch, so I'm
going to ask you anyway.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.280
And that is, what advice would
you give to aspiring writers

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.550
who want to accomplish even
a fraction of what you've

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.200
accomplished?

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.100
TONI MORRISON: Well my shorter
answer that I gave him was,

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:30.980
you write the, and then
see what happens.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.230
If that doesn't work--

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:40.120
I tell my students, they're
young, like many of you.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.180
And I say, look, I don't
want to hear

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.430
about your little lives.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.310
I'm not interested.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.560
Besides, you don't
know nothing.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.110
You have a boyfriend.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.180
Your grandmother did this.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.200
Your mother--

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.102
ah!

00:30:01.102 --> 00:30:03.070
No.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.215
I want you to imagine something
way out of the box.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.730
And I taught a course
twice about this.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:21.080
First, I told them, we're going
to write about slavery--

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.260
you are.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.210
Not American slavery.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:29.260
I'm talking about all kinds
of slavery, all kinds.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:38.570
So a girl came up with eunuchs,
what happens to them,

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:42.460
and how they are enslaved, and
how they have to have their

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:48.290
genitals in a box that must
accompany them when they die.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:53.910
One wrote about the Turks and
whoever they were fighting,

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.620
the Moors, or something.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.800
One person wrote about
American slavery.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.730
Other people wrote about
all different kinds--

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:02.980
and with characters.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.930
And I said, after you write
this, I'm going to have

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.790
somebody from the art department
come in and tell

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:18.090
you how to draw or paint
or something.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:22.560
Because we're going to have an
exhibition, and the person who

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.820
does the art is going to
be not you but the

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.090
character you invented.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.810
And that happened.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:34.100
I mean, the ones who were good
painters wrote stupid stories

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.320
but painted beautifully.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.380
And the ones that couldn't draw
a straight line wrote

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.970
great stories, and they're like,
this is a dumb painting.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.340
But anyway, they were two art
forms that we put together.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:48.770
We had the thing, and I did
that a couple of times.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:56.800
But the point was, the second
time, a girl wrote about a

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:02.730
woman in Texas who was a
waitress, but who couldn't

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.990
speak English.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.280
Actually, it was when she
was a dishwasher,

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.830
trying to be a waitress.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.540
But she had to learn English.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.300
And she used the menu and those
little doilies around in

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.980
order to write, and so on.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.290
It was really interesting.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:21.260
Somebody else did a thing
about a woman who was an

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.055
ancient mistress of
somebody in Paris.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.420
So the point of all of this
was, step outside.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.970
You don't know anything about
this little girl in Texas, so

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.290
create her.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.700
Really create something.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.980
Don't go back and say, well,
when I was in high school,

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.250
there was this guy.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.720
Yeah.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:54.310
So that was really the most
successful thrust of teaching

00:32:54.310 --> 00:33:01.760
creative writing after all these
many, many years of just

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.590
editing, is what I was
doing, mostly.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:07.290
They turn in something, and I
make it better, or suggest

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.550
they make it better.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.820
Then I stopped that and began
to tell them, do this.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.410
That was part of the Atelier
we were talking.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.960
TORRENCE BOONE: At
Princeton, yes.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.470
Say more about that, because
that was a new collaborative

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.820
model that you built.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:27.440
TONI MORRISON: Well, about 20
years ago, in my 60s, in my

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.290
young 60s, I was going to
retire from Princeton.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.860
And they said, oh, no, no, no.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:37.110
And I was trying to say, if I
stay here, what would I really

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.740
like to do?

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:41.500
I don't want to do
this anymore.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:47.440
And so I thought, none of us in
the arts department bring

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.860
our work to class.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:55.500
We do that at home, whether
we're writers or poets or

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.750
photographers or
theatre people.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.410
What we do in the class
is whatever the

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:03.540
students are doing.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:08.360
And we evaluate,
encourage that.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.040
And then they get
a pass or fail.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:18.520
And I thought, why don't I bring
artists in who do that

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.159
for a living?

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.480
It's not about pass or fail,
it's about confronting

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.520
somebody who is a professional
writer or a professional

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.610
lyricist or a professional
dancer, and let those people

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.780
work with the students
on a project.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.940
And it's not entirely equal,
but it's close.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.520
So American Ballet Theatre came,
the choreographer came.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.929
And he brought some of the
dancers from ABT and some of

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.179
the Princeton dancers--

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.605
who thought they were dancers,
or they used to be dancers.

00:34:56.605 --> 00:34:59.470
You know, the ABT girls
don't go to college.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.130
They just study dance.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.590
And the Princeton girls
go to college

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.690
and used to be dancers.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.720
So they were very, like-- ugh.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.560
But on stage, they could
not go en pointe.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.455
I mean, you have
to keep going.

00:35:15.455 --> 00:35:18.870
But the girls from ABT,
they were 18.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.500
But they were the ones who
could toe dance, as we

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.190
used to call it.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.850
And I brought--

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:27.500
Yo Yo Ma came, all sorts of
people came to work on

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.390
projects that were theirs.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:34.450
And the students helped
or changed.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.880
I had Richard Price came.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.260
He was doing a movie.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.070
And he had a horrible scene.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.206
I mean, it wasn't a
horrible scene.

00:35:40.206 --> 00:35:42.870
It was just long, long, long.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.710
And he couldn't fix it.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:49.660
So he brought it and asked
students to act it out for

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.370
him, so he could see what was
too much and what was not

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.270
enough, and so on.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.000
But it varied.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.530
And it's still going on
there, by the way.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:06.350
It was, for me, the most
exciting thing that I had done

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.850
in that area.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.540
Because I didn't want to
confine it to writing.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.200
I wanted it to be all
sorts of things.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:22.710
We bought sculptures and
painters from galleries.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:27.680
And I taught a course with
Gabriel Marquez.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.930
It was called Narrative.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:36.522
He spoke a little
bit of English.

00:36:36.522 --> 00:36:38.560
I spoke a very little
bit of Spanish.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.330
The only people who were fluent
in both languages were

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.870
the students.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.910
And we actually taught a
semester class, back and

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:56.731
forth, back and forth, about
how to construct narrative.

00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:58.400
It was beautiful.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.190
I was mostly quiet, but it was
a magnificent thing to see.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:07.200
They had the students there,
listening to someone--

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.580
and if you know Marquez's work,
there's nobody better at

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:16.320
constructing a complicated
structural novel than he is.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.520
TORRENCE BOONE: We're going to
open it up to questions.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.790
So if anyone in the audience has
questions, make your way

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:24.560
to the mikes.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.660
On this theme, inspiration,
where do you

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.570
get inspiration now?

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:38.350
Not only for your writing,
but life in general.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:43.104
TONI MORRISON: Life in general
is not so interesting anymore.

00:37:43.104 --> 00:37:43.890
[BLOWS NOSE]

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.860
Excuse me.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:50.490
Notice, I'm sick, but
I came anyway.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.730
TORRENCE BOONE: Thank you.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.810
TONI MORRISON: I'm
a little leery of

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.880
that inspiration stuff.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.130
I don't need it.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.020
I know what to do.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.830
And I know how to do it.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:10.270
And I don't like the world
when I'm not doing it.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.430
When I'm not writing, ugh!

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:18.000
And just aware of some good
stuff, but mostly not.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.370
The way people who have lived
as long as I have--

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.120
so that it's a little
problematic for me.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.780
But if I get an idea, like I
have in every book I've ever

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:33.180
written, some compelling idea
that has some kind of meaning,

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:39.400
and then I can pluck characters
who could explicate

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.940
that for me--

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.470
and then the whole world
is such a lovely place.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:47.530
I cannot begin to tell you
how fascinating and how

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:51.290
overwhelming and lovely
it is to be here.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.260
I can't tell you.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.310
I'd hate to leave.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.590
Yes?

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.030
AUDIENCE: I wanted to know some
of the artists' works of

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.950
art that you've read or are
reading currently or seen or

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.370
experiencing that's touching
you now and making

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:10.348
you glad to be here.

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:14.260
TONI MORRISON: Well, a lot
of music, I think.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:19.180
Which is interesting,
because I don't play

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.280
music when I'm writing.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.600
I don't ever use it as
background, like something--

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.040
I have to either listen to
it or not listen to it.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.670
But recently, particularly when
I get stuck, as I have

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:38.400
been recently, the music breaks
it open for me, the

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.878
kinds of music that I like.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:44.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.850
I had to write my question down
because I was so nervous

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:47.555
talking to you.

00:39:47.555 --> 00:39:49.210
TONI MORRISON: Oh, please.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.140
AUDIENCE: When I think of your
novels, I think of intricate

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.440
plots that are often
unpredictable, colors that

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.680
become characters, and prose
that often reads like poetry.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.770
For all of these reasons, when
a friend asked for a

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.140
recommendation just the other
day, I immediately recommended

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.580
both "Beloved" and the "The
Bluest Eye," as I had just

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.550
finished rereading
them myself.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.830
She said she doesn't like to
read your novels because of

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.620
the graphic violence
and rape scenes.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.410
And I didn't know how to
defend them to her.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:12.660
How would you respond?

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.218
TONI MORRISON: Tell
her to read Homer.

00:40:17.218 --> 00:40:24.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.650
TONI MORRISON: Speaking
of violence and rape.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.530
TORRENCE BOONE: Scott?

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:31.650
AUDIENCE: I have to admit--

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.280
I'm sure my mom's actually
really jealous.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.910
She's a high school educator,
and she loves teaching your

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.210
writing to her students.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:43.600
And I think she shared her love
of your words with me, so

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.220
thank you for the opportunity.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:52.780
I'm curious if you ever, in
newer novels or newer writing

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:58.440
or in between books, find times
where your characters

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.070
are either recycled into new
characters or interact with

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:06.290
new characters and how that
process, at least, probably is

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.860
up in your brain, and how
that feels and looks--

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.530
if that happens at
all, I suppose.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.335
TONI MORRISON: The strong ones
you have to get rid of fast.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:23.260
And I don't remember using
aspects of one character in

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.960
another character
in another book.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.910
I'm fearful because
in a sense--

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.660
writers say this, and
nobody knows what

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.790
they're talking about--

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.490
the characters talk to you.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.390
And you have to know
their names.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.190
They're like ghosts.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.040
And you have to introduce
yourself so they'll talk.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.340
And you get the right name.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.700
But they don't shut up.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.540
They're only interested
in themselves.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.900
And I have had characters that
I've just slammed the door.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.645
Like Pilate in--

00:41:56.645 --> 00:41:57.350
TORRENCE BOONE: "Song
of Solomon."

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.710
TONI MORRISON: "Song of
Solomon--" she was

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.340
eating up the book.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.440
So I had people talk
about her.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.785
And then every now and
then, there would be

00:42:04.785 --> 00:42:06.260
a scene with her.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:15.890
But not just to do that, because
as I was telling you

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:19.390
this morning, I don't really
like these characters, because

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.950
they just take over.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:25.115
And if you let them, you will
let what many authors do do,

00:42:25.115 --> 00:42:28.860
which is, you keep writing them
in the next book and the

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.920
next book--

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.300
different scenes, different
narratives, same character.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.910
And I don't mean just the
detective story-types.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:41.570
But you're still writing about
that same character?

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.980
Although now it's a 10-year-old
girl or a

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.670
50-year-old man, but it's still
the same character.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:52.450
And I just have to get rid
of it, slam it, because

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.770
otherwise, you're always back
there, always back there.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:00.100
For me, it's a big effort
to write brand new.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.980
Every time I sit down to write,
it's like I've never

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.620
written anything ever before.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.300
It's a brand new thing.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.180
Yes?

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:12.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.800
Ms. Morrison, do you think of
yourself as a female writer?

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.720
Is that something that you're
aware of, in terms of not only

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.930
what you're writing and your
responsibility to your sex,

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:28.170
but also in terms of how you're
received and how other

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:31.620
authors who are female
authors are received?

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:37.816
TONI MORRISON: Well, I have done
that, in the beginning--

00:43:37.816 --> 00:43:41.740
because I was in publishing
when I first wrote a book.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.580
So I made it very important
that I was a black female,

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.340
underscore, underscore.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.030
And they were trying to say--

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.840
I remember going to an event.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.100
And a friend of my doctor,
who I think it was, was

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.260
introducing me.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.130
He said, Toni Morrison
is wonderful.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.070
And she writes beautiful.

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.580
I don't think of her
as a black writer.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.450
I don't think of her
as a female writer.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:04.680
I think of her as--

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.130
and he paused--

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:07.570
and I said, a white
male writer?

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.730
So with all those definitions in
there, you don't know which

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.930
ones to push, and so on.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:23.600
Recently, as I talked to you
about withholding race, is to

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.560
try to be like a human
being writer type.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.270
But I do know that in
the books, I have

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:37.870
withdrawn white men.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.080
I never write about them.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.040
And the reason is not that
they're not there in the world

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.540
and important--

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.850
it's just that they
get in the way.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.640
Always the gays--

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.750
I just don't want that
so I can be free.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.090
Like in Desdemona, we were
saying earlier, that I wrote

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.730
this thing with Peter Sellers,
I said, I will only write it

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.530
if you take Iago out.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.910
If he's out of the play,
we can go forward.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.320
Because he just takes over the
play, talks all the time.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.980
Everybody lies to him or
misrepresents something.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.595
I'm sorry, that was
a simple question.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:20.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.090
So you talked a little bit about
teaching writing, which

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.590
has been really interesting.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:28.580
And I wanted to know how you
feel about this somewhat new

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:32.510
format we have these days called
the writing workshop,

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:37.550
where you submit a story and
the entire class critiques.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:38.900
TONI MORRISON: Oh.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.870
Yeah, that's what they do.

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.600
I mean, I used to do that at
Princeton, when I was telling

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.120
you about the things,
choosing--

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.390
it's a strange subject.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.740
They had to read in class.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.930
And everybody around them could
say horrible, nice,

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:56.810
wonderful, I love it, I hate
it, what about this.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.990
So they got that feedback
constantly.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.980
And they could either
do it or not do it.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:05.370
It's like having 15 editors
tell you what's wrong, or

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:10.340
what's beautiful, and me,
controlling it all.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.580
But that workshop thing was very
much part of the creative

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.550
writing classes that I
taught at Princeton.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:23.720
And it works, particularly with
new writers, and they're

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.180
not quite sure.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:30.320
And they need the comments and
critique of their peers.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.890
Yeah.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.920
How do you judge
your own work?

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.920
How do you know when it's
finished, when it's right?

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.140
And then how do you take
criticism after that?

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.996
TONI MORRISON: Well,
I always know.

00:46:46.996 --> 00:46:51.760
I always know when to stop.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.790
I've thought it out so carefully
from the beginning

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:56.370
to the end.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:00.410
I always know the end, how it's
shaped, what it means,

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:03.700
and all the themes
are in the end.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.120
The problem is getting there,
how to get there, what the

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.650
middle is like.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:15.040
And if I can find it that way,
then I know I'm finished, and

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.290
I know it's good.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.210
The couple of times I
have not done that,

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:21.590
in a couple of books--

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:22.840
I made mistakes.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:30.920
I was judging the characters
instead of representing them.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.230
And that's not my job, to say,
your bad, you're good.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.990
So that's that.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.910
The criticism--

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:44.310
well, all the bad criticism
is bad and untrue.

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:50.200
And all the good criticism
is by brilliant people.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.660
But as writers, as most people,
you remember the bad.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.610
You remember, ugh, 1942,
remember that?

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.860
You said--

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.130
No, no, no.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.990
You've got to take it.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:09.360
Was there someone over there?

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.620
AUDIENCE: So thanks
for being here.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.280
TONI MORRISON: Where
is the person?

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.530
AUDIENCE: Hiding down here.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.690
So you talked a little bit
about your thoughts about

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.790
technology and writing.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.970
And you sounded pretty
optimistic about it, which I'm

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:23.800
really happy to here.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.190
But I did read something the
other day, of Philip Roth,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.710
saying that he thought it was
like a false nostalgia for the

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.920
idea that there was a golden age
of serious fiction, that

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:40.080
he was worried that these days,
with all the demands on

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.345
people's attention, let's say--
there's always a cell

00:48:42.345 --> 00:48:46.290
phone ringing, there's always
a new email you just got--

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:51.260
that basically he was worried
that to sustain the attention

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.490
that you need to enjoy a good
book and a good read is going

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.050
away and is going to be lost.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.490
And I'm wondering how
you feel about that.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:05.170
TONI MORRISON: I think the alarm
that he describes, I

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.010
would share.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:12.400
Except it'll change.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.660
It's like, everybody's
on cell phones--

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.830
that's not going
to be forever.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:20.450
Nothing is.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:27.010
The one thing that really
has lasted is books.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.570
Even those ones on wood--

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:40.400
I think that he is sorry that
things are changing and that

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:45.530
he may not be able to
change with it.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:51.140
And I understand that
feeling of sorrow.

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:55.190
Other authors feel that way
also, that they're fighting up

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.440
against something that they
don't understand, and they

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.720
can't participate in,
and what about the

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.570
good old days, when--

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:06.360
so I've never been
afraid of that.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.690
I don't think it'll
ever disappear--

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:15.940
books, whether they're
hardcover, softcover, ebooks,

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.630
books in the sky--

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.170
they'll be there.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:22.000
They'll be on your
watches, right?

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.100
So I think it'll be around,
because the hunger for

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:29.170
narrative is as old
as the human life.

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:30.860
Everything is a story.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.230
Everything is art.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:37.140
There is no drive, no country,
no age in which people

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.570
did not make art--

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:42.360
where there was a line in the
sand, [INAUDIBLE], or painting

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:48.050
on a cave, or dancing, or
singing, or painting their

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.390
faces, or putting on costumes.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:55.520
Human beings have always done
that, decorated it.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.790
Maybe it wasn't as sophisticated
as tattoos are,

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:02.470
but they could've been.

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:03.080
It's there.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:09.480
And the hunger for stories is
permanent, eternal, and it

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.470
will never go away.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:13.400
Never.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.640
It's like food--

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.890
which might go away.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:20.805
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:20.805 --> 00:51:22.720
I have two questions.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.310
The first one is pertaining
to this work, Home.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:29.770
I was wondering if there were
any parallels between this

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:36.300
work and your other work, in
"The Foreigner's Home,"

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.270
whether one work inspired
the other, and

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:40.600
which one came first.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:46.670
And then the second one is
about the anti-Communism

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:51.780
sentiments in the 1900s
up to the 1950s.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:59.290
And in your own words, the
destruction of Capitalism in

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:00.590
current times--

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.250
what do you think is--

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:03.620
TONI MORRISON: Pretty good.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.220
AUDIENCE: Paraphrased.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.134
TONI MORRISON: The death
of Capitalism, yes.

00:52:07.134 --> 00:52:08.346
Go right ahead.

00:52:08.346 --> 00:52:08.880
Go on.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.170
AUDIENCE: What do you think
of the sentiments of the

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:16.080
sentiments towards Communism and
Socialism in the current

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:21.400
day, or the change of both
Capitalism and Communism and

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.550
the way they are accepted
into modern-day society.

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:28.175
TONI MORRISON: What was
your first question?

00:52:28.175 --> 00:52:31.160
AUDIENCE: It was about "Home"
and "The Foreigner's Home."

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.350
TONI MORRISON: Ah, yeah.

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:35.070
Well, I did this thing
at the Louvre--

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:38.510
about six weeks of stuff.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:42.100
And I used an expanded
Atelier.

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:47.000
But "The Foreigner's Home" for
me was, who is the foreigner?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.700
There are countries in which the
people who live there are

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.960
foreign, have been
made foreign.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.470
Think of countries in Africa--

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.070
that's where they live, that's
their home, but with

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:05.720
colonialism, they become
strangers and foreigners in

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.140
their own home.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:11.080
And also, the movement of
peoples across the seas and

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:15.310
rivers, now, is greater
than it has ever been.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:23.900
So the idea of home was mixed
and confusing and disturbing.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:29.140
And I had used a painting by
Gericault called "The Raft of

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:36.750
the Medusa," which was a
painting of a raft that had

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:40.350
been cut loose by some slavers,
and they were all

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.320
lower-class people.

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.870
And they were supposed to
drown, and they didn't.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.320
And some of them died, and
they ate each other.

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:48.630
Whatever.

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:51.820
But there was this one figure
at the top, pointing toward

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.370
the ship that he thinks
is coming.

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:59.050
But they were cut loose, and
they were floating on the sea,

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.750
waiting for help, refugees.

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:05.430
And they were from all
sorts of countries.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:08.060
And I used that in
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:14.570
as a kind of a theme for what
home meant, or is becoming to

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:20.550
mean, when people are in huge
refugee camps or in prisons in

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:24.310
other countries, or were run
out of things-- so that the

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:29.190
whole notion of home is far more
complex than it ever was

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.000
when people were just
immigrants, going from

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.980
A to B and so on.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.670
And you said something about
Capitalism and Socialism--

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:38.310
and I don't know.

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:43.603
I think raw Capitalism,
predatory Capitalism is

00:54:43.603 --> 00:54:45.840
predatory and is bad.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.180
It doesn't have to
be that way.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.500
It can be moral.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:59.890
Although I don't think the
profit motive helps--

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:02.070
but there are instances.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:06.632
Every now and then, you see a
huge corporation do something,

00:55:06.632 --> 00:55:12.990
I should say, Google-y,
something important.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:15.690
It's not all downhill.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:16.940
Thank you.

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.190
TORRENCE BOONE: Final
question.

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:22.120
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.730
So there are a number of
passages in "Home" where I

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:31.180
found myself mentally
transporting my perspective

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:35.050
backwards decades because of the
scenery and the situations

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:35.910
you were describing.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:37.870
I'm thinking, this must
be the 1880s.

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:41.480
And there will be, the next
sentence is, and she'd love to

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.500
watch "I Love Lucy." And I'm
like, oh my god, this wasn't

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.150
that long ago.

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.690
So I had the effect,
I guess, you were

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.220
going for on me, certainly.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.010
I had this connection-- it's
not that long ago.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:56.600
And so my question is, you say
that we didn't do a very good

00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:01.650
job in the '50s of representing
what was actually

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:03.530
happening in our media.

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:07.140
And so, is that inevitable,
you think, over time?

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:11.250
Or are we doing a better
or worse job today?

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:16.950
TONI MORRISON: That period is
being described more exactly

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.940
by other writers now.

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.610
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:21.005
wrote a wonderful
book called--

00:56:21.005 --> 00:56:23.190
I don't know what
it was called--

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:26.010
about that.

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.860
And Jane Smiley has a
character in there.

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:31.260
So that period is being
written about and paid

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.920
attention to by really, really
first-rate writers the way I

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.195
thought it hadn't been before.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.945
The second part of
your question--

00:56:41.945 --> 00:56:45.050
AUDIENCE: The second part is,
are we making the same

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:47.570
mistakes today?

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.310
I'm sure we are, but
I wondered if you

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:51.560
could talk about it.

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.200
TONI MORRISON: Today--

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.750
I don't understand today.

00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:59.500
I'm writing a book about--

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.210
it's not like the '50s
or the '20s.

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:04.370
It's more recent.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:06.390
I'm having an awful time.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:07.860
Because I don't really
understand--

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:11.480
I don't have the fabric yet.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.700
I'm trying.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.550
But there's something very
different and elusive about

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:18.925
contemporary culture.

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:24.480
You understand that all
of our periods have

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.110
been defined by war--

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.520
all of them.

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.590
War is about the acquisition
of wealth or land, period.

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:37.480
And then somehow, it's not
about any of that.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.478
Somebody can tell me what
World War I was about.

00:57:41.478 --> 00:57:43.290
You don't know.

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:46.260
They said, well, this one-- they
were all family members.

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:50.830
The queen was related to the
German who was related to the

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:52.080
Kaiser and--

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.060
so World War II, that
was important.

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:01.200
That was a real serious,
we got to stop.

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.730
Everything else is not, it's
about something else.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:08.620
So my thing is, my feeling--

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.440
there is a lot of war,
I don't know if--

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:15.880
is that war is language,
meaning.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.480
They treat it like
it's a movie.

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.995
When is it going to be over?

00:58:19.995 --> 00:58:21.245
When is the end?

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:31.040
We talk about it like it's
a theater in the press.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.430
We've been there 10 long years--
nobody asked that

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:35.160
question in World War II--

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.350
when is it going to be over?

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:40.010
It was over when they stopped.

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:42.000
So I think there's a whole
different thing.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.835
And there's a resistance
toward war.

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:52.080
People are not enthusiastic
about it.

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.960
Yay, let's go invade,
or something.

00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.800
It seems to me not so
thrilling an idea.

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.080
Apparently there's something
else to do.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:10.700
I think the drone thing is a
sign of people withdrawing

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:16.310
from death and destruction,
and so on.

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:20.870
Although they say, well,
you killed an American.

00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:23.112
What about that?

00:59:23.112 --> 00:59:28.370
And Americans who gave up their
citizenship in World War

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:34.410
II were shot because they joined
the enemy, and they

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:37.250
were understood to
be the enemy.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:39.260
Nobody said, where's
your passport?

00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:40.920
Are you an America or not?

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.360
Well, anyway, I don't
want to go on.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.330
But the point is that there
is a big change.

00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:48.070
I can't even grasp it.

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:51.450
I don't know if war is the only
entrance, but for me, it

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:55.860
seems that the culture's
changed.

00:59:55.860 --> 01:00:03.380
A whole bunch of things that
seemed permanent 20 years ago

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.440
are not anymore.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.320
And the attitude toward war is
one of the changes, although

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:15.290
we may still be involved
in some aspect of them.

01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:16.540
But it's narrower.

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:23.600
Otherwise, I'm going to
look to you to tell me

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.850
what's going on.

01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:29.080
TORRENCE BOONE: Miss Morrison,
thank you.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:29.980
TONI MORRISON: You're welcome.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:37.823
[APPLAUSE]
