00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.409
so a vertical guideline is basically you

00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:05.419
so a vertical guideline is basically you
 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.360
so a vertical guideline is basically you
can think of it as a new edge of the

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370
can think of it as a new edge of the
 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.280
can think of it as a new edge of the
screen so it's like I have one on the

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290
screen so it's like I have one on the
 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.300
screen so it's like I have one on the
left of the screen I have one on the

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.310
left of the screen I have one on the
 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.950
left of the screen I have one on the
right screen and now I've put an edge of

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960
right screen and now I've put an edge of
 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.910
right screen and now I've put an edge of
the screen in the middle of the screen

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920
the screen in the middle of the screen
 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.470
the screen in the middle of the screen
that I can use as an anchor for

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480
that I can use as an anchor for
 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.779
that I can use as an anchor for
constraints I'm gonna head and move that

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789
constraints I'm gonna head and move that
 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.519
constraints I'm gonna head and move that
to where I'd like it in my design and

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529
to where I'd like it in my design and
 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.829
to where I'd like it in my design and
now I can just take those text views and

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:20.839
now I can just take those text views and
 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.200
now I can just take those text views and
create constraints from those two this

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210
create constraints from those two this
 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.569
create constraints from those two this
guideline and to kind of visualize what

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579
guideline and to kind of visualize what
 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.269
guideline and to kind of visualize what
this is doing underneath if I move the

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279
this is doing underneath if I move the
 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.859
this is doing underneath if I move the
guideline it's actually gonna move the

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869
guideline it's actually gonna move the
 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.440
guideline it's actually gonna move the
entire layout now so we could go into

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450
entire layout now so we could go into
 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.290
entire layout now so we could go into
helpers and we use add vertical barrier

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300
helpers and we use add vertical barrier
 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.390
helpers and we use add vertical barrier
this allows you to add a barrier to the

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400
this allows you to add a barrier to the
 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.910
this allows you to add a barrier to the
screen what a barrier is is it's kind of

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920
screen what a barrier is is it's kind of
 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.500
screen what a barrier is is it's kind of
like a view through the text it's

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510
like a view through the text it's
 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.960
like a view through the text it's
actually called a grouping code so we

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970
actually called a grouping code so we
 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.640
actually called a grouping code so we
can open up the component tree select

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650
can open up the component tree select
 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.680
can open up the component tree select
our email and password and drag that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690
our email and password and drag that
 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.350
our email and password and drag that
down to be inside of our barrier now

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360
down to be inside of our barrier now
 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.030
down to be inside of our barrier now
it's not actually a view group it's just

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040
it's not actually a view group it's just
 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.650
it's not actually a view group it's just
a view that's added to the screen it's

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660
a view that's added to the screen it's
 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.780
a view that's added to the screen it's
positioned on one side or the other of

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790
positioned on one side or the other of
 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.600
positioned on one side or the other of
all of the views that are inside of it

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610
all of the views that are inside of it
 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.060
all of the views that are inside of it
right by default it's on the left but if

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070
right by default it's on the left but if
 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.279
right by default it's on the left but if
I open up the attributes pain and scroll

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289
I open up the attributes pain and scroll
 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.539
I open up the attributes pain and scroll
down to the bottom I'm going to find a

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549
down to the bottom I'm going to find a
 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.190
down to the bottom I'm going to find a
barrier direction which I can set to the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200
barrier direction which I can set to the
 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.300
barrier direction which I can set to the
end and now that I've done that I'm

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310
end and now that I've done that I'm
 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.039
end and now that I've done that I'm
gonna set up my constraints and then

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049
gonna set up my constraints and then
 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.649
gonna set up my constraints and then
translate my English over to German and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659
translate my English over to German and
 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.300
translate my English over to German and
everything's gonna relay out and do

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310
everything's gonna relay out and do
 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.690
everything's gonna relay out and do
exactly what I expected we've added the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700
exactly what I expected we've added the
 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.550
exactly what I expected we've added the
ability to add constraints directly with

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560
ability to add constraints directly with
 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.249
ability to add constraints directly with
the context menu so in this case you

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259
the context menu so in this case you
 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.719
the context menu so in this case you
know if you have components that are

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729
know if you have components that are
 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.370
know if you have components that are
really close to each other this makes it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380
really close to each other this makes it
 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.200
really close to each other this makes it
a lot more precise and more direct to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210
a lot more precise and more direct to
 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.480
a lot more precise and more direct to
actually set those constraints so in

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490
actually set those constraints so in
 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.999
actually set those constraints so in
this case and this is available in 3 3

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009
this case and this is available in 3 3
 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.969
this case and this is available in 3 3
beta as well so you can try it out today

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979
beta as well so you can try it out today
 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.279
beta as well so you can try it out today
and so in this case if we select one

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289
and so in this case if we select one
 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.949
and so in this case if we select one
component which we have this lovely cat

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959
component which we have this lovely cat
 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.309
component which we have this lovely cat
picture you can just simply constrain it

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319
picture you can just simply constrain it
 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.279
picture you can just simply constrain it
to the parent so what does it look like

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289
to the parent so what does it look like
 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.800
to the parent so what does it look like
if you have multiple multiple components

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810
if you have multiple multiple components
 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.949
if you have multiple multiple components
so in this case we have these two text

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959
so in this case we have these two text
 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.090
so in this case we have these two text
views that are really close to each

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100
views that are really close to each
 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.209
views that are really close to each
other and so not sure if people have

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219
other and so not sure if people have
 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.709
other and so not sure if people have
tried to create constraints between two

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719
tried to create constraints between two
 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.389
tried to create constraints between two
text views that almost overlap it

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399
text views that almost overlap it
 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.709
text views that almost overlap it
becomes a little painful when you're

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719
becomes a little painful when you're
 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.419
becomes a little painful when you're
going from the bottom of one to the top

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429
going from the bottom of one to the top
 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.029
going from the bottom of one to the top
of the other and so with this new

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039
of the other and so with this new
 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.740
of the other and so with this new
context menu you can actually just keep

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750
context menu you can actually just keep
 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.440
context menu you can actually just keep
the two selected

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
the two selected
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.000
the two selected
and then when you open them the context

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
and then when you open them the context
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.530
and then when you open them the context
menu there's now this constrained menu

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
menu there's now this constrained menu
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.330
menu there's now this constrained menu
and so you can actually just see that

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340
and so you can actually just see that
 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.890
and so you can actually just see that
the two elements that you want to use

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900
the two elements that you want to use
 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.540
the two elements that you want to use
are there and then you can easily

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550
are there and then you can easily
 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.430
are there and then you can easily
cascade to the right constraint that you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440
cascade to the right constraint that you
 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.140
cascade to the right constraint that you
want the design surface has always had a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
want the design surface has always had a
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.030
want the design surface has always had a
bunch of view options to me to take

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
bunch of view options to me to take
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.110
bunch of view options to me to take
advantage of when you're working with

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
advantage of when you're working with
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.570
advantage of when you're working with
your layouts so the two I'll talk about

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580
your layouts so the two I'll talk about
 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.330
your layouts so the two I'll talk about
specifically are which we added is show

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
specifically are which we added is show
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.790
specifically are which we added is show
all constraints and live rendering what

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800
all constraints and live rendering what
 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.800
all constraints and live rendering what
we've done in Android studio 3.3 is

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810
we've done in Android studio 3.3 is
 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.050
we've done in Android studio 3.3 is
we've added this option to show all

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
we've added this option to show all
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.000
we've added this option to show all
constraints but it's actually turned off

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010
constraints but it's actually turned off
 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.640
constraints but it's actually turned off
by default and so here's a quick video

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650
by default and so here's a quick video
 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.050
by default and so here's a quick video
to show you what that looks like

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060
to show you what that looks like
 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.990
to show you what that looks like
and so what we'll do instead is we only

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
and so what we'll do instead is we only
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.850
and so what we'll do instead is we only
show the constraints on the actively

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860
show the constraints on the actively
 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.100
show the constraints on the actively
selected component so this makes it

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110
selected component so this makes it
 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.199
selected component so this makes it
easier to just you know work with the

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209
easier to just you know work with the
 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.550
easier to just you know work with the
component that you're actually working

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
component that you're actually working
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.199
component that you're actually working
with and not be distracted by all the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209
with and not be distracted by all the
 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.360
with and not be distracted by all the
arrows and margins that usually come

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
arrows and margins that usually come
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.630
arrows and margins that usually come
with the layout the other view option we

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640
with the layout the other view option we
 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.670
with the layout the other view option we
have is live rendering so we've actually

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680
have is live rendering so we've actually
 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.500
have is live rendering so we've actually
done live rendering by default in

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510
done live rendering by default in
 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.970
done live rendering by default in
constraint layout for quite some time

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980
constraint layout for quite some time
 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.479
constraint layout for quite some time
and so it's on by default but depending

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489
and so it's on by default but depending
 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.430
and so it's on by default but depending
on the specs of your machine and act it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440
on the specs of your machine and act it
 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.309
on the specs of your machine and act it
can actually be a little slow you've

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319
