00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.610
Starting at home,
Umaima traveled

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.850
uphill to the gift
store for 45 minutes

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.030
at just 8 miles per hour.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.130
She then traveled back
home along the same path

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.490
downhill at a speed
of 24 miles per hour.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.700
What is her average speed
for the entire trip from home

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.600
to the gift store and back?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.510
So we're trying to figure
out her average speed

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.390
for the entire trip.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.780
That's going to be equal
to the total distance

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.025
that she traveled
over the total time.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.586
Well, what's the total
distance going to be?

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:40.960
Well, the total
distance is going

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.200
to be the distance
to the gift store

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.630
and then the distance
back from the gift store,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.415
which are the same distances.

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:50.040
So it's really you could say two
times the distance to the gift

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.540
store.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.230
And then what is going
to be her total time?

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:22.020
Well, it's time to gift store
plus the time coming back

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.910
from the gift store.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.410
Now, we know that the
distance to the gift store

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.700
and the distance back from
the gift store is the same.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.580
So that's why I just said that
the total distance is just

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.999
going to be two times the
distance to the gift store.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.540
We don't know-- in
fact we know we're

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.080
going to have different times
in terms of times to the gift

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.550
store and times coming back.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.630
How do I know that?

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.160
Well, she went at
different speeds.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
So it's going to
take her-- actually,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.304
she went there much
slower than she came back.

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:46.970
So it would take her
longer to get there

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.590
than it took her to get back.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.190
So let's see which of these we
can actually-- we already know.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.730
So how do we figure out the
distance to the gift store?

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.850
At not point here do they
say, hey, the gift store

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.360
is this far away.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.470
But they do tell us, this
first sentence right over here,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.740
"Umaima traveled uphill to
the gift store for 45 minutes

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.270
at just 8 miles per hour."

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.220
So we're given a time.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.900
And we are given a speed.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.480
We should be able to
figure out a distance.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.900
So let's just do a
little bit of aside here.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.330
We should be able to figure out
the distance to the-- actually

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.630
let me write it this way.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.500
The distance to
the store will be

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.170
equal to-- now we've got to make
sure we have our units right.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.378
Here they gave it in minutes.

00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:40.900
Here they have 8 miles per hour.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.320
So let's convert
this into hours.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.630
So 45 minutes in hours,
so it's 45 minutes

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.860
out of 60 minutes per hour.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.820
So that's going
to give us 45/60.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.120
Divide both by 15.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.990
That's the same thing as 3/4.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:06.150
So it's going to be 3/4 hours is
the time times an average speed

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.305
of 8 miles per hour.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.930
So what is the
distance to the store?

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.370
Well, 3/4 times 8.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.810
Or you could view it
as 3/4 times 8 times

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.280
1, is going to be-- well,
it's going to be 24 over 4.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.680
Let me just write that.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.140
That's going to
be 24 over 4 which

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.900
is equal to-- did I get it?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.400
Yeah.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.650
24 over 4, which is equal to 6.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.460
And units-wise, we're
just left with miles.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.250
So the distance to
the store is 6 miles.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.080
2 times the distance
to the gift store,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.760
well, this whole thing
is going to be 12 miles.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.510
12 miles is the total
distance she traveled.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.740
Now, what is the time
to the gift store?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.360
Well, they already
told that to us.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.110
They already told us
that it's 45 minutes.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.949
Now, I want to put
everything in hours.

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.240
I'm assuming that they want
our average speed in hours.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.090
So I'm going to put
everything in hours.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.650
So the time to the gift
store was 3/4 of an hour.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.020
And what's the time coming
back from the gift store?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.810
Well, we know her speed.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.668
We know her speed coming back.

00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:21.709
We already know the distance
from the gift store.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.740
It's the same as the
distance to the gift store.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.850
So we can take this distance,
we can take 6 miles, that's

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.620
the distance to the gift
store, 6 miles divided

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.490
by her speed coming back,
which is 24 miles per hour,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.890
so divided by 24 miles per hour.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.990
It gives us-- well, let's see.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.170
We're going to have 6 over
24 is the same thing as 1/4.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.440
It's going to be 1/4.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.590
And then miles divided
by miles per hour

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.070
is the same thing as miles
times hours per mile.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.530
The miles cancel out.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.620
And you'll have 1/4 of an hour.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.720
So it takes her 1/4 of
an hour to get back.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.495
And that fits our intuition.

00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:03.620
Actually, let me write that
in the same green color

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.090
since I'm writing all
the times in green color.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.920
So 1/4 of an hour.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.280
So she went there.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.040
Going to the gift
store was slow.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.260
It took her 3/4 of an hour.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.570
Coming back only took
her 1/4 of an hour.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.100
So now we're ready to
calculate her average speed

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.770
for the entire trip.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.890
Average speed for
the entire trip

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.010
is going to be equal to
the total distance, which

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.440
is 12 miles, divided
by her total time.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.280
3/4 hours plus 1/4
hour is exactly 1 hour.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.290
So her average
speed is 12 over 1,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.880
which is just 12 miles per hour.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.249
Her average speed is
just 12 miles per hour.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.290
And you might have been
tempted to say hey, wait.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.974
Why don't I just
average 24 and 8.

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:55.390
But that wouldn't
have been right,

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.669
because she's traveling those
for different amounts of time.

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.210
So what you really
have to do is just

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.710
think in terms of go back to
your basics-- total distance,

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.820
total time.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.160
Figure out the total distance.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.630
This first sentence
right over here

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.130
gives us half of
the total distance,

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.250
the time to the store.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.310
We just doubled that
to get the time back.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.460
And then our total
time we can figure out.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.140
They tell us the
time to the store.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.390
And then we can figure out
the distance from the store

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.970
and using that and the speed
to figure out her time back.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.840
And then we get total
distance divided

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.490
by total time--
12 miles per hour.
