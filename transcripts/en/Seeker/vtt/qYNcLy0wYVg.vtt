00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:14.660
Agave, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Fructose,
Sucralose, Glucose, WHAT DOES IT ALL MEEEEANNANNANNANN?!?!

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.519
Sweeteners come in MANY forms, the health
pros and cons are heavily debated, but the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.779
IMPORTANT thing is what happens when you get
them into your body.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.390
Agave nectar and high-fructose corn syrup
are two heavy hitters in these debates, so

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.230
which is worse?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.230
Or better?

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.530
Well before we go down the "which one" rabbit
hole let's explain how the sweetness affects

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.530
you.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.581
Sugar is a carbohydrate, which means it's
a chain of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen; their

00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:43.940
chemical names usually end OSE.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.329
Sucrose, Sucralose, Glucose, Fructoseâ€¦

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.199
Glucose is a simple sugar, plants make it
as a byproduct of photosynthesis.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.240
Fructose, is also a simple sugar, it naturally
occurs in fruits and is also found in honey,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.190
sugar cane, corn (obviously), and so on.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.100
The real debate comes down to fructose.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.430
When you eat a simple sugar like glucose,
your body knows what to do.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.330
That stuff comes from plants!

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.410
It's natural!

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.790
Your body can actually CREATE it if it wants.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.750
When you eat enough, your brain tells your
body -- "We're good.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.250
Stop with the sugars!"

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.720
Fructose, doesn't do that.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.760
It's sneakier.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.210
It doesn't tell the body to release insulin,
it doesn't tell the brain to cool it.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.930
This is why we can consume huge amounts of
this sweetener.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.390
Where glucose can be converted right to energy,
fructose has to trek all the way to the liver.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.520
By the time it gets there, your body will
probably metabolize it into fat instead.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.100
Regular table sugar is 50-50 glucose to fructose.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.830
High-fructose corn syrup is 45-55 glucose
to fructoseâ€¦ not too shabby.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.080
I mean, it's definitely more, but not as much
as I would have thought.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.610
It's called HIGH-fructose, because corn syrup
doesn't contain ANY naturally.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.280
Scientists in the 50s figured out how to add
enzymes to the syrup to convert it to 55-percent

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.440
fructose.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.000
Agave nectar on the other hand?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.930
It can have as much as 90 percent fructose.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.729
10 percent glucose.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.640
If you're nervous about high-fructose corn
syrup, by comparison agave is a frickin' bomb.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.400
When agave is marketed, it's usually called
healthy and natural, which may be true.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.280
Not all agave nectars are produced the same
way, but they're all processed.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.650
Agave is heated and then enzymes are added
to bring out the right profile.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.760
At the end of the day it's usually a man-made
fructose sweetener.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.980
Why is fructose bad?

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.980
It's not.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.500
Too much is bad, but a little isn't going
to hurt you in the least.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.280
The problem is, sugar is in everything these
days, candy bars and milkshakes, sure, but

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.349
also the beef, bun, ketchup, soda, AND the
fries at America's favorite fast food places

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.570
-- there's sugar in literally the entire meal.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.220
Agave might not be bad either, you can add
a lot less to get the same sweet taste, but

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.000
you're basically consuming pure fructose,
so go easy on it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.380
If you want to reduce the amount of fructose,
specifically, don't cut out eating fruit.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.420
Fruit contains vitamins and fibers, unlike
fructose syrup.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.190
Don't overdo it, make sure you mix your fruits
with EVEN MORE vegetables.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.090
In the end, the "who's worse" battle isn't
really settleable.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.320
High-fructose corn syrup IS highly manufactured,
nutritionally meh, but agave is also manufactured

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.400
and similarly nutritionally meh.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.569
Sugar should be consumed sparingly regardless,
but if you pay attention to the OSE, you can't

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:50.530
miss it.
