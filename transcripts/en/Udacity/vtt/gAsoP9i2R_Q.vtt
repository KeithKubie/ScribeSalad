00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.480
As more mentioned, you can also focus
your segmentation on a Persona.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.080
Personas are fictional characters
created to represent different user

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.370
types then they're going to use
your product in very similar way.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.030
So, the best practice is to define
three to five different personas and

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.000
describe them as if they're real people,
so with a name,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.970
a job, values whatever hobbies and maybe
even a quote that the user might say.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.630
We'll use these to create an actual
profile for each persona.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.580
Let's take you to kids for example.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.830
This is Art, he's a dad,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.390
and as much as he'd love to expose his
son to all different content music he

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.160
really wants to make sure that his son
only consumes age appropriate content.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.130
And this is Finn, his son,
he's 3 years old.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.510
He wants to watch YouTube all day long.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.380
And he wants to do
everything by himself.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.360
He needs an interface that's going to
allow him to do it himself, and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.960
be easy to navigate.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.770
These are two personas: Art
is our decision maker, so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.870
as a company YouTube needs Art to
trust in their product with his son.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.990
And Finn needs an app that
he actually enjoys using.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.540
So, a persona for a could be a Dalia,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.420
a 29-year old finance executive who
frequently travels for business.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.630
When she's not working,
she loves the outdoors,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.070
trying new upscale restaurants,
cooking, and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.760
of course spending time with her Golden
doodle, who she considers a child.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.360
In a business to business example,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.040
creating a persona can be
a little bit more complex.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.640
You really have to understand
the business you're targeting and

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.110
the individual constraints of
each user and decision maker.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.760
So, the user could be a marketing
person or an engineer, but

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.870
the decision maker could be someone
more senior level like the CEO or CFO.
