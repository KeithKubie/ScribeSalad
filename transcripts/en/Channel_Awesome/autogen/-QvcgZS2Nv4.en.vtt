00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:44.780 align:start position:0%
appreciated even more for it I think
 

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.169 align:start position:0%

00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:47.179 align:start position:0%
that's sort of where I say no we really
 

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's sort of where I say no we really
