00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.280
MALE SPEAKER: So when you look
down at that then, that's like

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.930
an X.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.355
MATT PARKER: It is.

00:00:03.355 --> 00:00:05.680
It's one of my ex-favorite
numbers.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.490
For a while, my favorite
number was 3,435.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.090
And I say for a while, because
I don't think a favorite

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.120
number -- you don't commit
to a favorite number

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.540
for life, to be honest.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.470
Very few things that I'll have a
static opinion on what is my

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.990
favorite, other than
my girlfriend.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.170
Whereas 3,435 for a
while there was

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.420
one of my top numbers.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.660
I'll show you why.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.070
And actually, it probably had a
bit of a record run as being

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.820
my favorite number.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.770
3,435, it's called a
Munchausen number.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.520
And what you do for a Munchausen
number is you raise

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.760
each of the digits to the
power of that digit.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.000
So 3 to the 3 plus 4 to
the 4 plus 3 to the 3

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.440
plus 5 to the 5.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.698
And if you then add 3 to the 3
plus 4 to the 4 plus 3 to the

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:56.960
3, plus 5 to the 5,
it equals 3,435.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.250
It equals itself.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.660
It's a bit like a narcissistic
number, which I'm sure people

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.500
will be talking about.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.660
Except this time, each number
is obsessed with itself.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.460
In fact, the Munchausen
it's named after was a

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.960
narcissistic character.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.860
And so it's a very, very
narcissistic number.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.610
And what's even better about
it is it's the only one.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.980
In base 10, this is
the only number

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.830
which has that property.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.830
Well, it was the only number
that has that property.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.360
If you look up online, whenever
you talk about the

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.070
Munchausen number and you talk
about 3,435, someone will come

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.560
along and say, but what about
438,579,088, huh?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.260
What about that?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.970
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I was
just about to say that.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.050
MATT PARKER: It was on the tip
of your tongue, wasn't it?

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.530
Because 4 to the 4 plus 3 to the
3 plus 8 to the 8 plus 5

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.560
to the 5 plus 7 to the 7 plus
9 to the 9 plus 0 to the 0

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.820
plus 8 to the 8 plus 8 to the
8 equals 438,579,088.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.020
And people are all up in your
grill with what up with this?

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.920
And there is a problem
with that.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.940
There's a reason why that makes
me emotional, and I'll

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.840
show you why.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.370
It is this bit here--

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.970
0 to the 0.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.220
This relies on 0 to
the 0 equaling 0.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.440
And it turns out 0 to the
0 does not equal 0.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.590
Nor does it equal 1,
for that matter.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.860
0 to the 0 is undefined.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.590
There is no value for 0 to the
0, because anything to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.390
the 0 equals 1.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.770
And 0 to the anything
equals 0.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.480
And when both of those things
happen at once, you basically

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390
have a big argument, and people
get very emotional

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.930
about this.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.710
If you want to find equally core
numbers, there are things

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.860
like 4,155, which equals the
digits at the bottom--

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.700
4,155 to the power of the same
digits, but not necessarily in

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.350
the same order.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.380
So if you put them up as in 5,
4, 1, 5, that still holds.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.560
But you've got to shuffle the
digits around when you raise

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.550
them up the top.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.160
MALE SPEAKER: You mentioned to
me that was your favorite

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.400
number for a long time.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.510
MATT PARKER: Yeah.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.980
MALE SPEAKER: It was your
favorite number for possibly a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.520
record time.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.705
MATT PARKER: It must have
been seven or eight

00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:17.610
months it was up there.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.200
It was good.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.930
MALE SPEAKER: What happened?

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.410
Why did you break up?

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.750
MATT PARKER: It was
fun, but it just--

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.470
I got bored.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.300
I got bored.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.820
And I went back to the safety
of narcissistic

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.560
numbers for a while.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.800
So 371 took over for a
substantial period of time.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.250
And then I wanted to go
back into perfect

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.020
numbers for a while.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.410
So 33,550,336 took back over.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.160
And at the moment, it's 764.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.350
But that's because it's
a grafting number.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.120
But this is not the time nor
the place to talk about

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.370
grafting numbers.
