00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.900
Mussels may be the key to stronger, more durable
dental implants.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.320
Those little, shelled ocean critters, not,
like your bicep… just to be clear.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.960
There are a lot of problems with the current
materials that dentists use for cavity fillings,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.760
crowns and other dental implants.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.680
For example, they fall out.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.819
Normal everyday things like chewing and eating
hard or acidic foods can wear down a filling

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.239
and its bonding with the surrounding tooth.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.029
And this can lead to the filling cracking
or falling out.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.919
God forbid you chew... with your teeth!

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.869
And the problem of the falling-out fillings
could be solved by mussels!

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.010
Well, not actually mussels, but the adhesive
they use to stick to things.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.690
For years, scientists have been searching
for a strong, reliable, adhesive.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.440
And now, inspired by nature, they think they’ve
found it.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.570
These little creatures have an incredible
ability to tightly stick to wet surfaces like

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.570
rocks and boats and hang on for dear life.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.379
And because of this bonding, they can withstand
a lot - pummelling waves, blistering, dry

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.289
heat, and salt water cycles.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.079
They do this with what are called byssal threads.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.329
They reach out from inside the shell to help
mussels attach themselves to things.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.519
And they’re super resistant to breaking.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.670
Byssal threads are 5 times stronger than our
strongest tendon, the Achilles.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.450
These threads contain a group of catecholic
compounds which let them stick to a variety

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.590
of wet surfaces, through bonds on the sub-nanoscopic
molecular level!

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.869
Because this adhesion works so well in water,
it has been looked at for use in surgery and

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.540
even for the U.S. Navy.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.720
And now there’s another group who want this
stuff.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.890
Dentists.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.049
Scientists have tried using a dental bonding
material made from catecholic compounds and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.150
it is very promising.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.369
Implants adhered with this material had a
10 times stronger bond and a 50 percent increase

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.369
in toughness!

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.619
It’s still in it’s early stages but this
sounds super promising!

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.630
Less broken or displaced implants mean less
trips to the dentist.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.920
Which is basically life goals, let’s be
real.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.979
You know those nights where you’re like
“eh, I realllly don’t feel like brushing

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.460
my teeth” so you don’t?

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.340
Do you know what that does to your teeth?

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.429
Find out here.

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.090
Do you hate the dentist or are you one of
the few people that love it?
