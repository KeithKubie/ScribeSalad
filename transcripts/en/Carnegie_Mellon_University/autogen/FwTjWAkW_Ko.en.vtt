to forecast and predict not only because

this season followed the shape that all

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340
this season followed the shape that all
 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.610

going up so it really confused our model

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620

I think I've talked to other groups it's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
I think I've talked to other groups it's
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.209
I think I've talked to other groups it's
confused their models as well so we not

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
confused their models as well so we not
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.650
confused their models as well so we not
only have to do forecasting but also

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
only have to do forecasting but also
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.410
