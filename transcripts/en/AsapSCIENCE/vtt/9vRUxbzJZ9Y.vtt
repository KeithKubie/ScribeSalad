00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.608
So you've made it to the last round of a TV game show and have the chance to win a Brand-new car.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.649
It sits behind one of these three doors,

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.678
but the other two have a sad little goat behind them. You make your choice, and the host decides to reveal where one of the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.829
goats is. He then offers you a chance to change your door.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.209
Do you do it ? Does changing your choice even make a difference? The short answer is yes, even though it seems counter-intuitive.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.029
Changing your door choice actually doubles your odds of winning the car, but how is that possible?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
This is the Monty Hall Problem.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.529
At the start, most people correctly assume that you have a one in three chance of choosing the correct door

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.859
But it would be incorrect to assume that when one door is removed. Each door now holds a 50/50 chance of having the car.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.230
Let's use a deck of cards to understand why.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.779
Pick a card from this deck without looking this card has a 1 in 52 chance of being the ace of spades,

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.718
but now I'm going to flip over all the other cards except one none of which are the ace of spades of

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.579
the two cards left. Which one seems more likely to be the ace of spades? The one you chose

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.618
randomly out of a deck of 52 or the one I purposefully and suspiciously left turned down?

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.040
It turns out your card remains at a chance of 1 in 52 where my card now has a 51 out of 52.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.380
Probability of being the Ace of spades.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.790
The same principle is true with the three doors you see when I removed the door.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.189
I did so with motive knowing there was a go behind it the only two scenarios that exists are

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.420
A. You chose the correct door and I'm

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.180
arbitrarily picking one of the wrong choices to show you in which case staying will make you win or

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.089
B. You pick the wrong door, and I show you the other incorrect answer in which case switching will make you win.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.930
Scenario 'A' will always happen when you choose the winning door, and 'B'

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.930
will always happen when you pick a losing door.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.680
Therefore, 'A' will happen one-third of the time and 'B' will happen two-thirds of the time.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.860
As such, switching your door wins two out of three times this Paradox has perplexed many people including

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.049
scientists and mathematicians. To this day, because our gut tells us, that switching will have no consequence

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.490
but when using formal calculations or computer simulators the results don't lie.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.399
Switching your door increases the probability of winning.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.529
Let's see it one more time using a chart. Here are all the possible

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.899
scenarios the car is behind door 1, 2, or 3 , and you have the choice of each three doors. This means

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.670
there are nine possible outcomes.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.040
Let's tell you them up quickly if it's behind door 1 and you chose door 1 you should stay but if you chose Door 2

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.169
or 3. You should switch if it's behind door 2 and you chose door - you should stay but the other two you should switch.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.140
Add it all up and you should switch six out of nine times, so do you still trust your gut feeling?

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.619
