Test test

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
What's new in

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
Android Accessibility

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.913
1, 2, 3.  3, 2, 1.  We're ready 
to start.

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:15.248
&gt;&gt; PRESENTER:  Hello, everyone.

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:20.022
Can you hear hear me?Hello, 
everyone.  Fabulous.

00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:27.635
Tsaran.  I am an Android 
accessibility program manager.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.770
decided to spend the next 40 
minutes of 

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:41.096
this conference with us learning
about 

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:44.694
and related

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.583
work we do with Google.

00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:57.497
access environment can empower 
people 

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:00.605
disabilities to be productive 
and 

00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:03.663
their lives.

00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:08.949
organization, there is over 1 
billion 

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.038
disabilities in the world.

00:01:14.538 --> 00:01:16.538
That's nine 0s.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.041
over 50 million has difficulty 
doing simple tasks.For example, 

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:28.687
some of us take for granted a 
glass of water or walking out of

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.393
the favorite restaurant or 
listening to a 

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:38.375
conditions.

00:01:39.657 --> 00:01:42.505
For other people, these tasks 
aren't easily achievable.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:49.252
to change that.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.159
millenia, humanity has been 
developed 

00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.271
tech gadgets.

00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:02.757
I will give you a few examples.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.690
noble prize for this one, fire, 
clock, 

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:14.105
creating to improve the quality 
of our lives.

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:19.642
some people, this is just to 
improve the their lives.

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:26.164
disabilities, these gadgets, 
this new 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.076
advancement made it possible in 
many live their lives.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:37.008
completely blind could not do my
work at 

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:40.053
without assistive technology or 

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:43.776
tools that help me to do very 
basic life.  You know?

00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:53.746
So in this case, again, 
technology is 

00:02:56.636 --> 00:02:59.521
superimportant and today, we 
would like you about some of the

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:01.522
technology.

00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:09.851
low logic conditions where you 
were 

00:03:12.373 --> 00:03:14.408
something or how about a 
(inaudible) were trying to read.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.580
long to pick up and read.  Many 
things, right?might remember 

00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:23.581
discomfort and 

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.455
circumstances.

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.736
discomfort and frustration to be
rest of your life.

00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:39.365
people with disabilities, it is.
like this.

00:03:45.627 --> 00:03:47.627
amazing power to change, if not 
all of 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.290
certainly a lot of these things.

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.042
actually create some of that 
technology.know something about 

00:03:57.043 --> 00:04:00.097
technology at Google, right?We 
create that technology.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:07.606
technology, we feel like we have
you 

00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:12.138
purpose so we can tell you about
things we create.Over the last 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.139
year, we've been working 

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:17.401
creating some of the new tools 
to help 

00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:21.261
disabilities, but also create 
new APIs 

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:31.755
more access age   With that, I 
would like to invite 

00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:37.823
to you to kick off our marathon 
and to 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.069
about well, where is Brian?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.695
Here goes Brian.Welcome, Brian.
everybody.

00:04:52.163 --> 00:04:54.836
My name is Brian Kemler and I'm 
a on Android accessibility.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.350
our new accessibility services 
and the make them possible.

00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:09.483
how we're innovating in this 
space.

00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:14.566
Android P to make hearing 
conversations 

00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:18.730
easier.  Listening is difficult.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.824
field with no background noise 
and a 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.759
ears, but the everyday reality 
is we 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.090
noise.

00:05:39.194 --> 00:05:41.852
In fact, unwanted sound is one 
of the common environmental 

00:05:41.853 --> 00:05:43.853
problems.

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:47.956
annoying, but it prevents us 
from 

00:05:51.082 --> 00:05:53.524
colleagues, friends, and loved 
ones no well we can hear, most 

00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:55.525
of us can relate 

00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:59.411
following acoustically 
challenging situations.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.839
trying to listen to a caller in 
a loud 

00:06:11.307 --> 00:06:13.307
Listening to a presenter who is 

00:06:14.982 --> 00:06:16.982
too softly like me right now.

00:06:26.834 --> 00:06:28.834
noise and boost the signal on 
your 

00:06:31.553 --> 00:06:33.553
would never miss the 
conversation?

00:06:38.312 --> 00:06:40.312
sound amplifier.

00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:44.837
accessible service that helps 
user focus 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.144
world conversations using only 
an and a set of headphones.

00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:57.467
personalized levels to optimize 
their 

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.002
experience to the current 
environment.

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:05.484
sliders for loudness and tuning,

00:07:07.364 --> 00:07:10.007
over 100 audio presets in the 
background.settings can then be 

00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:12.008
independently 

00:07:16.922 --> 00:07:18.922
ear, adjusting them provides 
ambiient 

00:07:19.976 --> 00:07:21.976
improves ambiient sound quality 
in a 

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.041
scenarios including enhancing 
sound in 

00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:29.163
or far away spaces.

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:34.468
somebody who speaks softly, 
tuning -- 

00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:38.349
TV to a volume that's 
understandable and for everybody

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.350
in the room.

00:07:42.412 --> 00:07:44.412
briefly explain how it was built
uses 

00:07:46.202 --> 00:07:48.202
dynamics processing effect.

00:07:59.373 --> 00:08:02.844
effect is based on a four-stage 
signal architecture.  Stage 1 is

00:08:02.845 --> 00:08:04.845
pre-equalization.

00:08:08.744 --> 00:08:10.744
think about the pre-equalizer as
a 

00:08:11.813 --> 00:08:13.813
to adjust any audio frequency.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.661
and everything in between.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.750
compressor.

00:08:24.663 --> 00:08:26.663
stone of the processing effect.

00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:33.282
sound and adjust down loud 
sounds to better listening 

00:08:33.283 --> 00:08:35.283
experience.

00:08:37.388 --> 00:08:40.268
post-equalization similar to the
first allows to you fine tune 

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.269
any audio frequency.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.390
Lastly, stage four the limiter 
prevents 

00:08:49.672 --> 00:08:51.672
gain above a developer 
designated thresh 

00:08:53.543 --> 00:08:55.543
prevents loud or unwanted 
noises.

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:59.016
doing a number of demos and a 
deep dive 

00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:03.639
dynamics processing effect and 
sound at 3:30 on stage 5.

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:09.133
want to learn more.

00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:15.029
we're doing to make Android 
easier for 

00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:19.896
mobility and dexterity 
challenges.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.630
we're going to do a little 
empathy exercise.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.778
ask everybody to take out their 
phones.  All right.

00:09:33.452 --> 00:09:35.452
I want everybody to take a 
screen shot.have a purpose.

00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:39.844
Take a screen shot, please.

00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:44.745
you have done that, I want to 
you do it 

00:09:48.071 --> 00:09:50.071
want you to do it with just one 
hand.

00:09:51.313 --> 00:09:53.313
Screen shot.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.010
Screen shot on your phone.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.490
one hand, is it?

00:10:03.633 --> 00:10:05.633
this is their everyday reality.

00:10:07.098 --> 00:10:09.098
with tremors or limited hand 
strength.

00:10:10.757 --> 00:10:13.613
simple tasks such as holding the
phone, hardware buttons or 

00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:15.614
performing gestures 

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:20.992
difficult, painful and time 
consumeing.Accessibility 

00:10:20.993 --> 00:10:22.993
service, accessibility 

00:10:24.702 --> 00:10:26.702
accessibility service to make 
common 

00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:29.786
easier for users with physical 
disabilities.

00:10:32.478 --> 00:10:35.132
alone, this is a population of 
over 75 users.

00:10:38.617 --> 00:10:40.617
Accessibility menu simplifies 
the functions.

00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:49.241
lock screen, take screen shot 
and volume 

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958
directly to accessibility 
settings instantly.

00:11:04.847 --> 00:11:07.287
Further, we designed it with 
very large targets located at 

00:11:07.288 --> 00:11:09.288
the bottom of the screen.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.380
facilitates reach ant for those 
with a or limited reach.

00:11:16.453 --> 00:11:18.453
landscape mode.

00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:24.542
on top of our accessibility 
framework.

00:11:27.113 --> 00:11:29.113
new APIs and lock screen.using 
it today.

00:11:35.117 --> 00:11:37.117
over to Patrick to talk about 
vision.

00:11:41.462 --> 00:11:43.699
&gt;&gt; PATRICK CLARY:  Thanks, 
Brian.  All right.Hello, 

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.398
everyone.  My name is Patrick 
Clary.Product Manager on 

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:50.399
accessibility at 

00:11:53.532 --> 00:11:55.532
very excited today to announce 
for the 

00:11:59.037 --> 00:12:01.472
time here at I/O a new app 
coming to the called lookout.

00:12:07.658 --> 00:12:09.658
who are blind blind and low 
vision.

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:13.627
for them where it requires help 
from others.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:17.561
the users might be entering a 
new space first time.  They 

00:12:17.562 --> 00:12:20.242
might not know if other people 
present in that space.  They 

00:12:20.243 --> 00:12:22.243
might need assistance.

00:12:24.312 --> 00:12:27.177
If I need a chair, reading the 
office another example is when a

00:12:27.178 --> 00:12:29.178
user is cooking.

00:12:30.434 --> 00:12:32.294
might need assistance reading 
the recipe different 

00:12:32.295 --> 00:12:34.295
ingredients.

00:12:38.602 --> 00:12:40.258
leverage a users Smartphone to 
make the space and are thes more

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.259
accessibility to 

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.560
who are blind or vision 
impairments.

00:12:48.065 --> 00:12:50.065
of lookout as a personal guide 
that sees 

00:12:52.349 --> 00:12:55.011
and speaks items of importance 
that it the environment.

00:13:03.112 --> 00:13:05.112
this ask what they will see.

00:13:06.313 --> 00:13:08.313
four different modes and that 
launch 

00:13:11.202 --> 00:13:13.202
work and play, home, scanning, 
which is 

00:13:16.134 --> 00:13:18.134
long form text and experimental.

00:13:20.822 --> 00:13:22.822
to actually specify the activity
they're 

00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:28.567
in and fine tune lookout to 
provide more results.  So after 

00:13:28.568 --> 00:13:30.568
selecting the mode, a user 

00:13:32.247 --> 00:13:34.247
be presented with a live view 
which will 

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:37.734
items of importance as they're 
detected.

00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:43.868
profiles one of our testers who 
is an 

00:13:45.138 --> 00:13:47.138
San Francisco and describes the 
impact 

00:13:57.676 --> 00:13:59.676
piece of art that we can walk 
on.

00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:04.189
to experience this new thing.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.127
I am a theatre and art 
instructor.born visually 

00:14:09.128 --> 00:14:11.128
impaired.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.990
impressionist painting.

00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:19.106
working with my supplies and 
they don't up where I want them 

00:14:19.107 --> 00:14:21.107
to be.

00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:24.997
scissors.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.284
12 o'clock.

00:14:33.638 --> 00:14:35.908
have a physical experience with 
art and observe it.

00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:44.921
to watch or listen instead of 
witnessing or doing.

00:14:58.785 --> 00:15:01.027
&gt;&gt; PATRICK CLARY:  So that gives
you idea of the type of 

00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:03.028
experience that provide.

00:15:07.897 --> 00:15:09.897
areuson a massive experience.

00:15:15.005 --> 00:15:17.005
their Android device on a 
laniard like 

00:15:18.498 --> 00:15:20.498
perhaps on a shirt pocket.

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:27.901
the user.  If the user is 
cooking, they can engaged in 

00:15:27.902 --> 00:15:29.902
that activity without having 

00:15:30.987 --> 00:15:32.987
their device and interact with 
the screen.

00:15:38.534 --> 00:15:40.534
wearing the phone, Lookout 
provides helpful hints.

00:15:42.614 --> 00:15:44.614
To facilitate this, we designed 
a set of controls.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.550
user can knock on the device to 
begin 

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:54.077
that Lookout provides and they 
can do like cover the camera to 

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.078
pause 

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.940
the fingerprint sensor to change
different modes.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.240
works.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.162
So first Lookout will collect 
live around the scene of the 

00:16:09.163 --> 00:16:11.163
user and then 

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.280
series of machine learning like 
bar 

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.040
people are present, detect 
objects and scene.

00:16:22.494 --> 00:16:24.494
The next thing we do is score 
these 

00:16:26.192 --> 00:16:28.286
based on a personalization model
and the user has chosen.

00:16:31.736 --> 00:16:34.392
relevant and important items to 
the user.important because you 

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.393
can imagine in a 

00:16:37.457 --> 00:16:40.114
scene, there can be many things 
we can however, we only want to 

00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:45.014
tell the user important things 
based on what we know context 

00:16:45.015 --> 00:16:47.015
they're currently in.

00:16:48.713 --> 00:16:50.713
note that we do most of this all
on the 

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.650
that you can use this app 
completely and 

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.720
internet connection.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.174
and low vision that harnesses 
the power learning to provide 

00:17:10.175 --> 00:17:12.175
relevant results spaces around 
them.

00:17:15.348 --> 00:17:17.993
for users in the U.S.this 
summer.

00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:24.929
trust the testers.

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:32.362
out, go to Google.tester.  You 
can come to our sandbox to be a 

00:17:33.392 --> 00:17:35.392
user as well.

00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:39.715
talk about what we're doing in 
the cognitive space.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.040
&gt;&gt; MAYA BEN-ARI:  Thank you, 
Patrick.  Hi.

00:17:47.482 --> 00:17:49.482
I amMaya Ben-Ari.

00:17:57.784 --> 00:17:59.784
(inaudible) operating.

00:18:03.322 --> 00:18:05.322
you work on the screen and the 
text will 

00:18:07.758 --> 00:18:09.758
be read  

00:18:15.183 --> 00:18:17.183
aloud.

00:18:18.652 --> 00:18:20.652
User can simply select text 
using the 

00:18:22.938 --> 00:18:28.051
or in the picture and the text 
will be and read aloud.demo.

00:18:31.956 --> 00:18:34.005
For that I am going to go off 
the stage.

00:18:43.616 --> 00:18:46.254
going to open my camera.Here you
go.

00:18:51.572 --> 00:18:53.572
this is the regular camera.

00:18:55.874 --> 00:18:57.874
accessibility button.

00:18:59.394 --> 00:19:01.394
button here in the corner.

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:11.747
And next I'm going to select the
text   &gt;&gt; Select to speak with 

00:19:11.748 --> 00:19:16.227
those CRs on Android today.  
Please try it out.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.570
clicker.

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.344
data.

00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:45.009
We'd love to have your feedback.

00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:49.082
Android framework.

00:19:54.941 --> 00:19:56.941
that the device are built O.

00:19:59.206 --> 00:20:01.206
users can interrupt with the 
touch 

00:20:02.664 --> 00:20:04.726
standard UI or even here the 
sounds that are producing.

00:20:09.837 --> 00:20:11.837
ways.

00:20:14.378 --> 00:20:16.378
First one is developing APIs for
apps services to make.

00:20:19.268 --> 00:20:21.498
range of audience and second, we
are accessibility features into 

00:20:21.499 --> 00:20:23.542
the framework.

00:20:32.719 --> 00:20:35.392
enable developers to make their 
app more accessible.The first 

00:20:35.393 --> 00:20:37.393
one is adding a pain title.

00:20:38.883 --> 00:20:40.883
me start on what is a pain?

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:45.767
the window that is visually 
distinct for 

00:20:47.249 --> 00:20:49.304
is visibilitily distinct for 
users and like a window changes.

00:20:53.199 --> 00:20:55.199
can see here in the quick 
setting and 

00:21:02.203 --> 00:21:04.203
determine when panes on the 
strength had updated.

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:12.374
accessibility pane title.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.880
automatically notified to 
changes to the pane.

00:21:19.127 --> 00:21:21.127
user get more granular 
information about 

00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:26.317
changed with minimal input from 
app developer.

00:21:28.832 --> 00:21:30.832
please do add a title to your 
pane.

00:21:36.399 --> 00:21:38.829
attribute so developer can mark 
whether heading inside their 

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.830
app.

00:21:43.932 --> 00:21:45.932
for apps with text heavy views.

00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:57.087
user who cannot view the screen 
without the whole text.

00:22:00.156 --> 00:22:02.156
Last API is we add the ability.

00:22:06.494 --> 00:22:08.494
basically -- the last API is 
setting forcible.

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.083
grouping of the contract of that
content.

00:22:16.991 --> 00:22:18.991
example, let's say you have a 
sports and 

00:22:22.867 --> 00:22:24.867
insure that the number

00:22:30.283 --> 00:22:32.283
for the users who cannot see the
screen.

00:22:35.608 --> 00:22:37.608
can use screen reader focusable 
to group the content.

00:22:42.567 --> 00:22:44.567
updating our documentation for 
and grouping.

00:22:48.882 --> 00:22:51.955
accessibility section in 
developer.android.com.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.750
features coming to the Android 
framework.

00:23:01.807 --> 00:23:03.807
the one is adjust vibration.

00:23:08.908 --> 00:23:10.908
for users

00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:24.241
innovation as some user find 
animation distracting.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.767
So we basically just added a new
setting those off.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.290
launched the volume see 
accessibility short cut.

00:23:43.014 --> 00:23:45.014
basically to toggle on and off 

00:23:46.639 --> 00:23:48.639
services, you need long press 
for three volume keys.

00:23:51.302 --> 00:23:53.302
based on the feedback.

00:23:55.605 --> 00:23:58.285
settings that you can toggle on 
and off color correction and 

00:23:58.286 --> 00:24:00.286
coloring version.

00:24:02.157 --> 00:24:04.157
second one is we reduced the 
time to 

00:24:06.884 --> 00:24:08.884
seconds to one second after the 
initial activation.

00:24:21.822 --> 00:24:23.822
testing for accessibility and 
its everything we built into OS.

00:24:28.402 --> 00:24:30.402
the accessibility services in 
the app 

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.500
we want that Eco-system to be as
possible.

00:24:39.665 --> 00:24:41.665
manual testing and automated 
testing.

00:24:42.923 --> 00:24:45.576
we found the combination of both
can better coverage for your 

00:24:45.577 --> 00:24:47.577
app.

00:24:49.283 --> 00:24:51.283
different testing tools and how 
those 

00:24:53.977 --> 00:24:56.422
integrated to cover 
accessibility to accessibility 

00:24:56.423 --> 00:24:58.423
issues.

00:25:02.117 --> 00:25:04.117
testing.

00:25:08.502 --> 00:25:11.168
understand how your products are
used by users with disabilities.

00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:21.156
need to turn --  talk back or 
switch your app because you want

00:25:21.157 --> 00:25:23.157
to be in the 

00:25:25.655 --> 00:25:27.655
user to feel how it is to run an

00:25:28.705 --> 00:25:30.705
service; however, we are aware 
that 

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:35.457
takes time and you cannot test 
for every you make into the app 

00:25:35.458 --> 00:25:37.458
and for that, we 

00:25:41.253 --> 00:25:44.759
provide -- there is also 
automated testing.developed 

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.760
Android accessibility testing 

00:25:50.093 --> 00:25:52.093
also shortly called ATF to 
quickly 

00:25:53.171 --> 00:25:55.171
accessibility issues early in 
the development cycle.

00:25:58.091 --> 00:26:00.091
ATF is an open source library 
which we 

00:26:03.214 --> 00:26:05.214
integrated into express end and 
testing 

00:26:09.407 --> 00:26:11.407
accessibility issues.  ATF 3.

00:26:15.557 --> 00:26:17.557
detail.

00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:24.214
accessibility testing framework.

00:26:27.806 --> 00:26:29.806
report and accessibility 
scanner.

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:35.124
pre-launch report, we're making 
it even 

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:39.229
get accessibility tests results 
by 

00:26:41.139 --> 00:26:43.139
directly into the developer 
console.

00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:46.821
what is play pre-launch report?

00:26:50.587 --> 00:26:52.858
automated testing solution which
calls multiple physical devices 

00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:56.716
and detects developer can fix 
before reaching their end users.

00:26:59.984 --> 00:27:01.984
Including recognizing crashes 
and 

00:27:07.114 --> 00:27:09.114
APK publishd to the Alpha and 
Beta channel.

00:27:14.047 --> 00:27:16.268
play pre-launch report also 
include tests.

00:27:21.622 --> 00:27:23.622
This is yet another example how 
we 

00:27:26.722 --> 00:27:28.722
our core accessibility testing 
library.

00:27:30.998 --> 00:27:34.889
your app as in this example.  
This is a cooking app.It will 

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.890
launch accessibility tests 

00:27:42.022 --> 00:27:44.022
contrast ratio, touch target 
size, missand so on.

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.209
opportunity to fix those -- to 
fix those 

00:27:52.668 --> 00:27:54.668
their app launches and make 
their app 

00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:04.667
which is an app that suggests 

00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:10.812
framework.

00:28:15.514 --> 00:28:17.514
accessibility scanner discovered
more 

00:28:23.505 --> 00:28:25.505
accessibility in apps.

00:28:28.064 --> 00:28:30.064
accessibility scanner.

00:28:32.764 --> 00:28:34.764
A new version of accessibility 

00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:38.423
available today with additional 

00:28:40.939 --> 00:28:42.939
such as traversal order for 
screen elemental.

00:28:49.481 --> 00:28:51.481
suggestion and finally, we also 
allowing 

00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:54.533
threshold for contrast ratio and
touch target size.

00:28:59.283 --> 00:29:03.583
So to download accessibility 
scanner, go to G.co.So to some 

00:29:03.584 --> 00:29:06.472
of the section, we talked 
testing and we showed a number 

00:29:06.473 --> 00:29:08.473
of tools automate testing.

00:29:14.198 --> 00:29:16.198
incorporate manual testing and 
automated testing.

00:29:17.884 --> 00:29:19.884
So please do try out the 
different tools 

00:29:21.355 --> 00:29:25.633
develop the testing strategy for
your app.  Now another vital 

00:29:25.634 --> 00:29:27.634
piece of the puzzle 

00:29:33.087 --> 00:29:35.133
that said, I will hand it off to
Melissa about user research.

00:29:42.094 --> 00:29:46.599
&gt;&gt; MELISSA BARNHART:  Thank you,
Maya.Melissa Barnhart.  I am a 

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.600
researcher on Android.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.050
Now that we have gotten a sneak 
peek on 

00:29:53.562 --> 00:29:55.562
services coming in Android P, I 
would 

00:29:57.422 --> 00:29:59.422
about the role of research and 
role and development process.

00:30:02.762 --> 00:30:04.762
research?

00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:08.905
research focuses on 
understanding user needs and 

00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:10.906
motivations.

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:15.583
understanding the impact of 
design on an audience.

00:30:26.155 --> 00:30:28.155
best for users, but often times 
we don't.

00:30:30.598 --> 00:30:33.876
is truly the expert and by 
seeking experiences.start to 

00:30:33.877 --> 00:30:36.731
challenge our assumptions and 
perspectives.

00:30:41.643 --> 00:30:44.287
Why do we do user research?have 
heard the stat that 9 out of 10 

00:30:47.984 --> 00:30:49.984
but you may not know that the 
number 1 

00:30:51.106 --> 00:30:53.106
failure is lack of a market need
for our product.

00:30:54.957 --> 00:30:57.612
So in those situations, people, 
design products that look for an

00:30:57.613 --> 00:30:59.613
audience who interested in using
them.

00:31:02.702 --> 00:31:04.702
for the opposite.

00:31:08.451 --> 00:31:10.451
validate your ideas and inform 
your 

00:31:14.454 --> 00:31:18.943
Hopefully you're thinking great.
when do I get started?  The 

00:31:18.944 --> 00:31:21.429
short answer is now.User 
research involves a set of 

00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:26.676
along your existing product 
development 

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.832
helping you make decisions at 
each stage.methods like field 

00:31:31.833 --> 00:31:34.281
studies, interviews competitive 
analysis can help you 

00:31:39.203 --> 00:31:41.044
area of technology and uncover 
opportunity areas.Once you have 

00:31:41.045 --> 00:31:43.045
decided what you want to 

00:31:44.725 --> 00:31:46.725
have a prototype, methods like 
cognitive 

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.840
throughs, usability tests or par

00:31:53.107 --> 00:31:56.288
design exercises can help you 
make decisions.  Once your 

00:31:56.289 --> 00:31:58.766
product is out on the products 
like log analysis, diary 

00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:04.471
can help you evaluate its 
performance.

00:32:05.767 --> 00:32:07.767
have a lot of time or 
experience, that's okay.

00:32:10.427 --> 00:32:12.427
take a few hours and talk to a 
few users.

00:32:14.126 --> 00:32:16.126
Nielsen of the Nielsen norm an 
Group 

00:32:18.996 --> 00:32:21.740
results come from small 
affordable studies.

00:32:26.645 --> 00:32:28.645
I would like to show you how 
Android 

00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:32.577
research to rim prove our 
accessibility offerings.Let's 

00:32:32.578 --> 00:32:34.578
take the example of talk back 
feedback.

00:32:38.117 --> 00:32:40.117
Talk back, Google screen writer 
uses by default.

00:32:42.826 --> 00:32:44.826
we wanted to know why.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.490
off while others leave it on?

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.402
where vibration is more or less 
useful 

00:32:55.303 --> 00:32:57.949
pattern or intensities of the 
vibration difference?  Good 

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.592
research starts with good 
questions.

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:08.351
perceptions of vibration 
feedback, we user interviews.

00:33:16.166 --> 00:33:18.166
questions with vibration 
feedback.turn it off?

00:33:22.177 --> 00:33:24.177
of vibration on your phone.

00:33:25.261 --> 00:33:27.261
or just right?

00:33:28.954 --> 00:33:30.954
participate ants needs, we 
prompted them 

00:33:32.416 --> 00:33:34.416
vibration feedback across a 
range of Android phones.

00:33:36.698 --> 00:33:39.184
So the tasks added a usability 
component study.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.670
In the research, we validated a 
real for vibration feedback.

00:33:48.012 --> 00:33:50.012
feedback provides availability 

00:33:53.551 --> 00:33:55.551
in noisy environments when they 
may not 

00:33:56.655 --> 00:33:59.348
hear spoken feedback on their 
device.that the more distinct 

00:33:59.349 --> 00:34:01.598
the vibration more useful.

00:34:06.915 --> 00:34:08.915
wanted the ability to adjust 
vibration 

00:34:10.182 --> 00:34:12.182
according to their personal 
preferences.

00:34:13.703 --> 00:34:15.703
Android P, we're giving greater 
control over vibration feedback.

00:34:20.686 --> 00:34:23.355
to their accessibility settings 
and decrease or disable 

00:34:23.356 --> 00:34:27.066
vibration.beginning.  We will 
continue to make improvements 

00:34:29.927 --> 00:34:31.927
this area as we further 
research.

00:34:38.092 --> 00:34:40.092
and resources to help you going 
forward.

00:34:44.055 --> 00:34:46.055
&gt;&gt; VICTOR TSARAN:  All right.

00:34:50.597 --> 00:34:52.597
for the importance in user 
research in decisions we make.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.100
few more announcements, could 
we.

00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:10.815
like to announce that Voice 
access and 

00:35:12.308 --> 00:35:14.308
service that helps someone with 

00:35:16.218 --> 00:35:18.218
use their Android phone 
completely 

00:35:21.512 --> 00:35:23.955
Voice just simply issue Voice 
commands, is graduating from bet

00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:25.956
A.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.480
research, development, 
iterations, we're 

00:35:33.969 --> 00:35:35.969
ready to launch it and give it 
to you.

00:35:40.513 --> 00:35:42.513
this summer, with new UI 
enhancements, a 

00:35:44.187 --> 00:35:46.187
assist ant immigration and by 
assistant, 

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:49.646
Google assistant just to be sure
coming 

00:35:50.712 --> 00:35:52.712
Google assistant UI and more 
improved overall.

00:35:54.806 --> 00:35:56.806
So look out for Voice access.

00:36:03.204 --> 00:36:05.204
is we decided to package our 

00:36:06.904 --> 00:36:08.904
that you commonly find built 
into an 

00:36:13.229 --> 00:36:15.229
into a single package we call 
Android 

00:36:17.111 --> 00:36:19.760
Some include talk back and for 
people are visually blind and 

00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:21.761
vision impaired.

00:36:25.852 --> 00:36:27.852
that allowed people

00:36:32.351 --> 00:36:34.351
just demoed a few minutes ago.

00:36:47.488 --> 00:36:48.911
services, not just talk back, 
will be discoverable in the Play

00:36:48.912 --> 00:36:50.912
Store as well 

00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:55.371
become a platform for new future

00:36:58.465 --> 00:37:00.465
services we will be developing.

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:09.311
about you a little bit.  Right?
it.  You built a lot of the cool

00:37:09.312 --> 00:37:11.312
stuff too.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.630
evening, we announced Google 
Play awards.

00:37:20.385 --> 00:37:22.385
like to give a shout out to few

excited to give them help.The 

00:37:43.182 --> 00:37:45.182
way the service works is that

us in various Google I/O events.

00:38:26.044 --> 00:38:28.044
the solution is it allows people

&gt;&gt; PRESENTER:  Good afternoon, 
everybody.  Good  afternoon.  

00:59:35.647 --> 00:59:37.647
Hello, hello.

00:59:39.181 --> 00:59:41.205
and I lead the  firebase product
team.  Thank you for joining us 

00:59:41.206 --> 00:59:44.079
today.   We're so excited to be 
here.

00:59:49.515 --> 00:59:51.515
over an overview of firebase, 
highlight 

00:59:54.646 --> 00:59:56.646
year and also talk about ways 
that  

00:59:57.723 --> 00:59:59.352
firebase can help you across the
different stages of app  

00:59:59.353 --> 01:00:01.353
development.

01:00:02.852 --> 01:00:05.505
When we started firebase, we had
a simple vision to help  

01:00:05.506 --> 01:00:07.506
developers built 

01:00:09.609 --> 01:00:11.460
come a long  way since the early
days of expanding the platform 

01:00:11.461 --> 01:00:13.461
from  being a 

01:00:14.976 --> 01:00:17.445
broad app development  platform.
And while our platform and 

01:00:17.446 --> 01:00:19.446
community 

01:00:24.606 --> 01:00:27.451
on helping mobile app teams  
succeed.  And we do this by 

01:00:27.452 --> 01:00:29.452
providing a platform 

01:00:31.148 --> 01:00:33.148
key problems across the 
different 

01:00:34.433 --> 01:00:36.433
stages of app  development from 
helping 

01:00:41.419 --> 01:00:44.076
with  Google infrastructure like
Cloud firestorm and functions to

01:00:44.077 --> 01:00:46.077
helping you 

01:00:47.815 --> 01:00:50.681
your app with tools and  
insights like performance 

01:00:50.682 --> 01:00:52.682
monitoring and crash littics 

01:00:54.573 --> 01:00:59.661
grow your business with Google 
analytics  and remote alike.  So

01:00:59.662 --> 01:01:02.516
whether you are building a brand
app or looking to extend an 

01:01:02.517 --> 01:01:05.202
existing app, we want to help  
you solve these 

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:12.620
more of your  energy towards 
your users and running your 

01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:14.621
business.

01:01:17.518 --> 01:01:19.560
keynote earlier, we have seen  
incredible momentum.  We now 

01:01:19.561 --> 01:01:21.561
have over 1.

01:01:25.977 --> 01:01:28.221
firebase every month including 
many global  partners that you 

01:01:28.222 --> 01:01:30.222
may recognize.

01:01:31.691 --> 01:01:33.691
you are trusts us with your apps

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.020
whether you are a sole  
developers or working in large 

01:01:37.021 --> 01:01:41.262
teams. committed to  helping 
companies of all sizes to 

01:01:41.263 --> 01:01:43.263
succeed.

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:47.010
So you may have  heard earlier, 
we  number of updates last year.

01:01:49.052 --> 01:01:51.052
We  released four new products 
and 

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:56.408
our own internal learnings and 
tools, but most important  and 

01:01:56.409 --> 01:01:58.678
most valuable of all based on 
your feedback.

01:02:05.098 --> 01:02:07.098
many developers is data privacy.

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:14.735
soon take effect.  So to  help 
developers succeed under the new

01:02:14.736 --> 01:02:16.736
regulations, we have  updated 

01:02:18.011 --> 01:02:20.869
of service to include a data 
processing  and security terms 

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.870
and have worked hard 

01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:26.161
to meet compliance needs with 
many 

01:02:29.098 --> 01:02:31.098
privacy and  security standards 
like 

01:02:33.979 --> 01:02:35.623
you are building with world 
class data security and  

01:02:35.624 --> 01:02:37.624
protection.

01:02:40.974 --> 01:02:42.974
firebase products work  and see 
them in 

01:02:46.087 --> 01:02:48.087
and hear from  some of our 
partners.

01:02:53.245 --> 01:02:55.245
a developer team of  only 3.

01:02:57.353 --> 01:02:59.353
this scale  without firebase.

01:03:02.053 --> 01:03:04.053
So we use firebase to take care 
of our 

01:03:05.151 --> 01:03:08.053
notifications.  Our app  
continues to grow and we're 

01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:11.069
focusing more on stability and  

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.159
now we're starting to 
investigate how  firebase can 

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.160
also help us there.

01:03:18.646 --> 01:03:20.646
No one wants to use it from the 
nice  user interface.

01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:25.998
time and helping us  pinpoint 
the root cause.  It helps us to 

01:03:25.999 --> 01:03:27.999
prioritize.

01:03:29.481 --> 01:03:31.481
and then you can fix the crash  
with the most users.

01:03:34.568 --> 01:03:39.476
time to concentrate  on user 
growth. firebase.  Now  we're 

01:03:39.477 --> 01:03:41.477
able to run smarter campaigns 
that drive deeper  engagements.

01:03:45.233 --> 01:03:47.233
increase in the usage alternate 
back 

01:03:50.314 --> 01:03:52.157
&gt;&gt; Mobile games, user retention 
is one of the toughest  

01:03:52.158 --> 01:03:54.158
problems.  When we heard about 
firebase 

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:59.328
we  wanted to see if people 
increase retention by targeting 

01:03:59.329 --> 01:04:01.329
the  right users.

01:04:04.095 --> 01:04:06.929
success by serving  those who 
predictd to the turn we saw a 

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.930
20% gain retention.

01:04:12.093 --> 01:04:14.137
a fantastic partner giving us 
scalable  easy to use 

01:04:14.138 --> 01:04:16.138
infrastructure.

01:04:19.882 --> 01:04:21.882
&gt;&gt; We can drive engagement.

01:04:25.865 --> 01:04:27.865
thanks to the power of  Google's
machine learning.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.639
past partners and  all

01:04:40.018 --> 01:04:42.018
you.

01:04:44.093 --> 01:04:46.093
Growing user retention and 
photos, you 

01:04:47.409 --> 01:04:49.409
can see how  firebase can help 
you  stages.

01:04:54.277 --> 01:04:56.277
and talk about each of  these 
stages in 

01:04:57.370 --> 01:05:02.104
some of the  updates.  To start,
I would like to welcome Alex, 

01:05:02.105 --> 01:05:04.105
our lead  Product Manager 
focusing 

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:10.270
ways to use firebase to build a 
better app.  Alex?  Good 

01:05:10.271 --> 01:05:12.936
afternoon.  Thank  you for 
coming.

01:05:21.365 --> 01:05:23.365
about app  development is just 
how fast our industry evolves.

01:05:31.217 --> 01:05:33.896
today compared to just a  few 
years ago is really staggering.

01:05:38.366 --> 01:05:40.366
More than ever,  building 
successful 

01:05:42.867 --> 01:05:44.867
requires from developers to  
carefully pick their battles.

01:05:54.547 --> 01:05:56.165
grab off the shelf are make or 
break decisions from  anyone 

01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:58.235
from the start ups to the 
uncorns.

01:06:03.154 --> 01:06:05.228
And one of the key goals has 
been since its very creation to 

01:06:05.229 --> 01:06:07.229
empower 

01:06:08.692 --> 01:06:10.692
build better, more successful 
apps  

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:14.170
precisely by allowing them to 
make the 

01:06:16.653 --> 01:06:19.695
infrastructure.  Excuse me this 
is something  that I experienced

01:06:19.696 --> 01:06:21.696
first hand.

01:06:23.763 --> 01:06:26.473
I  spent five years building and
growing a start up that was  

01:06:26.474 --> 01:06:28.693
powered by many firebase 
products.

01:06:31.964 --> 01:06:33.964
built a realtime  collaboration 
out.

01:06:36.668 --> 01:06:38.668
We built all our sync engine 
fully in  house.

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:43.404
infrastructure was incredibly  
difficult.  And the time we were

01:06:43.405 --> 01:06:45.405
spending doing 

01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:50.289
would be better spent on 
focusing on 

01:06:52.025 --> 01:06:54.025
the core  user experience of our
product.

01:06:57.566 --> 01:06:59.566
That's how we  started using the
firebase realtime database.

01:07:02.654 --> 01:07:04.654
within a week of prototyping 
with  my 

01:07:09.372 --> 01:07:10.801
a product and decided to  
refactor our whole lab with the 

01:07:10.802 --> 01:07:12.802
database.

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:17.786
of the best engineering and 
business  decisions that we made

01:07:17.787 --> 01:07:19.787
as a start up 

01:07:24.939 --> 01:07:26.971
go faster and it helped us focus
on features that matterd  to our

01:07:26.972 --> 01:07:28.972
users 

01:07:30.861 --> 01:07:32.861
that  essentially wasn't core to
our business.

01:07:34.754 --> 01:07:37.019
And to me, that is  what 
firebase really is about.

01:07:42.718 --> 01:07:44.550
Of course since then, firebase 
has brook a much broader  

01:07:44.551 --> 01:07:46.551
platform.

01:07:48.835 --> 01:07:51.117
Firebase developers have 
evolved.diverse than ever.

01:07:54.166 --> 01:07:56.166
In a typical size of  firebase 
teams  rapidly.

01:07:59.501 --> 01:08:01.501
So today, one of  our core 
focuses is 

01:08:04.005 --> 01:08:06.005
to adapt to make firebase just 
as  

01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:12.330
of the size of your team or the 
steal  scale of  your app.

01:08:16.228 --> 01:08:19.069
That's why we build apps that  
are  everythingo northeastic to 

01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:21.070
scale.

01:08:22.943 --> 01:08:24.943
Going forward, you will  also 
see us 

01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:29.619
that help you  better monitor 
your infrastructure and test 

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.620
your code and in 

01:08:33.328 --> 01:08:35.328
secure apps.  So now let's talk 
about some of these 

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.260
exciting updates that we have 
for   developer tools.

01:08:47.083 --> 01:08:49.083
Firestorm that stores  and 
synchronizes 

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.360
app data at global scale.

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:59.167
is NoSQL that am addresses some 
of the toughest problems of  

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:01.168
dealing with app data.

01:09:05.372 --> 01:09:07.372
firestore allows to you access 
your data 

01:09:11.085 --> 01:09:13.772
removingd need to build a proxy 
layer between  your data and 

01:09:13.773 --> 01:09:15.773
your app.

01:09:18.885 --> 01:09:20.929
to  your data as it changes in 
realtime making building rich  

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:23.611
interactive apps much, much 
easier.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.200
today

01:09:50.822 --> 01:09:52.822
--

01:09:53.942 --> 01:09:56.407
caught  firestore is also a 
strongly consistent replicated 

01:09:56.408 --> 01:09:58.408
database  that 

01:10:01.733 --> 01:10:04.414
of queries than the predecessor 
and  all those new queries have 

01:10:04.415 --> 01:10:06.415
the 

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:11.836
with the results sets, not the 
data sets.  What that  means is 

01:10:11.837 --> 01:10:13.837
that you won't be 

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.500
and building  your back end 
every time 

01:10:18.791 --> 01:10:20.791
you have ten extra users.

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:27.200
industry leading database  
systems like table and mega 

01:10:27.201 --> 01:10:29.201
store and now spanner.

01:10:31.721 --> 01:10:33.721
knowledge to give you a 
powerfully  

01:10:38.638 --> 01:10:40.638
simple database to serve your 
useers

01:10:55.068 --> 01:10:56.095
if you have used  Cloud 
firestore already, it won't come

01:10:56.096 --> 01:10:58.096
as a surprise to 

01:11:00.817 --> 01:11:02.817
of these users are also using  

01:11:04.066 --> 01:11:06.930
functions in their workflows.  
Cloud Functions which we  

01:11:06.931 --> 01:11:09.586
launched  year, let's you 
automatically run back 

01:11:16.745 --> 01:11:18.745
end  code in response to codes 
in AGDPS requests.

01:11:22.581 --> 01:11:24.581
users  all over the world using 

01:11:25.628 --> 01:11:27.628
functions to build deceptively  
simple workflows.

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:33.387
use case for us is the  Hamilton
act.  In particular because 

01:11:33.388 --> 01:11:35.388
their usage is so  spikey.

01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:40.600
start a new lottery to sell 
tickets,  millions ever users 

01:11:40.601 --> 01:11:42.601
Connectality the 

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.733
of requests in a very short 
period of time.

01:11:49.252 --> 01:11:51.252
CloudFunctions automatically 
scales 

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:55.235
human action or intervention and
Hamilton only pays for the  

01:11:55.236 --> 01:11:57.236
resources 

01:11:59.543 --> 01:12:01.543
massively over  provision.

01:12:06.897 --> 01:12:08.897
new features based  on your 
feedback.

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:12.630
for calling  functions.  This 
make integrating back end 

01:12:14.673 --> 01:12:16.673
functionality  into your app 
much, much easier.

01:12:19.806 --> 01:12:21.806
in our tooling, which was a very
popular 

01:12:23.774 --> 01:12:25.774
improvement has been the 
expansion of  

01:12:27.049 --> 01:12:29.487
the ability to unit test your 
functions before you deploy  

01:12:29.488 --> 01:12:31.488
them.

01:12:33.167 --> 01:12:35.467
catch the problem  early on 
before they hit production.

01:12:40.791 --> 01:12:43.685
added new  monitoring tools to 
Cloud functions.  This make its 

01:12:43.686 --> 01:12:45.686
easier  to test and 

01:12:47.003 --> 01:12:51.111
to production.  You can  keep 
tab on any errors in your 

01:12:51.112 --> 01:12:53.112
functions and track your  
functions 

01:12:54.596 --> 01:12:56.596
latency and memory usage.

01:12:59.927 --> 01:13:01.927
When we say  that firebase 
empowers 

01:13:04.648 --> 01:13:07.343
than just scalable 
infrastructure.  We want to help

01:13:07.344 --> 01:13:09.344
you  with tasks that 

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.660
either  authentication.

01:13:18.373 --> 01:13:20.373
It is currently being used by 
hundreds 

01:13:23.887 --> 01:13:25.887
millions of users every  day 
over 80 

01:13:27.386 --> 01:13:29.386
million people sign in to an app
using firebase  authentication.

01:13:31.277 --> 01:13:34.153
you  signed in.  So these are 
new sign ins.

01:13:40.326 --> 01:13:42.326
with the digits team from 
fabric, we 

01:13:43.335 --> 01:13:45.335
introduce

01:13:48.293 --> 01:13:50.293
d   have seen to make sign in as

01:13:54.491 --> 01:13:56.491
To  that end, we just released 
passwordless sign in.

01:13:58.391 --> 01:14:00.391
essentially just click on a 
button on  

01:14:03.316 --> 01:14:08.829
your app and then click on the 
link. remember.  You have one 

01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:10.830
less thing to cause friction in 
your sign up.

01:14:16.656 --> 01:14:18.656
these addition  into fire a base
UI, 

01:14:19.727 --> 01:14:21.727
the open source library 
providing  UI flows.

01:14:24.569 --> 01:14:26.569
on I/O

01:14:33.197 --> 01:14:35.197
on I/O S.

01:14:36.508 --> 01:14:38.508
You heard earlier  today, 
machine 

01:14:40.156 --> 01:14:42.156
learning in AI are a huge focus 
at Google.

01:14:44.251 --> 01:14:46.251
fault that machine learning has 
the 

01:14:49.134 --> 01:14:51.134
potential to unlock  so many 
interesting challenges.

01:14:54.248 --> 01:14:56.248
to make sure  that all 
developers have 

01:14:57.925 --> 01:14:59.925
easy access to the power of 
machine  learning.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.711
launching ML Kit into Beta  
bringing the power of machine 

01:15:05.712 --> 01:15:07.712
learning right into 

01:15:11.749 --> 01:15:13.749
and I

01:15:15.282 --> 01:15:17.282
I os.

01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:20.350
It suspect phase detection, bar 
code  

01:15:22.031 --> 01:15:24.095
scanning, image labeling and 
land mark detection.

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:29.181
They let  you build ML powered 
experiences without needing 

01:15:29.182 --> 01:15:31.182
extensive  

01:15:32.296 --> 01:15:34.296
background in machine learning.

01:15:42.765 --> 01:15:44.765
For those with advanced needs, 
ML Kit 

01:15:47.896 --> 01:15:49.343
Tensorflow light models and 
serves  them through Googles 

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:51.344
global infrastructure.

01:15:54.628 --> 01:15:56.628
models and evaluate them on 
device 

01:15:57.734 --> 01:15:59.734
without having  to bundle the 
model with 

01:16:00.996 --> 01:16:02.996
the app. this  example.

01:16:05.698 --> 01:16:07.698
Let's take a look at disco, a 
partner 

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:11.356
who  integrated with ML Kit.

01:16:14.255 --> 01:16:16.255
that enables  creators to 
transform 

01:16:17.352 --> 01:16:19.352
photos with powerful editing 
presets.

01:16:22.507 --> 01:16:25.102
can be difficult to select the  
best pre-sets for an image.

01:16:32.069 --> 01:16:32.675
were able to build a 
recommendation feature that  

01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:34.676
automatically recognizes 

01:16:37.017 --> 01:16:39.017
order to  suggest the best 
presets.

01:16:41.342 --> 01:16:43.342
For example, if the creator 
added  a 

01:16:45.427 --> 01:16:47.427
ideal portraitor or presets.

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:52.182
Importantly, all the subject 
matter wrecking onnition is  

01:16:52.183 --> 01:16:54.183
done -- 

01:16:56.847 --> 01:16:58.847
is done on the device including 
user  privacy.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:07.650
over the next  upcoming months 
and years.

01:17:09.329 --> 01:17:10.781
more about  Tcheck out the 
session on machine learning and 

01:17:10.782 --> 01:17:12.830
mobile  devices tomorrow at 
3:30.

01:17:17.748 --> 01:17:19.748
how it is easier to  build your 
app if you use firebase.

01:17:22.474 --> 01:17:24.474
want to learn  more, be sure to 
check 

01:17:26.097 --> 01:17:28.487
out our session on 9:30.

01:17:36.597 --> 01:17:38.597
I will turn it over to Kris  I 
Kristen.

01:17:43.274 --> 01:17:45.274
Good afternoon,  everybody.

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:54.099
of the  fabric team a year ago. 
The goals of fabric even back 

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.100
when  we 

01:17:59.311 --> 01:18:01.348
developers build their  apps, 
understand their users and grow 

01:18:01.349 --> 01:18:03.349
their 

01:18:06.394 --> 01:18:08.394
businesses just  like fireface
base.

01:18:12.599 --> 01:18:14.599
And I'm excited to be a  part of
it.

01:18:30.067 --> 01:18:32.067
We found that 42% mentions 
crashes or bugs.

01:18:37.995 --> 01:18:39.995
reviews mention speed,  design 
and usability.

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.500
between app  quality and 
customer 

01:18:47.137 --> 01:18:50.945
satisfaction and retention is  
undeniable. help.  Over the past

01:18:50.946 --> 01:18:53.621
year, we have been working to 
make a number of improvements 

01:18:58.583 --> 01:18:59.832
improvements so they're ready 
for the  largest and most 

01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:01.833
complex apps out there.

01:19:03.299 --> 01:19:05.299
some improvements.

01:19:10.275 --> 01:19:15.470
over the last year was  having  
in GA.  They're  best in class 

01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:17.692
crash reporter.  We are excited 
to share today  that 

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.107
app developers keep their apps  
stable under 3 billion devices 

01:19:24.108 --> 01:19:26.108
world wide.

01:19:28.027 --> 01:19:30.305
to help so many of you build a 
better user  experience.

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:39.290
this so you can seat  trail of 
events leading up to a crash.

01:19:41.768 --> 01:19:47.004
them bread  crumbs.  In fact, 
bread crumbs is one of the main 

01:19:47.005 --> 01:19:49.005
reasons  that our partner we 

01:19:53.117 --> 01:19:55.117
to try out.

01:19:56.165 --> 01:19:58.165
Wetransfer  is a company that 
helps 

01:20:00.242 --> 01:20:03.333
users share files easily to stay
in  the  while working.  They 

01:20:03.334 --> 01:20:05.334
have 40 million  active users 

01:20:06.439 --> 01:20:08.476
that share over 1 billion files 
every   it's critical that each 

01:20:08.477 --> 01:20:10.477
one of them 

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.940
goes off without a  hitch.

01:20:15.632 --> 01:20:17.632
goal and maybe an  obsession 
with 

01:20:19.202 --> 01:20:21.202
getting as closa 100% crash free
as possible.

01:20:23.889 --> 01:20:26.185
achievable, they have a help 
metric  of 99.9%.

01:20:29.899 --> 01:20:31.899
If it ever gets below that, they
stop 

01:20:33.989 --> 01:20:38.309
fix crashes.  Bread crumb shows 
the actions that a user  takes 

01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:43.411
leading up to a crash. so much  
easier.  And the team no longer 

01:20:43.412 --> 01:20:47.720
needs to figure out how to  
produce the problem  can be a 

01:20:47.721 --> 01:20:49.741
lengthy and  frustrating 
process.

01:20:54.885 --> 01:20:56.885
has been a game changer  for 
them.

01:21:00.964 --> 01:21:02.964
While 100% crash free is

01:21:05.968 --> 01:21:07.968
audacious goal, we  are hope of 
it can

01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:11.699
hoping it can help.

01:21:14.789 --> 01:21:17.283
you  have already used and the 
crash is affecting a large  

01:21:17.284 --> 01:21:19.284
percentage of user base.

01:21:21.016 --> 01:21:24.102
team and select  the channel of 
your choosing.  We have many 

01:21:24.103 --> 01:21:26.103
more innovations  to come.  So 
stay tuned.

01:21:31.309 --> 01:21:33.309
We're super excited about the 
future 

01:21:36.151 --> 01:21:41.317
of crash litlittics.   The 
product will continue to be  

01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:44.003
until September,  but we 
encourage to you try out 

01:21:44.004 --> 01:21:46.278
crashlittics and oup grade  to 
it today.

01:22:06.162 --> 01:22:08.162
last year, we have battled 
tested the  

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.260
STK, we're excited to announce 
it is 

01:22:14.005 --> 01:22:18.296
Along with this comes a few new 
exciting features.   We have 

01:22:18.297 --> 01:22:20.297
heard feedback that there is 

01:22:22.009 --> 01:22:23.830
lot of useful data in  our 
console you can slice and dice 

01:22:23.831 --> 01:22:25.831
by things like 

01:22:28.329 --> 01:22:30.240
attributes, but we have heard it
can be  tough to be the most 

01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:34.147
important issues   data.  Today 
we're announcing the addition of

01:22:35.777 --> 01:22:40.262
the new issues  speed.  We do 
the digging for you. will find 

01:22:40.263 --> 01:22:42.263
it at the  top of your 

01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:47.370
performance monitoring console 
dashboard 

01:22:50.918 --> 01:22:52.918
issues you should be paying  
attention to.

01:22:54.591 --> 01:22:56.591
You can also dig into that issue
and 

01:23:01.513 --> 01:23:04.000
We're also now collecting more 
metrics  out of the box than 

01:23:04.001 --> 01:23:06.001
ever before.

01:23:08.505 --> 01:23:10.953
and network request, we now have
data on slow and frozen  frames.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.986
information  automatically for 
every page on your app.  Between

01:23:19.987 --> 01:23:22.682
custom  traces you set up  our 
out of the box metrics,  

01:23:24.513 --> 01:23:26.513
performance monalitorring has 
your back 

01:23:28.623 --> 01:23:30.623
experience out in the wild.

01:23:31.664 --> 01:23:33.664
Now, one  of our partners Swigy,
is 

01:23:34.972 --> 01:23:38.046
in India.  They started using 
performance monitoring  about a 

01:23:38.047 --> 01:23:40.047
year ago.

01:23:42.952 --> 01:23:44.952
STK on their  app, they realized
they had a problem.

01:23:46.681 --> 01:23:48.681
First impressions  last forever.

01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:53.634
diagnose the issues  that were 
causing  down.

01:23:56.912 --> 01:23:59.348
Those  fix over time.  Swigy was
able to make the start time 

01:24:05.734 --> 01:24:07.734
12X on I/O S.

01:24:16.368 --> 01:24:17.798
They saw an  increase in daily 
orders.  These type of increases

01:24:17.799 --> 01:24:19.799
really  matter 

01:24:22.486 --> 01:24:24.486
you have over 350,000 orders 
every day.

01:24:29.293 --> 01:24:31.293
puzzle.

01:24:35.764 --> 01:24:38.617
platform.  In  that spirit, 
today we're expanding 

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.660
Firebase test lab to  include 
I/O S.

01:24:54.972 --> 01:24:57.877
and virtual devices  that allow 
you to  and OS versions.

01:25:01.781 --> 01:25:04.031
With the addition of tesla for 
iOS, we help you get on a  high 

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:06.032
quality state 

01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:09.310
before you even release it  into
the app store.

01:25:12.842 --> 01:25:14.940
One of our partners Spotify goes
to   insure that each and every 

01:25:14.941 --> 01:25:16.941
one of the 

01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:20.619
users  has a great experience 
when the user is streaming app.

01:25:22.938 --> 01:25:24.938
They  have end to end tests they
set up every night.

01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:31.582
Before  Firebase, they even 
built  homegrown device farm.   

01:25:31.583 --> 01:25:32.827
They found -- whatever time they
found was hard to maintain  it 

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:35.083
and scale  as well as found that
some of the tests 

01:25:38.131 --> 01:25:40.131
would often fail unexpectedly 
and they 

01:25:41.451 --> 01:25:43.695
that they trusted.  Spotify 
decided they no longer  wanted 

01:25:47.153 --> 01:25:49.817
and  testing infrastructure.  So
they turned to Firebase test  

01:25:49.818 --> 01:25:51.818
lab.

01:25:58.795 --> 01:26:01.695
immediate insight to where tests
fail.   They have long-term 

01:26:01.696 --> 01:26:04.552
access to test  pops up.

01:26:07.839 --> 01:26:10.111
Spotify loves the scale ant and 
reliability of test lab.

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:17.468
in  test lab, is they 
experienced a 2X increase in 

01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:19.469
testing  throughput.

01:26:24.595 --> 01:26:26.420
confidence so they  can stay 
focus on what's important to 

01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:28.421
their business  

01:26:30.087 --> 01:26:32.087
to fans around the world.

01:26:35.739 --> 01:26:41.318
We're  excited that test lab is
lab is across the platform. to 

01:26:41.319 --> 01:26:43.319
be an early tester, go to the 

01:26:45.043 --> 01:26:47.087
Firebase console or  use this 
URL to get on the waiting list.

01:26:54.733 --> 01:26:56.733
device lab and want to  see it 
in 

01:26:59.843 --> 01:27:02.035
right out the  doors right 
there.  To hear more about how 

01:27:02.036 --> 01:27:04.036
you can  

01:27:06.802 --> 01:27:09.064
transfer swigy and  Spotify did,
we have another talk tomorrow 

01:27:09.065 --> 01:27:11.065
that focusing 

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:14.936
on stage 7.

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:20.666
is improves  management and 
growing a 

01:27:21.782 --> 01:27:23.414
but there is  more to this 
story.  To hear more about this,

01:27:23.415 --> 01:27:25.415
I would like  

01:27:28.544 --> 01:27:30.544
on stage.  Grow your users and  
increase 

01:27:33.617 --> 01:27:35.617
management with Firebase.

01:27:46.849 --> 01:27:49.112
Christen.  You get  ready is to 
launch your app, 

01:27:52.811 --> 01:27:55.250
important area  that they focus 
on.  Growth.  This is a problem 

01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:57.251
that's  personal to 

01:27:58.344 --> 01:27:59.988
to joining Google, I was  
building consumer mobile apps 

01:27:59.989 --> 01:28:01.989
like many of you.

01:28:07.567 --> 01:28:09.567
we had a successful launch.

01:28:13.322 --> 01:28:15.322
Had over  5,000 5-star reviews 
until 

01:28:18.434 --> 01:28:20.078
only used our app for about 10 
days and then  disappeared 

01:28:20.079 --> 01:28:22.079
forever.

01:28:24.992 --> 01:28:26.992
new  downlet's every day, the 
number of 

01:28:28.671 --> 01:28:30.671
daily active users on our  app 
was not growing at all.

01:28:32.352 --> 01:28:34.385
that retention and  engagement 
are really hard problems to 

01:28:34.386 --> 01:28:36.386
solve and a  

01:28:37.868 --> 01:28:40.935
doesn't translate into a  
successful business.  As we 

01:28:40.936 --> 01:28:42.936
talked to other app teams about 

01:28:45.434 --> 01:28:48.269
solving these problems, we heard
one thing  consistently repeated

01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:50.270
about the growth process.  
experimentation.

01:28:53.859 --> 01:28:55.694
You can rely purely on 
intuition.  It is  more 

01:28:55.695 --> 01:29:00.846
effective to run an  let data 
drive  product decisions.  With 

01:29:00.847 --> 01:29:02.847
Firebase, we built products that

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.540
of the experimentation process.

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:13.229
First you observe what users are
doing inside your apps. make a 

01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:15.076
hypothesis about how to improve 
their  behavior with respect to 

01:29:15.077 --> 01:29:17.077
your business goals.

01:29:22.319 --> 01:29:24.967
test  that hypothesis by trying 
a new product and experience.  

01:29:24.968 --> 01:29:26.968
And  then you analyze the user 
response.

01:29:33.113 --> 01:29:35.113
In Firebase, we're  building 
tools to  scale this process.

01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:39.390
You can  iterate quickly and 
watch new 

01:29:43.755 --> 01:29:45.755
your business.

01:29:52.562 --> 01:29:56.042
for Firebase which help  you 
observe user behavior. 

01:29:56.043 --> 01:29:58.497
understand where  your users are
coming from, what they're 

01:29:58.498 --> 01:30:00.498
engaging, how often  

01:30:02.205 --> 01:30:04.205
how much revenue you are 
generating.

01:30:05.284 --> 01:30:07.284
Now  with Firebase, you can 
always see 

01:30:09.401 --> 01:30:11.401
afternoonp and last year, we had
the 

01:30:12.897 --> 01:30:14.897
ability to  see anmyselfd for 
individual users.

01:30:16.752 --> 01:30:22.107
view  and streamview.  Now we're
excited to give you the ability 

01:30:22.108 --> 01:30:24.140
to level up and see aggregated  
for all apps of  your project.

01:30:28.208 --> 01:30:30.208
If you have an I/O S version, 
you can 

01:30:32.929 --> 01:30:36.422
and are the metrics are trending
across your business.  This 

01:30:36.423 --> 01:30:40.141
means you can now analyze data  
levels.  Across all your apps 

01:30:40.142 --> 01:30:42.142
for an individual 

01:30:43.649 --> 01:30:45.649
app  and even an individual 
user.

01:30:48.029 --> 01:30:49.914
visibility  in the user behavior
is critical because to drive 

01:30:49.915 --> 01:30:51.915
both, you  

01:30:56.110 --> 01:30:58.201
find segments to ultimately make
a guess on how to improve the 

01:30:58.202 --> 01:31:00.202
metrics.

01:31:02.506 --> 01:31:04.514
and Google Analytics help with 
you this segment segmentation.

01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:14.574
can segment users on  what they 
have done in the past. Firebase,

01:31:14.575 --> 01:31:17.017
you  have an additional way to 
segment users by predicting 

01:31:17.018 --> 01:31:19.281
their  future behavior.

01:31:22.953 --> 01:31:24.812
of looking back what they have  
done, you can ask them to look 

01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:28.705
forward on what  do.  Using a 
combination of audiences and  

01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:32.530
predictions, you can target 
users to drive a better outcome.

01:31:38.573 --> 01:31:40.573
Firebase  predictions and we 
launched 

01:31:43.104 --> 01:31:45.189
expertise and machine learning 
to the Analytics dat from  your 

01:31:45.190 --> 01:31:47.190
apps.

01:31:50.339 --> 01:31:52.339
it forms future  behavior.

01:31:53.644 --> 01:31:55.644
Out of the box, Firebase can 
predict 

01:31:57.114 --> 01:32:00.015
make purchases and which will 
turn.  But if  you are tracking 

01:32:00.016 --> 01:32:02.016
conversion of 

01:32:06.797 --> 01:32:08.797
machine learning models can 
begin to 

01:32:10.254 --> 01:32:12.254
predict like listening  to a 
song or sharing photos.

01:32:15.364 --> 01:32:18.441
we have made  predicts on 4 
billion app users.  So Google 

01:32:18.442 --> 01:32:20.442
analytics and  predictions 

01:32:22.707 --> 01:32:24.536
segway users that might be  
underperform.  They give you 

01:32:24.537 --> 01:32:27.398
actions to take so you  and 
improve the health of your 

01:32:27.399 --> 01:32:29.399
business.

01:32:30.586 --> 01:32:32.586
You can personalize the product 

01:32:35.808 --> 01:32:37.808
config maybe to help convert a 
user.

01:32:39.459 --> 01:32:41.459
Or send a  highly relevant 
message to 

01:32:44.767 --> 01:32:46.767
to  bring users back into the 
app.

01:32:51.504 --> 01:32:53.770
control the behavior  and 
appearance of  updates to the  

01:32:53.771 --> 01:32:55.771
app store.  This is really 
important because we 

01:33:00.490 --> 01:33:03.328
not only takes days away from  
valuable engineering resources, 

01:33:03.329 --> 01:33:05.329
but users also 

01:33:08.114 --> 01:33:12.144
their apps.  If you use remote 
config like  marketing copy, the

01:33:12.145 --> 01:33:14.145
size and color of 

01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:19.059
or  even the layout and flow of 
the app, ask you tweak the  

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.060
values -- you 

01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:24.510
instantly to users.   Now 
another powerful aspect is that 

01:33:28.846 --> 01:33:32.945
on Google Analytics audiences 
and Firebase  predictions.  

01:33:32.946 --> 01:33:35.010
Maybe you want to incentivize 
users by  them a discounts or 

01:33:35.011 --> 01:33:38.300
how about changing the theme of 
your app to be more receptive.

01:33:42.568 --> 01:33:44.027
built to  provide personalized 
experiences and keep users 

01:33:44.028 --> 01:33:46.028
engaged and  

01:33:49.343 --> 01:33:51.343
Another action you  can use to 

01:33:53.266 --> 01:33:55.266
optimize your business is 
Firebase Cloud  messaging.

01:33:58.115 --> 01:34:00.115
right  message to the rights 
users to 

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:04.478
app  and keep them engaged.  
Whether using API or console, we

01:34:04.479 --> 01:34:06.479
give 

01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:10.599
were sent and  opened.  One 
common practice is send 

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.600
messagings 

01:34:15.497 --> 01:34:18.568
your app in some time to improve
retention.   We can proactively 

01:34:18.569 --> 01:34:22.517
reach out to users  to  turn.  
This is a powerful tool because 

01:34:22.518 --> 01:34:26.775
it allows to you  intervene 
before it is  you the best  

01:34:26.776 --> 01:34:30.247
chance of improving retention.  
Now as we mentioned before,  

01:34:30.248 --> 01:34:32.248
whether 

01:34:34.749 --> 01:34:37.450
remote config or Cloud  
messaging, you want to test 

01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:39.694
these actions and make sure  
improving your business before 

01:34:39.695 --> 01:34:41.695
you expose  all of your users to
them.

01:34:49.343 --> 01:34:50.770
So AB testing let's you use data
to drive your product  

01:34:50.771 --> 01:34:52.771
decisions.

01:34:54.836 --> 01:34:56.836
You define the various

01:35:01.033 --> 01:35:03.677
and you have  randomly 
distributing your user base to 

01:35:03.678 --> 01:35:05.678
the complex analysis  

01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:09.761
variant is achieving the best 
results.   AV testing make its 

01:35:09.762 --> 01:35:11.762
simple.

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.522
secondary goals so that you can 
insure that a winner  is not 

01:35:17.523 --> 01:35:19.523
only improving 

01:35:21.725 --> 01:35:23.943
retention.  Once you verify the 
results, you can result  

01:35:23.944 --> 01:35:25.944
experience out to all of your 
users.

01:35:34.892 --> 01:35:36.892
use Firebase for  their app.

01:35:42.168 --> 01:35:44.199
would receive an  apcurrinsey to
win prizes and make the game 

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.200
more enjoyable.

01:35:50.542 --> 01:35:52.542
models and most publishers, they

01:35:53.962 --> 01:35:55.962
didn't have the

01:35:57.142 --> 01:35:59.142
time or resources to dedicate to
this.

01:36:01.643 --> 01:36:03.643
Firebase AB testing and remote 
config, 

01:36:05.186 --> 01:36:07.186
they were able  to use the 
console.

01:36:08.615 --> 01:36:10.680
received the  promotion, another
group where users were loved the

01:36:10.681 --> 01:36:15.392
promotion  3 and finally a group
that  would only see the 

01:36:15.393 --> 01:36:17.393
promotion if there were 
predicted to  turn.

01:36:19.871 --> 01:36:21.506
the system found was a 20% 
increase in retention  rate when

01:36:21.507 --> 01:36:29.282
showingthe  to  turn.  Really 
amazing results.  So we just saw

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:34.214
how Firebase  helps  process.   
Google Analytics let's you 

01:36:34.215 --> 01:36:39.135
observe what users are doing in 
your app and  based on past 

01:36:39.136 --> 01:36:41.393
behavior.   Firebase 
predictions, you can find 

01:36:44.678 --> 01:36:46.980
they might do in the future.  
Once you found  segments to 

01:36:46.981 --> 01:36:51.707
improve,   various actions.  You
can personalizethe product with 

01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:57.905
remote  config or highly 
relevant  other users with Cloud

01:36:57.906 --> 01:37:00.347
messaging.  Most importantly, 
you can do this in a 

01:37:05.611 --> 01:37:10.885
safe, low  risk way byes using 
AV testing.  If you are 

01:37:10.886 --> 01:37:12.935
interested in  learning more 
about how Firebase can help you 

01:37:15.372 --> 01:37:19.900
your app,  check out the session
tomorrow morning at 8:30.S a lot

01:37:19.901 --> 01:37:23.798
of  new features coming in  
Analytics.  So I encourage you  

01:37:23.799 --> 01:37:26.655
on do that as well.  That will 
be 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

01:37:29.746 --> 01:37:31.746
it over to Francis to talk about
what is up for  Firebase.

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.665
I am super excited about the  
future of app developments and 

01:37:41.666 --> 01:37:43.666
the  ahead.

01:37:46.905 --> 01:37:50.682
As  you  you have seen from some
of the developments, across 

01:37:50.683 --> 01:37:52.683
Google  we're 

01:37:54.372 --> 01:37:57.244
the technologies to enable  
developers like you to shape the

01:37:57.245 --> 01:37:59.245
future of app development.

01:38:03.745 --> 01:38:07.316
exciting part for us is what all
of you have  built.  Last year, 

01:38:07.317 --> 01:38:09.317
I am on a team of 

01:38:12.048 --> 01:38:14.087
a sign language translation app 
to help hearing  disabilities to

01:38:14.088 --> 01:38:19.835
better communicate.  because not
only did it help their quality 

01:38:19.836 --> 01:38:25.618
of lives, but  also for the 
community around them. 

01:38:25.619 --> 01:38:26.787
inspirations like  this that 
motivate all of us in Firebase 

01:38:26.788 --> 01:38:29.659
to work hard and  helping you 
succeed.

01:38:34.987 --> 01:38:36.987
ahead, we will telephone  to 
deepen into 

01:38:39.464 --> 01:38:42.251
to to help you  solve key 
problems.

01:38:46.745 --> 01:38:48.745
Further more, we'll be expanding

01:38:50.405 --> 01:38:52.053
to web experience on the web  to
help you scale better through 

01:38:52.054 --> 01:38:54.054
Google Cloud 

01:38:57.588 --> 01:39:00.702
advancements of ML to help you 
to do more.  Our  mission is to 

01:39:00.703 --> 01:39:02.703
hip succeed and be 

01:39:04.211 --> 01:39:06.211
platform available  for 
everybody in 

01:39:07.893 --> 01:39:09.305
the world while we made good 
progress.  We  are just getting 

01:39:09.306 --> 01:39:11.306
started.

01:39:12.631 --> 01:39:14.631
inspirations from all of you.

01:39:18.066 --> 01:39:20.299
us shape the future of Firebase.
On behalf of the  Firebase team,

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:22.300
I 

01:39:24.214 --> 01:39:26.214
you and I  look forward to 
meeting many 

01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:29.890
of you out in the sandbox after 
this or 

01:39:32.891 --> 01:39:34.891
Thank you so much.

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.080
Per-for-

01:40:19.414 --> 01:40:21.414
Per

02:00:07.676 --> 02:00:09.676
&gt;&gt; TORI BURMEISTER:  Hi, 
everybody.  I'm Tori.

02:00:17.508 --> 02:00:19.508
I am a Product Manager  working 
on actions on Google.

02:00:27.303 --> 02:00:29.303
first built, this we  previewed 
this 

02:00:30.977 --> 02:00:33.639
talk, the feedback we 
universally got  tips.

02:00:39.595 --> 02:00:41.595
So we're adding two more tips.

02:00:45.516 --> 02:00:47.516
excited to be working on  
actions in 

02:00:53.226 --> 02:00:55.226
next step in the  evolution of 
computer interactions.

02:01:02.713 --> 02:01:04.713
and received the list of blue  
links.

02:01:05.783 --> 02:01:07.783
It opened up a wheel new world 
of 

02:01:09.469 --> 02:01:11.469
exploration.

02:01:12.934 --> 02:01:14.934
I also remember when I became  
fully 

02:01:17.893 --> 02:01:19.893
dependent on my mobile phone 
checking 

02:01:22.385 --> 02:01:24.385
the  weather, finding friends in
a crowd.

02:01:26.046 --> 02:01:28.046
It really changed the  way I 
lived.

02:01:36.102 --> 02:01:38.102
actions on Google, I'm  really 
excited 

02:01:42.092 --> 02:01:44.107
really  changed the way we 
interact with computers.

02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:53.948
in the back, we lost  the 
monitors up here. please.

02:01:58.857 --> 02:02:00.857
evolution in  computing.

02:02:05.199 --> 02:02:07.462
on Google platform  and we are 
here to show you not only being 

02:02:07.463 --> 02:02:11.319
part of the next  at T. actions 
on Google is the  developer 

02:02:13.141 --> 02:02:15.141
platform for the Google 
assistant.

02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:18.698
your products and services by 
the assistant.

02:02:21.745 --> 02:02:23.745
With over 500 million devices 
running 

02:02:25.204 --> 02:02:27.204
a great opportunity for you.

02:02:28.907 --> 02:02:30.907
We're not here to tell you how  
to 

02:02:32.192 --> 02:02:35.120
scratch.  There are  other 
sessions covering that.

02:02:40.202 --> 02:02:41.826
of you can use to build great 
actions.   And when you build 

02:02:41.827 --> 02:02:43.827
great actions, not 

02:02:45.749 --> 02:02:51.320
users, but it opens the doors to
get your actions  noticed.  

02:02:51.321 --> 02:02:53.321
Throughout this talk, we're 
going to  two  tools.

02:02:56.110 --> 02:02:58.152
First, the actions on Google 
console or sometimes  

02:02:58.153 --> 02:03:00.153
affectionately known as the 
console.

02:03:03.041 --> 02:03:05.041
administer your actions.  
Second, dialogue flow.

02:03:08.179 --> 02:03:09.845
build your conversational 
actions and  includes a lot of 

02:03:09.846 --> 02:03:11.846
natural language 

02:03:13.497 --> 02:03:15.941
for making great actions.  Let's
dive in.

02:03:20.836 --> 02:03:22.836
We  bucketd the tips into three 
categories.

02:03:29.617 --> 02:03:31.617
how you  make a great action and
avoid

02:03:37.843 --> 02:03:40.289
-- this is how I get your  
action to more users.

02:03:45.071 --> 02:03:47.071
design is what  delights users.

02:03:52.201 --> 02:03:56.505
mistakes and  solutions to make 
a great design.  Tip 1.  Make 

02:03:56.506 --> 02:04:01.216
your  conversation as simple as 
but no simpler.  Do you  know 

02:04:01.217 --> 02:04:04.085
someone who talks too much?  
Well, an action can too.

02:04:07.342 --> 02:04:09.342
interact, keep it simple.

02:04:10.849 --> 02:04:12.703
Users don't need every  option 
upfront, guide them to the most 

02:04:12.704 --> 02:04:19.721
used  and then  make options 
available if they asked.  Now, 

02:04:19.722 --> 02:04:21.722
we're going to  act out a 
conversation.

02:04:22.984 --> 02:04:24.984
will be playing the exciting  
role of 

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:28.258
an action and I'll be the useer.

02:04:31.354 --> 02:04:33.354
&gt;&gt; SUNIL VEMURI:  Welcome to 
sounds of relaxation.

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.280
Are  you frying to sleep, 
meditate, 

02:04:38.359 --> 02:04:40.359
think or reflect?

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:45.920
We have something for that.

02:04:47.186 --> 02:04:49.186
Would you like to also include 
ocean 

02:04:50.188 --> 02:04:52.188
waves

02:04:53.535 --> 02:04:55.535
crackling fire,  wind or birds 
chirping with that?

02:05:01.916 --> 02:05:03.916
for five minutes, 30  minutes or
an hour?

02:05:06.204 --> 02:05:08.204
to sit or lie down.   Are you 
ready?

02:05:13.805 --> 02:05:18.330
Here's your 30-minute relaxation
sounds with birds chirping.  

02:05:18.331 --> 02:05:20.331
That was tedious.

02:05:21.775 --> 02:05:23.775
I'm  definitely not in a relaxd 
state of wind after that.

02:05:28.699 --> 02:05:31.347
simple and get the users  
quickly to the delight. a look 

02:05:31.348 --> 02:05:33.629
at another  example that keeps 
the conversation simple.

02:05:43.436 --> 02:05:45.436
Which session would you  like 
today?

02:05:51.617 --> 02:05:54.286
&gt;&gt; So it's the end of the day 
and time to wind down.

02:05:58.189 --> 02:06:00.189
Just find a comfortable place.

02:06:03.076 --> 02:06:05.076
Let me go back.

02:06:07.774 --> 02:06:09.813
Don't  auto play it again.  
Thanks.

02:06:13.511 --> 02:06:16.438
user quickly to  where they want
to go.  In a conversational 

02:06:16.439 --> 02:06:18.439
dialogue, we  know 

02:06:20.091 --> 02:06:22.942
time another question is asked. 
So  the fewer steps to complete 

02:06:22.943 --> 02:06:24.943
a task, the better.

02:06:32.345 --> 02:06:34.345
engaged by avoiding less banter.

02:06:38.273 --> 02:06:43.982
Tip 2.  Add a  person.  We want 
simple conversation. also want 

02:06:43.983 --> 02:06:45.983
to  feel connected and 

02:06:47.434 --> 02:06:50.115
engaged with your action.  
Developing a  persona or a 

02:06:50.116 --> 02:06:52.803
personality  then incorporating 
it into your  action 

02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:58.400
really bring its tos it to life.

02:07:05.198 --> 02:07:07.198
There are many types of pizza 
restaurants.

02:07:10.527 --> 02:07:12.765
York walk up where you  can grab
a quick slice and the local 

02:07:12.766 --> 02:07:14.766
beach side local spot.

02:07:17.455 --> 02:07:19.455
to communicate in a different 
way and 

02:07:20.942 --> 02:07:22.942
your  action can exemplify this.

02:07:25.616 --> 02:07:27.508
you can draw users into your 
action.  We'll do some acting  

02:07:27.509 --> 02:07:29.509
again.

02:07:32.205 --> 02:07:34.205
and I'll be the  user.

02:07:37.686 --> 02:07:39.686
What would you like today?

02:07:44.630 --> 02:07:49.334
What toppings would you like to 
add?right?  It's fine.   But I'm

02:07:49.335 --> 02:07:54.240
not sure we expressed  our brand
or  who we are.  Let's try it 

02:07:54.241 --> 02:07:56.241
again.

02:08:01.174 --> 02:08:03.174
What can I get  you?

02:08:05.673 --> 02:08:07.673
What flavor do you crave?

02:08:09.097 --> 02:08:11.097
taken this one a  little far, 
but you get the idea.

02:08:13.191 --> 02:08:17.886
is a local  surfer.  Personality
can't be avoided.  It's human 

02:08:17.887 --> 02:08:19.887
they were  to attach 

02:08:21.590 --> 02:08:23.058
and we're hard wired to look  
for meaning and the things 

02:08:23.059 --> 02:08:25.059
around us.

02:08:27.116 --> 02:08:28.987
with your action regardless of 
whether you  think about it or 

02:08:28.988 --> 02:08:30.988
not.

02:08:33.879 --> 02:08:38.599
and define it.  Well defined 
personas also  increase the 

02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:40.600
emotional connection.

02:08:45.676 --> 02:08:48.268
usage, retention and brand 
loyalty.  Things to think about 

02:08:48.269 --> 02:08:50.269
when you are 

02:08:51.925 --> 02:08:56.614
state is the  usish going to be 
in.  Are they looking to relax? 

02:08:56.615 --> 02:08:58.615
Are they  excited?

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:02.986
of that, what role should your 
agent  play?  Looking at these 

02:09:02.987 --> 02:09:06.847
attributes, these are  options. 
The first might be a teacher, 

02:09:06.848 --> 02:09:09.645
someone  who is patient and 
helpful and encouraging.

02:09:14.735 --> 02:09:16.735
a  friend might be playful, 
casual and silly.

02:09:18.092 --> 02:09:20.174
Whereas a  helper, you will be 
to be  proactive and  succinct.

02:09:23.662 --> 02:09:25.662
We recommend you define the 
persona at 

02:09:26.915 --> 02:09:28.915
conversation around it.

02:09:31.198 --> 02:09:33.198
It can  make a big difference.

02:09:37.699 --> 02:09:39.699
Users can be  unpredictable.

02:09:41.765 --> 02:09:44.617
that we don't  always expect.  
In the case of conversational 

02:09:44.618 --> 02:09:46.618
actions, 

02:09:48.738 --> 02:09:50.738
you didn't anticipate.

02:09:51.787 --> 02:09:54.666
Let's try  this dialogue.  This 
time I'll be the user and Tori 

02:09:56.514 --> 02:09:58.514
will be  the action.

02:10:03.244 --> 02:10:05.244
What size do you want?

02:10:06.708 --> 02:10:11.869
you want?  A small,  medium or 
large?  The grammar was not 

02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:13.870
robust.

02:10:14.936 --> 02:10:19.095
The  action didn't understand a 
common  of medium.  In  this 

02:10:19.096 --> 02:10:21.096
case, I said double.

02:10:22.127 --> 02:10:24.127
Now, I don't know about you, but
I've 

02:10:25.370 --> 02:10:28.026
and you can ask for different  
sizes in different ways.  So you

02:10:28.027 --> 02:10:30.027
want your grammars to  handle 

02:10:31.685 --> 02:10:33.685
common variations that might 
can't up.

02:10:36.618 --> 02:10:38.618
Let  me show you how you can 
approach.

02:10:40.105 --> 02:10:42.344
flow,  there's a simple way to 
do this.  First, training 

02:10:42.345 --> 02:10:44.345
phrases.

02:10:46.450 --> 02:10:47.891
of the common different  ways 
somebody might say the same 

02:10:47.892 --> 02:10:49.892
phrase.

02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:53.350
So, for example,  can I have a 
medium?

02:10:55.476 --> 02:10:57.735
A double,  please.  You can 
include all of these different 

02:11:02.241 --> 02:11:03.649
phrase section so that the 
system will  understand that 

02:11:03.650 --> 02:11:05.650
Arizonas might ask for things in
different  ways.

02:11:10.414 --> 02:11:13.287
Let's take another example.   
Rain boots.  So there are many 

02:11:13.288 --> 02:11:15.960
different ways  might  say rain 
boots.

02:11:19.831 --> 02:11:21.831
It can be gum boots, galoshes, 
Willies.

02:11:26.767 --> 02:11:27.775
interfaces in dialogue  flow so 
users can give their responses 

02:11:27.776 --> 02:11:33.085
with these kinds of  variations.
there's another part.  The more 

02:11:33.086 --> 02:11:37.953
examples  you give, the better 
dialogue flow can learn from  

02:11:37.954 --> 02:11:39.954
because it does have learning 
capabilities.

02:11:41.456 --> 02:11:44.316
And it  can account -- it can 
learn  has  expressed the same 

02:11:44.317 --> 02:11:46.317
concepts.

02:11:47.809 --> 02:11:49.809
So more examples, the better.

02:11:52.543 --> 02:11:55.220
timeout that illustrates  this. 
Timeout tells you about events 

02:11:55.221 --> 02:11:57.221
in the United Kingdom.

02:11:59.085 --> 02:12:01.085
screen, timeout is asking for a 
day you'd like  to go out.

02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:05.580
The user responds with:  I don't
know.

02:12:10.172 --> 02:12:13.067
timeout recognizes the fray I  
don't  gives a helpful response.

02:12:16.945 --> 02:12:22.473
In  the second screen, timeout 
again  or Saturday.  The user 

02:12:22.474 --> 02:12:24.715
respondd -- today,  tomorrow or 
Sunday.  The user responded with

02:12:24.716 --> 02:12:26.716
Saturday.

02:12:30.232 --> 02:12:32.232
Common variations and things  
outside 

02:12:33.755 --> 02:12:35.755
for.

02:12:37.457 --> 02:12:39.913
Excuse me  And on the right.   
The user was being clever and 

02:12:39.914 --> 02:12:41.914
they asked for something  funny.

02:12:48.339 --> 02:12:49.760
So kind of like an  Easter egg. 
Something to make your actions 

02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:51.761
more robust.

02:12:57.752 --> 02:12:59.752
Users can  still say unexpected 
things.

02:13:01.609 --> 02:13:03.641
talk to each  other, if the 
listener doesn't understand the 

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:08.754
speaker, they   it out.  They 
ask for  corrections or 

02:13:11.006 --> 02:13:13.246
rewordings or try to give some 
hints to  forward.

02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:18.740
Let's take a look at an  example
here.

02:13:24.425 --> 02:13:26.425
event?

02:13:29.102 --> 02:13:31.786
understand.  When is the  event?

02:13:35.868 --> 02:13:37.899
understand.  When is the  event?

02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:46.500
When is the event?

02:13:49.582 --> 02:13:54.135
But I'm sure you heard  
something like  a computer.   

02:13:54.136 --> 02:13:55.963
This is hopefully not something 
unfamiliar.  The action is  

02:13:55.964 --> 02:13:58.427
repetitive and It gives the same
response.

02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:04.130
It's  not noticing that the user
is Ernestly trying to move the  

02:14:04.162 --> 02:14:07.141
forward.  So here's what we 
recommend.

02:14:11.202 --> 02:14:13.202
For the  initial prompt, you can
give that.

02:14:15.341 --> 02:14:17.596
types of  errors that you -- 
that we recommend you handle.

02:14:24.141 --> 02:14:26.141
When this  happens, you want to 
if the  back on track.

02:14:28.265 --> 02:14:29.915
We  recommend the first reprompt
to be what's called a rapid  

02:14:29.916 --> 02:14:31.916
reprompt.

02:14:33.387 --> 02:14:35.426
same response or maybe a slight 
variation, but don't go too much

02:14:35.427 --> 02:14:37.427
further than that.

02:14:40.567 --> 02:14:42.427
isn't giving something you can't
handle, here's  where we call 

02:14:42.428 --> 02:14:44.428
escalated detail.

02:14:47.356 --> 02:14:49.390
more  elaborate and perhaps an 
example of what they can say to 

02:14:49.391 --> 02:14:51.391
move the conversation forward.

02:14:53.282 --> 02:14:55.350
that, stop  reprompting.  Don't 
pester the user.

02:14:58.398 --> 02:15:01.079
We find the sequence  works very
well. another type of error 

02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:03.103
that's  called no input.

02:15:06.376 --> 02:15:09.371
This means the user didn't say  
system didn't hear what the user

02:15:09.372 --> 02:15:11.406
said.  Perhaps  they were 
thinking about what 

02:15:14.458 --> 02:15:16.500
they got  confused by the 
prompt.  Weren't sure how to 

02:15:16.501 --> 02:15:18.501
respond.

02:15:21.638 --> 02:15:25.086
three stage reprompting to  help
the user along.  And with these 

02:15:25.087 --> 02:15:27.952
six reprompts, you are   way to 
build a helpful conversation 

02:15:29.571 --> 02:15:31.571
experience  that helps keep the 
user on track.

02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:35.080
code  this.

02:15:37.784 --> 02:15:40.646
In dialogue flow, you create 
what's called a fallback  

02:15:40.647 --> 02:15:42.647
intent.

02:15:46.364 --> 02:15:48.205
simply create an array  with the
three where I prompts, add a 

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:50.206
counter and some  logic.

02:15:52.109 --> 02:15:54.109
the right prompt and that's it.

02:15:58.075 --> 02:15:59.714
Great  design and delight to 
users.  Remember keep your 

02:15:59.715 --> 02:16:01.715
dialogue  short.

02:16:03.982 --> 02:16:06.009
Make robust grammars that handle
common variations and synonyms.

02:16:11.264 --> 02:16:14.106
no match  and no input.the 
design basics.

02:16:18.746 --> 02:16:20.746
Let's make it more fun and 
personalized.

02:16:24.334 --> 02:16:26.602
Einvolve with your user.  When 
you have -- evolve with your  

02:16:26.808 --> 02:16:28.808
user.

02:16:30.029 --> 02:16:32.029
conversation with someone,  do 
you introduce yourself again?

02:16:34.519 --> 02:16:38.613
it again?  Same goes for 
actions.  Be there with  help 

02:16:38.614 --> 02:16:40.614
and options when 

02:16:45.945 --> 02:16:48.377
to the  simplist and more 
personalized conversation with 

02:16:48.378 --> 02:16:50.378
your user.

02:16:52.086 --> 02:16:54.086
So here's a horscope action.

02:16:56.284 --> 02:16:58.740
If you  don't speak Portuguese 
and you don't happen to have 

02:16:58.741 --> 02:17:03.622
Google  Translate  let me tell 
you what's happening.  The  

02:17:03.623 --> 02:17:05.623
first time the user launches the

02:17:06.702 --> 02:17:10.773
sign O. subbasses kept launches,
it doesn't and  simply reuses 

02:17:10.774 --> 02:17:12.774
the previous answer.  This is 
great.

02:17:17.351 --> 02:17:19.351
a much better  experience for 
your user.

02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:24.935
this could  be when the user 
invokes the action.  You just 

02:17:24.936 --> 02:17:26.936
give them  their horscope right 
away.

02:17:30.845 --> 02:17:33.888
are plenty of examples of  good 
personalization.  If you are a 

02:17:33.889 --> 02:17:35.889
food action, you can  

02:17:36.967 --> 02:17:38.967
vegetarian and focus on those 
choices.

02:17:40.023 --> 02:17:42.023
If  you are a fitness action, 
remember 

02:17:43.745 --> 02:17:46.200
is that the user likes and use 
those as the  defaults.

02:17:50.290 --> 02:17:52.290
Now we'll take a look at the 
code.

02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.400
user  info API, you can get the 
users 

02:17:57.675 --> 02:17:59.675
name, anonymized user ID and  
more.

02:18:03.398 --> 02:18:05.398
if it's the same user on  
subsequent invocations.

02:18:07.289 --> 02:18:11.583
There are also more robust  
solutions  O off.  So hearing 

02:18:11.584 --> 02:18:13.637
the code, you can see  we're 
checking if we have seen the 

02:18:13.638 --> 02:18:15.901
user before. we do the 
introduction.

02:18:19.383 --> 02:18:21.014
If we have, we attempt to  
retrieve the horscope sign and 

02:18:21.015 --> 02:18:23.291
then continue on  the  
conversation.

02:18:26.746 --> 02:18:28.746
What we want you to remember 
from 

02:18:30.216 --> 02:18:32.216
evolving  with the users is one,
get rid 

02:18:33.732 --> 02:18:36.195
intro if the user is  familiar 
with it.  And two, become more 

02:18:36.196 --> 02:18:38.196
personalized as you  learn about
them.

02:18:41.691 --> 02:18:43.691
already know.

02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:48.370
&gt;&gt; SUNIL VEMURI:  We have all 
already 

02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:51.860
computer generated  text to 
speech.

02:18:52.934 --> 02:18:55.818
nice text to  speech.  But do 
you know what's even better?  

02:18:55.819 --> 02:18:57.819
Media.

02:19:00.909 --> 02:19:02.909
one to make your actions sound  
awesome.

02:19:04.585 --> 02:19:06.585
First, the media responds action
PI.

02:19:07.628 --> 02:19:10.248
clips in your action.  Suppose 
I'm building an action  that 

02:19:11.051 --> 02:19:13.051
plays famous speeches.

02:19:16.370 --> 02:19:20.266
include  the actual audio, some 
images and some controls.  Let's

02:19:20.267 --> 02:19:22.267
give  it a listen.

02:19:26.363 --> 02:19:28.363
for you.

02:19:29.862 --> 02:19:31.862
Ask what  you can do for your 
country.

02:19:33.168 --> 02:19:34.440
Great way to include a little  
bit of media inside of your 

02:19:34.441 --> 02:19:36.922
action. the API is  straight 
forward.

02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:42.020
Just give the URL to an audio 
file,  

02:19:43.524 --> 02:19:45.524
hand it to actions in Google to 
play the rest.

02:19:47.014 --> 02:19:49.014
It's a great way to bring your 
audio  users.

02:19:52.194 --> 02:19:55.050
The second way is through SSML. 
Let's say  I'm trying to create 

02:19:55.051 --> 02:19:57.051
a 

02:19:58.717 --> 02:20:01.975
action.   Let's listen to what 
this sounds like with plain text

02:20:01.976 --> 02:20:03.976
to  speech.

02:20:07.314 --> 02:20:10.167
Welcome to the tear fig world of
the  imagination -- terrifying 

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:12.612
world of the imagination.   &gt;&gt; 
SUNIL VEMURI:  Tori, did that 

02:20:13.013 --> 02:20:15.013
sound creepy?

02:20:21.587 --> 02:20:23.587
change it and see how it  sounds
if I 

02:20:25.087 --> 02:20:27.087
manipulate the  Voice.

02:20:29.995 --> 02:20:31.995
Welcome to the terrifying world 
of  imagination.

02:20:34.147 --> 02:20:36.388
there.down.

02:20:41.048 --> 02:20:43.636
Now let's add  some sound 
effects.

02:20:51.577 --> 02:20:53.577
&gt;&gt; Come in.

02:20:56.705 --> 02:20:58.705
Welcome to the terrifying world 
of the  imagination.

02:21:04.703 --> 02:21:09.000
(roaring/growling).  There we 
go.  What a  difference.  Now 

02:21:09.001 --> 02:21:11.001
we're talking.

02:21:12.050 --> 02:21:13.495
to play that  for you one more 
time, but this time I will show 

02:21:13.496 --> 02:21:16.158
you the   to compose this sound.

02:21:19.818 --> 02:21:22.814
Let's  take a look.  (

02:21:26.786 --> 02:21:28.786
thunder)

02:21:30.583 --> 02:21:32.583
(growling) (foot steps and 
slamming     &gt;&gt; Come in.

02:21:34.442 --> 02:21:36.442
Welcome to the terrifying world 
of the  imagination.

02:21:39.907 --> 02:21:45.063
(growling)   &gt;&gt; SUNIL VEMURI:  
All right.  What we did here is 

02:21:45.064 --> 02:21:52.443
use two  features of SSML.  Par 
and prosit. you fine tune  how 

02:21:52.444 --> 02:21:56.335
the computer speaks by changing 
the pitch, speaking rate  and 

02:21:56.336 --> 02:21:58.336
volume.

02:21:59.387 --> 02:22:02.028
unique to access on Google.   
Let's you play multiple sound 

02:22:02.029 --> 02:22:04.029
layers 

02:22:06.691 --> 02:22:09.755
audio and mix that with your 
text to  speech.  With that, you

02:22:09.756 --> 02:22:11.756
can make great sounds 

02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:15.420
for your action.

02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:19.396
To further help you make great  
audio environment for your 

02:22:19.397 --> 02:22:21.397
sound, we have a 

02:22:24.305 --> 02:22:26.335
with over 1,000 sounds including
ambiient sounds, sports,  

02:22:26.336 --> 02:22:28.336
Voices, Foley and many more.

02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:36.646
to you include  sounds into your
actions.  Tip number 7.  Adjust 

02:22:36.647 --> 02:22:38.647
to your  device.

02:22:42.984 --> 02:22:44.984
mentioned the assist ant is on  
over 500 million devices.

02:22:48.107 --> 02:22:50.107
Smart speakers, phones, watches,

02:22:52.216 --> 02:22:54.216
Chromebooks, cars, TVs and with 
the 

02:22:56.512 --> 02:22:58.512
assistant  STK, device makers 
are 

02:23:02.587 --> 02:23:04.587
the  time.  When designing for 
multiple guyses, 

02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:09.174
Sometimes it's Voice  only like 
a Google home.  And with new 

02:23:09.175 --> 02:23:11.253
smart screens,  there's a  
touch.

02:23:14.949 --> 02:23:16.572
Sometimes the same  device falls
on different parts of the 

02:23:16.573 --> 02:23:18.573
spectrum 

02:23:20.646 --> 02:23:22.646
content like their driving or 
the volume is  muted.

02:23:26.563 --> 02:23:28.563
when designing for these.

02:23:30.048 --> 02:23:32.048
Let's take an example of a surf 
report O.

02:23:34.113 --> 02:23:37.390
home, the report  needs to be 
presented with just speech.  So 

02:23:37.391 --> 02:23:39.391
in this example,  the whole 

02:23:40.884 --> 02:23:42.884
is verbal and through audio.

02:23:43.929 --> 02:23:45.929
Now that  same one on the right 
is with a screen.

02:23:49.277 --> 02:23:51.147
verbal presentation is a bridge,
but now there's a  visual 

02:23:51.148 --> 02:23:53.148
presentation that goes along 
with it.

02:23:54.858 --> 02:23:57.102
we  encouraged you to use the 
rich visual presentations on  

02:23:57.103 --> 02:24:02.601
devices with screens. bottom, on
the bottom  right, you can see 

02:24:02.602 --> 02:24:04.602
the choices are presented as 

02:24:06.331 --> 02:24:08.331
can tap on them instead of 
having to 

02:24:09.794 --> 02:24:11.794
speak  on a device with the 
screen.

02:24:13.454 --> 02:24:15.454
is  straight forward.

02:24:17.136 --> 02:24:19.136
Using surface capability APand 
some  conditional logic.

02:24:21.610 --> 02:24:22.636
more about this  topic.  
Fortunately, there's a whole 

02:24:22.637 --> 02:24:24.637
talk 

02:24:25.717 --> 02:24:27.717
about it Wednesday  at 11:30 
called 

02:24:30.221 --> 02:24:32.221
actions for the Google assist 
ants.

02:24:34.883 --> 02:24:36.883
Beyond smart speakers and 
displays.

02:24:39.049 --> 02:24:41.049
are working putting  them in the
hands of users.

02:24:43.558 --> 02:24:45.625
want to try  things out with a 
smaller audience before you 

02:24:45.626 --> 02:24:47.626
launch to a  birth audience.

02:24:51.313 --> 02:24:53.214
just releaguesd a new tool that 
let's you test with smaller 

02:24:53.215 --> 02:24:59.192
audiences and  with it.  You can
do an Alpha release.  Your 

02:24:59.193 --> 02:25:02.262
action  goes through a limited 
review. get early  feedback on 

02:25:02.263 --> 02:25:04.700
your action.  Give it out to a 
small test group  and 

02:25:09.603 --> 02:25:11.603
of the Alpha releases is  that 
the 

02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:15.910
review process is much shorter, 
within hours.

02:25:17.864 --> 02:25:20.302
test it with users and iterate 
very, very  quickly and get that

02:25:20.303 --> 02:25:22.303
feedback you 

02:25:24.192 --> 02:25:26.044
releasing to a larger audience, 
you have gotten through all  the

02:25:26.045 --> 02:25:28.697
bugs and design issues.

02:25:32.092 --> 02:25:34.334
is doing a Beta  release.  This 
is intended when you are near 

02:25:37.992 --> 02:25:39.992
version or near stable  version.
Test this with a wider audience.

02:25:45.587 --> 02:25:47.584
typical approval for actions.  
But there's  an additional 

02:25:47.585 --> 02:25:49.585
advantage 

02:25:51.644 --> 02:25:52.596
you  take an action from Beta to
public.  So that way if you are 

02:25:52.597 --> 02:25:54.597
trying to time 

02:25:56.244 --> 02:25:58.294
marketing  considerations, you 
can keep it in Beta and when you

02:25:58.295 --> 02:26:00.295
are  ready for 

02:26:01.985 --> 02:26:04.012
flip the switch and make it go 
live  to the public.

02:26:11.790 --> 02:26:15.452
tested it and  launched it, it's
great to see what happens. many 

02:26:15.453 --> 02:26:19.610
users  are coming back?  Or how 
many users are there?  How many 

02:26:19.611 --> 02:26:21.611
are  coming back?

02:26:22.689 --> 02:26:24.689
they encountering?

02:26:25.943 --> 02:26:27.943
For  traditional metrics like 
traffic, 

02:26:33.513 --> 02:26:35.513
views you can use to see these.

02:26:37.818 --> 02:26:39.025
Retention like  a cohort 
analysis is available through 

02:26:39.026 --> 02:26:41.026
chat base.

02:26:42.496 --> 02:26:44.340
base  is a tool that you can 
integrate with your action to 

02:26:44.341 --> 02:26:47.592
get  keeper conversation 
Analytics. about some  things 

02:26:47.593 --> 02:26:50.264
that are conversational and 
Analytics, let's take 

02:26:53.956 --> 02:26:55.571
well conversational  analytics 
and this is called a session 

02:26:55.572 --> 02:26:57.572
flow.

02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:03.567
takes most often.  The green 
paths are  the ones that your 

02:27:03.568 --> 02:27:05.568
action handled.  The red are not
handled.

02:27:10.910 --> 02:27:12.910
a usish says book a  hotel, that
was handled.

02:27:14.394 --> 02:27:16.394
feedback  Twasn't handled.

02:27:17.689 --> 02:27:19.689
Now, when we talked about no 
match 

02:27:22.417 --> 02:27:24.249
tip, here is where you can see  
how often these no matches 

02:27:24.250 --> 02:27:26.250
happen and where 

02:27:27.699 --> 02:27:30.150
addressing these.  Both dialogue
flow and  chat base 

02:27:33.835 --> 02:27:36.649
include a session flow view. 
drill down, you can see 

02:27:36.650 --> 02:27:39.325
transcripts including the  
individual steps a user went.

02:27:42.799 --> 02:27:44.799
led up to  a potential problem.

02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:48.060
So you can try to address that. 
To  recap.

02:27:51.951 --> 02:27:56.270
the next level and  increase the
engagement. the user.  Add  

02:27:56.271 --> 02:27:59.529
sounds.  Account for actions 
running on different types of  

02:27:59.530 --> 02:28:01.530
devices.

02:28:02.597 --> 02:28:04.597
with screen and some not.  Test 
it with smaller audiences and 

02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:12.950
tools here to see what the users
are doing.

02:28:16.276 --> 02:28:20.777
built your awesome  app.  You 
want to engage your users and  

02:28:20.778 --> 02:28:23.637
many more.   Tip 10.

02:28:27.108 --> 02:28:29.777
Reengage your users.  During 
normal interactions  with your 

02:28:34.064 --> 02:28:35.904
users to opt in to receive  
updates using two subscription 

02:28:35.905 --> 02:28:37.905
models.

02:28:42.061 --> 02:28:44.061
Google pulls an update at a time
spes feed by  the user.

02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:47.540
The second is push notifications
where 

02:28:49.225 --> 02:28:51.225
actions can push updates when 
appropriate.

02:28:53.512 --> 02:28:58.446
These work on  the phone even if
you  Android app installed.   

02:28:58.447 --> 02:29:00.292
Now with cross surface 
notifications coming in to 

02:29:00.293 --> 02:29:02.921
Google  assist ants, you  able 
to reach users on speakers, 

02:29:02.922 --> 02:29:04.922
smart  

02:29:06.493 --> 02:29:08.493
displays and other Google 
devices.

02:29:16.734 --> 02:29:20.623
This can keep you up  to date.  
Here's an example. what it looks

02:29:20.624 --> 02:29:23.275
like when  they're getting the 
update.

02:29:26.368 --> 02:29:30.453
As well as a notification when  
there  delays.  Great way to 

02:29:30.454 --> 02:29:32.454
reengage.

02:29:35.763 --> 02:29:37.763
If you  wanted user to get daily

02:29:40.048 --> 02:29:42.048
up using the actions console.

02:29:43.296 --> 02:29:45.296
The second way is in your web  
hook and your code.

02:29:49.029 --> 02:29:51.029
a new register update  object.

02:29:53.107 --> 02:29:55.543
You can put in arguments here 
horscope sign and  then the 

02:29:55.544 --> 02:29:57.544
frequency.

02:30:03.953 --> 02:30:05.953
tip of the day or a surf report.

02:30:09.038 --> 02:30:11.038
can be a great way to reengage 
with 

02:30:12.747 --> 02:30:14.747
your users, but  they can also 
be really annoying.

02:30:16.444 --> 02:30:19.096
be careful to  make it relevant.
So use personalization.

02:30:24.010 --> 02:30:27.271
of the whole league.  Be  
descriptive.  Users will receive

02:30:27.272 --> 02:30:30.952
the title and the  notification.
the content they're receiving 

02:30:30.953 --> 02:30:32.953
and  

02:30:34.012 --> 02:30:36.012
don't just list the name of the 
action.

02:30:37.071 --> 02:30:39.071
users.

02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:42.960
Make sure the information is 
relevant to  them or don't do 

02:30:42.961 --> 02:30:44.961
it.

02:30:46.885 --> 02:30:48.885
Tip 11.

02:30:52.806 --> 02:30:54.806
We're working hard to  make sure
all 

02:30:56.600 --> 02:30:58.600
And there are  three main ways 
to get discovered.

02:31:01.127 --> 02:31:03.127
The first is the  assistant 
explorer directory.

02:31:06.418 --> 02:31:11.312
to the assistant.  Make sure you
come up as an  option. the third

02:31:11.313 --> 02:31:13.584
is is action links.  Your hyper 
links  to your action which 

02:31:17.049 --> 02:31:19.049
you can add to any surface.

02:31:23.581 --> 02:31:25.655
discovered.  Make it good.

02:31:28.910 --> 02:31:31.760
We check each action and the 
higher  quality, the return  

02:31:31.761 --> 02:31:35.090
rate, health and ratings, the 
more likely we'll highlight  

02:31:35.091 --> 02:31:39.568
your action. the design 
principles and the developer  

02:31:39.569 --> 02:31:42.217
docs to help guide you.  We have
some great stuff out there.

02:31:48.137 --> 02:31:51.047
that will help.directory.

02:31:54.718 --> 02:32:00.009
It's available  on the web at 
assistant.google.com/explorer.

02:32:05.394 --> 02:32:07.394
because we see that 30% of our 
third-party  actions are getting

02:32:09.514 --> 02:32:11.514
through it.

02:32:12.778 --> 02:32:15.233
So when a user  is browsing, you
want to make sure you get 

02:32:15.234 --> 02:32:17.234
discovered.

02:32:20.175 --> 02:32:22.405
option are contextual 
suggestions.  These  relevant 

02:32:22.406 --> 02:32:24.406
suggestions are based 

02:32:28.905 --> 02:32:31.295
as  the time of day or location.
The second is dynamic  

02:32:31.296 --> 02:32:33.296
categories.

02:32:36.051 --> 02:32:38.051
new, what's  trending, what's 
popular 

02:32:39.915 --> 02:32:41.915
and now we have editorial pics.

02:32:45.964 --> 02:32:49.341
This is a new feature with
campaigns.  You now know that 

02:32:49.342 --> 02:32:51.342
high quality is the 

02:32:52.414 --> 02:32:54.414
featured in the assist ant 
directory.

02:32:55.875 --> 02:32:57.491
To trigger  more naturally in 
conversation, use built in 

02:32:57.492 --> 02:32:59.492
intense.

02:33:02.590 --> 02:33:04.590
It allows actions to trigger for

02:33:06.084 --> 02:33:08.084
relevant queries that are more 
general.

02:33:13.284 --> 02:33:15.284
taxonomy for actions across all 
Google surfaces.

02:33:17.822 --> 02:33:20.657
parses the user query and  
passes it as structured data so 

02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:22.658
developers don't have to.

02:33:24.554 --> 02:33:27.214
general intents much is more 
natural for users  and this way,

02:33:27.215 --> 02:33:29.471
users don't have to use your 
action name.

02:33:35.151 --> 02:33:37.187
are tell a joke or start  a 
calming activity.

02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:46.192
flow, you can select  the built 
in intent and then add in 

02:33:46.193 --> 02:33:48.675
parameters that can be  pansd 
into your action.

02:33:53.975 --> 02:33:55.975
these intents available so you 
can gift, 

02:33:57.281 --> 02:33:59.117
understanding of what your 
action can do and we'll be  

02:33:59.118 --> 02:34:01.118
rolling out hundreds 

02:34:02.609 --> 02:34:04.609
more in the coming months.

02:34:06.874 --> 02:34:10.118
So the third way to get 
discovered is action links.   

02:34:10.119 --> 02:34:13.600
They're hyper links that point  
your action.   They make your 

02:34:13.601 --> 02:34:15.601
actions discoverable 

02:34:18.008 --> 02:34:20.008
from any platform or  surface 
and allow 

02:34:21.833 --> 02:34:23.048
to engage directly with your 
action  irrespective of how they

02:34:23.049 --> 02:34:25.049
found your link.

02:34:28.778 --> 02:34:30.778
Websites, social campaigns and 
more.

02:34:33.845 --> 02:34:35.845
It's really  simple to set up 
action links.

02:34:38.536 --> 02:34:40.536
actions  console, Pudge inner a 
URL link and give it a title.

02:34:42.863 --> 02:34:44.863
And  then share away.

02:34:51.357 --> 02:34:53.357
Be helpful everywhere your users
are.

02:34:55.686 --> 02:34:57.686
We're  launched in more than 25 

02:35:00.515 --> 02:35:02.970
We  recommend engaging with this
global audience as soon as  

02:35:02.971 --> 02:35:04.971
possible.

02:35:10.285 --> 02:35:12.285
countries and  languages.

02:35:14.999 --> 02:35:16.999
and  multiple languages.

02:35:18.281 --> 02:35:20.281
English, French and German.

02:35:23.991 --> 02:35:25.991
And here  we're going to show 
you how 

02:35:28.252 --> 02:35:30.252
localize an  action using a 
localization library.

02:35:32.958 --> 02:35:34.958
The first thing to do  is create
a locale's directory.

02:35:37.627 --> 02:35:39.627
file for each locale.

02:35:41.927 --> 02:35:43.927
In this example, it is  EN-US.

02:35:47.674 --> 02:35:49.674
Then within the file, you create
a 

02:35:50.722 --> 02:35:52.722
constant for  each string in 
your action 

02:35:54.001 --> 02:35:56.001
along with the string.

02:35:58.066 --> 02:35:59.902
for  each additional language, 
you create a new JSON file and 

02:35:59.903 --> 02:36:04.186
use  the same  strings.  There 
are  many translation services 

02:36:07.303 --> 02:36:09.303
that can help with this.

02:36:15.427 --> 02:36:17.861
you use the I18 and node library
to do the  hard work.

02:36:22.589 --> 02:36:24.672
Here you're going to configure 
the I18   and set the locales 

02:36:24.673 --> 02:36:26.958
you want to support the wear the
translation files 

02:36:33.775 --> 02:36:35.775
Then  when the conversation 
starts, 

02:36:37.448 --> 02:36:39.448
you're going to set that  
specific users 

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:42.924
I18 object.

02:36:45.191 --> 02:36:47.642
Finally,  throughout the 
conversation, you use these 

02:36:47.643 --> 02:36:51.090
don't dance  instead of  
statements.  Is this greatly  

02:36:51.091 --> 02:36:54.954
simplifies the complexity of 
supporting multiple languages.

02:36:58.618 --> 02:37:00.618
want to insure that the work 
that you 

02:37:01.672 --> 02:37:03.672
have put into  designing and 
enhancing your action pays off.

02:37:07.986 --> 02:37:09.986
acquire as many users as 
possible and  

02:37:11.046 --> 02:37:13.046
keep them coming back for more.

02:37:14.124 --> 02:37:16.967
&gt;&gt; SUNIL VEMURI:  There are so 
many more resources here  at I/O

02:37:16.968 --> 02:37:21.660
to help you  learn more about  
these tips.  Look for sessions 

02:37:21.661 --> 02:37:23.661
marked for assistant 

02:37:25.544 --> 02:37:27.544
a few for you.

02:37:28.617 --> 02:37:30.617
We have  sessions that talk 
about how 

02:37:32.693 --> 02:37:34.693
to design for smart displays.

02:37:36.099 --> 02:37:38.178
and Gains.  You can learn to 
enhance your action  with 

02:37:38.179 --> 02:37:40.179
transactional capabilities, a 

02:37:43.065 --> 02:37:45.507
Excuse me there are sessions on 
how to Celt  up the Alpha and 

02:37:45.508 --> 02:37:50.812
Beta releases we  and grow your 
user base.  Finally, we have 

02:37:50.813 --> 02:37:52.813
office  hours and a 

02:37:55.093 --> 02:37:57.093
of the  team.

02:38:02.003 --> 02:38:04.003
with hundreds of  partners 
globally

02:38:07.075 --> 02:38:09.075
We have seen a lot of these 
challenges.

02:38:10.751 --> 02:38:13.219
This list is  happend by this. 
have given you a head start in 

02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:15.220
creating  great actions.

02:38:17.702 --> 02:38:19.702
I look forward to seeing how you

02:38:21.164 --> 02:38:23.407
in  the space and create cool 
assistive actions.  Next.

02:58:14.755 --> 02:58:16.755
5:00-7:00 p.m.

The Future of the andestroyed 
App model 

02:59:11.715 --> 02:59:13.715
5:00-

5

02:59:20.684 --> 02:59:22.684
:45 p.m.

02:59:34.486 --> 02:59:36.486
The future of the Android App 
model and 

02:59:45.948 --> 02:59:48.396
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.  My name is 
drew Knox.

02:59:51.695 --> 02:59:54.359
I'm a Product  Manager on 
Chrome's web platform team. 

02:59:54.360 --> 02:59:56.360
focused on make  the web and 
easier 

02:59:57.441 --> 02:59:59.700
platform to build on, which is 
why I am  here to talk about.

03:00:04.606 --> 03:00:06.606
I may be a little biased when I 
say  

03:00:09.314 --> 03:00:12.182
most amazing things  helps have 
ever built.  Now, when I say 

03:00:12.183 --> 03:00:16.293
this, I mean the  web,  
internet.  Now to be true, the 

03:00:16.294 --> 03:00:18.294
internet is  its 

03:00:19.345 --> 03:00:21.785
own wonder, but the web is an 
open   that stood the test of 

03:00:21.786 --> 03:00:23.786
time.  And that's really 
humbling to  me.

03:00:27.536 --> 03:00:29.536
The web is on every desktop.

03:00:32.445 --> 03:00:34.476
homes.  When we got through 
collaboration and  

03:00:37.945 --> 03:00:39.945
we worked across individuals, 

03:00:41.210 --> 03:00:43.210
businesses,  even governments to
develop 

03:00:47.107 --> 03:00:48.149
anybody, but certainly 
futureured by many people along 

03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:51.874
the  way.  I don't think there's
any other  like that.

03:00:59.605 --> 03:01:01.605
play a leadership  roll on the 
web.

03:01:02.687 --> 03:01:06.565
context.  The  web strength 
stems from that collaboration 

03:01:06.566 --> 03:01:08.566
and openness.

03:01:11.491 --> 03:01:13.739
that we're excited to share  
with the web community.  But 

03:01:13.740 --> 03:01:16.610
more than anything, it's about  
discussion because once the web 

03:01:18.635 --> 03:01:21.549
community gets  involved, that's
really where things start to 

03:01:21.550 --> 03:01:23.550
matter.

03:01:28.541 --> 03:01:30.977
Now the web's success carries 
with it expectations.  As  

03:01:30.978 --> 03:01:32.978
technology is increasingly 

03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:36.677
part of users  lives, they're 
expecting more and more from the

03:01:36.678 --> 03:01:39.336
digital  experiences they 
interact with.

03:01:42.812 --> 03:01:44.853
service you provide anymore.  
Everyone is in on  the game 

03:01:44.854 --> 03:01:46.854
these days.

03:01:49.354 --> 03:01:51.354
want to keep up.

03:01:52.597 --> 03:01:54.597
This isn't just a thought 
experiment.

03:01:55.631 --> 03:01:57.661
seen again and again that people
who put the time and  effort 

03:01:57.662 --> 03:01:59.662
into delivering 

03:02:02.414 --> 03:02:04.454
big  business rewards.  You 
can't afford to stand still or  

03:02:06.098 --> 03:02:08.098
someone else is going to grab 
the opportunity.

03:02:10.782 --> 03:02:12.782
across the board, we see three  
big 

03:02:15.868 --> 03:02:17.868
are ramping up rapidly  right 
now.

03:02:18.902 --> 03:02:20.902
Users.

03:02:22.185 --> 03:02:24.185
Their sites to load instantly.

03:02:26.896 --> 03:02:29.133
of users will abandon a site if 
it takes  longer than three 

03:02:29.134 --> 03:02:31.134
secondings to load.

03:02:34.032 --> 03:02:37.097
half your customers before they 
have even seen your sites.   

03:02:37.098 --> 03:02:39.941
Delivering the load times is 
really hard.only five seconds.

03:02:43.419 --> 03:02:46.674
We know how hard it is  is to 
hit the  target.  But the impact

03:02:46.675 --> 03:02:49.311
of  getting the load times down 
is very real.

03:02:55.745 --> 03:02:58.651
that 20% of all mobile Android 
page let's are  abandoned 

03:02:58.652 --> 03:03:00.722
because a site takes too long to
load.

03:03:05.055 --> 03:03:07.927
20  %, 1 out of 5 of all page 
loads on mobile is abandoned.

03:03:12.664 --> 03:03:14.664
Now, the next area where user 

03:03:19.444 --> 03:03:22.111
are rocketing is  really 
draconian.  In order to avoid 

03:03:22.112 --> 03:03:24.112
any negative user  

03:03:26.819 --> 03:03:29.053
to every input within 50  
milliseconds.  No matter what 

03:03:29.054 --> 03:03:31.054
your site is doing, you 

03:03:33.140 --> 03:03:35.140
at 60 frames per second.

03:03:38.831 --> 03:03:40.831
site's design is  tougher to 
nail down 

03:03:42.299 --> 03:03:44.299
loading speeds, but  it doesn't 
make it any less important.

03:03:49.051 --> 03:03:51.051
improved by 60% when they  
revamped the 

03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:54.520
quality and performance of their
website.

03:03:57.005 --> 03:03:59.644
weren't enough, users 
increasingly expect your  

03:03:59.645 --> 03:04:01.645
service to be accessible 
everywhere.

03:04:04.750 --> 03:04:06.787
of  their devices, their known, 
laptop, TV, smart speakers, you 

03:04:06.788 --> 03:04:08.788
name it.

03:04:10.272 --> 03:04:14.607
their services things  like face
eye book or snap chat.  This 

03:04:14.608 --> 03:04:16.608
leaves you delivering  

03:04:18.466 --> 03:04:20.632
quality while supporting an 
evergrowing  matrix of 

03:04:20.633 --> 03:04:22.633
delivering platforms.

03:04:23.705 --> 03:04:25.735
represent three big 
opportunities for the web to go 

03:04:25.736 --> 03:04:29.813
further than simply making 
things possible. want the web  

03:04:29.814 --> 03:04:32.663
to actively support you in 
finding success with these three

03:04:32.664 --> 03:04:37.983
key areas. your experience load?
How high  quality is the design 

03:04:37.984 --> 03:04:40.443
and interaction of your page?

03:04:45.740 --> 03:04:47.740
can users find you?

03:04:51.244 --> 03:04:54.716
ahead of us.  But web  steppers 
have a leg up on everyone else 

03:04:54.717 --> 03:04:56.717
here.

03:05:00.129 --> 03:05:02.129
well positioned to embrace these
kinds 

03:05:04.645 --> 03:05:06.645
new user expectations.

03:05:08.514 --> 03:05:10.514
For example, PWA's show is 180 
times 

03:05:11.939 --> 03:05:13.939
smaller than their

03:05:16.608 --> 03:05:18.608
iOS  app.

03:05:21.720 --> 03:05:23.720
of building high quality UX, new
users  

03:05:25.185 --> 03:05:27.185
convert three times as often.

03:05:30.526 --> 03:05:32.983
worker or the purple loading 
pattern give you unprecedented  

03:05:32.984 --> 03:05:34.984
control over how you deliver 
your app.

03:05:38.925 --> 03:05:40.925
push note fixing as, that let's 
you 

03:05:44.674 --> 03:05:46.674
that can load instantly for  
users.

03:05:47.777 --> 03:05:49.428
And perhaps most obviously, the 
web is cross  platform by 

03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:54.371
default.beginning.  Being 
everywhere is built into the 

03:05:55.598 --> 03:06:00.277
web's DNA. how we do things.  So
building a PWA interest choosing

03:06:03.375 --> 03:06:07.665
the web is like starting 100 
meters down  track.  But  these 

03:06:07.666 --> 03:06:10.101
technologies, they only make it 
possible to build  incredible 

03:06:10.305 --> 03:06:12.305
pages.

03:06:13.569 --> 03:06:15.609
and flexibility of the  
primitives I just mentioned, for

03:06:15.610 --> 03:06:17.610
a lot of people who 

03:06:18.894 --> 03:06:20.378
out there and focus on 
delighting their  users, these 

03:06:20.379 --> 03:06:22.379
can be unnecessary.

03:06:23.464 --> 03:06:25.464
site more complex.

03:06:26.543 --> 03:06:28.543
So we think that the web can do 
more 

03:06:31.485 --> 03:06:33.485
to make incredible pages easy to
build  just  possible.

03:06:35.578 --> 03:06:38.272
To started things off, let's 
hear from my  colleague Stephfan

03:06:38.273 --> 03:06:40.273
who we're doing 

03:06:42.358 --> 03:06:44.358
options for more  content 
delivery.

03:06:51.999 --> 03:06:53.999
like to talk to you  about 
standards 

03:06:55.294 --> 03:06:57.154
working on right  now to improve
how to deliver content on the 

03:06:57.155 --> 03:06:59.155
web.

03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:04.545
progression of sharing a link  
with a friend viewa chat, you 

03:07:04.546 --> 03:07:07.436
get the link  the link.

03:07:10.908 --> 03:07:13.360
We provide a nice screen shot of
it,  but wouldn't it be cool if 

03:07:13.361 --> 03:07:15.361
we could 

03:07:17.055 --> 03:07:19.507
content  rather than merely the 
link?  What we'd like to be able

03:07:19.508 --> 03:07:21.508
to  do is to 

03:07:24.405 --> 03:07:27.483
a web app just like  what Drew 
was talking about.  This allows 

03:07:27.484 --> 03:07:29.484
for useful new  applications.

03:07:30.955 --> 03:07:32.955
offline PWA installs.

03:07:34.419 --> 03:07:36.419
What we  need is the way to 
distribute 

03:07:39.704 --> 03:07:42.149
on it coming from exactly the 
same place  that it was 

03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:44.150
originally published from.

03:07:46.207 --> 03:07:47.636
notion is, we also need to make 
sure we don't break  anything 

03:07:47.637 --> 03:07:52.994
while we're doing all this. want
to  break attribution.  We don't

03:07:52.995 --> 03:07:54.995
want to break things like  
integrity.

03:08:00.718 --> 03:08:02.550
working on some  technologies 
under the umbrella web 

03:08:02.551 --> 03:08:04.551
packaging.

03:08:05.624 --> 03:08:08.093
is  currently being done as part
of the IATF standards  

03:08:08.094 --> 03:08:13.237
development process, web an  
ITAF draft.  We think this 

03:08:13.238 --> 03:08:15.238
collection of technologies and  
this approach is going 

03:08:17.568 --> 03:08:20.048
powerful new set of  primitives 
which allows for simpler loading

03:08:20.049 --> 03:08:22.743
architecture  in the use cases.

03:08:25.799 --> 03:08:27.799
So the first  step along the way
to 

03:08:29.056 --> 03:08:31.056
getting web packaging is this 
notion  of 

03:08:34.368 --> 03:08:36.448
Signed exchanges provide a way 
to  associate shared content -- 

03:08:36.449 --> 03:08:38.449
sorry.

03:08:40.546 --> 03:08:42.779
its  origin in a way that's 
verifiable and secure.

03:08:46.473 --> 03:08:49.112
Assigned  exchange is basically 
an  with a digital  signature 

03:08:49.113 --> 03:08:54.459
wrapped around it.  It has a 
number of notable  features. the

03:08:54.460 --> 03:08:56.460
duration of validity.

03:08:57.719 --> 03:08:59.719
How  long this web package is in
fact valid.

03:09:01.809 --> 03:09:03.442
mechanic anism that encourages 
the browser to verify  at 

03:09:03.443 --> 03:09:05.443
appropriate 

03:09:06.974 --> 03:09:08.974
the most  current.

03:09:10.058 --> 03:09:12.058
If the package has a problem or 
if it 

03:09:17.439 --> 03:09:19.468
the user not to have stale  
content.  You want to have 

03:09:19.469 --> 03:09:21.469
integrity.

03:09:24.061 --> 03:09:26.061
within the scope of the digital 

03:09:27.549 --> 03:09:29.981
signature and  it tells us the 
content   since it left the 

03:09:29.982 --> 03:09:31.982
publisher.  And finally within 
scope of  this 

03:09:35.951 --> 03:09:37.951
the publisher.

03:09:39.274 --> 03:09:41.274
This is going to come in handy 
very shortly.

03:09:43.595 --> 03:09:45.858
working on it.  So  there's 
still stuff that needs to get 

03:09:45.859 --> 03:09:50.781
done. will have  things called 
bundled exchanges.  They have 

03:09:50.782 --> 03:09:52.782
all the  characteristics of 

03:09:54.480 --> 03:09:56.728
+ they come with all  the 
assets.  It is everything that 

03:09:56.729 --> 03:09:58.729
you wanted with 

03:10:02.472 --> 03:10:04.472
and about integrity.

03:10:10.845 --> 03:10:12.845
world that has web  packageing.

03:10:17.018 --> 03:10:19.018
aggregator,  for example.

03:10:20.483 --> 03:10:23.778
And let's call it Google 
Procrastinator.  You  subscribe 

03:10:23.779 --> 03:10:25.779
to a bunch of content.

03:10:29.746 --> 03:10:31.746
when you want to procrastinate 
and it 

03:10:33.423 --> 03:10:35.423
straight forward type of 
application.

03:10:36.516 --> 03:10:38.516
New, for a site like this, there
are 

03:10:40.025 --> 03:10:42.025
that can serve you very, very 
well.

03:10:44.099 --> 03:10:45.926
Now, imagine  we have a friend 
Dave.  Dave is very 

03:10:45.927 --> 03:10:47.927
enthusiastic.

03:10:53.495 --> 03:10:55.495
He tends to send us lots  of 
links.

03:10:56.612 --> 03:11:01.535
article.  Since  the success 
rate is generally pretty good, 

03:11:01.536 --> 03:11:05.025
we will click on  the link. this
is what we get.  Turns out David

03:11:05.026 --> 03:11:07.276
was great.  This is a 
mind-blowing popular link.

03:11:10.569 --> 03:11:12.569
server collapsed under the load.

03:11:14.071 --> 03:11:16.071
Now, let's  imagine this was a 
site 

03:11:18.243 --> 03:11:22.708
in  procrastinator.  Our server 
could very well have already  

03:11:22.709 --> 03:11:24.709
downloaded a bundled exchange 

03:11:27.029 --> 03:11:29.297
the content that  belongs to 
that page and it can then diss 

03:11:29.298 --> 03:11:31.298
play it forever  you.

03:11:34.060 --> 03:11:35.893
super, super slow, but you are  
still getting your content 

03:11:35.894 --> 03:11:37.894
because the 

03:11:42.252 --> 03:11:45.160
is all coming from the 
procrastinator service.  No  

03:11:45.161 --> 03:11:47.161
matter what happens, the content

03:11:48.664 --> 03:11:50.537
and although  this is served by 
someone other than the original 

03:11:50.538 --> 03:11:52.538
publisher,  you 

03:11:54.466 --> 03:11:56.466
that continue is the same thing 
that 

03:11:57.930 --> 03:11:59.930
the publisher originally sent 
out.

03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:03.217
no Connectivity at all?  
Fortunately, it is  open web all

03:12:03.218 --> 03:12:05.291
the way down.

03:12:10.198 --> 03:12:12.198
It turns out we're using a 
service 

03:12:13.310 --> 03:12:15.310
worker to render this and  the 
service 

03:12:17.196 --> 03:12:19.196
one of which can be  the bundled
exchange.

03:12:21.508 --> 03:12:23.508
So despite the fact the 
originating  

03:12:26.011 --> 03:12:27.862
intrinsically support offline by
using  this offline, you get an 

03:12:27.863 --> 03:12:29.863
offline reading 

03:12:33.186 --> 03:12:35.186
handy when your Connectivity 
fails or 

03:12:37.608 --> 03:12:39.608
you're in  aircraft without 
Wi-Fi.

03:12:42.783 --> 03:12:44.589
the  potential future of web 
packaging.  But let me give you 

03:12:44.590 --> 03:12:47.676
much  more concrete example. 
immediate example as well.

03:12:51.567 --> 03:12:53.567
Now when app appeared on the 
scene 

03:12:55.643 --> 03:12:57.263
deliver a user focused snappy 
web experience  and if you were 

03:12:57.264 --> 03:12:59.264
at the state 

03:13:03.869 --> 03:13:05.869
on,  the median load time, 
display time 

03:13:07.342 --> 03:13:10.211
of an amp page is still  very, 
very low. work out so well was  

03:13:10.212 --> 03:13:12.212
the user 

03:13:14.292 --> 03:13:16.292
confusion caused by seeing a 
page from a 

03:13:22.597 --> 03:13:25.405
publishers URL in the address 
box.  We  look up chocolate chip

03:13:25.406 --> 03:13:27.406
cookies and 

03:13:29.508 --> 03:13:32.453
the recipe and if we look in the
address bar, it still  says 

03:13:32.454 --> 03:13:34.454
Google.

03:13:38.608 --> 03:13:40.608
com slash/amp.

03:13:42.664 --> 03:13:45.849
web packageing, we  enter the 
same query.  Chocolate chip 

03:13:45.850 --> 03:13:47.850
cookies.

03:13:51.159 --> 03:13:53.159
is telling us web packaging is  
involved.

03:13:55.088 --> 03:13:57.088
We'll tap the recipe.  It's the 
same thing.

03:14:00.436 --> 03:14:01.520
up into the address bar, it 
shows food network rather  than 

03:14:01.521 --> 03:14:03.521
Google.

03:14:06.216 --> 03:14:07.631
to make  this happen, but the 
user experience is one where 

03:14:07.632 --> 03:14:09.632
there's no  

03:14:10.926 --> 03:14:14.381
is very clear where the  content
is coming from.  At this point, 

03:14:14.382 --> 03:14:16.382
I would like to give  a 

03:14:20.943 --> 03:14:22.978
to our friends at foodnetwork 
who sunk a lot of  time and 

03:14:22.979 --> 03:14:25.608
energy to enable this particular
demo. we also  like to you try 

03:14:25.609 --> 03:14:29.706
this for yourself.  It wouldn't 
be very  shorting if we kept 

03:14:29.707 --> 03:14:31.707
this to ourselves.

03:14:35.650 --> 03:14:37.650
dive at the moment on Android, 
there is 

03:14:41.210 --> 03:14:43.210
enable the exchanges.  The 
Chrome  loading team has been 

03:14:44.683 --> 03:14:46.683
doing a ton of work to make this
happen.

03:14:50.251 --> 03:14:52.251
If there  certificate tooling 

03:14:55.354 --> 03:14:56.979
exchanges and in combination 
once you flip the switch, you  

03:14:56.980 --> 03:14:58.980
will be able to 

03:15:00.078 --> 03:15:02.078
and get a better  sense of how 
this technology works.

03:15:06.229 --> 03:15:08.229
in delving even  deeper and 

03:15:11.203 --> 03:15:13.044
web packaging, I  encourage to 
you take a look at the spec here

03:15:13.045 --> 03:15:15.045
on this link  

03:15:18.998 --> 03:15:21.635
than you will immediately  learn
what to do with.  With that, 

03:15:21.636 --> 03:15:23.636
back to Drew.

03:15:25.114 --> 03:15:27.114
Thanks very much.

03:15:28.781 --> 03:15:30.781
Thank you, Stefan.

03:15:31.894 --> 03:15:36.001
About halfway  through or so.  
So we'll power through. we just 

03:15:36.002 --> 03:15:38.651
heard  about how we're thinking 
about making loading easier.

03:15:42.172 --> 03:15:44.172
to make it easier to build pages
that 

03:15:45.505 --> 03:15:47.505
stay fast and responsive after 
they've loaded.

03:15:48.967 --> 03:15:50.967
about what makes this hard on 
the web 

03:15:53.329 --> 03:15:55.574
today, I think  of an overgrown 
jungle.  platform.

03:15:58.929 --> 03:16:00.340
It's focused on back wards 
compatibility for most  of its 

03:16:00.341 --> 03:16:02.341
lifetime.  Now don't get me 
wrong.

03:16:06.259 --> 03:16:08.259
the stability of your business.

03:16:10.990 --> 03:16:13.751
lot of Gruff we have accumulated
along the way.  If we go back to

03:16:13.752 --> 03:16:18.019
that person who wants  users and
get their business out there, if

03:16:18.020 --> 03:16:20.020
you are  just going from point A
to 

03:16:21.502 --> 03:16:24.184
of best  practices and rules of 
thumbna you need to keep track 

03:16:24.185 --> 03:16:26.385
of to  keep your page 
successful.

03:16:35.433 --> 03:16:41.954
video games.   Videotape games 
track a bunch of  behalf.  This 

03:16:41.955 --> 03:16:44.623
allows theme have far more 
complex experiences and  

03:16:44.624 --> 03:16:46.624
interactions.

03:16:47.890 --> 03:16:50.162
with board games, you find  
yourself spending a lot of time 

03:16:50.163 --> 03:16:52.163
just moving 

03:16:54.479 --> 03:16:57.371
rules are being followed.  Well 
if the web  did something 

03:16:57.372 --> 03:16:59.372
similar to video games?

03:17:01.503 --> 03:17:03.334
the platform aware of all these 
rules and best practices  that 

03:17:03.335 --> 03:17:05.335
you keep track 

03:17:09.247 --> 03:17:10.470
on your needs  and goals, you 
can ask the browser to manage 

03:17:10.471 --> 03:17:12.703
those  automatically on your 
behalf?

03:17:21.330 --> 03:17:22.989
lot of tools out there that help
track best  practices. will 

03:17:22.990 --> 03:17:27.477
continue to be vital.  They can 
be  much more opinionated than 

03:17:27.478 --> 03:17:30.133
the bare platform which allows  
to take further and give you 

03:17:30.134 --> 03:17:32.134
better performance games.

03:17:35.291 --> 03:17:39.980
They can offer more holistic  
the lighthouse  report.  But we 

03:17:39.981 --> 03:17:44.476
want developers to be able to  
websites.  We don't want them to

03:17:44.477 --> 03:17:46.477
have to commit to an entire tool
chain upfront.

03:17:49.775 --> 03:17:51.405
that doesn't require any 
configuration, that  catches 

03:17:51.406 --> 03:17:53.406
problems from the first line of 
code you write.

03:17:58.853 --> 03:18:02.156
apply lighthouse, your very  
first score is even higher. 

03:18:02.157 --> 03:18:04.661
that, we think that  the web 
needs to make the best practices

03:18:04.662 --> 03:18:06.662
available 

03:18:10.360 --> 03:18:12.999
directly  in the plat form -- 
platform.say this.

03:18:16.880 --> 03:18:18.880
Internal JavaScript framework 
has best 

03:18:19.939 --> 03:18:21.939
the platform's API surface.  
This means  things like removing

03:18:26.324 --> 03:18:28.324
patterns that are performance or
security anti-patterns.

03:18:31.627 --> 03:18:36.547
If  you use something similar of
used  used HTML.   They try to 

03:18:36.548 --> 03:18:39.033
get you to avoid certain APIs.  
We found that  these rules make 

03:18:41.694 --> 03:18:44.784
productive because they  catch 
errors earlier.  They also 

03:18:44.785 --> 03:18:46.785
improve the security of our  
sites.

03:18:48.460 --> 03:18:50.460
when we turn the rules on, we 
reduced  

03:18:51.796 --> 03:18:56.702
cross site scripting 
vulnerabilities in  75%.  So 

03:18:56.703 --> 03:18:59.378
we're eager today to start a 
discussion with  the rest of the

03:18:59.379 --> 03:19:03.491
web community. practices  that 
make most sense for the web.  

03:19:03.492 --> 03:19:05.492
What's the best way to  build 
them 

03:19:07.145 --> 03:19:09.145
into the web's platform?

03:19:12.682 --> 03:19:14.682
big role.  Feature policy is a 
cross browser  

03:19:18.233 --> 03:19:19.880
implemented in Chrome with  
positive signal thes from other 

03:19:19.881 --> 03:19:21.881
browsers.

03:19:26.682 --> 03:19:28.682
allows the browser to have 
feltsures of the  web.

03:19:31.413 --> 03:19:33.683
It allows attributes where we 
can spes  Chrome should disable.

03:19:37.782 --> 03:19:39.782
A concrete example shown  here 
is this 

03:19:43.526 --> 03:19:45.526
You can see it on an Iframe, but
you 

03:19:47.465 --> 03:19:49.465
can specify this site  wide with
a 

03:19:51.372 --> 03:19:53.372
is enabling the HR policy  
anyone who 

03:19:56.309 --> 03:19:58.309
tries to use the synchronize XHR
request will get  an error.

03:20:04.693 --> 03:20:06.693
learning the  ropes and access 
is old school.

03:20:10.811 --> 03:20:13.281
We don't want to just  turn off 
APIs.  It is half the battle.  

03:20:13.282 --> 03:20:15.282
We.

03:20:19.633 --> 03:20:21.633
practices, things like images 
must have  

03:20:24.752 --> 03:20:26.599
that's more than three window  
heights offscreen.  We think 

03:20:26.600 --> 03:20:28.600
there are three areas that 

03:20:30.081 --> 03:20:32.081
fit for this.

03:20:33.392 --> 03:20:35.392
First area we think there's a 
lot  ever opportunity is images.

03:20:43.742 --> 03:20:45.742
found  at 25% can save 250 
kilobytes.

03:20:47.353 --> 03:20:49.353
A median network connections  is
about 

03:20:50.639 --> 03:20:52.922
That's 5 seconds you can  give 
back with essentially no extra 

03:20:52.923 --> 03:20:54.923
development work.

03:20:57.226 --> 03:20:59.226
easier to find the kind of low 
hanging 

03:21:00.685 --> 03:21:02.685
fruit  and tackle them 
incrementally.

03:21:04.419 --> 03:21:06.419
we  have been working on 
recently.

03:21:07.488 --> 03:21:10.395
The first requires all  images 
to have sizes. the user 

03:21:10.396 --> 03:21:13.289
experience  from jumping around 
as new images load and resize 

03:21:13.290 --> 03:21:18.210
the  knows ahead of time how big
those are  going to be.

03:21:22.903 --> 03:21:27.818
modern image formats.   Make 
sure you take advantage of the  

03:21:27.819 --> 03:21:29.819
decoding and high  compression 
rates of modern images.

03:21:33.927 --> 03:21:35.927
image down scaling.

03:21:39.696 --> 03:21:41.696
a desk top  image on a mobile 
device.

03:21:42.769 --> 03:21:44.769
And finally, we have a policy  
that 

03:21:47.909 --> 03:21:50.771
poorly comment pressed  images. 
Now with each of these policies,

03:21:50.772 --> 03:21:52.772
what 

03:21:55.273 --> 03:21:57.305
thes the policy is that Chrome 
rend ares it in  inverted 

03:21:57.306 --> 03:21:59.306
colors.

03:22:02.080 --> 03:22:03.947
at  what is going on, you can 
immediately see the images that 

03:22:03.948 --> 03:22:05.948
need further attention.

03:22:09.338 --> 03:22:10.948
the exact  shape of the APIs and
figuring out the best way to 

03:22:10.949 --> 03:22:15.033
bake the   so they're useful to 
you.  But  we're eager for 

03:22:15.034 --> 03:22:17.034
feedback.

03:22:20.969 --> 03:22:25.462
flags.  If you turn on the 
experimental radio duct  

03:22:25.463 --> 03:22:27.463
features flag, you can get 
access 

03:22:29.981 --> 03:22:31.981
formats  with the two other I 
mentioned coming soon.

03:22:38.355 --> 03:22:40.355
reducing payload size of  
websites.

03:22:44.020 --> 03:22:48.634
that accrues  slowly over time. 
We want to help infrastructure 

03:22:48.635 --> 03:22:53.709
teams  across their website 
automatically.   As each little 

03:22:53.710 --> 03:22:55.710
regression came in, 

03:23:01.045 --> 03:23:04.699
it before they need to do a full
site redesign.   We're 

03:23:04.700 --> 03:23:07.362
introducing something called  
creates  an attribute that 

03:23:07.363 --> 03:23:12.741
allows to you limit the size of 
each  individual resource type. 

03:23:12.742 --> 03:23:14.742
things like images  should never
be 

03:23:16.435 --> 03:23:18.867
larger than 100 kilobytes or 
JavaScript   than two kilobytes.

03:23:20.925 --> 03:23:22.952
Now, the  specificity of these 
policies allows to you track 

03:23:22.953 --> 03:23:27.476
down   as they're committed.  
But the per  resource 

03:23:27.477 --> 03:23:30.768
flexibility means you can set 
whatever policies   most sense 

03:23:30.769 --> 03:23:33.248
for your site F. you're a 
multi-media  site, you will 

03:23:38.130 --> 03:23:40.130
bigger  policies than a news 
site.

03:23:41.999 --> 03:23:43.999
about today is  animations.

03:23:45.950 --> 03:23:47.950
ability to  specify which 
properties 

03:23:49.243 --> 03:23:53.987
are safe to animate.  Now, as 
site  requirements and browser  

03:23:53.988 --> 03:23:55.988
evolve, you can  fine tune which
properties you want to allow.

03:24:01.340 --> 03:24:03.807
a policy that only allows  
accelerated animations like 

03:24:03.808 --> 03:24:05.808
transform and Opacity.

03:24:08.110 --> 03:24:10.960
no matter what is going on for 
the rest of your  site.  Like I 

03:24:10.961 --> 03:24:13.419
mentioned before, this policy   
behind the same experimental 

03:24:16.259 --> 03:24:18.893
productivity feature flag.   
Okay.  So I just ran through a 

03:24:18.894 --> 03:24:23.818
bunch  policies.  If  you're 
interested, you can try them 

03:24:23.819 --> 03:24:25.819
behind a flag like I  mentioned,

03:24:27.942 --> 03:24:29.977
this link to find more precise  
API documentation and 

03:24:29.978 --> 03:24:34.536
information on how to  
development environment today.  

03:24:34.537 --> 03:24:36.537
What really excites  me is 
because 

03:24:38.836 --> 03:24:41.290
value at  development time, you 
can start using them and 

03:24:41.291 --> 03:24:45.781
experiencing  them  the flag.  
Just turn them on  while you're 

03:24:45.988 --> 03:24:48.036
developing.  But most important 
is that we want  to 

03:24:51.300 --> 03:24:52.957
hearing feedback on what use 
cases we're missings  and which 

03:24:52.958 --> 03:24:54.958
policies are the most exciting.

03:24:58.309 --> 03:25:00.171
go to  the Github repo and 
express support for what matters

03:25:00.172 --> 03:25:02.172
to you  most.

03:25:03.852 --> 03:25:05.852
Now automatically tracking best 

03:25:07.767 --> 03:25:09.767
practices is  only part of the 
battle.

03:25:11.647 --> 03:25:14.909
is that the web  comes with a 
lot of assembly required.  This 

03:25:14.910 --> 03:25:16.910
is great for  those of us who 

03:25:20.029 --> 03:25:21.857
and push the platform to  its 
limits, but going back to that 

03:25:21.858 --> 03:25:23.858
person that's 

03:25:25.127 --> 03:25:28.033
get to point A to point B.  It 
make its difficult to find  that

03:25:30.082 --> 03:25:32.082
perfect library from a third 
party.

03:25:34.165 --> 03:25:36.165
trying to keep the size of your 
site  payload small.

03:25:39.673 --> 03:25:41.903
the platform has shied  away 
from building my level 

03:25:41.904 --> 03:25:43.904
productivity features 

03:25:45.564 --> 03:25:48.439
easy to get wrong and anyone who
knows about  app cache will 

03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:50.440
probably agree.

03:25:52.741 --> 03:25:55.616
of the run time even for pages 
that aren't using the API.   

03:25:55.617 --> 03:25:58.093
Everything is global on the web.
if there's a way  to provide 

03:25:58.094 --> 03:26:00.094
more of 

03:26:01.138 --> 03:26:03.138
these my level features while 
avoiding  

03:26:05.243 --> 03:26:07.243
call together is layered APIs.

03:26:08.926 --> 03:26:10.926
Now, as a brief aside, it turns 
out 

03:26:12.191 --> 03:26:13.019
a pretty good set of 
characteristics for solving  

03:26:13.020 --> 03:26:15.890
this problem.  The features and 
the modules are imported.

03:26:21.018 --> 03:26:23.018
use and JavaScript has  no 
special privileges.

03:26:24.935 --> 03:26:29.428
fit your needs,  you're not left
with nothing else to use.  You 

03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:31.429
can dig in  and build something 
use case.

03:26:34.967 --> 03:26:36.967
It is really just  there for 
your convenience.

03:26:42.926 --> 03:26:47.094
web platform features  like Adif
or index DB. important twist  

03:26:47.095 --> 03:26:49.365
and that's they have to share 
the same discipline as a  

03:26:50.988 --> 03:26:52.988
JavaScript module.

03:26:55.701 --> 03:26:57.771
be imported and they can't do  
anything that plain vanilla 

03:26:57.772 --> 03:27:01.053
JavaScript couldn't do. 
necessarily mean we implement it

03:27:01.054 --> 03:27:03.923
in JavaScript.   But they behave
Identically.

03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:11.256
a remote  URL, you specify a 
platform identified by using the

03:27:11.257 --> 03:27:15.562
same  module import Syntax. the 
feature shift with a  browser.

03:27:20.344 --> 03:27:22.344
Now, layered API is because they
are 

03:27:23.422 --> 03:27:25.877
of the gate which is why we're 
including a  fallback Syntax 

03:27:25.878 --> 03:27:27.878
built in.

03:27:31.847 --> 03:27:33.284
the layered API, you get 
graceful deg reigation without  

03:27:33.285 --> 03:27:35.285
feature detection and doing 
anything special.

03:27:38.040 --> 03:27:40.942
But on browsers that do support 
a layered API, it is  a standard

03:27:40.943 --> 03:27:42.943
lib, but 

03:27:47.360 --> 03:27:51.052
exploring.  So we  built two 
prototypes for layered APIs.

03:27:56.369 --> 03:27:57.785
infinite list  called virtual 
list and Async local storage 

03:27:57.786 --> 03:27:59.786
API.

03:28:02.305 --> 03:28:03.965
experimental productivity  
features flag I mentioned for 

03:28:03.966 --> 03:28:05.966
policies.

03:28:10.395 --> 03:28:12.440
we tried building something with
these ourselves.   So for any of

03:28:12.441 --> 03:28:14.441
you who have tried to 

03:28:16.580 --> 03:28:20.304
the  HTML spec page that might 
be a small group, it's huge.  It

03:28:20.305 --> 03:28:22.984
takes a long time to load and  
frequently staring at a  white 

03:28:22.985 --> 03:28:25.861
screen because it is loading a 
lot of text all at  once.

03:28:30.134 --> 03:28:32.584
see here on the left the normal 
HTML spec  page.  Then on the 

03:28:32.585 --> 03:28:34.585
right using the virtual 

03:28:35.916 --> 03:28:37.916
API to load content as we go.

03:28:40.844 --> 03:28:42.844
You can see that it loads  much 
more smoothly.

03:28:46.825 --> 03:28:48.046
incremental  loading view 
recycling infinite list 

03:28:48.047 --> 03:28:50.047
implementation T.

03:28:51.927 --> 03:28:54.792
library or write  anything 
custom code.  This works right 

03:28:54.793 --> 03:28:56.793
out of the box.

03:28:57.858 --> 03:29:00.113
to get the concept.  We are  
eager to keep working with 

03:29:02.610 --> 03:29:04.840
browsers and the web community 
to   that and the specific shape

03:29:04.841 --> 03:29:11.597
of these APIs.  But  key to that
process is feedback from you. 

03:29:11.598 --> 03:29:13.598
look at  this link if you want 
to find 

03:29:14.879 --> 03:29:18.757
out more about layered APIs  and
try  the features flag.  Just 

03:29:18.758 --> 03:29:21.252
make  sure to provide feedback 
in the Github repo in the focus 

03:29:21.253 --> 03:29:23.253
of  all  and the best way 
forward.

03:29:27.171 --> 03:29:29.171
The last top they could we 
mentioned 

03:29:31.056 --> 03:29:33.056
was getting  your content 
everywhere.

03:29:35.783 --> 03:29:38.284
platform team,  we want to make 
it easy for you to offer one 

03:29:38.285 --> 03:29:40.285
definitive  experience.

03:29:43.190 --> 03:29:45.442
portable, high quality,  
interactive, even if the user 

03:29:45.443 --> 03:29:47.443
comes to that 

03:29:49.346 --> 03:29:51.397
than your top level URL.  We 
want to make it  easy for other 

03:29:54.039 --> 03:29:56.899
services to embed that content 
and all  its  interactivity 

03:29:56.900 --> 03:30:00.802
while preserving users privacy. 
Westbound  packaging is a key 

03:30:00.803 --> 03:30:05.908
first  right?  The signed  
exchange allows you to make sure

03:30:05.909 --> 03:30:07.909
that all resources are  
attributed to your site.

03:30:12.669 --> 03:30:14.669
They  use any storage, any 
partition 

03:30:18.206 --> 03:30:20.206
your resources into one easily 

03:30:21.657 --> 03:30:23.657
shareable package.

03:30:27.072 --> 03:30:29.120
to allow  different sites and 
authors to move seamlessly 

03:30:29.121 --> 03:30:31.121
between one  another.

03:30:33.217 --> 03:30:35.217
fluid animations from one  page 
to 

03:30:36.487 --> 03:30:38.487
another even if they're separate
domains.

03:30:41.593 --> 03:30:44.064
embedded interaction to a full 
page experience  without losing 

03:30:44.065 --> 03:30:52.085
any state of a user's action. 
here  are still evolving.  If 

03:30:52.086 --> 03:30:54.086
this sounds a bit vague, you're 
not  allowed.

03:30:57.888 --> 03:30:59.919
peek or a call to get in  on the
action.  We have a proposal and 

03:30:59.920 --> 03:31:01.920
are interested 

03:31:03.639 --> 03:31:05.087
around it, but we need to hear 
others  thoughts before we know 

03:31:05.088 --> 03:31:07.088
what it looks like.

03:31:09.028 --> 03:31:11.514
in how we build something 
between an I-frame and  a link, 

03:31:11.515 --> 03:31:13.515
something that sits 

03:31:16.041 --> 03:31:18.041
go to the  link here and join 
the discussion.

03:31:27.340 --> 03:31:30.389
and interactions,  getting your 
content everywhere. are quickly 

03:31:30.390 --> 03:31:33.255
going to become stable stakes 
for successful web  experiences.

03:31:36.137 --> 03:31:37.977
make it easy to make this  
transition.  We want to make it 

03:31:37.978 --> 03:31:43.937
easy for you to  web.  So this 
is really just the beginning of 

03:31:43.938 --> 03:31:45.938
how  we can make user 
experiences 

03:31:48.458 --> 03:31:51.104
how we can  foster content 
discovery and composition while 

03:31:51.105 --> 03:31:55.642
making it   these experiences.  
So if you  take two things away 

03:31:55.643 --> 03:32:00.129
today, the first is turn on the 
experimental  features flag and 

03:32:00.130 --> 03:32:02.130
start playing  with some of the 
things we mentioned.

03:32:07.284 --> 03:32:09.757
to the Github repos linked on 
the slides.  If you  have any 

03:32:09.758 --> 03:32:14.674
questions, Stefan and  sandbox  
after the talk.  So you can come

03:32:14.675 --> 03:32:16.675
up and ask us anything.   Thank 
you very much.

03:58:17.099 --> 03:58:19.099
6:00-6:45 p.m.

03:58:27.549 --> 03:58:29.549
PWAs:  Building bridges to 
mobility, 

03:58:33.482 --> 03:58:35.482
desktop and Native

03:58:47.040 --> 03:58:49.040
mobile, desktop and know  Native

03:59:47.095 --> 03:59:49.095
Per

03:59:50.442 --> 03:59:51.868
Here are the links to more  
information about the stuff we 

03:59:51.869 --> 03:59:55.739
covered  and please take  a 
minute to fill out that 

03:59:55.740 --> 03:59:59.035
evaluation form.  The feedback 
is  good. got it in there.

04:00:02.941 --> 04:00:04.941
done.

04:00:08.518 --> 04:00:10.518
&gt;&gt; Yeah T.

04:00:11.576 --> 04:00:13.576
&gt;&gt; Should we get some caffeine 
before we head over?

04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:20.110
&gt;&gt; Why don't we use the 
Starbucks web app.

04:00:21.416 --> 04:00:23.692
Okay.  What would you like,  
Pete?

04:00:30.180 --> 04:00:32.180
&gt;&gt; PETE LePAGE:  Can I do

04:00:37.618 --> 04:00:44.356
a CHAI tea latte.(inaudible).  
Back to the  order.  Excellent. 

04:00:44.357 --> 04:00:46.806
Let's go do it.  All right.

04:01:07.756 --> 04:01:09.756
You don't have to clap that 
long.  Sorry.

04:01:11.500 --> 04:01:13.500
&gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  All right.

04:01:14.809 --> 04:01:16.809
Good afternoon, everyone.

04:01:18.696 --> 04:01:20.696
I'm Jenny Gove and I'm a US 

04:01:23.424 --> 04:01:25.424
I  work on user experience and 
web experiences.

04:01:27.276 --> 04:01:29.276
Developer Advocate on  the team.

04:01:34.247 --> 04:01:38.141
lots of reasons to love the  
web.  It's the scale. users on 

04:01:38.142 --> 04:01:40.142
almost any  device.  And the 
only thing they need is a 

04:01:40.420 --> 04:01:42.420
browser.

04:01:43.890 --> 04:01:45.890
to share.  There is nothing to 
install.

04:01:50.545 --> 04:01:52.545
It's an open EKO*E system that 
anyone can use or build on.

04:01:57.520 --> 04:01:59.520
talking a lot about  progressive
web apps.

04:02:04.121 --> 04:02:05.539
new set of  capabilities that 
allow us to radically improve 

04:02:05.540 --> 04:02:07.540
the user  

04:02:12.143 --> 04:02:14.143
our users.

04:02:16.688 --> 04:02:18.688
First, the experience  must load
fast and feel fast.

04:02:20.971 --> 04:02:23.618
fast something loads across the 
network.  But also how  long it 

04:02:23.619 --> 04:02:25.619
takes us to get 

04:02:26.899 --> 04:02:28.899
the screen.

04:02:31.437 --> 04:02:33.437
The experience also needs to 
feel integrated.

04:02:37.242 --> 04:02:39.671
It needs to launch in the  same 
way that other apps are launched

04:02:39.672 --> 04:02:41.672
on that 

04:02:42.692 --> 04:02:47.700
guys device. same way that's 
right apps do.  For example, 

04:02:47.701 --> 04:02:49.701
using the  payment 

04:02:51.258 --> 04:02:53.258
request API to make payments a 
snap.

04:02:56.557 --> 04:02:58.557
It should always work because  
when it 

04:03:00.437 --> 04:03:02.437
loads too slowly, it breaks  in 
user 

04:03:04.735 --> 04:03:06.735
experience and it really 
destroys user trust.

04:03:08.668 --> 04:03:10.751
bay area, there are areas with 
poor cell  coverage.  And there 

04:03:10.752 --> 04:03:12.752
are people here in the U.S.

04:03:14.053 --> 04:03:16.053
to use dial up to get online.

04:03:17.563 --> 04:03:20.251
And world wide, more than 60%  
of cell phones are on 2G 

04:03:20.252 --> 04:03:22.252
networks.

04:03:24.323 --> 04:03:26.323
creating a reliable  experience 
is crucial.

04:03:30.607 --> 04:03:32.607
Engaging  experience starts at 
the 

04:03:33.906 --> 04:03:37.361
a delightful  first run 
experience for the user.  It 

04:03:37.362 --> 04:03:39.362
continues throughout  all of 
your 

04:03:42.252 --> 04:03:45.093
so that they work perfectly  
without friction.  An engaging 

04:03:45.094 --> 04:03:47.094
user experience uses the   web.

04:03:50.219 --> 04:03:52.219
It is indexable, searchable, 
linkable and  shareable.

04:03:53.689 --> 04:03:56.550
The experience is timely and 
relevant  it's  precise because 

04:03:56.551 --> 04:03:58.551
it counts for 

04:04:01.235 --> 04:04:03.235
users context and what matters  
to them now.

04:04:06.606 --> 04:04:08.606
on making your  experience 
engaging, you 

04:04:09.871 --> 04:04:12.163
with  UX professionals.  
Researchers and designers to 

04:04:12.164 --> 04:04:14.164
identify  

04:04:15.886 --> 04:04:17.886
those critical journeys for your
experience.

04:04:24.641 --> 04:04:26.641
Things like asking for 
permissions  

04:04:29.352 --> 04:04:31.352
the user first opens the  app.

04:04:33.412 --> 04:04:35.412
There's no real to do that at 
this point.

04:04:37.940 --> 04:04:39.940
sign up and sign in at the right
time.

04:04:41.623 --> 04:04:44.511
When  they're investd in the 
task   something for them to 

04:04:44.512 --> 04:04:48.159
gain from doing so not only 
something  for your business to 

04:04:48.160 --> 04:04:50.160
gain.

04:04:51.844 --> 04:04:53.844
important flows to  get right 
are 

04:04:55.158 --> 04:04:58.429
payment experiences that we 
alluded to I  shaller. be quick 

04:04:58.430 --> 04:05:01.279
and easy and -- they have to  be
quick and easy and frictionless.

04:05:04.728 --> 04:05:06.349
and not frustrated by that 
experience.  I will be  covering

04:05:06.350 --> 04:05:08.350
this more on 

04:05:11.879 --> 04:05:14.758
in  another talk called Google 
Pay:  Best practices for 

04:05:14.759 --> 04:05:21.371
payment. and forms.  We talked a
lot about performance of forms 

04:05:21.372 --> 04:05:23.372
before and the user  experience 
of 

04:05:25.079 --> 04:05:27.390
there is still really plenty of 
poor  experiences on the web we 

04:05:27.391 --> 04:05:29.391
found out.

04:05:32.662 --> 04:05:34.662
that was conducted in Europe on 
400 top sites.

04:05:38.174 --> 04:05:40.634
We found  that 42% of the sites 
from  didn't show  the 

04:05:40.635 --> 04:05:42.680
appropriate keyboard for the 
input type that was needed.

04:05:48.246 --> 04:05:50.902
friction and that was  quite a 
surprise us to.  It's the best 

04:05:50.903 --> 04:05:52.903
practice that has  been  long 
time.

04:05:56.813 --> 04:05:58.813
shouldn't it be walled a  
standard practice?

04:06:00.301 --> 04:06:03.972
All of these they should.  We're
finding that a lot of the time  

04:06:03.973 --> 04:06:05.973
getting them  right.

04:06:08.498 --> 04:06:10.139
We also found that 27% of sites 
didn't clearly  identify which 

04:06:10.140 --> 04:06:15.272
fields were optional.users.  For
example, the user might be  

04:06:19.960 --> 04:06:21.389
number of sales is they to fill 
in,  when actually that's not 

04:06:21.390 --> 04:06:23.390
true.

04:06:25.494 --> 04:06:27.494
to complete an experience that 
is not applicable  to them.

04:06:31.463 --> 04:06:33.940
Ultimately causing them to give 
up entirely.   So it is critical

04:06:33.941 --> 04:06:36.378
to make sure you are following 
all the  best practices of 

04:06:39.894 --> 04:06:42.563
input type,  using features 
appropriately.  We have a set of

04:06:42.564 --> 04:06:44.564
principles  here we 

04:06:45.631 --> 04:06:47.649
conducting extensive research  
that can help guide you towards 

04:06:47.650 --> 04:06:49.650
creating a more 

04:06:53.058 --> 04:06:55.058
So you can find those at that 
link.

04:06:58.803 --> 04:07:01.266
this whole ideaa fire.   Fast, 
integrated, reliable and 

04:07:01.472 --> 04:07:03.472
engaging.

04:07:06.997 --> 04:07:08.997
reliable experiences is service 
workers.

04:07:12.364 --> 04:07:15.231
are now supported in every 
modern  browser including -- 

04:07:15.232 --> 04:07:20.754
browser including safari and 
Edge. support for service work 

04:07:20.755 --> 04:07:22.755
or back in 

04:07:23.843 --> 04:07:26.514
March and  the receipt update to
Edge   supported there too.

04:07:30.828 --> 04:07:32.828
Browsish vendors are all adding 
new  

04:07:35.187 --> 04:07:37.855
that really  enhance the user 
experience.  Edge got push 

04:07:37.856 --> 04:07:39.856
notifications  and 

04:07:42.760 --> 04:07:44.760
stuff with the at home  screen 
through their store.

04:07:49.093 --> 04:07:51.093
and is working on the web 
notifications  APIos.

04:07:53.621 --> 04:07:56.081
And fare is also working on 
those web   APIs.

04:08:01.374 --> 04:08:02.993
at the very  successful PWA 
launched by the team at 

04:08:02.994 --> 04:08:04.994
Starbucks.

04:08:07.243 --> 04:08:09.243
capabilities and brings a modern
web 

04:08:11.617 --> 04:08:13.617
makes it easier to  browse the 
menu, 

04:08:15.942 --> 04:08:17.942
customize and place an order or 
pay for 

04:08:19.613 --> 04:08:21.613
All right.  So I will go over 
here.

04:08:31.214 --> 04:08:33.214
.  All right?

04:08:34.283 --> 04:08:35.509
And then I'm  going to sign in 
and if should sign in 

04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:37.510
automatically.

04:08:39.569 --> 04:08:41.569
Pete is going to buy me a  
coffee.

04:08:42.864 --> 04:08:44.864
once in a while.

04:08:46.546 --> 04:08:48.546
And here we're signed in.

04:08:50.830 --> 04:08:54.499
And  then I'm going to add it to
the  here.  I will  add that.

04:08:58.001 --> 04:09:00.001
Let me shut that app.

04:09:02.297 --> 04:09:04.735
And here it's been added  to 
home screen. progressive web app

04:09:04.736 --> 04:09:06.808
here.  I  will launch it from 
here.  Okay.

04:09:10.094 --> 04:09:12.094
So now I'm going to order  my 
coffee.

04:09:14.573 --> 04:09:17.072
location  because it knows I 
will be browsing and looking for

04:09:17.073 --> 04:09:19.073
order.

04:09:22.199 --> 04:09:27.497
I think I'll have a coffee.  
Plans a cafe  mister.  Let's see

04:09:27.498 --> 04:09:29.498
if -- there we go.

04:09:32.008 --> 04:09:34.008
maybe I'll  go for an Americano.
All right.

04:09:36.500 --> 04:09:38.500
So it ams me to have a  Grande, 
I 

04:09:39.592 --> 04:09:42.224
a bit smaller.  Let's pick  a 
tall.

04:09:48.670 --> 04:09:50.670
I'm going to go for a splash of 
milk.  All right.

04:09:54.090 --> 04:09:56.539
a little bit of sugar.  All 
right.

04:10:02.886 --> 04:10:04.886
So add  that to my order and I 
can 

04:10:06.135 --> 04:10:10.227
want it.  This is the nearest.  
I will confirm the store.   Add 

04:10:10.228 --> 04:10:12.259
that to my order.  I got one for
you.

04:10:16.163 --> 04:10:19.665
And let's  take a look.  So 
there they are.  Actually, I can

04:10:19.666 --> 04:10:24.011
check out  from there. leave 
them sitting there.  We will  

04:10:24.012 --> 04:10:26.012
probably go and pick them up.

04:10:28.289 --> 04:10:30.289
All right.

04:10:33.390 --> 04:10:35.390
I was somewhere where I didn't 
have a good connection.

04:10:37.043 --> 04:10:40.325
So I will put this into 
(inaudible) mode. this happened 

04:10:40.326 --> 04:10:42.326
to me recently actually.

04:10:43.388 --> 04:10:45.388
I visited London, which is where
I'm from, the UK.

04:10:48.497 --> 04:10:50.982
going to see a friend.  I knew  
that Starbucks was on the way, 

04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:56.070
time on my hands.

04:10:58.343 --> 04:11:00.343
I could actually browse the menu
here 

04:11:01.405 --> 04:11:03.405
and see what I wanted to order 
on the way.

04:11:09.813 --> 04:11:14.814
It's able to do that.  So I can 
make good use of my time  I want

04:11:14.815 --> 04:11:16.815
to do that.

04:11:19.339 --> 04:11:21.339
So these  experiences extend 
even to payment.

04:11:24.088 --> 04:11:25.718
have a connection, say I am 
visiting a  different country 

04:11:25.719 --> 04:11:27.719
where I don't have a 

04:11:32.058 --> 04:11:34.100
the store and I want to pay, 
then Starbucks is also  cashed 

04:11:34.101 --> 04:11:36.766
my payment  the store  right 
there.

04:11:40.877 --> 04:11:42.877
So that Starbucks progressive 
web app  experience.

04:11:44.378 --> 04:11:46.378
And let's go back to Slides.

04:11:49.346 --> 04:11:51.346
really paid off of Starbucks.

04:11:54.234 --> 04:11:57.488
is by the number of daily and  
monthly active users.  That's 

04:11:57.489 --> 04:11:59.934
more than doubled from their   
experience.  So it is really 

04:11:59.935 --> 04:12:05.097
paying off.  Useirs  are placing
more and more user  web app  

04:12:05.098 --> 04:12:07.098
with the number of orders 

04:12:08.561 --> 04:12:10.561
growing by 12% week over week.

04:12:13.442 --> 04:12:15.684
approach and made sure  this 
worked nicely on desktop as 

04:12:15.685 --> 04:12:17.685
well, they're 

04:12:19.575 --> 04:12:21.575
the web app in order to order 
ahead so  

04:12:23.092 --> 04:12:25.092
the drink is ready when they get
there.

04:12:33.203 --> 04:12:35.203
Starbucks app has  been so 
successful.

04:12:41.815 --> 04:12:43.262
but if your  site takes more 
than three seconds to load, you 

04:12:43.263 --> 04:12:45.924
have lost  more than half of 
your users.

04:12:50.017 --> 04:12:52.017
Tneeds to feel like it loads 
fast.

04:12:54.337 --> 04:12:56.781
to use place holder content.  
You can see  here until the 

04:12:56.782 --> 04:13:00.244
actual content is loaded.  it 
looks like things have started 

04:13:00.245 --> 04:13:04.791
to load to the user.   Those 
great placeholders have quickly 

04:13:06.214 --> 04:13:08.214
by real  content.

04:13:09.291 --> 04:13:11.291
And on fast network or when the 

04:13:12.320 --> 04:13:14.320
contempt has been

04:13:16.483 --> 04:13:19.341
be aware of those.  Another  
aspect is navigation between 

04:13:19.543 --> 04:13:22.227
pages. fast.

04:13:25.477 --> 04:13:28.346
It never feels like the page has
a full  reload on the web.

04:13:32.027 --> 04:13:34.027
the  network, but instead 
everything 

04:13:37.599 --> 04:13:39.599
should be pre-cached and  ready 
to go.

04:13:43.663 --> 04:13:45.306
friction of sign ins,  Starbucks
makes sign in as simple as a one

04:13:45.307 --> 04:13:47.307
tap thing.

04:13:50.392 --> 04:13:52.392
new API.  (inaudible) is going 
to be  talking 

04:13:56.846 --> 04:13:59.297
more about it in his talk called
Sign up  in  on the web.  So 

04:13:59.298 --> 04:14:04.412
check that one out.  You can see
we got the  app to home screen. 

04:14:04.413 --> 04:14:08.605
the phone properly.   I'm sorry.
That was my fault.  I was 

04:14:08.606 --> 04:14:10.606
responsible for that.

04:14:11.665 --> 04:14:16.756
home screen prompt.  They can 
add this to  their home screen. 

04:14:16.757 --> 04:14:18.757
When the user adds your 
progressive 

04:14:20.653 --> 04:14:22.900
app to their home screen on 
Android, Chrome automatically  

04:14:22.901 --> 04:14:24.901
creates an APK for 

04:14:28.458 --> 04:14:30.940
refer to a web  APK.  Your app 
shows up not only on the home 

04:14:34.417 --> 04:14:36.417
in your settings.

04:14:38.513 --> 04:14:40.513
So can go in  and see where the 
permissions are.

04:14:44.261 --> 04:14:46.523
being used and so forth.  Today 
Chrome  automatically will show 

04:14:50.465 --> 04:14:52.532
when  the site is not already 
installed.  The users interacted

04:14:52.533 --> 04:14:54.533
with the site 

04:14:57.256 --> 04:14:59.715
it meets the  PWA criteria which
means that it's got a web app 

04:14:59.716 --> 04:15:01.716
manifest, a  

04:15:03.007 --> 04:15:07.762
(inaudible).  Of course the 
easiest  way to test that is to 

04:15:07.763 --> 04:15:09.763
use lighthouse.

04:15:11.835 --> 04:15:13.265
set up in the web tent if you 
haven't gone over  there and 

04:15:13.266 --> 04:15:15.266
seen it where you 

04:15:16.512 --> 04:15:18.966
through  it and talk with folks 
on the web team to understand 

04:15:18.967 --> 04:15:20.967
what is  going on.

04:15:23.274 --> 04:15:25.553
tomorrow on lighthouse and  the 
Chrome UX report that will go 

04:15:25.554 --> 04:15:28.236
into a lot more  use these 
tools.

04:15:31.556 --> 04:15:33.556
Today, before Chrome shows the  
add to 

04:15:35.444 --> 04:15:39.939
home screen prompt, it's going 
to fire a   install prompt.  

04:15:39.940 --> 04:15:41.940
This gives you control over when
that  prompt appears.

04:15:46.289 --> 04:15:48.542
experience,  they don't want 
that prompt to show up if I'm in

04:15:48.543 --> 04:15:50.543
the middle  of ordering a drink.

04:15:52.633 --> 04:15:54.633
the user to finish what  they're
doing 

04:15:56.378 --> 04:15:58.378
and then say oh, hey, add this 
to your home  screen.

04:15:59.860 --> 04:16:01.860
want to distract the order or 
the user.

04:16:04.291 --> 04:16:09.840
So in the default event  and 
call prevent default on it.  

04:16:09.841 --> 04:16:11.841
Prevent default says hey,  don't
show up.

04:16:14.744 --> 04:16:16.570
so that in a  moment when you're
ready to show it, when you're 

04:16:16.571 --> 04:16:18.571
like okay.

04:16:21.054 --> 04:16:23.920
this to be visible, you can call
prompt on that saved event.

04:16:26.969 --> 04:16:29.650
You can also tell when a user  
has  your app to the home screen

04:16:29.651 --> 04:16:32.083
by listening for the  app 
installed event.

04:16:35.568 --> 04:16:37.568
will  teleyou that yes.  They 
clicked.

04:16:40.530 --> 04:16:42.530
I want to install this or  crime
or 

04:16:45.103 --> 04:16:47.221
added -- able to  add it to the 
user's home screen.  That's 

04:16:47.222 --> 04:16:55.662
today. prompt.  But it's 
changing.  All  right?  Starting

04:16:55.663 --> 04:17:00.564
in Chrome 68, Chrome is no  that
prompt automatically.  Instead, 

04:17:00.565 --> 04:17:02.565
you're going to  need to 

04:17:05.463 --> 04:17:10.682
prompt event.   Then trigger the
prompt by calling prompt on it 

04:17:10.683 --> 04:17:12.683
on that  saved event with 

04:17:14.198 --> 04:17:16.198
useer gesture.

04:17:18.785 --> 04:17:21.481
To make the experience  
reliable, Starbucks used workbox

04:17:21.482 --> 04:17:23.482
with a 

04:17:25.198 --> 04:17:27.879
and run time caching strategies.
By pre-caching  their content, 

04:17:27.880 --> 04:17:29.880
they 

04:17:32.822 --> 04:17:35.940
that the app needed to run were 
always there.  They wouldn't  

04:17:35.941 --> 04:17:39.269
have to wait for the network. 
user uses the app  and they're 

04:17:39.270 --> 04:17:43.564
able to cache additional content
as they  navigate around.

04:17:55.055 --> 04:17:57.095
what they allow users to do as  
we showed earlier is you can pay

04:17:57.096 --> 04:17:59.096
for your order.

04:18:02.011 --> 04:18:04.253
about the users previous orders,
about the  nearby stores they 

04:18:04.254 --> 04:18:06.254
have gone to and their payment 
details.

04:18:10.788 --> 04:18:12.788
be available.

04:18:16.727 --> 04:18:18.727
progressive web app  engaging.

04:18:21.624 --> 04:18:23.869
so the users can  customize that
drink with many options 

04:18:23.870 --> 04:18:25.870
available.

04:18:28.584 --> 04:18:31.504
fundamental details like the  
navigation stack making sure 

04:18:31.505 --> 04:18:33.505
that the back bend does the  
right thing.

04:18:37.675 --> 04:18:39.675
navigate  step by step back up 
rather 

04:18:42.588 --> 04:18:45.004
screen and also another random 
page.  To make the experience  

04:18:45.005 --> 04:18:47.005
feel more 

04:18:51.335 --> 04:18:54.647
content specific to  provide 
feedback to the user.  For 

04:18:54.648 --> 04:18:56.648
example, after clicking  at 
order, 

04:18:58.576 --> 04:19:04.126
a toast letting me than it's 
been added  to my bank.  As you 

04:19:04.127 --> 04:19:06.986
can see through creating a fast 
reliable and engaging 

04:19:06.987 --> 04:19:08.987
progressive web 

04:19:10.682 --> 04:19:12.682
app,  Starbucks have put their 
customers 

04:19:13.823 --> 04:19:16.099
where they are in the context 
that they live, they work,  they

04:19:16.100 --> 04:19:18.100
play to make 

04:19:19.992 --> 04:19:21.992
delightful  experience in order 
to 

04:19:30.302 --> 04:19:31.939
So have we bunched that fire  
Acrohn's  acronym in your head 

04:19:31.940 --> 04:19:36.256
yet? bad jokes.  I have a  
couple more set up for you.  So 

04:19:36.257 --> 04:19:38.257
be ready.

04:19:40.669 --> 04:19:42.669
working on building  their own 
progressive web apps.

04:19:46.307 --> 04:19:47.991
usings a  progressive web app to
make it possible for users to 

04:19:47.992 --> 04:19:52.145
ask  questions  and then provide
an answer  once they have 

04:19:52.146 --> 04:19:54.146
reconnectd.

04:19:55.693 --> 04:19:59.605
It uses service workers,  
background  push notifications. 

04:19:59.606 --> 04:20:02.532
By using service  workers, they 
were able to reduce the number 

04:20:02.533 --> 04:20:04.533
of external  

04:20:05.809 --> 04:20:07.809
requests by nearly 50% and they 
were 

04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:11.110
age to  reduce the number of 
user 

04:20:12.168 --> 04:20:14.168
by  loading JavaScript by 6%.

04:20:15.220 --> 04:20:17.220
So they saw a pretty good  
performance improvement.

04:20:19.734 --> 04:20:21.734
which is a  new way to create 
and share hyper local stories.

04:20:25.548 --> 04:20:29.011
It's all  built around a 
progressive  app.  It's a tiny 

04:20:29.012 --> 04:20:31.485
fraction of  a Native app and it
has 100% of the functionality.

04:20:35.201 --> 04:20:37.765
neat stuff with the media 
capture APIs so you  can take a 

04:20:37.766 --> 04:20:39.766
picture or video and 

04:20:44.496 --> 04:20:46.496
and sharing is as simple as 
sharing a URL.

04:20:52.177 --> 04:20:54.177
And the Maps  team recently ship
a web ap.

04:20:55.784 --> 04:20:57.784
They

04:21:00.588 --> 04:21:03.100
Previously, many of these  users
were getting a so called light 

04:21:03.101 --> 04:21:05.101
experience 

04:21:07.428 --> 04:21:09.428
mobile in mind, but it didn't 
take 

04:21:10.495 --> 04:21:12.495
advantage  of the new 
capabilities that  to  offer.

04:21:15.493 --> 04:21:17.493
The progressive web app doesn't 
have 

04:21:19.431 --> 04:21:22.495
feature parody  with their 
initiative app. around four key 

04:21:22.496 --> 04:21:24.496
user  journeys.

04:21:25.992 --> 04:21:29.679
Again, see that bad pun?  I told
you there were a  few. were 

04:21:29.680 --> 04:21:31.956
really important.  First they 
wanted to  make it easy for 

04:21:36.053 --> 04:21:38.326
land  marks so they can get a 
sense of where they are.

04:21:48.581 --> 04:21:50.581
They help  them discover new 
places.

04:21:52.047 --> 04:21:54.540
they wanted to make  it easy to 
get directions.  So that they 

04:21:54.541 --> 04:21:56.541
could figure out  how to 

04:21:59.157 --> 04:22:01.157
And users  are using it even 
more.

04:22:04.100 --> 04:22:06.100
The new experience is seeing 20%
more 

04:22:08.117 --> 04:22:12.699
page loads compared to the 
previous  experiences.  

04:22:12.700 --> 04:22:15.622
Targeting low end devices, but 
the  to put that extra effort 

04:22:15.623 --> 04:22:17.697
into making sure that  
everything was fast.

04:22:24.656 --> 04:22:27.103
the  beginning by establishing 
code size, load time and  

04:22:27.104 --> 04:22:29.772
benchmarks that can  every 
single commit.

04:22:33.021 --> 04:22:35.458
They use Chrome DEV tools to use
memory and performance and  test

04:22:35.459 --> 04:22:37.459
it on 

04:22:38.961 --> 04:22:40.961
looking for any regressions.

04:22:43.431 --> 04:22:47.936
They   needed it make sure it 
worked  flaky  networks.  They 

04:22:47.937 --> 04:22:49.937
set a goal to be mindful of how 

04:22:51.045 --> 04:22:54.595
much data  they were using and 
trying to  that in check.  

04:22:54.596 --> 04:22:56.034
Forever  users on expensive data
plans, they wouldn't consume too

04:22:56.035 --> 04:22:58.035
much of their data.

04:23:02.166 --> 04:23:04.166
progressive web app.

04:23:07.888 --> 04:23:09.888
I've already installed it on 
here.

04:23:11.777 --> 04:23:14.637
that -- oh, I guess we should 
come out of  airplane mode.  

04:23:14.638 --> 04:23:17.505
That would be kind of helpful.  
neat things, they have that no 

04:23:18.115 --> 04:23:20.115
internet.  They give you an  
indication of 

04:23:23.387 --> 04:23:25.387
You can see this looks like the 

04:23:26.442 --> 04:23:28.442
standard Maps experience.

04:23:30.105 --> 04:23:32.623
It may not be quite as shiny, 
but I  check out and try  and 

04:23:32.624 --> 04:23:40.476
find a place I have been once or
twice before.  Sports  page. 

04:23:40.477 --> 04:23:43.129
quickly almost instantly with 
all  the information.  It has 

04:23:43.130 --> 04:23:45.130
that standard page view.

04:23:46.223 --> 04:23:48.223
about the things that I'm 
looking for.

04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:54.429
And if I  clear this out -- even

04:23:55.700 --> 04:23:57.700
the  places -- there we go.

04:23:58.809 --> 04:24:00.809
It remembers placings that I've 
been  to before.

04:24:02.531 --> 04:24:04.531
page, that's all still  there.

04:24:05.811 --> 04:24:10.601
It is cached in an index DB 
table so  to go.  If we can 

04:24:10.602 --> 04:24:13.714
switch back to the  slides, 
great.  With the previous Maps 

04:24:13.715 --> 04:24:15.715
experience, 

04:24:19.646 --> 04:24:21.646
focused to put as much Beta as 
possible 

04:24:24.608 --> 04:24:26.608
into that  HTTP request.

04:24:30.112 --> 04:24:31.535
CSS and  JavaScript and Htext ML
templates, stuff they might need

04:24:31.536 --> 04:24:33.536
for  

04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:37.623
They wanted to have  everything 
there so they can get started 

04:24:37.624 --> 04:24:39.624
right away.

04:24:43.207 --> 04:24:45.851
web app, they have refactord the
code into  really super fine 

04:24:45.852 --> 04:24:47.852
grain modules 

04:24:48.931 --> 04:24:51.388
worker when they're needed.  So 
unlike the  traditional 

04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:53.389
experience, 

04:24:57.132 --> 04:24:59.318
cod  that's needed -- code 
that's needed T. doesn't have to

04:24:59.319 --> 04:25:01.319
load  or execute that 

04:25:02.330 --> 04:25:04.330
code meaning

04:25:15.418 --> 04:25:17.418
And the Maps team wanted to make
sure 

04:25:20.314 --> 04:25:22.314
reliably no matter what their  
network connection was like.

04:25:24.382 --> 04:25:26.382
To achieve that, they use  
service 

04:25:27.854 --> 04:25:29.854
to cache the core app shell of 
their app.

04:25:31.149 --> 04:25:33.149
So they can eliminate the 
network in that initial stuff.

04:25:36.025 --> 04:25:38.025
how they were going to  store 
the map tiles.

04:25:42.357 --> 04:25:44.813
somewhere between  10 and 20K 
each and you imagine as you pan 

04:25:44.814 --> 04:25:49.376
and zoom, you can  of them.  In 
fact, you can load dozens  of 

04:25:49.377 --> 04:25:54.676
them by panning and zooming 
pretty quickly. change 

04:25:54.677 --> 04:25:58.526
frequently.  Imagine new 
businesses open and  close as 

04:25:58.527 --> 04:26:00.527
things changed.

04:26:02.759 --> 04:26:04.759
Those map tiles are

04:26:06.766 --> 04:26:08.766
So starring those tiles using 
the 

04:26:12.653 --> 04:26:15.094
they wanted to  accomplish in 
V1.  So what they decided to do 

04:26:15.095 --> 04:26:18.768
is use the  browser cache. in a 
really neat way.

04:26:22.033 --> 04:26:24.033
As each  tile is successfully 
loaded, 

04:26:28.677 --> 04:26:30.677
an index DB table.

04:26:33.650 --> 04:26:35.917
Later when the browser goes to  
get it again, the service worker

04:26:35.918 --> 04:26:37.918
regenerates 

04:26:39.002 --> 04:26:41.002
URL based  on the version 
information 

04:26:43.294 --> 04:26:45.294
and is able to go back to the  
browser cache.

04:26:46.773 --> 04:26:49.397
the tile back from the  browser 
cache again.  For things like 

04:26:49.398 --> 04:26:51.398
searches, directions  

04:26:53.097 --> 04:26:55.145
stuff, all of that is saved in 
index DB.   That is always there

04:26:55.146 --> 04:26:57.146
on the users   offline.

04:27:00.689 --> 04:27:02.520
To help eliminate some of the 
yankieness is  possible, and 

04:27:02.521 --> 04:27:04.521
reduce the 

04:27:05.986 --> 04:27:08.836
memory that's  used, they use 
the layers panel in Chrome DEV 

04:27:08.837 --> 04:27:10.837
tools to  

04:27:13.717 --> 04:27:15.717
and remove them from the  dom.

04:27:16.783 --> 04:27:21.485
That also shows them really 
useful if you go into  3D mode. 

04:27:21.486 --> 04:27:23.550
context of your page.  If you're
trying to figure out what 

04:27:29.647 --> 04:27:31.075
It is one of my favorite ones 
that I recently started  playing

04:27:31.076 --> 04:27:33.076
with that's been around for a 
while.

04:27:35.949 --> 04:27:37.949
also  decided to limit the 
amount of 

04:27:41.612 --> 04:27:44.279
transparency and buck shadows  
that they have. the search box 

04:27:44.280 --> 04:27:46.280
you see up  there is a full 
development.

04:27:49.212 --> 04:27:52.051
In the normal experience, it's  
a  that has the map tiles drawn 

04:27:52.052 --> 04:27:55.104
behind it.   They don't have to 
draw the map tiles behind it or 

04:27:55.105 --> 04:27:57.105
anything.

04:27:59.588 --> 04:28:01.588
One of the biggest  challenges 
that 

04:28:04.287 --> 04:28:06.128
progressive web app  is the 
storage APIs are stoned to the 

04:28:06.129 --> 04:28:08.129
origin.  And I didn't  realize 
this.

04:28:10.654 --> 04:28:12.654
Maps is actually served on 
Google.com.

04:28:17.796 --> 04:28:19.796
So that means it shares the same

04:28:22.667 --> 04:28:25.908
but also search and Chrome's 
default new tab page.  Any  

04:28:25.909 --> 04:28:27.909
service that Google serves is 

04:28:29.377 --> 04:28:31.377
They  have to be careful not to 
step 

04:28:33.216 --> 04:28:35.216
on other folks toes.

04:28:37.138 --> 04:28:39.571
tools is the clear site data  
button.  It removes the service 

04:28:39.572 --> 04:28:41.572
workers, gets 

04:28:42.848 --> 04:28:44.848
and let's start from zero.

04:28:48.624 --> 04:28:50.624
Of course, that  includes the 
cookies.

04:28:53.011 --> 04:28:54.659
what was going on, I kept 
getting signed out of mail and I

04:28:54.660 --> 04:28:56.660
couldn't 

04:28:59.646 --> 04:29:01.902
my cookies  signs me out of my 
mail.  It was a pain in the 

04:29:01.903 --> 04:29:03.903
butt.

04:29:07.041 --> 04:29:09.094
So we gave you a lot of  
progression about progressive 

04:29:09.095 --> 04:29:11.095
web apps to mobile.

04:29:15.205 --> 04:29:17.205
developments for progressive  
web apps today.

04:29:20.498 --> 04:29:21.719
of mobile has been  strong, we 
mustnd forget desktop usage is 

04:29:21.720 --> 04:29:23.720
still growing  

04:29:25.218 --> 04:29:27.453
chart here.  This graph shows 
that  mobile phone 

04:29:33.653 --> 04:29:36.115
has significant use in the 
evening time.  Desktop  usage is

04:29:36.116 --> 04:29:38.116
not evenly 

04:29:39.616 --> 04:29:41.626
when most  people are at work 
and at their desks.

04:29:45.912 --> 04:29:47.912
It's mainly lead by  
productivity apps.

04:29:50.395 --> 04:29:52.395
of the apps we use today 
messageing  

04:29:53.410 --> 04:29:55.410
like slack and Spotifying.

04:30:00.125 --> 04:30:02.620
be really important to use 
because it gives them  the 

04:30:02.621 --> 04:30:04.621
confidence the app will be fast,
reliable and engaging.

04:30:09.571 --> 04:30:11.598
built desktop hats  using web  
framework that  embeds their 

04:30:14.217 --> 04:30:16.217
application in a custom built 
web browser.

04:30:18.926 --> 04:30:20.926
does today.

04:30:24.617 --> 04:30:25.606
It feels kind of  redundant to 
ship an entire browser and your 

04:30:25.607 --> 04:30:28.063
code given that   already has a 
browser on that machine.

04:30:31.734 --> 04:30:33.734
Not only  have you significantly

04:30:35.408 --> 04:30:38.853
but you have to keep that 
rendering stack up to date. and 

04:30:38.854 --> 04:30:43.571
more.  So you are  responsible 
for your app and maintaining 

04:30:43.572 --> 04:30:45.617
that rendering  stack in this 
case.

04:30:58.171 --> 04:31:00.171
desktop -- PWA for desk top.

04:31:01.879 --> 04:31:05.790
desktops.  And it also needs to 
be fast integrated,  reliable 

04:31:05.791 --> 04:31:08.035
and engaging. me now I'm  sure.

04:31:11.515 --> 04:31:13.515
That means they launched from 
the same 

04:31:14.951 --> 04:31:17.392
place that  there was desktop 
apps, but  run also in an app 

04:31:17.393 --> 04:31:19.393
window.

04:31:20.438 --> 04:31:22.477
So they look and feel like other
apps on the desk top.

04:31:27.595 --> 04:31:29.595
progressive web apps to  desk 
top.

04:31:31.297 --> 04:31:33.530
you today is on  Chrome OS.  But
work is already well underway to

04:31:36.602 --> 04:31:38.602
support  windows and Mac as 
well.

04:31:42.159 --> 04:31:44.159
web apps through the Microsoft 
app store.

04:31:50.718 --> 04:31:52.718
at the FWA experience --  PWA 
OS.

04:31:54.673 --> 04:31:56.673
I will  move to this pixel book 
now.

04:31:58.800 --> 04:32:00.800
Let's go to Spotify.

04:32:13.779 --> 04:32:15.779
will see here that it asks me if
I want to install the app.

04:32:20.135 --> 04:32:22.564
So I'm going to say yes and -- I
can  install here.  If  you look

04:32:22.565 --> 04:32:24.565
quickly and closely, you 

04:32:26.232 --> 04:32:28.232
will see it land on my  shelf 
down here.

04:32:30.558 --> 04:32:32.558
close that out and show you how 
easy 

04:32:34.181 --> 04:32:36.181
it is to launch it as if it was 
my 

04:32:39.886 --> 04:32:44.142
So Pete, I heard about the ban 
tomorrow  night.  Did you hear? 

04:32:44.143 --> 04:32:46.143
I'm kind of excited.

04:32:48.187 --> 04:32:50.187
Let's --  all right.

04:32:59.219 --> 04:33:01.219
keep going.

04:33:10.559 --> 04:33:12.559
the window.

04:33:14.858 --> 04:33:16.858
demo is good.

04:33:17.940 --> 04:33:20.195
So you  saw that it was -- I can
and see if it will  play.

04:33:24.712 --> 04:33:26.712
You can see the install app is 
gone here.

04:33:29.233 --> 04:33:31.035
app and it is using the whole of
the  screen that's in the app 

04:33:31.036 --> 04:33:33.036
window and it's 

04:33:36.165 --> 04:33:37.597
that I can launch directly there
from my shelf.   All right.  

04:33:37.598 --> 04:33:39.598
Let's move back over to Slides.

04:33:41.457 --> 04:33:43.457
Getting started isn't different 
than what you are already doing.

04:33:45.555 --> 04:33:47.821
like a whole new  class of apps 
or anything like that.  All of 

04:33:47.822 --> 04:33:50.534
the work you  have already done 
existing progressive web apps  

04:33:50.535 --> 04:33:53.369
still applies.  Service workers 
make it fast and reliable.

04:33:58.271 --> 04:34:00.271
push notifications to keep users
up to date.

04:34:04.373 --> 04:34:06.373
They add to home screen criteria
as it does on mobile.

04:34:10.865 --> 04:34:13.534
running in a tab, it is  running
in an app window. no tabs or 

04:34:13.535 --> 04:34:15.535
address bar.

04:34:16.799 --> 04:34:18.799
It is just your app.

04:34:22.133 --> 04:34:24.133
There nkow is window 
organization.

04:34:29.408 --> 04:34:31.408
make it really easy to

04:34:38.477 --> 04:34:40.477
-- you have the  standard 
maximize as 

04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:46.471
you would expect and on Chrome 
OS, the   bar, it is themed 

04:34:46.472 --> 04:34:48.472
based on the manifests colors.

04:34:51.960 --> 04:34:53.960
Speaking of the web app, I do 
want to 

04:34:56.039 --> 04:34:58.039
you  future proof your apps by 
adding the scope property.

04:35:00.917 --> 04:35:03.584
It  defines the set of URLs the 
is going to consider  within 

04:35:03.585 --> 04:35:05.585
your app.

04:35:07.146 --> 04:35:09.146
If you leave that set of URLs, 
it will 

04:35:11.861 --> 04:35:13.915
This is important.  In the  
future, this is going to be 

04:35:22.116 --> 04:35:24.116
Within the app and menu, there 
is that 

04:35:25.819 --> 04:35:28.277
app mernew that gives you the 
URL and  you want  to get into.

04:35:32.570 --> 04:35:34.570
into account building  desktop 

04:35:36.491 --> 04:35:38.491
necessarily  always apply to 

04:35:39.862 --> 04:35:41.862
progressive web app on mobile 
devices.

04:35:44.604 --> 04:35:46.604
to significantly larger screen  
real estate.

04:35:48.108 --> 04:35:50.108
Don't just put your content with
extra 

04:35:52.817 --> 04:35:55.690
use the additional space by 
creating new points.   Some 

04:35:55.691 --> 04:35:57.691
applications benefit from that 
wider view.

04:36:18.340 --> 04:36:20.340
-- as it continues to get 
smaller, I 

04:36:22.061 --> 04:36:24.061
can still see  the same content.

04:36:29.209 --> 04:36:31.209
This shows me only the current 
condition.

04:36:32.707 --> 04:36:35.363
might show me the current songs 
and the button needed to  change

04:36:35.364 --> 04:36:37.364
the song.

04:36:43.375 --> 04:36:46.229
responseive  design to the next 
level.  When switched to tablet 

04:36:46.230 --> 04:36:51.199
mode,  these  window full 
screen.  Depending  on how the 

04:36:51.200 --> 04:36:53.200
user holds the 

04:36:54.483 --> 04:36:56.483
device, maybe even the landscape
report trait.

04:37:00.020 --> 04:37:02.094
responsive  design and that's 
what matters here.

04:37:06.400 --> 04:37:08.400
mode.

04:37:10.493 --> 04:37:12.493
Responsive design is critical to
a success.

04:37:14.619 --> 04:37:16.619
Desktop progressive web app 
experience.

04:37:18.336 --> 04:37:20.336
possibilities.

04:37:21.837 --> 04:37:23.837
So  work with your design and 
take a 

04:37:24.888 --> 04:37:26.888
approach for  break points.

04:37:28.982 --> 04:37:30.982
There's a screen or not and 
works 

04:37:33.413 --> 04:37:35.413
nicely with  those virtual 
keyboards.

04:37:39.054 --> 04:37:41.054
support for windows and Mac and 
for all 

04:37:44.707 --> 04:37:46.707
support with functionality.

04:37:51.314 --> 04:37:53.314
Them is the launch  icon to let 
users know.

04:37:57.491 --> 04:37:59.522
installed  PWA when the user 
click on a link that needs to be

04:37:59.523 --> 04:38:01.523
handled  by that app.

04:38:02.816 --> 04:38:05.706
out for announcements on the  
premium block that you see here 

04:38:05.707 --> 04:38:08.403
for updates and  it today.

04:38:11.857 --> 04:38:14.109
So we have about a minute  and a
half left to cover the last 

04:38:14.110 --> 04:38:16.110
section.

04:38:17.190 --> 04:38:19.190
I won't go that fast.  I will 
cover the key  stuff.

04:38:26.359 --> 04:38:30.360
out in another video.  We know 
that  there are a lot of cases 

04:38:31.813 --> 04:38:33.813
where this makes sense.

04:38:36.300 --> 04:38:38.300
to integrate your web content 
into your Native  app.

04:38:39.787 --> 04:38:41.787
Today you can do this using 
either a 

04:38:43.827 --> 04:38:45.827
or  custom fab.

04:38:55.970 --> 04:38:57.970
-- one of the things you want is
to be 

04:39:02.551 --> 04:39:04.551
have control.

04:39:06.452 --> 04:39:09.118
Trusted web activities allows to
you oints great that  experience

04:39:09.119 --> 04:39:11.119
powered by  experience.

04:39:14.245 --> 04:39:17.533
It is rendered by  the users up 
to date.  It isn't a mechanic an

04:39:17.534 --> 04:39:19.534
torch wrap  

04:39:20.788 --> 04:39:22.788
and you put it on the Play 
Store.

04:39:23.893 --> 04:39:25.893
It can cause  some kind of 
drastic problems.

04:39:28.266 --> 04:39:30.539
design to Mike it possible for 
you to use the investment on  

04:39:30.540 --> 04:39:32.540
your web app 

04:39:33.871 --> 04:39:36.118
app.  There are a  couple of 
requirements.

04:39:39.185 --> 04:39:41.185
They must be done as first party
content. it has to be yours.

04:39:44.306 --> 04:39:46.306
You need to  add an intent 
filter in 

04:39:47.594 --> 04:39:49.594
your manifest and you need to 
pass  the 

04:39:50.768 --> 04:39:52.768
progressive criteria we talked 
about earlier.

04:39:54.441 --> 04:40:01.937
You  need to follow the standard
Play Store guidelines.to do.  

04:40:01.938 --> 04:40:05.642
Essentially two,  but we'll call
them sort of four. up a set of 

04:40:05.643 --> 04:40:07.643
digital  asset links and 

04:40:08.730 --> 04:40:10.730
that allows you to prove that 
your 

04:40:13.443 --> 04:40:15.443
web and then create the 
activity.

04:40:19.387 --> 04:40:21.387
The  code here is we will get 
this up 

04:40:27.804 --> 04:40:29.804
and details where they already 
-- if 

04:40:31.314 --> 04:40:33.314
you go to G.

04:40:34.423 --> 04:40:36.423
co,  all of the notes in and 
including 

04:40:39.351 --> 04:40:42.433
to get  started on this is right
up there.  So that completes 

04:40:42.434 --> 04:40:44.434
this talk.

04:40:46.253 --> 04:40:48.253
So  you can all get to the party
tonight.

04:40:54.762 --> 04:40:56.762
progressive app works.

04:40:58.663 --> 04:41:00.663
They are bringing a  more 
convenient 

04:41:02.545 --> 04:41:04.545
and great ease of use to  their 
consumers.

04:41:06.870 --> 04:41:08.870
We're seeing how Google has web 
apps 

04:41:11.625 --> 04:41:13.274
and how progressive web apps can
improve  desktop experiences 

04:41:13.275 --> 04:41:15.275
through careful design and use 
of app  window.

04:41:20.542 --> 04:41:22.542
you can  integrate your PWA into
your Native app.

04:41:26.487 --> 04:41:29.794
focus on being fast, integrated,
reliable and  engaging.  They're

04:41:29.795 --> 04:41:31.795
transforming the web on mobile  
on  desktop.

04:41:35.500 --> 04:41:37.500
three things, one go  check your

04:41:41.325 --> 04:41:43.325
that before  prompt event.

04:41:44.393 --> 04:41:46.393
Go try that and out of scope and
if 

04:41:48.888 --> 04:41:50.888
a look at trusted web  
activities.  Thanks, everybody.

04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:54.390
Thank you.
