00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.380
When it comes to leading up the chain,

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.340
what do you do when your goals aren't seeming to align?
Example,

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.330
making money versus have any impact.
Okay,

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.090
this is the deal here.
The goals have to align,

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.550
they have to align it.
And furthermore,
they will align.

6
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.440
That is now you might have to go pretty high up the chain to make this happen or

7
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:28.450
you might have to dig pretty hard to make that happen.

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.090
But this is a great example,
right?

9
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:34.000
The example is making money versus making an impact.

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.680
And I'm going to tell you that those two actually aligned.

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.770
How do they align?
Well,
let me explain.

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.460
If your company makes more money,

13
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.290
they will have a bigger impact,
right?
They will have a bigger impact.

14
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:54.790
So let me,
let me break it down a little bit.
So,

15
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.420
so if you want to have a big impact on a client,
right?

16
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.470
And so what you do is you spend so much time and so much money with that client,

17
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.760
with that customer,

18
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.400
you're going to realize that the company,
if you're,

19
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.000
if you invest that much to a client or to customer,

20
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.740
you invest that much time in that much money.

21
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.110
Your company is going to go out of business.
Now,

22
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:20.320
how much impact are you having with that?
With that client?
The answer is zero.

23
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.780
Now sometimes the opposite happens and this is probably what you,

24
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.610
what the question is related to.
For instance,

25
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.020
if we as a company,
we start cutting corners on quality.

26
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.780
We start cutting corners on customer service or whatever the case may be.

27
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.670
We might make more money in the short term.
Oh,
like to save money,
save money.

28
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:44.920
You know what?
We were supposed to have 10 people answering phones.

29
00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:46.900
We're going to fire six of them.
We're going to have four left.

30
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.670
That means everyone's waiting on the phone,

31
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.500
so now we don't have good customer service.

32
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:53.740
Now we'll start to write a Yelp review.
I was on hold for 14 hours.

33
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.310
I hate this company,
right?
This happens.
This is what happens.
This is the example.

34
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.870
So,
so now up the chain of command,
so before it was,
look,

35
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.160
we need 30 people in the call center to answer the phone.

36
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.150
And that way everybody gets an answer within 30 seconds when they call in and

37
00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:11.530
when a customer calls in,
okay,

38
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.930
we're out of business in a month because we can't afford 30 people.

39
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:15.190
So now we have no impact.

40
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.600
The other end of the spectrum is we have three people in the call center

41
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.900
responding to phone calls.
We,
everyone has to wait an hour now.
No one,

42
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.610
everyone hates our company.
We also have no impact.
Yeah.
So the the,

43
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.650
there,
the goals have to be aligned at some case and but the thing is,

44
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.720
it is a balancing act.
It's,

45
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.900
it's between expenditures for the cost to produce or the cost to provide

46
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:45.880
service.
And you've got to keep that as low as possible so that,

47
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.050
so that money is made but you can't go so low that quality and customer service

48
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.570
and follow on business and customer relations,

49
00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:03.220
you can't so low that it gets destroyed.
And so you as a,

50
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.050
as a worker need to realize that your higher ups are trying to balance that and

51
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:08.831
they're saying,
hey,

52
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:11.800
you can't dedicate this much time or you can't dedicate that much time to echo.

53
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.390
You need,
you're spending too much time with each client.

54
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:15.580
You need to get three more clients.
Well,

55
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.540
I can't give them the impact that I want.
I can't give them the focus.
Okay.

56
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.600
Can you handle one more client?
Yeah,
I could probably do that.
Okay.

57
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:26.500
We're finding the balance that the new,
another good restaurant business,
right.

58
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.380
Restaurant business is a really easy,

59
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:33.190
simple one to understand because the quality of the food that we get and the

60
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.990
quality of the,
the,
the chefs that we have,
the,

61
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.310
the more it costs to buy the food,

62
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:43.390
that good food and the higher quality chef and cook and help we have,

63
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.420
the better the food's going to be.
Well,
all that stuff costs more money.

64
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.370
So you got to find that.
If you,

65
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.100
you have a restaurant where it's the best hamburger in the world,

66
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.050
it's $84 you're not going to have a line at that place.
You Go,
you,

67
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.230
you have impact because you're having the best burger in America.
Guess what?

68
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.750
You're not going to be in business to have that.

69
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.660
Your impact is going to be zero all their side of the spectrum.

70
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.510
Salmonella poisoning.
Cause you're buying cheap stuff and you cut,
you know,

71
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.750
refrigeration costs and,
and that's guess what?
You're going out of business too.

72
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.930
So the goals are aligned at the end of the day because profit equals growth.

73
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.640
Growth equals impact.
Now you know,
are there ethical times where someone says,

74
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.350
hey,
we're screwing over a couple.
Yeah,
absolutely.

75
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.040
Look what's happened at Wells Fargo,
right?
Wells Fargo had a,
had a,

76
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.820
a plague of that type of behavior and it was rampant throughout the whole

77
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:39.310
company.
Guess where they're at now?
They're hurting,
they're hurting.

78
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:42.070
They made a bunch of money in the short term.
But guess what?

79
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:46.510
Now they're not trusted.
So they got to do some recuperation.

80
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.500
But that's a classic example is someone from Wells Fargo might've asked this

81
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:54.880
question and you know,
a year ago before the story broke and said,
Hey Jocko,

82
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.170
we're trying to do something positive here and the company won't,

83
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.770
my goals aren't aligned with the company.

84
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.420
And he would have been right and he should have raised his hand because what he

85
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.660
could have said was,
hey,
bosses,
if we keep this up,

86
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.960
we're going to lose the trust and confidence of the public and we're going to be

87
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:14.140
hurting.
And he would've been correct.

88
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.480
So you got to find that balance.

89
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:19.090
But just remember that even though the goals might not seem aligned,

90
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.080
they are aligned.
In the end,
they need to be that.
Not saying they always are,

91
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.700
but if they're not aligned in the end,
you're going to be,

92
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:26.950
you're probably going to go out of business

93
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.660
because you just cut a swath of mayhem.

94
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.970
You destroy your customers either through high prices or by low service.

95
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.180
One of those two things can happen if you don't find the dichotomy,
the balanced,

96
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:42.100
not even dichotomy,
it's the balance.
You gotta find the balance.
