00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.860
We're asked to first find
the focus and directrix

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.310
of the parabola by
moving the orange point

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.530
and line to their
correct positions,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.650
then use that
information to find

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.510
the equation of the parabola.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.960
So just as a little
bit of review,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.070
a parabola is a
conic section that

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.080
is formed from all
of the points that

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.420
are equidistant to
some point that we call

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.182
the focus and some line that
we called the directrix.

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:28.140
And what we have right
over here-- what it does

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.830
is, as we move
along the parabola,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.420
as we move our cursor
along the parabola

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.920
right over here, it looks
at the distance to where

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.690
the current dot is
and then it tries

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.400
to plot that same distance to
some theoretical directrix.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.170
And that's where
that line drops down.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.930
And you can clearly
see right now

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.030
that this isn't working out,
that this is not equidistant.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.890
So the first thing that I like
to do when I try to figure out

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.930
where the focus is
is that the parabola

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.770
is going to be symmetric
around the focus,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.410
or at least around the vertical
line that the focus is on,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.340
I should say.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.349
And so the focus is going to
sit right above the vertex.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.200
So that's the first thing to do.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.860
And so let me keep
manipulating it.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.275
So if I look below
down there-- and it's

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.400
hard to do that because
when I move the cursor then

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.275
that green thing
disappears-- but if you look

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:19.229
at that vertical green line,
that shouldn't be moving--

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.270
the bottom of it shouldn't
be moving up and down.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.410
It should be equidistant
to a flat line.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.260
So let me keep playing with it.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.450
It looks like that
might be an improvement.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.160
Let me see.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.960
So this actually
looks pretty good.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.660
Notice the bottom--
oops-- notice

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.470
the bottom of the
vertical green line

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.245
is not moving in the
vertical direction.

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:43.120
It's just moving in the
horizontal direction.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.420
So if I move my directrix up
there, that should work out.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.530
So let me move it up there.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.940
And there you have it.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.230
Notice now my parabola--
these green lines

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.410
show the distance to the
focus and the distance

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.990
to the directrix, and notice
that they are always the same.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.393
So it looks like I got the right
focus and the right directrix

00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:04.550
now.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.400
So I got the right focus
and the right directrix.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.900
And the focus is 1/4
comma negative 3/8.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.880
And the directrix is
y equals negative 5/8.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.760
So now let's try to
use that information

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.044
to actually find the equation
of the parabola in this form

00:02:22.044 --> 00:02:22.710
right over here.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.840
And this is going to involve a
little bit of algebra for us.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.890
So actually let me
copy and paste this.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.219
So I'm going to
copy and paste this

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.760
so that we know what
we need, and let

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.200
me open my little
scratch pad up.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.730
All right.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.210
So this is our
information, and we

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.210
need to figure out the
equation of the parabola.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.329
So just as a little bit of
review, we have the point.

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.620
So let's say this is our point.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.380
This is our focus-- is the
point 1/4 comma negative 3/8.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.130
And then we have the directrix
at y equals negative 5/8.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.440
So the directrix looks
something like this.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.860
That is y is equal
to negative 5/8.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.360
And then we have our parabola.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.800
And it looks
something like this.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.230
It's equidistant to
the 2, so our parabola

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.120
looks something like that.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.542
And the parabola, the x's and
y's that satisfy this equation

00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:24.000
are all of the x's
and y's that are

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.610
equidistant to these two things.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.450
So let's call that x comma y.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.880
So let's find an equation for
all of the x's and y's that

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.350
are equidistant to this
point and to this line

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.860
right over here.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.250
So, first, let's think about
the distance between this focus

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.742
and this x, y right over here.

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:44.200
Well, that distance just comes
straight out of the distance

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.190
formula, which comes straight
out of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.160
It's going to be x
minus 1/4 squared

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.570
plus y minus
negative 3/8 squared.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.200
So that's going to be
y plus 3/8 squared.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.670
So this is our distance squared.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.660
We could take the square root if
we-- Why don't we just do that?

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.160
So let me just take
the square root.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.660
So this is the distance between
any point on the parabola x, y

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.120
and the focus.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.887
And the distance between that
same point and the directrix--

00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:20.220
well, that's just going to
be a straight, vertical line.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.880
So that's just going
to be our change in y.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.230
So this is going to be equal
to y minus negative 5/8,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.746
which is the same
thing as y plus 5/8.

00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:35.870
And just to make sure that
this is always positive,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.920
let's square it and then
take the square root.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.620
Now, to simplify
this, we could square

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.100
both sides of this equation.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.730
And we get x minus
1/4 squared plus y--

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.230
and actually let
me expand this out.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.980
This will be useful
for us in a second,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.130
so let me expand this out.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.100
So this is going to be y
squared plus-- let's see,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:06.550
2 times 3/8 is 3/4-- so
plus 3/4y plus 9/64 is

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.486
equal to this thing squared,
which is just y-- well, let me

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:11.860
actually expand
that out as well.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:19.880
So that's y squared plus 2
times 5/8 is going to be 5/4.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.664
5/4y plus 25 over 64.

00:05:26.664 --> 00:05:28.205
Now, let me see if
I can simplify it.

00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:30.040
I have a y squared
on both sides,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.600
so I can cancel those terms out.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.260
So y squared, y squared.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.520
Let me subtract 3/4y
from both sides.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.060
And let me subtract
9/64 from both sides.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.360
Minus 9/64.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.239
Minus 9/64.

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:50.780
Actually, we had a
little more space.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.370
So that's going to be gone
and that's going to be gone.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.610
Our left hand side is
just going to simplify

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.500
to x minus 1/4 squared.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.660
And that's going to be
equal to-- let's see.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.800
5/4 minus 3/4 is 2/4, which
is the same thing as 1/2y.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.850
And then 25/64
minus 9/64 is 16/64,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.510
which is just the
same thing as 1/4.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.170
So it's going to
be plus 1/4 there.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.630
Now, we're almost got
where we need to go.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.060
We have this x
minus 1/4 squared.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.460
We just need to get a
coefficient out here and write

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.250
this in terms of
y minus something.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.670
So what we can do
right over here

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.770
is we can factor out a 1/2.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.840
So let's do that.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.340
So this is going to be
x minus 1/4 squared is

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.809
equal to-- factoring out a
1/2, it's 1/2 times y plus 1/2.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.350
And now, in order to put it in
the form that they care about,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.830
they just have y minus
something right over here

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.420
and then something times
x minus something squared.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.990
So we need to get this 1/2
or get this coefficient

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.089
on the other side.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.630
The easiest way I
know how to do that

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.340
is to multiply both sides by 2.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.960
So you multiply both sides by 2.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.110
That cancels.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.450
And if we really want
to put it in the form

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.140
that they care about,
we can swap the sides.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.970
Instead of writing
y plus 1/2, we

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.730
can write that as y
minus negative 1/2.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.572
That's the same
thing as y plus 1/2--

00:07:25.572 --> 00:07:27.030
I'm going to do it
in the same form

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:38.277
that they want-- is equal to
2 times x minus 1/4 squared.

00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:38.860
So let me see.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.750
Did I do that right?

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.250
Yep.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.530
y minus negative 1/2 is the
same thing as y plus 1/2

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.410
is equal to 2 times
x minus 1/4 squared.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.400
So let me see if we got
that actually right.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.840
So let's see.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.330
It's negative 1/2 here,
positive 2, and then 1/4.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:10.860
So we have it is negative
1/2, positive 2, and then 1/4.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.270
Let's see if we got it right.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.160
And we did.
