00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.736
And now, as we are in the throes
of election season,

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.172
it is time for another
installment of Voter Voices.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.607
(cheering and applause)

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.577
This incredibly important,
classic segment

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.646
that we've only actually done
one other time.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.581
This is what we hear
from a niche group of voters

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.984
who could sway
this very close election.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.520
Tonight's group is Furries.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.156
The Facebook page Furries for
Trump is titillating voters

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.925
with its sexy rabbit drawings.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.693
Ah!

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.929
Just ruined<i> Space Jam</i> for me.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.898
(laughter)

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:34.734
The hashtag #FurriesForHillary

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.769
has been used
a whopping five times.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:39.205
So here to give us a perspective
of an undecided Furry

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:43.576
is Connor Coop,
aka Dreamhorse Sweetnipple.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.578
♪ ♪

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:47.547
(cheering and applause)

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.354
Thank you.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:56.856
Thank you, everyone.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.758
Thank you for having me, Chris.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.628
Now, we Furries may seem
a little out there, um.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.464
But we're just like you.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.232
We are lawyers.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.467
We are teachers.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.768
We're doctors.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.804
Um, I'm an unlicensed
gynecologist, for instance.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:13.439
HARDWICK:
Oh.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.476
We're normal Americans,

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.278
uh, who just happen to derive
sexual gratification

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.280
cranking it to crude sketches
of raccoon people

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:22.882
with arm-length dongs.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:26.018
Now, first of all, you're
actually not very furry.

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:29.388
-Do not velour-shame me.
-HARDWICK: Okay.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.457
I am sorry, Connor.
I am very sorry.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.825
Uh, please. Call me, uh,

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:35.628
Dreamhorse Sweetnipple
when I'm in my true skin.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:36.829
HARDWICK:
All right, Mr. Sweetnipple.

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.030
It's actually, uh, sorry.

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:39.732
-It is actually
Dr. Sweetnipple. -Okay.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:41.701
I didn't spend six years
getting my nipples sweetened

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:45.471
in medical school to be called
Mister on a basic cable program.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:49.342
All right, Dr.,
Dr. Sweetnipple-- okay, okay.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.810
So politically,
where are you right now?

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.078
Why are you undecided?

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.379
(neighs like a horse)

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.848
HARDWICK:
Whoa!

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:58.584
-I get a little worked up.
-Whoa, boy.

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.753
Am I presenting to the right?
Am I presenting?

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.955
-Yeah, you're presenting.
-It's right in my face.

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:05.658
HARDWICK;
You're presenting very well.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.393
And there-there's something
about you squatting

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:09.962
makes it creepier--
I don't know what it...

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.532
(laughter)

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.967
I was told this would be
a relatively safe space.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.802
Tom,
you told me at the convention

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:20.173
this was gonna be a safe space.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.308
On-Once you're here,
it's... you're fair game.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.643
-You're in the arena.
-Fair enough.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.812
Speaking of game, uh,
part of me is drawn to Trump

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:29.182
'cause of his tax policy.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.816
Um, I would love to be able
to write off

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.419
my dry cleaning expenses
every year.

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:35.721
Um, I do spend a lot of money
on-on dry cleaning.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:36.923
HARDWICK:
Like how much?

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.925
Like $45,000 to $50,000
every year.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.927
HARDWICK:
Oh, okay, yeah, that's... Why?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.728
I jizz in this thing
all the time is why.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.463
-HARDWICK; Oh, I see, okay.
-It's full of jizz.

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:47.600
Um... (neighs) On the other
hand, though,

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:50.469
I am- I am drawn to Hillary's
maternity leave policy.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.704
HARDWICK:
Okay.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:53.072
Uh, because I'm a bad unicorn,

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:54.974
uh, who needs to be spanked
by his mommy.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:56.776
HARDWICK:
Well, I don't think that's...

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.611
I don't think that's what the
plan is actually set up for.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.179
Well, actually, if you go
through her Web site, the...

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.447
HARDWICK:
Whoa!

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.715
Oh, my God.

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:04.150
-Come on!
-CAMPBELL: Oh!

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.885
-I am so s... -Wow. -You just
knocked over the ashes

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:08.988
-of Lucille Ball. We keep
that urn here... -Oh, no.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.257
-for good luck. This was
the<i> I Love Lucy</i> stage, and...

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.359
-I'm very sorry. -Granted,
it was probably a bad idea

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:16.095
to keep it there next to your
rainbow (bleep), but...

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:17.530
-Come on. -Wow.
-I'm really sorry.

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.198
-Terrible.
-All right, you know what,

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:20.967
thank you for being here.
You did a good job.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.702
Do you want to, uh, come get...
come get an apple?

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.036
-Yes, please, yeah.
-You want some apple?

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.705
-(neighs)
-Here you go.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.174
-Open palm-- I will bite you.
-Oh, okay, all right,

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.977
all right, there you go,
there you go. Good, good.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.312
-Thank you.
-Good, Sweetnipple.

-That's Dr. Dreamhorse
Sweetnipple, everyone. -♪ ♪

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.422
I'm glad we give people a voice
on this show, uh...

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:47.293
For-for a unicorn, that was
actually kind of average-sized.

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.095
You better watch yourself--

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:52.565
Voldemort sucked his (bleep)
to stay alive.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:56.202
He's... he's more of a...
he's more of a duocorn.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.701
He is kind of a duocorn,
you're right.
