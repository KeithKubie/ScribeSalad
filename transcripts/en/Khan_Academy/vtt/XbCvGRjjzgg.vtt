00:00:00.398 --> 00:00:02.116
- [Voiceover] In the last
video, I started introducing

00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:04.903
the intuition for the Laplacian operator

00:00:04.903 --> 00:00:07.132
in the context of the
function with this graph

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:09.384
and with the gradient
field pictured below it.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.009
And here, I'd like to go
through the computation

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.681
involved in that.

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:15.421
So the function that I
had there was defined,

00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:17.163
it's a two-variable function.

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:20.112
And it's defined as f(x,y)

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:21.969
is equal to three

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:26.969
plus cos(x/2)

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.530
multiplied by sin(y/2).

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.459
And then the Laplacian which we define

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:38.664
with this right side up triangle

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:40.475
is an operator of f.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.960
And it's defined to be the divergence,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.702
so kind of this nabla dot

00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:48.904
times the gradient which
is just nabla of f.

00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:50.274
So two different things going on.

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:51.877
It's kind of like a second derivative.

00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:53.246
And the first thing we need to do

00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:54.802
is take the gradient of f.

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:55.708
And the way we do that,

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:56.822
we kind of imagine expanding

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.634
this upside down triangle

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:01.675
as a vector full of partial
differential operators:

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:03.742
partial partial x

00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:08.363
and partial partial y.

00:01:08.363 --> 00:01:09.965
And with a gradient,
you just kind of imagine

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:11.753
multiplying that by the function.

00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:13.053
So if you imagine multiplying that

00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:16.095
by the function, what it looks like

00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.788
is just a vector full
of partial derivatives.

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:20.391
So you're taking the partial of f

00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:24.222
with respect to x and the partial of f

00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:25.220
with respect to y.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.590
Those are the two different components

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.482
of this vector-valued
function that is the gradient.

00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:31.415
And in our specific example,

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:33.134
when we take the partial derivative of f

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:35.154
with respect to x

00:01:35.154 --> 00:01:37.151
what we get, is we look over here.

00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:38.590
Three just looks like a constant,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.728
so nothing happens.

00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:41.377
Cos(x) halves.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:43.165
The derivative of that with respect to x,

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:45.649
we kind of take out that 1/2.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.809
So 1/2, and the derivative of cos is -sin.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:54.736
So that's -sin(x/2).

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:59.668
And sin(y/2), well, y just
looks like a constant.

00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:02.548
So sin(y/2) is just some other constant.

00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:05.636
So in our derivative, we just
keep that constant in there,

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:10.112
that sin(y/2).

00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:12.718
And then, for the second component,

00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:14.367
the partial derivative of f

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:15.574
with respect to y.

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:16.712
Three still looks like a constant

00:02:16.712 --> 00:02:17.989
cause it is a constant.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.264
Now, cos(x/2) looks like a constant

00:02:20.264 --> 00:02:21.844
because as far as y is concerned,

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:22.865
x is a constant.

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:24.746
So cos(x) is a constant.

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:28.833
But then, the sin(y)
has a derivative of cos.

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.435
And we also take out that 1/2.

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:32.757
So you take out that 1/2

00:02:32.757 --> 00:02:34.707
when you take the derivative of the inside

00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:36.774
and then the derivative of the outside

00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:40.071
is cosine of whatever was in there.

00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:43.136
So in this case, y/2.

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:45.296
And we're multiplying it
by that original constant,

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:47.362
cos(x/2).

00:02:47.362 --> 00:02:50.613
So, still we have our cos(x/2)

00:02:50.613 --> 00:02:55.489
since it was a constant times
a certain variable thing, x/2.

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.440
So that's the gradient.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.717
And then, the next step here

00:02:58.717 --> 00:03:01.271
is to take the divergence of that.

00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.687
So with the divergence,
we're going to imagine

00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:05.543
taking that del operator
and dot producting

00:03:05.543 --> 00:03:06.565
with this guy.

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:08.910
So if I scroll down to
give some room here,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.255
we're going to take that,

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:13.067
that vector that's kind
of the same vector,

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:14.205
the partial partial x.

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:16.387
And I say vector, but vector-ish thing,

00:03:16.387 --> 00:03:19.104
partial partial y.

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:19.940
And now we're going to take

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.519
the dot product with this entire guy.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.146
So I'll go ahead and just copy it over.

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:29.803
Just kind of copy it over here.

00:03:29.803 --> 00:03:31.382
And let's see.

00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:35.393
So, I need a little bit
more room to evaluate this.

00:03:35.393 --> 00:03:37.646
So here, when you imagine
taking the dot product,

00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:40.107
you kind of multiply these
top components together.

00:03:40.107 --> 00:03:41.384
So we're taking the partial derivative

00:03:41.384 --> 00:03:44.008
with respect to x of this whole guy.

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.214
And when you do that, well you get,

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:48.373
you still have that 1/2

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:51.624
and then the derivative of -sin(x/2).

00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:53.760
So that 1/2 gets pulled out

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.643
when you're kind of taking

00:03:54.643 --> 00:03:55.850
the derivative of the inside.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.891
And the derivative of -sin is -cos.

00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:02.723
So -cos of that stuff on the inside,

00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:06.113
that x/2.

00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:07.617
And of course, we still
multiply it by this.

00:04:07.617 --> 00:04:09.754
This looks like a constant, the sin(y/2).

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:11.713
And we multiply by that,

00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:15.713
sin(y/2).

00:04:16.953 --> 00:04:18.275
And then we add that

00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:19.483
because it's kind of like a dot product.

00:04:19.483 --> 00:04:20.876
You add that to what it looks like

00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:23.105
when you multiply these
next two components.

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:24.220
So we're going to add.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.961
And you have that 1/2.

00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.978
And then cos(y/2), when
we differentiate that

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.371
you also pull out the 1/2.

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.436
So again, you have that pulled-out 1/2.

00:04:34.436 --> 00:04:37.153
And the derivative of cos is -sin.

00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:40.520
So now we're taking -sin of,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.653
and then that stuff on the inside, y/2.

00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:46.882
And we continue multiplying
by the constant.

00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:50.017
As far as y is concerned,
cos(x/2) is a constant.

00:04:50.017 --> 00:04:55.006
So we multiply it by that, cos(x/2).

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.278
And then that, so that is the divergence

00:04:58.278 --> 00:04:59.671
of that gradient field.

00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:01.343
So the divergence of the gradient

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:05.523
of our original function
gives us the Laplacian.

00:05:05.523 --> 00:05:07.264
And in fact, we could
simplify this further

00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:08.286
because both of these terms

00:05:08.286 --> 00:05:09.516
kind of look identical.

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:10.747
But the main point of this video

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.721
is kind of how you go through that process

00:05:12.721 --> 00:05:14.718
where you imagine taking the gradient

00:05:14.718 --> 00:05:17.063
of your function and then
the divergence of that.

00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:19.547
And that's what the Laplacian is.

00:05:19.547 --> 00:05:20.529
See you next video.
