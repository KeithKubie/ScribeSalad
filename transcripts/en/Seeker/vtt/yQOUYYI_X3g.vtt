00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.940
You know what, there's something about people
watching super violent movies that just changes

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.060
our little brains…

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.060
Guys, my common sense is tingling...

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:15.760
Hey cinephiles, Trace projecting out into
the Internet for DNews.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.750
Movies are getting more violent, sexual, and
profane.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.610
Studies show violence in movies has tripled
since the 1950s, and PG-13 movies contain

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.770
more gun violence than R-rated movies since
2009!

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.040
In fact, all movies have gotten more sexual,
and even G-Rated movies have gotten more violent.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.350
Shoot-em-up movies are fun!

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.329
But can also be bad for us.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.690
So, with R-Rated comic book movies hitting
the theaters: what is all this violence, profanity

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.120
and sex doing to our brains?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.110
As technology has improved and storytelling
has evolved over the last 100 years, many

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.489
movies have become more realistic, but still
depict crazy outlandish situations.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.590
Unfortunately for us, our brains haven’t
evolved that fast.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.530
When your brain sucks in the latest action
film, we react as if it's really happening.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.439
For example, filmmakers often use violence
to get the "good guys" to solve a problem.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.920
This teaches us violence solves problems,
which isn't realistic.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.109
And has implications in everyday life.

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.549
Linfield College found women who watched videos
showing relational violence and aggression

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.999
(like, pretty much all wives of wherever shows)
went on to instigate relational hostility.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:24.709
A 15-year study in Developmental Psychology
found if kids watch violent television or

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.539
movies they display more violence later in
life.

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.759
And this is regardless of sex, social status,
intellectual capabilities, or parenting styles

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.530
and parental aggressiveness.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.509
The caveat is, the kids have to identify with
the characters on screen and believe the violence

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.509
is realistic.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.709
Which studies have shown is happening more
often because of our silly lizard brains.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.139
And this goes the same for everyone!

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:49.890
A study in Prevention Science, found a positive
correlation connecting teens watching R-rated

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.380
films waged in "sensation seeking," behavior.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.649
Sensation seekers are those who crave risky
behaviors -- like alcohol use.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.659
Studies found that teens who wouldn't normally
perform risky-behaviors, like underage alcohol

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.309
consumption, would be more likely to do so
after watching a movie where such risky behaviors

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:08.479
were portrayed!

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.899
DAMN OUR SUSCEPTIBLE BRAINS!

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.450
Unsurprisingly, children who were exposed
to sexually explicit movies and TV would then

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.470
go on to have sex sooner, as well.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.140
In fact, a study by the Children's Hospital
Boston found "for every hour the youngest

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.329
group of children [aged SIX to EIGHT] watched
adult-targeted content… their chances of

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.750
having sex during early adolescence increased
by 33 percent."

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.989
And these behavioral changes have echos inside
the brain.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.250
According to Columbia University, fMRI scans
of people watching violent imagery show activity

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.310
in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex
-- the area involved in reactive aggression,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.870
and the supplementary motor cortex -- the
area involved in planning and imagining behaviors.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.390
Essentially, people would visualize themselves
BEING violent, and the part of their brain

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.349
associated with violent reactions was ALSO
active.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.780
And another study found as teens watched more
violent content, their connection between

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.319
violent behavior and emotion weakened.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.219
All this might explain why people who watch
violence can go on to be more violent in their

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.439
own lives.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.980
It seems to me, when we see a lot of violent
media, we begin to disconnect the emotional

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.860
reaction to risky sexual activity, alcohol
abuse or violence with ACTUALLY doing these

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.860
things.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.609
Making us more likely to try them.

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.989
But we can fight it, and it helps to start
with kids.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.780
One of the researchers recommended we simply
pay attention to movie ratings.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.290
Children are more impressionable than adults
they should quote "should not be permitted

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.810
to see R-rated movies."

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.310
Also, if the violent person is a role-model,
their actions carry even more weight.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.730
To fight that, says another lead researcher,
we should simply point out movies are works

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.730
of fiction.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.400
Funnily enough, having a conversation about
it really can help.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.389
There's a lot more going on with this than
you think!

00:03:53.389 --> 00:04:04.379
Julia looks in how the brain reacts to your
favorite movies in 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:13.329
this video…

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.510
What IS your favorite movie?

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.620
Is it action packed?

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.620
Let's make a list.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.580
I'm going on vacation soon and need something
to do.
