Congratulations, we're at the end of lesson four.

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:08.098
[SOUND] Wow. That was a lot of stuff

00:00:08.098 --> 00:00:10.840
we covered. Well, lesson four is also the

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.000
most content-heavy lesson in this course, so we're

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.662
really happy to see you here. We covered

00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:19.734
data relationships, specifically the ancestor and that has

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:23.290
a relationship. We also looked at queries, query

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.390
by kind and then filtered by ancestor and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.350
then filtered by different properties. Datastore indexes,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.930
we took an in depth tour of datastore

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.130
indexes, it allows you to do queries in datastore and we've wrapped it up with

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.570
different consistency modelsa and transactions in datastore.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.570
In the next lesson, we will look at

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.790
heavy duty stuff. You want to know what heavy duty is? Well, be here to join us.
