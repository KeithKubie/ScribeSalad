the water from the liquid you remove it
 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.990
the water from the liquid you remove it
from the solid and it has great

advantage but if you look carefully the

we worked with his pet virus the

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279
we worked with his pet virus the
 

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:39.819
we worked with his pet virus the
adenovirus and when he got this nice

00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:39.829
adenovirus and when he got this nice
 

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:41.650
