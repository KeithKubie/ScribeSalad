00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:01.513
- [Voiceover] Stacy wants to find

00:00:01.513 --> 00:00:05.415
the derivative of f of x
equals x squared plus one

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:07.813
at the point x equals two.

00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:10.794
Her table below shows the
average rate of change

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:14.339
of f over the intervals from x to two

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.998
or from two to x, and
these are closed intervals,

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:21.440
for x-values that get
increasingly closer to two.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.979
so they get-- so we're talking about

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:24.761
the average rate of change of f

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.881
over these closed intervals

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.857
for x-values that get
increasingly closer to two.

00:00:30.857 --> 00:00:31.980
It looks like we're going to be dealing

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.786
with some type of a limit,

00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:35.608
or we're trying to calculate
some type of a limit,

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:37.760
or approximate some type of a limit.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.520
Let's read this data here.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.976
These are the x values
and she's trying to find

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.786
the average rate of change between each

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:47.248
of these x-values and two,

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:49.638
or the average rate of
change of the function

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:51.317
between when x is--

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.584
one of these x values and two,

00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:56.532
and then she has the
average rate of change

00:00:56.532 --> 00:00:57.780
that she precalculated,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.014
so we don't have to get a calculator out

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:00.097
or anything like that,

00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:03.170
and just as a reminder, how
did she calculate this 3.9?

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.038
Well, they tell us.

00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:06.230
She took f of 1.9,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.190
what does the function
equal when x is 1.9?

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.017
From that, she subtracted

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:13.936
what is the value of the
function when f is equal to two,

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:16.851
so that's really our change in f,

00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:18.601
and she divided it by

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.205
the x, which is 1.9,

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:23.701
minus two,

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:27.383
so change in f over change in x.

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:30.397
What is the average rate of change

00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:33.355
of our function over that interval?

00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:36.483
She did it between 1.9
and two, she got 3.9.

00:01:36.483 --> 00:01:38.475
Then she gets closer to two,

00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:41.697
so now she's doing it between 1.99 and two

00:01:41.697 --> 00:01:43.581
and it becomes 3.99,

00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.415
it looks like it's getting closer to four.

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:47.740
She gets even closer to two

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.835
and the average rate of change
gets even closer to four,

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:54.415
and then she goes on
the other side of two,

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:56.498
you could view it as this is approaching,

00:01:56.498 --> 00:02:00.897
this is-- this is approaching--
this is x approaching two

00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:02.897
from the left hand side,

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.221
and this is x approaching
two from the right hand side.

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.549
When it's 2.1, the average
rate of change is 4.1.

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.029
When it's 2.01, once again,

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.762
we're getting closer to two,

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:15.344
we're getting closer to two,

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.686
the average rate of change
is getting closer to four.

00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:19.044
The closer we get to two,

00:02:19.044 --> 00:02:21.723
the closer the average rate
of change gets to four.

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:24.373
What this data is really
helping us approximate

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:25.670
it's really saying, okay,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.112
the average rate of
change we know is f of x

00:02:29.112 --> 00:02:31.102
minus f of two,

00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:32.769
over x minus two,

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:35.229
but what we're really thinking about is,

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:39.189
well what is the limit as x approaches two

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.384
right over here?

00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:42.754
That's what this data
is helping us to get at,

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:46.806
and it looks like this
limit is equal to four.

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:47.952
They give us it in here, it says,

00:02:47.952 --> 00:02:50.119
"Look, the closer that x gets to two

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.600
"from either the left hand
side or the right hand side,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.706
"the closer that this
expression right over here,

00:02:55.706 --> 00:02:58.932
"which is this number, gets to four."

00:02:58.932 --> 00:03:00.604
You might recognize,

00:03:00.604 --> 00:03:04.396
this is one of the
definitions of a derivative.

00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:07.144
This is one of the
definitions of a derivative.

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:10.776
This right over here
would be f prime of two,

00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:12.341
the derivative at x equals two

00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:14.510
is equal to the limit as x approaches two

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.409
of all of this business.

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.633
There's other ways to express
a derivative as a limit

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.125
but this is one of them.

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:21.716
There you go, from the table,

00:03:21.716 --> 00:03:22.683
what does the derivative

00:03:22.683 --> 00:03:24.817
of f of x equals x squared plus one

00:03:24.817 --> 00:03:26.588
at x equals two appear to be?

00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:28.346
Well, the derivative at x equals two

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:29.736
appears to be

00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:31.383
equal to four,

00:03:31.383 --> 00:03:32.633
and we're done.
