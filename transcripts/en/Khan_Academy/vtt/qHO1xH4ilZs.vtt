00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.120
We're now on problem
number 28.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.743
And the question is,
is x an integer?

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.500
Statement one tells us that
x over 2 is an integer.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.060
So if you think about it, x has
to be an integer, because

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.850
x is divisible by 2.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.470
This tells us that x is
divisible by 2, because when I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.250
divide by 2 it's not
5.5 or something.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.930
I get an even-- I
get an integer.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.910
So x has to be an integer.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.360
And if you want to use an
example, well if x is

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.940
divisible by 2, then x could be
6, which is clearly-- well

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.380
anyway, that's almost
too obvious.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.990
I don't think I have to
explain this too much.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.410
But this alone is enough to
know that x is an integer,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.480
because it's actually
divisible by 2.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.910
Statement number two tells
us that 2x is an integer.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.530
This doesn't give me a
lot of information.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.960
Because if x is equal to 1/2,
then 2x is equal to 1.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.760
So that 2x is an integer,
but x is not an integer.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.320
But if x is equal to one,
then 2x is equal to 2.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.660
And so 2x being an integer,
doesn't necessarily tell me

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.630
whether or not x
is an integer.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.540
So this is useless, and
this is useful.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.590
So the answer is one,
that only statement

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440
number one is necessary.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.570
A.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.550
Problem 29.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.000
I should write smaller so
I could save space.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.190
What is the value of x?

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.490
Simple enough.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.560
The first one says, 2x
plus 1 is equal to 0.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.820
Like I said before, you could
just look at this and say,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.050
this is eighth grade algebra.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.480
I can solve for x.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.250
This is all I need.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.990
And you could solve for
it if you want.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.940
You could say 2x is equal
to minus 1, x is

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.070
equal to minus 1/2.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.600
But that would be a waste of
time, because they're not

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.030
asking you what x actually
equals, they're just ask you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.270
whether you could
solve for it.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.330
Two says, this is interesting.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.990
x plus 1 squared is equal
to x squared.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.110
Now you might be tempted to just
take the square root of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.730
both sides.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.910
But that actually becomes
complicated, because you could

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.700
have the positive or negative
square roots.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.760
You'd have to set up a bunch
of different equations.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.090
The easiest thing to
do actually would

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.870
be to expand this.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.700
So what's x plus 1 squared?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.870
What's x plus 1 times
x plus 1?

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:41.030
So that's x squared plus 2x plus
1 is equal to x squared.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.870
And if you subtract x squared
from both sides of this

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.130
equation, you get 2x plus
1 is equal to 0.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.150
So you actually end up
getting this again.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.990
So both of these pieces of
information are equivalent.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.620
And each of them independently
is enough to solve for x.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.080
So the answer is D.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.200
Each statement alone
is sufficient.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.900
Problem number 30.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.600
What is the value of 1
over k plus 1 over r?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.250
And what information
do they give us?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.481
So they tell us that k plus
r is equal to 20.

00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.925
It's not obvious to me how to
figure out from this, what 1

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.480
over k plus 1 over r is.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.680
And just to experiment, if
we were to find a common

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.540
denominator and add these
together, what is another way

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.260
of writing this expression?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.720
Well the common denominator
would be kr.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.090
And 1 over k is the same thing
as r over kr, right?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.175
You can cancel out the r's and
get 1 over k plus-- and 1 over

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:55.750
r is the same thing
as k over kr.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.010
So this statement is equivalent
to this statement.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.010
So we're trying to figure
out what r plus k

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.330
over k times r is.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.150
Statement one just
gives us the top.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.350
So that by itself
isn't enough.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.110
What does statement
two give us?

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.840
kr is equal to 64.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.610
So statement two gives us
this information, right?

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.339
Statement one gives us this
information, up here.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.690
So we actually need both of them
to figure out what this

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.690
is equal to.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.080
So the answer is C.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.170
Both statements together are
sufficient, but individually

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.420
they're not that useful.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.250
Problem 31.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:47.210
If x is equal to one of the
numbers, 1/4, 3/8, or 2/5,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.040
what is the value of x?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.420
So x is one of these, and
we have to figure out

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.150
which of they are.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.380
So statement one tells us that
1/4 is less than x, which is

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.120
less than 1/2.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.120
So if x is greater than 1/4,
statement one immediately

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.370
tells us that x is not 1/4.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.680
Let's see.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.770
And x has to be less than 1/2.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.750
Well both of these numbers
are less than 1/2, right?

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.510
Statement one.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.790
Let me do this in a color.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.790
Statement one tells us that
our answer is one of these

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.640
two, right?

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.250
That's what statement
one tells us.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.720
Because both of those-- that's
0.4, that's less than 1/2.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.230
3/8 is what?

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.780
Actually, no.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.560
This is interesting.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.480
3/8 is actually greater-- no,
3/8 is obviously less than

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.910
1/2, right?

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.280
What am I thinking.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.910
4/8 is exactly 1/2.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.800
So 3/8 is also less than 1/2.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.740
So statement one tells us it's
one of those two choices.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.690
And statement two says that 1/3
is less than x which is

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.070
less than 3/5.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.756
So this tells us that x has
to be greater than 1/3.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.830
Let's see.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.150
3/8 is greater than
1/3, right?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.900
Because 3/9 is 1/3.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.490
So 3/8 is greater than 1/3.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.000
2/5 is also greater
than 1/3, right?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.340
It's 0.4.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.370
So that's greater than 1/3.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.510
Let's see.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.310
Is 3/8 less than 3/5?

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.630
Well, sure, right?

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.640
3/8 is definitely
less than 3/5.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.580
And 2/5 is definitely
less than 3/5.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.970
So it seems that statements
two and one are actually

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.130
giving you the same
information.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.030
And when you get both of them,
they actually don't clarify.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.680
They don't give you
any clarity,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.740
whether x is 3/8 or 2/5.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.480
So they just leave
you hanging.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.350
And so the answer is E.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.430
Together they're still
not sufficient.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.370
Unless I missed something.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.690
Once again, remember, I'm just
doing this in real time.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.920
I don't know if-- it's very
possible that I make an error.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.210
Problem 32.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.530
Triangle PQR.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.880
Let me draw that.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.740
If PQ is equal to x, so this
distance is equal to x.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.920
And QR is equal to x plus 2.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:37.240
And PR is equal to y, which of
the three angles of triangle

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.100
PQR has the greatest
degree measure?

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.370
So they want to know which
of these angles --

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.290
so angle 1, 2, 3.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.600
You need to be able to figure
out which of these angles has

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.090
the greatest degree measure.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.450
And it might be intuition
to you.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.010
But in order to figure out which
angle has the greatest

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.690
degree measure, you essentially
have to figure out

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:06.020
which angle is opposite
the largest side.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.720
That's one way to
think about it.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.890
And that should get you which is
the largest degree measure.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.540
So if we could figure out
whether x, x plus 2, or y is

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.140
larger, then we'd be all set.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.190
So first of all, we know that
x plus 2 is greater than x.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.270
So our answer, as far as the
longest side, is either going

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.380
to be y or x plus 2.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.030
And the shortest side is either
going to be y or x.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.059
But anyway.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.929
What do they say?

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:39.440
They say 1y is equal
to x plus 3.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.909
So if y is equal to x plus 3,
this is the largest side of

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.310
the triangle, right?

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.140
This is the largest side
of the triangle.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:54.860
This is the second largest. And
then this will be-- if I'm

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.680
thinking about this
right, this will

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.870
be the largest angle.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.230
Let me think about that.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.140
I mean, you could go back
to a little bit of our

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.650
trigonometry, but this would
be the largest angle.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.270
And let's see.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.990
So I think one alone
is enough.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.750
It tells us this is
the longest side.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.910
The triangle would look
something like this.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.770
This is the longest side.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.890
This is the second
longest side.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.410
And then this would be
the shortest side.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.280
It would look something
like that.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.340
And then angle three would
be the largest angle.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.580
Let's see.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.160
Statement number two tells
us that x is equal to 2.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.000
x is equal to 2 gives us
no information about y.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
If we say that x is equal to 2,
then we know that x plus 2

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.090
is equal to 4.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.840
And we have no information
about y.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.930
So that really still
doesn't help us.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.470
Because it could easily be
a triangle like this.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.820
2, and then the 4 could
come back this

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.220
way and be like that.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.440
In which case this would
be the largest angle.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.080
Or y could be a really
big distance.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.790
So that 4 could be like
that, if y was a

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.840
really large number.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.220
Let's see.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.520
If you have the combination of
the two, well-- we know that

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.460
one alone is sufficient.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.530
Two alone is not sufficient.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.400
And I'm just doing-- let me
think about it a little bit.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.560
Let me make sure that I'm
right, that one alone is

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.300
sufficient.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:18.980
Yeah I'm pretty sure.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.760
I mean, I can't think of an
example where I have to know

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.030
that x is equal to 2.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.280
Yeah.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.260
So unless I'm wrong,
the answer is a.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.950
Statement one alone
is sufficient.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.000
I'll see you in the
next video.
