00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.259
that's a really interesting question and

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:06.269
that's a really interesting question and
 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.009
that's a really interesting question and
sadly the answer isn't simple the simple

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019
sadly the answer isn't simple the simple
 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.049
sadly the answer isn't simple the simple
answer is no but now I've got to explain

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059
answer is no but now I've got to explain
 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.590
answer is no but now I've got to explain
why I'm saying that the answer is no the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600
why I'm saying that the answer is no the
 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.970
why I'm saying that the answer is no the
answer is that every process for cooling

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
answer is that every process for cooling
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.150
answer is that every process for cooling
either also introduces the possibility

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160
either also introduces the possibility
 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.960
either also introduces the possibility
that you can introduce some extra energy

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970
that you can introduce some extra energy
 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.760
that you can introduce some extra energy
into the system you see cooling means

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770
into the system you see cooling means
 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.249
into the system you see cooling means
taking energy out and heating means

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259
taking energy out and heating means
 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.200
taking energy out and heating means
putting energy in but in order to take

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210
putting energy in but in order to take
 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.110
putting energy in but in order to take
energy out then it turns out that you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120
energy out then it turns out that you
 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.540
energy out then it turns out that you
open the door for energy to go in take

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550
open the door for energy to go in take
 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.729
open the door for energy to go in take
laser cooling laser cooling takes the

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739
laser cooling laser cooling takes the
 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.680
laser cooling laser cooling takes the
energy out by having an atom coming

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690
energy out by having an atom coming
 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.810
energy out by having an atom coming
along and then a photon hits the atom

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820
along and then a photon hits the atom
 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.259
along and then a photon hits the atom
and slows the atom down then that photon

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269
and slows the atom down then that photon
 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.509
and slows the atom down then that photon
has to go someplace and when that photon

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519
has to go someplace and when that photon
 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.540
has to go someplace and when that photon
is shot out by the atom the atom recoils

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550
is shot out by the atom the atom recoils
 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.059
is shot out by the atom the atom recoils
and more energy goes in so there's a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.069
and more energy goes in so there's a
 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.009
and more energy goes in so there's a
balance between the cooling the heating

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019
balance between the cooling the heating
 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.099
balance between the cooling the heating
and you can try to make that balance

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109
and you can try to make that balance
 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.110
and you can try to make that balance
work more and more in your favor but you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120
work more and more in your favor but you
 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.580
work more and more in your favor but you
can never make it work a hundred percent

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590
can never make it work a hundred percent
 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.830
can never make it work a hundred percent
cooling and no heating so that's one of

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840
cooling and no heating so that's one of
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.840
cooling and no heating so that's one of
the reasons why you don't expect to ever

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850
the reasons why you don't expect to ever
 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.810
the reasons why you don't expect to ever
get to absolute zero on the other hand

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820
get to absolute zero on the other hand
 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.969
get to absolute zero on the other hand
what does it mean to be at Absolute Zero

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979
what does it mean to be at Absolute Zero
 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.010
what does it mean to be at Absolute Zero
it means that all the thermal motion

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020
it means that all the thermal motion
 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.410
it means that all the thermal motion
stops well I can take one atom and I can

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420
stops well I can take one atom and I can
 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.080
stops well I can take one atom and I can
take as much energy out of it as

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090
take as much energy out of it as
 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.950
take as much energy out of it as
possible so that it's in what we would

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960
possible so that it's in what we would
 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.569
possible so that it's in what we would
call the ground state the lowest

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579
call the ground state the lowest
 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.060
call the ground state the lowest
possible state of energy is it absolute

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070
possible state of energy is it absolute
 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.420
possible state of energy is it absolute
zero not really because in order to be

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430
zero not really because in order to be
 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.859
zero not really because in order to be
at Absolute Zero I really have to have a

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869
at Absolute Zero I really have to have a
 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.179
at Absolute Zero I really have to have a
whole bundle of things I can't really

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189
whole bundle of things I can't really
 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.219
whole bundle of things I can't really
talk easily about the temperature of a

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229
talk easily about the temperature of a
 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.550
talk easily about the temperature of a
single object I should really talk about

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
single object I should really talk about
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.830
single object I should really talk about
whole ensemble and if I do that with a

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840
whole ensemble and if I do that with a
 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.990
whole ensemble and if I do that with a
whole bunch of atoms what's going to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000
whole bunch of atoms what's going to
 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.940
whole bunch of atoms what's going to
happen is maybe if I'm lucky maybe

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
happen is maybe if I'm lucky maybe
 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.560
happen is maybe if I'm lucky maybe
ninety nine percent of them are going to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
ninety nine percent of them are going to
 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.880
ninety nine percent of them are going to
be in the ground state and then one

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890
be in the ground state and then one
 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.190
be in the ground state and then one
percent isn't so it's not absolute zero

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
percent isn't so it's not absolute zero
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.919
percent isn't so it's not absolute zero
I can't come up with any procedure that

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929
I can't come up with any procedure that
 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.270
I can't come up with any procedure that
is going to say a hundred percent of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280
is going to say a hundred percent of
 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.940
is going to say a hundred percent of
time this atom is going to end up in the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
time this atom is going to end up in the
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.020
time this atom is going to end up in the
ground state and that's what I would

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030
ground state and that's what I would
 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.870
ground state and that's what I would
need to be able to claim that I'd really

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880
need to be able to claim that I'd really
 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.060
need to be able to claim that I'd really
gotten to absolute zero but on the other

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070
gotten to absolute zero but on the other
 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.940
gotten to absolute zero but on the other
hand I can get so close to absolute zero

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950
hand I can get so close to absolute zero
 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.030
hand I can get so close to absolute zero
that for many experiments it's basically

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040
that for many experiments it's basically
 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.930
that for many experiments it's basically
absolute

zero for all practical purposes but not

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460
zero for all practical purposes but not
 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.490
zero for all practical purposes but not
for all experiments and we're constantly

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500
for all experiments and we're constantly
 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.200
for all experiments and we're constantly
working on trying to make things colder

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210
working on trying to make things colder
 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.600
working on trying to make things colder
because for some experiments it really

matters that we're not quite there
