00:00:03.057 --> 00:00:05.495
Hot dog stuffed pizza crust

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:09.535
and a portable GameCube
encased in Tupperware.

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:12.994
Vsauce, Kevin here.
this is Mind Blow.

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:17.058
Carkoon is a car seat
that wraps the child

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.796
in a protective shell—
the airbag is made of Kevlar

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:23.977
and fireproof material,
providing 20 minutes

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:25.977
of protection
from a blaze.

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:28.412
There's also a transmitter
and GPS

00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:30.571
that sends signals
to a monitoring station

00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:32.823
to alert emergency services.

00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:35.650
To aid in communication
for deaf/blind people,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.650
there's the Mobile Lorm Glove

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.828
The Design Research Lab in Berlin
is developing this device

00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:44.009
to translate Lorm,
a common form of communication

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.632
used by people with hearing
and vision impairment

00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:48.632
into digital text.

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:51.323
The pressure-sensitive glove
allows message input,

00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:54.866
and you can also text to the glove,
which the user receives

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.420
through a vibro-tactile feedback pattern.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.366
Robotic rings are less life altering
and more or less just for fun.

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.732
A microcontroller and computer
move the eyes and mouth,

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.868
and they're looking
to further develop the rings

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:11.184
so they actually react
to the motion of the wearer.

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:15.944
Reacting to the behavior of inmates
is the mood-sensing Robot Prison Guard.

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:18.707
Developed in South Korea,
it has 3D cameras

00:01:18.707 --> 00:01:22.817
and software designed to analyze
abnormal prison activity.

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:25.115
It relays the information
to a control room,

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:27.832
and also allows the human guard
to communicate

00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:29.832
through the robot.

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:31.832
Let's take a break from robots
and lose some weight.

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:35.210
The K-E diet promises
20 pounds of weight loss

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.343
in just ten days
simply by eating through your nose.

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:42.384
A feeding tube is put
up the nose and into the stomach,

00:01:42.384 --> 00:01:47.121
pumping 800 calories worth
of protein, fat, and water on a slow drip.

00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:49.675
It induces ketosis,
which tricks the body

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:53.971
into burning fat, and it costs
$1,500 dollars a day.

00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.035
If you prefer eating
elevator wall cookies,

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.035
just ride the lickable lift.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:02.794
A London-based company installed
this Willy Wonka-inspired elevator

00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:06.416
that uses 1,325 cookies.

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:10.224
Oh, and once a cookie is licked,
it's removed by the bellboy.

00:02:10.224 --> 00:02:12.224
So, yeah.

00:02:12.224 --> 00:02:15.789
Breaking their own world record,
the Purdue Society of Professional Engineers team

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.411
created a 300-step Rube Goldberg machine.

00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:22.476
The simple task of blowing up
and popping a balloon

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.652
took the team 5,000 hours
to construct,

00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:29.831
and includes peeling an apple,
making a hamburger,

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:32.850
and changing a lightbulb.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.957
Back to robots,
DARPA and Boston Dynamics

00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:39.881
would like you to meet Pet Man,
a walking, crouching,

00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.597
push-up performing robot,

00:02:42.597 --> 00:02:46.939
and they also have a biped
that successfully goes up stairs.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.770
Don't worry, there are
also octopus robots in development.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.789
Funded by the European Commission,
the Octopus Project

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.295
features shape memory alloy tentacles
in the front

00:02:57.295 --> 00:02:59.686
and silicone arms in the back.

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:03.770
Finally, here's a huge Star Wars-themed
Lego barrel organ

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.813
playing the main theme
from Star Wars.
