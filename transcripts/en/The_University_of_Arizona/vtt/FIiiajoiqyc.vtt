00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.640
 I'm very excited about this
year, 2018, my second year

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.140
at the University of Arizona.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.380
We've been moving
people in all morning.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.350
We've had a lot of our senior
leadership team and my cabinet

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.290
out, helping move in today.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.660
Dana, thank you again
for inviting me back.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.860
How many people were involved
in helping the students move in?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.090
 We have hundreds of students
and faculty and staff helping

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.700
move in.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.570
We're moving in almost
68,000 students this week.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.910
It's a community effort.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.000
ROBERT: This is one of the
most academically accomplished

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.750
and gifted classes we've had in
many, many years, maybe ever.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.640
We have 110 countries
represented, all 50 states.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.270
31% of our students are
first generation students,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.740
probably the highest number for
any of the 60 AAU universities

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.116
that we partner with.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:54.948
 Hi.

00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:55.780
 Hello.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.410
I'm Bobby.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.910
 Hi.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.082
I'm Kathryn.

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:58.790
Nice to meet you.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.190
 It's good to meet you.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.100
I just wanted to
come by and say thank

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.419
you for choosing the U of A.
And what are you studying?

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:06.960
 I'm a pre-business
marketing major.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.281
 Well, your mom
said, going to Eller.

00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:09.780
 Yeah.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.735
 Eller is fantastic.

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:12.330
 I'm really excited.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.000
Yes.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.520
 Student success is the key
part of the strategic plan.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.730
And I'm just excited
about the class that's

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.820
come here this year from all
parts of the country and all

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.670
over the world to choose
the University of Arizona.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730
I think they made
a great choice.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.520
You have to learn how to
do the Wild Cat thing.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.440
You know, so, the way I--

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.220
so, OK but open it
up and it's a C. W C.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.040
 So that's a W and that's a C.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.470
 Yeah.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.090
Bear down and go Cats.
