MÁTÉ BEZDEK: My dissertation is
on fundamental investigations

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.630
that looks at interconverting
ammonia with its elements,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.530
nitrogen and hydrogen.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.158
PAUL CHIRIK: It
was clear that when

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:16.950
he applied to Princeton
in graduate school,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.790
he was somebody special.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.420
So he came to us from
the University of Calgary

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.800
really highly recommended.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.870
You could tell just
from his application,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.600
he was a deep thinker
and a real scholar.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.420
MÁTÉ BEZDEK: Anybody who goes
into science is a curious

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.830
person, and I think is driven
by this desire to find out more

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.540
about the natural world.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.840
So that was science broadly,
but I think chemistry,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.000
specifically, because
to me, chemistry

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.590
was this really nice balance
between a theoretical subject,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.770
one that is
intellectually satisfying,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.710
but at the same time,
it has a pretty large

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.970
practical component.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.870
The idea would be to take
ammonia, which is NH3,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.440
and take it to its elements,
nitrogen and hydrogen.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.210
And the reason you
really want to do this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.420
is because of the hydrogen
you can generate this way.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.930
And hydrogen is is the
ultimate clean-burning fuel,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.750
and so, what we
were able to show

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.550
is that we were able to make a
so-called non-classical ammonia

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.680
complex with molybdenum.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.420
And so the unique
thing that happens here

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.530
is that when you add ammonia
to this molybdenum complex,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.940
instead of just
sticking, we were

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.570
able to demonstrate that
the NH bond in ammonia

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.130
is no longer strong.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.140
It becomes extremely weak.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.530
That then enables a hydrogen
evolution to take place.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.470
Perhaps, there is nothing
more fundamental in chemistry

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.220
than the concept
of a chemical bond.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.550
And to me, if the fact
that we were still able

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.980
to make a contribution
to this concept in 2016,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.760
when we first did
this research, is

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.040
what made it so
exciting and so unique.
