Slime is some cool stuff
with a weird texture,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.900
and today, we're going
to see what happens

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.900
if we try and take all
of the water out of it,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.900
and then we'll see
what happens if we try

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.320
and put the water back in.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.232
[Music]

00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:19.700
Slime has been entertaining
children for years and years

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.400
under several different names,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.700
and it's a really cool weird substance.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.000
And it's something that
you can also make at home,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.100
which is pretty fun.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.400
But we're curious
what would happen

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.400
if you took all of the liquid
out of this slime.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.000
What would be left?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.200
What would the texture
be like then?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.000
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.900
We've got some
store-bought slime, and

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.400
we'll make some homemade slime.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.200
We're going to try
and dehydrate both,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.000
and then see if they
can be turned into a powder.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.660
and rehydrate it.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.440
[Music]

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:53.780
One cup of water,
1/2 teaspoon of borax...

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.840
[Music]

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.900
Half a cup of water,
and 5 ounces of clear glue.

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:08.492
Add a few drops of color.

00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:16.480
[Music]

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.940
Now, I am going to mix
everything inside our pitcher

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.812
'cause it's gonna hold
everything really nicely.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:36.640
[Music]

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.640
That's a great color of slime.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.240
[Music]

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.300
So now, we have
these two metal trays,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.400
and this is where we're going
to have our slime sit in

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.500
as it dehydrates.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.520
So, try and get
the purple one out.

00:01:54.762 --> 00:01:57.242
Slime!

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.100
That's truly delightful.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.900
Look at that.

00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:03.400
I wonder if it's going
to stick a lot to the tray.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.000
It is largely made
of glue after all.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's kind of cool.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.500
This stuff like
seems really thick

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.700
and gelatinous and all that.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.300
But if you leave slime out,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.900
if you make homemade slime,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.980
and then you just leave it
for like two days,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.600
all of those bubbles
will actually just

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.100
rise right up out of it.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.700
It takes a long time,
but you end up with just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.300
like perfectly clear slime,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.100
until you play with it again,
then you get a lot more bubbles

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.652
in it all of a sudden.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.500
Now, the green.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.220
Splat.

00:02:31.332 --> 00:02:33.500
We certainly have
different textures

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.300
in our two slimes here.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.500
This green stuff really likes
to gather up a lot more.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.900
The purple did an okay job
of spreading out.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.300
I don't necessarily need
it to be all stretched out,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.900
but I suspect it
will dehydrate better

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.620
if it is.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.440
More surface area, more liquid
can escape more easily.

00:02:52.462 --> 00:02:54.352
Those are fantastic colors.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.500
Now, these are going
to take a while.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.160
I'm probably going to end up
dehydrating them for several days,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.700
and during that time,
I'll probably also

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.600
take them out.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.000
Maybe flip them over
if one side seems

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.700
to be completely dry,
and the other one doesn't.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.100
I'll probably switch them back
and forth a little bit,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.800
but I'll just try
and do whatever it takes

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.600
to make sure they get a lot
of even heat and air to really

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.472
dry out completely.

00:03:18.472 --> 00:03:24.600
[Music]

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.000
It's been a few days,
and both of our types

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.800
of slime have completely
dehydrated inside our dehydrator.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.112
They took rather
different amounts of time.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:35.100
Our Green store-bought slime
completely dried out

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.200
till it was just plasticky
and brittle in--

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.120
I think it was
less than 24 hours.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.800
Our homemade slime,
our purple stuff,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.100
this took about twice as long,
and I had to flip it over.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.000
This piece actually just kind
of came unstuck from the metal,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.700
but it was still softer
on one side.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.600
So I'd like flip it over
and let it dry out more.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.100
But at this point,
I think both

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.480
of them are completely dry.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.400
You can see that's very brittle.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.300
Over here, we've just
got flakes of it,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.500
and now, we're going to see
if we can turn these

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.200
into a powder,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.800
and if we can turn them
into powder,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.700
can we add water back
into them and turn them

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.500
back into liquid slime?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.500
So let's take
our two different

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.700
dried out slimes,
which have remarkably

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.500
different textures,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.982
and see what we can do
to powderize them.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.900
I have a couple
of different blenders here.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.000
I've got like a little
Magic Bullet, and then

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.900
I've got a big old Blendtec
because this stuff is

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.260
really tough.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.940
But the green stuff is
very thin and brittle,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.100
and so I'm pretty sure I
can just crush this down,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.200
and put it in our little
Magic Bullet size blender,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.800
and that'll just
turn it into dust.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.400
So let's start off
with that one.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.500
Let's see how well it works.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.300
Let's see if I'm right about how
easily it comes apart,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.200
and hopefully,
it comes off of the metal nice

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.072
and easily as well.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.840
[Music]

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.300
Definitely does stick
to our foil tray a fair amount,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.940
some places.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.780
It's kind of hard to get
off of the metal.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.580
[Music]

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.300
So if I were to try this again,
I'd probably try

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.272
and find like a Teflon
coated pan or something.

00:05:06.612 --> 00:05:08.932
See if it slides off of that more easily.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.680
[Music]

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.900
All right, we've still got
a little bit stuck to our tray,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.400
but I think we've done
a fairly good job

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400
of getting most of it off.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.060
I'd say we've got at least 75%.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:38.000
[Music]

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.700
All right. Our blender,
I think has done a pretty

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.800
good job of chopping that up,
but I want to go even finer

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.532
if I can.

00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:46.500
I'm gonna throw this
in our mortar and pestle.

00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:51.400
Neon green powder, in
ground up old-fashioned style.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:01.880
[Music]

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.100
It's a pretty
good powder right there.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.960
Alright.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.280
Got our green ground up.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.840
Let's move on to our purple.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.780
[Music]

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.100
I think our blender could probably
handle these at full-size,

00:06:17.122 --> 00:06:17.622
but...

00:06:18.542 --> 00:06:20.200
Just going to start
by chopping it all down

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.240
a little bit smaller.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:49.400
[Music]

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.720
It doesn't even land.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.720
[Music]

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.220
Just like hovering above it.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.780
[Music]

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.380
Probably fine.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.460
[Music]

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.900
The lid has some vent holes,
and it definitely had some powder

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.832
escaping through that.

00:07:11.652 --> 00:07:13.800
Okay, that definitely
took it down quite a bit

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.900
but there's still some fairly
large chunks in there.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.842
This is like the consistency
of about maybe not flour,

00:07:19.842 --> 00:07:20.300
but close.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.100
This is like the consistency
of raw sugar.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.300
So I'm going to clean this out,
and try blending it even finer

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.000
in this blender.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.100
See if this is tough enough
to break that up anymore.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.380
Might've done a little.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.400
Definitely don't think
it's as fine of a powder.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.400
We'll try putting in
the mortar and pestle,

00:07:35.412 --> 00:07:37.342
and seeing if that makes
it any smaller.

00:07:37.342 --> 00:07:39.500
I think this mixture is
just sort of like

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.700
a flexible enough compound that
it doesn't crush very well.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.012
Whereas the other stuff dried
into such a rigid plastic.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.300
It is able to turn into dust.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.780
This is more like sand.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.200
Alright.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.300
Let's start out
with our purple stuff.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.700
We're going to try
just taking a spoonful

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.100
of our purple sand here,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.800
and we're going to add
little bits of water

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.300
and stir it,
and see if it

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.060
sort of dissolves back in.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.700
It also may take a little while
for these larger pieces

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.600
to really absorb all
the water they've lost,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.700
or maybe it'll never work.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.900
I haven't tried this before,
but let's find out.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.800
[Music]

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.132
We're definitely making a pulp.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.100
Certainly wouldn't
call it slime.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.000
I also don't think
this is enough water.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.692
I'm not sure what
it's going to do,

00:08:22.272 --> 00:08:24.700
but given the ratio
of what this was

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.600
before it started,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.700
and what it is now,
I think this is going

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.700
to be too little water
for it to properly

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.672
absorb everything.

00:08:31.672 --> 00:08:35.760
[Music]

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.700
This is forming into sort of like
a gelatinous sand texture instead

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.360
of a regular sand texture.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.800
Kinda want just let
that one sit,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.200
and then I'll get another cup
for the green powder.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.620
[Music]

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.200
Green powder.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.200
Static electricity that makes
it stick to the walls

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.340
in some spots.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:09:07.380
[Music]

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.000
Let's add a little bit more water.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.922
See how that goes.

00:09:10.042 --> 00:09:22.180
[Music]

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.592
Pretty similar result.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.322
We're getting sort
of a gelatinous sand,

00:09:26.322 --> 00:09:28.300
but I wouldn't say
that it's turned

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.302
back into slime.

00:09:31.272 --> 00:09:34.000
Well it seems to have used up quite
a bit of its water though.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.192
So let's give it some more.

00:09:35.192 --> 00:09:44.480
[Music]

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.400
We're definitely
getting some results

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.000
It does seem to be
absorbing the water,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.682
at least somewhat.

00:09:50.272 --> 00:09:52.800
But it took a long time
to dehydrate,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.200
so I wonder if it will take
a long time to rehydrate.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.300
So what we're going to do is
fill both of these cups

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.300
with a fair amount of water,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.700
and then just let
them sit overnight,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.300
and see what they turn into.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.800
Will they turn back
into the same kind

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800
of slime they were before?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.500
Or have we changed
something fundamentally

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.362
by dehydrating them?

00:10:09.452 --> 00:10:11.700
Our slime powders
have now been sitting

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.000
in water for several days,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.200
really trying to let
them soak up just as much

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.300
as they possibly could.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.500
Let's take a look
at how they've turned out.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.600
Our purple one is
the homemade stuff,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.800
and you can pretty clearly see
that there appears to be just

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.000
a layer of water
on top of whatever

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.200
is formed down there.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.802
What has formed down there?

00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:30.702
Okay.

00:10:30.702 --> 00:10:32.900
This is a little bit
like slime.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.700
It's definitely
got more texture,

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.600
but it is behaving pretty
similarly to slime.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.100
Stretch it out.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.540
Squish it down.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.100
It's slimy.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.220
It's oozy.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.400
It's not quite the same
as it was before,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.442
but I'd call that
still some slime.

00:10:53.962 --> 00:10:56.102
Purple, slightly grainy slime.

00:10:57.432 --> 00:10:59.462
All right, let's take a look
at our green slime.

00:11:00.152 --> 00:11:03.562
This doesn't have
the same clear water on the top.

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:05.300
I think it is
a little bit thicker

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.932
farther down in the cup.

00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:09.282
I don't know.

00:11:09.282 --> 00:11:11.352
That's looking
pretty slimy to me.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:19.600
[Music]

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.400
Once again,
there's-- I think

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.600
there's just a little bit
of a texture to it that

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.082
wasn't there before.

00:11:25.082 --> 00:11:29.980
[Music]

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.000
It's not even.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.800
There's some thicker parts
to our slime,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.300
and there's some runny parts
that you can't really get a hold of.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.260
I feel like when it yeah,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.580
when it comes from the store,
I feel like it's really really smooth,

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.772
almost like it's green pudding.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.080
This looks a little bit granular.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.500
It looks like if you took
purple food coloring,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.952
and poured it into a diaper,
and then took all the junk out.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.180
It's about the same consistency.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.732
Dehydrating works very well.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.140
Rehydrating?

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.700
It takes a fair amount of time,
and it doesn't give you quite

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.700
the same consistency,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.760
but we were able
to make powderized slime,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.622
and turn it back into real slime.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.880
Guys, that's all
I've got for today,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.300
but the fun doesn't end here.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.900
That box up at the top
will take you directly

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.900
to our last video.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.000
You should go check that out.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.200
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.162
you should be watching next.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.800
And if you haven't subscribe
to our channel,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.900
just hit this bomb
to join the club,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.500
and that way, you
will never miss out on the fun.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.300
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.420
Talk to you then.
