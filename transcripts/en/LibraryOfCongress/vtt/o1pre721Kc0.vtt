00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.880
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.530
And I hope you've been
having a wonderful time

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.060
at the National Book Festival.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.510
I'm Carla Hayden, the Library of
Congress, and I am so excited --

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.970
To introduce our next
writer and illustrator--

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.330
Of so many amazing books.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.480
You know who I'm
talking about, don't you?

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.780
Because he's right here.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.080
Mr. Brian Selznick.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.110
And I think that deserves a
big hand before I say all these

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.910
other wonderful things.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.500
[ Applause ]

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.520
Now you know that his books have
garnered countless accolades

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.310
around the world and
have been translated

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.840
into more than 35 languages.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.520
He is the Caldecott
Medal winning creator

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.080
of the number one New York
Times best sellers The Invention

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.970
of Hugo adapted into
an Oscar-winning movie

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.540
and Wonderstruck.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.490
I think we need more,
more, more.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.790
This is -- because
it gets better.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.720
He's also written the New York
Times bestsellers the Marvels

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.340
and Baby Monkey, Private
Eye, one of my favorites.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.410
So it has been 20 years since
the first Harry Potter book,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.060
and we are celebrating
the anniversary,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.150
the 20th anniversary, with
the publication by Scholastic

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.980
of a new edition and
series with covers

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.170
by our wonderful illustrator.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.220
Now he's going to
tell you all about it,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.720
and if you haven't read
the series yet, please do.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.750
If you want to re-read
it, please do,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.780
because Brian is
marvelous, and he is going

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.280
to be interviewed today
by Barrie Hardymon,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.100
MPR's Weekend Edition book
editor, also someone that lived

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.900
in my hometown of Baltimore.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.620
So she's going to interview
him and please join me

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.080
in welcoming Brian Selznick.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.140
[ Applause ]

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.960
&gt;&gt; Wow. Thank you.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.560
&gt;&gt; I have to tell you,
I'm a little starstruck.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.510
&gt;&gt; Can we have a round of
applause for Dr. Hayden, please?

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.080
[ Applause ]

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.420
Thank you.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.520
Making the Library of Congress
accessible to all of us,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.080
everyone in the country.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.460
Thank you for all of the work
you do opening up the doors

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.610
and making us feel welcome here

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.510
at the greatest library
in the world.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.730
[ Applause ]

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.030
So thank you all so much.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.030
I'm going to do a brief
presentation about the making

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.580
of the Harry Potter
books before we sit down

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.280
and have our interview together.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.450
So -- I don't have that much
time, so I just started --

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.210
I want to start when I was 10,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.940
so we have 42 years
to get through.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.180
I always drew when I was a kid.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.780
These are some drawings
that I did when I was young.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.220
I used to like to
copy famous artists.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.610
This is a copy of an angel
that I did by da Vinci.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.480
I also liked to draw monsters.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.970
I got in trouble sometimes
for drawing monsters

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.800
when I was a kid, but all

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.190
of these things were always
a big part of my life.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.370
And eventually I got a job at
Eeyore's Books for Children,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.910
which some of us remember as one
of the best bookstores anywhere,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.250
and that's really
where I learned how

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.200
to be a children's book
illustrator and how

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.740
to make books for children.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.240
I used to paint the windows
for different holidays.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.870
This, of course, was
our Christmas window.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.310
And my first book came out
while I was still working

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.670
at Eeyore's Books for Children,
The Houdini Box, and then I went

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.220
on and I made many other books,
some of which were set here

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.640
in Washington, DC, like Walt
Whitman, Words for America,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.670
and Amelia and Eleanor
Go for a Ride.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.860
And I was living in
Washington DC with my husband,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.830
David Serlin, while I
was making this book,

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.510
and he had a fellowship
at the Smithsonian.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.650
And so I went on from there
to make these three books,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.550
which formed a kind of trilogy,
The Invention of Hugo Cabret,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.360
Wonderstruck, and The
Marvels, which are books

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.880
that tell stories
with a combination

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.000
of words and pictures.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.910
And so when I got the call
to illustrate the new covers

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.080
for Harry Potter, I -- well,
immediately I was terrified,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.400
like my first response
was complete terror,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.530
because the entire world
loves Harry Potter.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.690
But I, myself, was a
fan of Harry Potter.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.470
I had read the books for the
first time two years prior

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.390
to getting this phone call, and
I really fell in love with them.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.600
I was so moved by the
characters, by the relationships

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.490
between everybody in the books,
by the battle between good

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.960
and evil, especially by Dobby.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.960
Dobby was my favorite character.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.370
I'm a Hufflepuff, by the way.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.210
I don't know if we have any
Hufflepuffs in the house.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.680
And so while I was talking
to Scholastic on the phone,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.340
and they were offering this
incredible opportunity to me,

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.370
I was told that I had two weeks
to design all seven covers

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.010
and hand in the sketches
in order to get approval,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.480
and if I get approved,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.930
then I could go ahead
and do the artwork.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.270
And while I was on the
phone, I had a vision

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.510
for what I wanted
the covers to be.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.460
I wanted them to be black
and white, and I wanted them

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.240
to all line up so that they
would tell a single story

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.180
from the first book to the last
book, like JK Rowling does,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.630
of the story of Harry Potter,
his growing up, and his battle

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.550
with good and evil, and
his friends and family.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.410
And so when I was
working on Hugo,

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.890
because one of the things I
wanted to say was that all

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.180
of the things I learned
making all of my books

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.300
up until Harry Potter, went

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.830
into helping me make the
Harry Potter book covers

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.370
as good as I possibly could.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.570
And so one of the things
I did when I was working

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.970
on the Invention of Hugo Cabret,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.840
was I illustrated a dream
sequence in the story that I did

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.720
as one long drawing, and then
I divided that one long drawing

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.910
up into five spreads, so that
when you get to the book,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.180
the dream sequence
feels like it's flowing

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.370
from one page into the next.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.990
And I remember doing that
single drawing and I thought,

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.170
that is what will
be my inspiration

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.120
for the Harry Potter covers.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.190
And so the first thing I did
was I sat down and I drew

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.060
out seven little book
covers next to each other

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.900
and I started drawing lines,
because I wanted to figure

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.030
out how to connect all
of them and I thought

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.250
like a swirling line
would connect them.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.230
And I realized that
that swirling line looks

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.720
like a snake.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.890
And that reminded me of
Nagini, and if you're a fan

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.690
of the books, you know
that Nagini is connected

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.070
with Voldemort and
it represents evil.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.870
And I thought that would be how
I could represent the battle

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.390
of good and evil is that
snake could wind all the way

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.810
through the books, from
Book One to Book Seven,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.630
where the snake is -- where
we see the snake's head

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.730
on Book Seven, and we have
an intimation, a hint,

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.420
of what happens at the end.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.720
Because one of the challenges

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.500
when you're doing book covers
is you want to make covers

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.790
that are interesting
to the fans,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.660
that they can identify with,
but it also has to bring

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.740
in new readers, so you don't
want to give away the ending.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.510
So I took that first sketch,
I started adding more details,

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.200
and I handed in my first
sketch in one week.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.040
I did this in less than a week.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.650
I got approval from
Scholastic, we got approval

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.240
from JK Rowling's entire team,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.970
and then I spent the next
several months working out all

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.200
of the details for these covers.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.390
So if you look at
these sketches,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.460
as we look at the detailed
versions, you'll see some things

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.100
that change, you'll see some
things that stay the same,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.970
but you'll notice that the
seventh book is the one

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.270
that changes the most.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.600
So notice here I have Harry
grown up, holding the head

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.290
of the snake, and
then that changes.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.540
Now you can see he's
got his two friends,

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.970
but I've got more
details worked in.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.900
And you can see I'm labeling
some of the characters,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.170
because I knew for the
fans I wanted to have lots

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.610
of little Easter eggs
where you would be able

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.590
to recognize things
from the books

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.890
that if you haven't
read the books,

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.470
you might not know
what they are.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.640
And I had to draw
this giant snake.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.180
And so I wanted to make
sure that the scales

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.060
for the snake all lined
up in the correct way,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.450
so I did one giant drawing.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.050
This drawing is actually this
big, to make sure that I got all

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.010
of the loops of the
snake correct.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.930
And then I began working out
what I wanted each of the covers

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.690
to look like, in detail,

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.390
and these are four different
versions of that final cover,

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.420
where you can see me
working towards the one

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.320
that eventually became the
cover that I ended up using.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.510
And I don't really do very
much work on the computer.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.100
I draw everything by hand.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.210
I have a Xerox machine, a
copy machine, in my studio

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.300
and I do print things out
or take a digital photograph

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.040
and print it out and I will
then I'll photocopy a drawing

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.330
and then I'll enlarge it or
shrink it on my photocopier

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.650
like it's 1997, and then
I will cut things out

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.110
and rearrange them
and move them around.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.930
And so you can see on
the wall of my studio,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.610
one of the drawings I did of
Harry as a kid, one of the ones

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.530
that I did of him
a little older,

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.340
so that I could move the
elements around a little bit,

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.510
the way people who work
on the computer might do

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.040
that with Photoshop,
I literally cut

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.170
and paste everything together.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.270
And so here you can see a cut
and pasted version of the cover

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:25.410
of the books, the big mural, and
I'm beginning to find the places

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.450
where each of the details
are going to work together.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.460
And so I got to go to Harry
Potter World in the middle

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.470
of all this to meet 75,000 Harry
Potter fans, and let me just say

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.800
that completely freaked
me out in terms

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.610
of the pressure and
the expectations.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.260
But what they reminded
me, ultimately,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.650
was that we're all
Harry Potter fans,

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.550
and I'm a Harry Potter fan
offering other Harry Potter fans

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.620
my version of this world.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.630
But I got to meet someone
who had Dobby with her,

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.950
and so I got my own Dobby,

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.240
and me and my husband
now live with Dobby.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.200
We're very happy.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.990
I think Dobby's very happy.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.050
And so then I began
doing the drawing.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.570
And so that became the
final image for the covers.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.570
And I started at the first
drawing and worked my way left

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.300
to right, and I put on an audio
recording of Harry Potter read

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.020
by Jim Dale, at the beginning
of this drawing, and I listened

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.850
to all seven of the books
while I was doing the drawings,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.260
and I actually was
keeping pace with the story

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.750
as I was working my
way across the covers

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.920
and I have a magnifying glass
that was helping me out.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.280
And this actually
didn't help at all.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.540
[ Laughing ]

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.010
And so by the time
I got to the end

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:52.020
and I was drawing the
final battle of Hogwarts,

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.230
I was actually listening
to the Battle of Hogwarts

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.150
in the stories themselves.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.060
Hold on, I just have
to do one thing.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.450
My computer froze.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.310
I'm just going to move ahead
this way and then go back.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.440
And so I had the
finished artwork finally,

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.460
and then we were able to choose
colors for each of the titles

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.730
that were representative of
something from the book itself.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.480
And so I'm going to now tell
you a few little secrets

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.080
from each of the covers.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.500
Harry Potter's glasses are
actually glasses I wore

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.640
in the movie version of my book
Wonderstruck that was directed

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.500
by Todd Haynes, starring
Julianne Moore.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.800
And so those are Harry Potter --

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.630
those became Harry
Potter's glasses.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.970
And so Aragog, there,
the spider, was inspired

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.770
by a sculpture by
Louise Bourgeois,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.000
who likes to make giant spiders
that are inspired by her mother,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.440
because she sees spiders
as very nurturing.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.760
These figures, the
Dementors, are inspired

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.760
by these grieving monks,
these sculptures that I saw

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.290
at the Met, which
were also inspirations

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:05.970
for graveyard figures in
the movie version of Hugo.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.580
And Fleur Delacour

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.240
in the Triwizarding Competition
was directly inspired

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.110
by the movie star Veronica Lake.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.950
And this centaur
was inspired by one

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.910
of the sculptures
on The Parthenon.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.160
And I had to draw what, for me,
was the most horrifying villain

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.870
in the entire series,
Dolores Umbridge,

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.070
because she's a bureaucrat,
she's a hypocrite,

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.730
she says she's doing good,
but is actually doing evil.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.340
I think we can all
make parallels

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.510
to people in our world.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.220
[ Applause ]

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.080
And because she's the one who,
to me, is the most realistic

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.470
and the most recognizable,
she's also the most terrifying.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.800
So I had to find someone

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.310
to represent this
embodiment of evil.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.510
So, of course, I
turned to my husband.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:07.390
[ Laughing ]

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.430
Dumbledore is Michelangelo's
Moses.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.120
And then I got to
do the box set,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.780
so I got to do these
quick little sketches

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.830
about what I wanted
the box to look like.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.720
I got to redesign all
of the house crests,

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.320
which was very exciting.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.890
And then this is the exterior
of the box, Harry Potter,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.720
but I love how Harry has
some of Voldemort in him,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.310
Voldemort has some of Harry
in him, good and evil are --

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.250
it's a very, very
complicated game that's played.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.170
It's a very, very
complicated dance

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.650
as good tries to
win out over evil.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.480
So when you take out all of
the books in the box set,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.830
this is what you find inside.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.190
So there's Voldemort
waiting for you inside.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:55.510
So as we put all
of them together --

00:14:55.510 --> 00:15:14.170
[ Music ]

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.880
That became the series.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.630
Thank you very much.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.650
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.260
Hi.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.560
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.860
&gt;&gt; How are you?

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.160
&gt;&gt; I'm well.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.460
So since we only
have five minutes,

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.760
I'm going to ask you the
thing that I'm going to talk

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.060
about the thing in this picture
that just moves me the most,

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.530
which is that -- and I heard
that you loved to draw babies,

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.260
and there are two babies
in this, and I want you

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.560
to talk about both of them.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.410
So at the beginning, you have
little baby Harry being left

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.080
on the doorstep.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.590
At the end, well --

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so because I wanted
to draw the whole story

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.780
and encapsulate it
as best I could,

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.060
the beginning we see
Harry when he's abandoned

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.640
and he's being rescued
at that moment.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.050
He's actually in the
hands of Dumbledore

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.080
after Hagrid has taken
him and rescued him.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.860
He's in the hands of Dumbledore.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.190
But then, at the end, Harry
has experienced so much loss,

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.170
but one of the things we learn

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.070
through JK Rowling's incredible
story is that it's the power

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:18.470
of love that saves Harry that
you begin to feel will save us,

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.050
and so I wanted to have
a glimpse of the love

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.550
that Harry had as a
baby from his parents.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.680
So we end with a vision of
him as a baby with his parents

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.520
and that cameo of love.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.810
&gt;&gt; And you can see their
cheeks are next to his cheeks.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.040
Actually I can barely
talk about it.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.340
It is so beautiful.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.940
&gt;&gt; And also right
underneath, you can see --

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.280
I'm looking at it right now.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.070
There's this sort of
-- the train sort of --

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.370
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.670
&gt;&gt; Still moving.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.970
And I love that the
Hogwarts Express is actually

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.270
on the cover of the last book.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.870
&gt;&gt; Because it makes
the reader feel

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.170
like we can all go to Hogwarts.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.470
&gt;&gt; We can all go to
Hogwarts together.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the books aren't over.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And in the coda,
when we move into the future

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.450
with the series, and we've
got other children going

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.750
to Hogwarts --

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.350
&gt;&gt; I wanted us to
always be moving forward,

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.250
and that's why ultimately
I decided that Harry

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.480
and his friends should be
facing into the future.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.250
And so they're facing
into the future,

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.880
Hogwarts Express is moving
into the future, because I feel

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.390
like the stories leave us
with that kind of hope.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.690
&gt;&gt; And with a --

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.990
&gt;&gt; With a forward motion.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.290
&gt;&gt; Propelled forward.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.830
I also -- I'm surprised
to hear you say

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.370
that you discovered these books
only two years before you got

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.930
the assignment, because there
are so many themes that I feel

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.960
like are yours, orphans
and love and loneliness

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.460
and finding these -- you must
have felt a real kindred, like,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.060
oh, these are my people.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:42.670
&gt;&gt; Yes. Most of my stories,
the children are orphans.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.300
&gt;&gt; I find that in a
story, having a kid

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.920
who doesn't have any parents has
a kind of agency where they have

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.620
to go out into the world
and create their own family.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.920
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.840
&gt;&gt; So a lot of times I'm
trying to write stories,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.920
that no matter what
you situation is,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.570
we can create our own families.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.610
We can surround ourselves
with people who we love.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.010
And so -- and I knew,
of course --

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.880
I mean, I knew a lot about
Harry Potter over the years,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.040
and so I knew that he was an
orphan, and I knew about some

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.880
of the general plot points, and
I knew that there were a lot

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.950
of themes that overlapped with
things that I cared about.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.250
So I think you're right.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.770
When I finally listened to
the story, and I was able

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:29.450
to really immerse myself in
what JK Rowling had created,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.600
I felt very much like Harry
and Hugo Cabret and so many

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.900
of my other characters.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.740
They're all cousins
to each other.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.340
&gt;&gt; In some way.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So before --

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.940
I know that we want to
take audience questions,

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.180
but I do want to ask, the
final illustrations are so rich

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.520
and they have so many details,
Firenze, and the Patronus

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.360
and all of these --
what's your favorite?

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.550
Is there some tiny Easter egg
that you want to let people --

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.890
or do you want everybody
to find their own?

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.140
Is there one favorite
moment in this?

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.070
&gt;&gt; I mean, it was really fun
going through and making lists

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.360
of everything that I
wanted to put in the cover,

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.800
so I do actually
have written lists.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.100
&gt;&gt; Oh, I would love
to see that list.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.860
&gt;&gt; Of all of my favorite
moments,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.820
all my favorite characters,
and then trying to figure

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.980
out what was going
to fit where was --

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.070
like I knew I wanted to draw
Hagrid with the golden egg,

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.920
with that egg, the dragon egg,
and I knew I had to get Dobby

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.320
in there, since he was
my favorite character.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.800
And then the labyrinth and
the Triwizarding Tournament,

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.160
there's a labyrinth
that they have

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.280
to go through, it's in right --

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.580
&gt;&gt; Oh, right, yes.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.880
&gt;&gt; Over there, yeah.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.180
And so --

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.480
&gt;&gt; You stumped me.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.120
&gt;&gt; And then getting to
draw my vision of Hogwarts

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.440
as well was really fun, which is
actually based on the train set

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.600
at the New York Botanical
Gardens,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.610
their Christmas display.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.820
They have all of the buildings
in New York made out of bark

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.640
and twigs and branches
and leaves and acorns,

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.040
and so that was one of my
inspirations for Hogwarts.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.340
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.640
&gt;&gt; So trying to get all
of that in was really fun.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.520
&gt;&gt; And it must have been
helpful that you've never had

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.830
to consult another vision
of this in your head,

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.670
because you hadn't really
-- because we have --

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.690
we are bombarded with these
images, be they Disney or --

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.290
&gt;&gt; Etsy, but wonderfully.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.890
&gt;&gt; I mean all of these different
-- but you never had to --

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.190
this arrived fully formed.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.790
&gt;&gt; To [inaudible].

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.090
&gt;&gt; Even though I hadn't
read the books, of course,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.660
Mary Grandpre's images
are everywhere.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.260
&gt;&gt; They're beautiful
and they're iconic.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.860
&gt;&gt; So -- and I had seen
some of the movies.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.700
I had seen some parts
of the movies,

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.820
and everything is
designed so brilliantly.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.490
&gt;&gt; It's all so beautiful, but
ultimately when I had to sit

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.510
down to do my version,
it really was --

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.620
it wasn't that it was easy
to put all that aside, but --

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.240
because I was very aware
of it, and loved all

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.480
of it, but it wasn't mine.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.780
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.170
&gt;&gt; And what we all have in
common is what JK Rowling wrote.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.980
So the movies come
from the books.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.580
&gt;&gt; The parks come
from the books.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.990
Mary Grandpre's images
come from the books.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.000
All the images come
from the books.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.180
So, like, if any of us,
anybody here was asked

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.860
to draw their Harry Potter,
we'd all have our own,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.160
so that's what I got to do.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.460
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.820
Well, on that note, let's take
some questions from the audience

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.880
and hear about your
own Harry Potters.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.180
Mr. Incredible?

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.950
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.250
&gt;&gt; We have a microphone.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.550
&gt;&gt; You've got to go
to the microphone.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.850
&gt;&gt; Can you jump over
to the microphone?

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.060
&gt;&gt; I work in radio and I
actually skipped the microphone.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.360
Sorry.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.570
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.870
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.240
&gt;&gt; So in your making of
the book, box I mean,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.370
how come you didn't decorate
part of it with Death Eaters?

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.670
&gt;&gt; With Death Eaters?

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.200
Oh, the question is how
come I didn't decorate part

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.790
of the box with Death Eaters?

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.090
One of the challenges I --

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.030
is that I could've decorated
the box with anything,

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.950
but one of the things I wanted
to do was try to have Harry

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.700
as the focus on the back,
that hidden Voldemort inside,

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.650
and then I thought it would
be interesting if each

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.520
of the sides could represent
the different houses.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.340
So every choice means
something doesn't get done,

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.640
but I thought it
would be interesting

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.910
to work on the house crests.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.210
&gt;&gt; Everything's hard.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You have a
question over here?

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.130
Okay, who has the next question?

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.730
&gt;&gt; I was going to do one more.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.190
On your drawings for the
black and white covers,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:33.600
I was wondering, you
should've included

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.290
like just one Death
Eater on each cover.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.270
&gt;&gt; Oh. Where were you?

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.490
Where were you a
couple months ago?

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:42.790
I could've taken that note.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.090
&gt;&gt; Everyone's a critic.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.600
&gt;&gt; But I'm glad that you like
the Death Eaters so much,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.290
because I really did
have fun drawing them,

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.470
even though they were so scary.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.770
Yeah?

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:55.000
&gt;&gt; So in terms of Wonderstruck,
do you, like, do all --

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.820
because there's like
two stories that are

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.430
like interlacing
with each other.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:02.290
Do you do like all the words
and then all the pictures

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.680
or something like that?

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.070
&gt;&gt; The question is
about Wonderstruck,

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.680
which tells one story
entirely in words

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.620
and then a different story
that's 50 years earlier all

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.920
in pictures.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.540
And I actually wrote both of
the stories at the same time.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.130
I wrote what I wanted
the picture story to be,

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.500
even though I knew it
was going to be pictures,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.050
and then I decided what
pictures would tell that story,

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.600
and then wove them
together from there.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.340
So I worked on them
simultaneously.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.320
&gt;&gt; What would you do
if a new book came out

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.740
and you were asked to --

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.890
&gt;&gt; What would I do if a new
Harry Potter book came out

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.060
and I was asked to
illustrate the cover?

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.080
I think I would have
all the same feelings.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.380
I would get really
nervous again,

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.970
and then I'd feel really honored
again, and then I would sit down

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.430
and figure out what would be
the best way to tell this story.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.850
But having told the entire
series, of the seven series,

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.740
I feel pretty pleased
with what I have there.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.140
Can we get another question?

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.440
Yeah.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.740
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
Harry Potter book?

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.280
&gt;&gt; What is my favorite
Harry Potter book?

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.580
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.880
&gt;&gt; That's a really
good question.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.090
I really do look at all
of them as a single story,

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:10.420
because when I'm asked
what was my favorite moment

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.750
or what was my favorite
part, I don't remember

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.400
which book it happened in.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.400
I remember that it happened in
the lifetime of Harry Potter,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.470
but I do remember the
Triwizarding event was

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.960
particularly exciting.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.290
The battle itself became
one of my favorites,

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.970
and sort of the story
art with what happened

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.140
with Dobby was one
of my favorites.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.930
&gt;&gt; I think we can get in
maybe one more question.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.200
&gt;&gt; Hi, yeah, so early on
in your talk you mentioned

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.300
that you decided very early
on that the covers would be

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.710
in black and white, and I was
hoping you could elaborate a

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.460
little more on that
and which parts

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.250
of the Harry Potter story
made you, led you to believe

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.950
that black and white
was the right choice.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I love drawing
in black and white and I think

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.160
that black and white is a very
mysterious way to make an image,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.340
because it asks you to
use your imagination,

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.760
because the world actually
isn't in black and white.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.150
So when we see something
in black and white,

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.220
it might remind us of an old
movie or an old photograph,

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.540
and then we, in our minds, fill
in what else might be there.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:15.020
So we might see a black and
white drawing of a landscape,

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.890
and in our minds we might be
aware that the sky is blue

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.190
and the grass is green,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.170
even though that's not
actually what we're seeing.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.720
So there's something
else happening

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.840
in our mind that's adding to
what's there, and that process

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.450
where the viewer has
to bring something else

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.110
to the image is exciting to me.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.820
And I thought because there's
so much happening in these books

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.350
and they're so mysterious,
that it might be nice to do it

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.910
in black and white so that
the reader can add parts

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.970
of their own imagination
to finish the images.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:48.310
So that's why I wanted to
do it in black and white.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.870
&gt;&gt; I think that's where
we have to leave it.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.200
But thank you so much, Brian,

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.500
and could we have
a great big hand --

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.000
round of applause for him.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.300
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.600
&gt;&gt; Yea. And look very
carefully at this.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.900
It's so wonderful.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.200
Thank you.
