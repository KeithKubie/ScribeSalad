A CAR RIDE AND PUT YOUR LIFE IN

&gt;&gt; CHRIS: OH, UM, YES!

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.101
THE ACTUAL ANSWER WAS:
"SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.938
THE TALIBAN?"

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.941
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:17.177

GRACE.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:37.264
&gt;&gt; IF I WAS D.T.F..

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:39.833
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.736
&gt;&gt; THE CORRECT ANSWER TO THE
72-YAER-OLD CAUCASIAN WOMA WAS,

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:47.174
"DO YOU LISTEN TO TRAP?"

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.977
LAST ONE: MY UBERDRIVER IS
SWEATY AS ( BLEEP ) AND HIS CAR

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.778
SMELLS LIKE BLANK AND BLANK.

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:52.479

NAME OF MY ALBUM.
