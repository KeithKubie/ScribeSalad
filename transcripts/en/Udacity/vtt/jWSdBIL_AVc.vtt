As soon as I found React, it became clear
that this was the right way to do things.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.220
What I love about react is that it's
going to set your career up for years to

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.049
come. As a front-end developer things
are constantly changing. The patterns

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.199
you'll see in React are the same
patterns current and future front-end

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.730
frameworks will utilize. Not to mention,
learning React will enable you to build

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.529
web apps, native apps, or even apps in
virtual reality. By learning React today

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.019
you're future proofing your career. I am
Tyler McGinnis; I'm from Eden, Utah.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.800
I am a Google developer expert, and I
work full-time on TylerMcGinnis.com

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.760
The paradigms and the principles that
you learn in React are all of a sudden

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.300
becoming popular in all these other
frameworks, so by learning React, React

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.170
isn't just going to teach you a new API
it's gonna help you learn nice software

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.250
principles that you can then apply to
different frameworks and languages.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.739
What I really like about this collaboration
is that it combines both of our

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.340
strengths. I've been teaching React in
the React ecosystem for a few years now,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.640
so I feel like I have a pretty good
grasp on how to teach it. And what

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.300
Udacit provides that I can't are things
like code reviews, mentorship, and the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.200
in-class experience. We think it's gonna
make you a much better developer so come join us!
