00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.719
The correct answer is P. There's nothing fancy

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.570
going on where, you know, p equals foo

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.450
and then, you know, because z equals p,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.750
z also equals foo. There's not that level

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.810
of computation. Now, if the server wants to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.070
do that down the road, that's fine. But

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.990
in the general, in the general case, z just equals the letter p, and that's it.
