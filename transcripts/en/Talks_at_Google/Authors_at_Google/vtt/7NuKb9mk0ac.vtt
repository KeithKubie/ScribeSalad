MICHAEL BIERUT: Thank you
so much for having me here.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.280
I'm sort of just warming you up
for Salman Rushdie, I suppose.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.770
I'm less significant
in every possible way.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.970
But we have a nice, intimate
the little space to talk.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.975
I'm a graphic designer.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.600
That's my name,
my Twitter thing.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.630
That's me on Easter Sunday,
1969, in suburban Cleveland,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.840
Ohio, which is where I grew up.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.230
That's my mom and
dad, obviously,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.320
and those are my
younger brothers,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.060
who are fraternal twins.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.300
Their names are
Ronald and Donald.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.750
They have rhyming names, OK?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.700
That explains
everything you need

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.408
to know about what it
was like to grow up

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:56.040
in suburban Cleveland
in the '60s.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.660
My mom doesn't
understand why that's

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.829
funny to give kids--
they're twins.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.120
Was I supposed to give them
completely unrelated names?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.290
It's a naming problem.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.060
At a very early age,
I realized I wanted

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.430
to be a graphic designer.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.310
I was good at art, but art
always seemed kind of hermetic

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.920
to me.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.440
Artists went off
to, as I imagined,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.810
they went, like to garrets
or studios or closed rooms,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.820
then just would do
paintings and things,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.370
and then sometimes would die.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.590
Then their paintings
would be discovered.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.710
Sometimes the paintings would
be sold in their lifetime.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.085
But it just seemed
like coming up

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:36.609
with ideas for paintings
just seemed really hard.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.650
When I realized there was
this other thing called

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.090
graphic design that, in effect,
was being creative as a means

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.576
to another end, I thought
it was really exciting.

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:48.200
And I can still
remember the first time

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.350
I saw a piece of graphic
design that really excited me.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.720
I was probably maybe
eight or nine years old.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.020
I was being driven by
my dad to get a haircut.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.720
We were stopped at
a traffic light.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.414
And my dad looked over to the
passenger side of the car where

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:08.080
I was sitting and
looked out the window,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.453
and saw a piece of
industrial equipment

00:02:12.453 --> 00:02:13.580
called a forklift truck.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.740
Do they have those here?

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.260
They do that, right?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.677
And he said, oh look,
that's really clever.

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:20.510
And I looked at the
truck, and I said, what?

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.593
He said, the way they wrote
the name of the truck.

00:02:22.593 --> 00:02:24.530
And on the side of the
truck it said Clark.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.900
And I said, why?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.900
And he said, well, look.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.590
It does what the truck does.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.790
And so he said, look how
the L is lifting up the A.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.960
And I was like, oh my god.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.750
Is this happening
all over the place?

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.320
Are these things everywhere?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.240
And so at that moment,
I sort realized

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.744
that something about
that-- it was like art,

00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:50.160
it was like
creativity, but it had

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.695
nothing to do with painting a
bowl of fruit, like Cezanne,

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:59.250
or some women with their noses
sideways, like Picasso, or just

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.330
splattering paint
like Jackson Pollock.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.490
This is like, our name is Clark.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.510
We make forklift trucks.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.272
What do you got?

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:07.230
It just occurred to me.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.880
The L can lift up the A.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.070
So I just thought, if I could
do that for the rest my life,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.670
I'd be happy.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.130
And I have, and I am.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.300
So I'm with you today.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.500
Here I am at Google.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.580
Thank you.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.600
So I'm just going to show you
one project that I worked on.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.190
And you guys recently
changed your logo, which

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.120
I like very much, by the way.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.690
I was really early out
of the box in Twitter

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.150
and said something like,
this is really good.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.230
And it was one of the few
really impulsive things

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.430
I've ever done on Twitter.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.340
And then journalists
started calling me up

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.459
to get me to weigh in
publicly about the logo.

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.750
But I've designed logos that
other people of weighed in

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.570
publicly on.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.210
And I'm sort of-- I don't think
everyone should be weighing

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.670
in publicly about logos.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.680
And a lot of times I sort of
think if-- back in the '60s,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.700
there was a little private
moment between me and my dad.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.820
Very private.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.200
If my dad was drinking a beer
with our next door neighbor,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.230
and he had brought up that
logo with another adult,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.560
that guy would have
thought he was insane.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.760
You know what I really like?

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.430
What do you like, Lenny?

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.450
That logo for Clark
Forklift Trucks.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.010
Ever seen it?

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.769
Like my next door neighbor
would be like, what the fuck?

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.269
What?

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.950
So people didn't talk
about logos in these days.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.060
They talk about them all
the time now, don't they?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.476
I mean, you put
out a logo and all

00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:26.524
of a sudden it's like
people are analyzing it.

00:04:26.524 --> 00:04:28.690
I don't know if you read
"The New Yorker" over here.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.065
But some lady in
"The New Yorker"

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:36.480
wrote this nostalgic poem about
how beautiful the old Google

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.581
logo was, which
personally, I just

00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:39.830
thought that was preposterous.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.120
She was saying,
oh, the serifs were

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.870
referring to centuries
of literary tradition,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.510
and now it's all
been sanded away.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.500
I just think the way
that all the O's line

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.817
up on in the search thing is
just-- it's all very nice.

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:57.150
So at any rate, I'm going to
going to show you something

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.210
that I worked on.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.180
And it's something that
actually came out very well,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.770
but had false starts
along the way.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.480
So for the first
time anywhere, I'm

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.840
showing the first thing that we
proposed, which was rejected.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.180
I've never shown this before.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.270
The thing that was accepted
is, I think, still on view

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.400
as part of Designs of the
Year at the Design Museum

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.370
here in London.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.880
But the rejected thing
has never been shown

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.420
publicly outside of the client.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.780
So here you go.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.980
Oh, this is for this book.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.660
And so what I really
find interesting

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.880
is how design is about solving
problems and doing things.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.700
And so it's art or creativity
for a purpose, right?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.392
So the purpose has to do
with how you do something.

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:43.850
And when I'm working
with a client,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.910
the first thing I try
to do is figure out

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.450
what they're trying to solve
and how to solve it, basically.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.800
OK.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.420
So this was actually the end,
about designing two dozen logos

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.520
at the same time.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.800
So the client is
the MIT Media Lab.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.979
You guys know what that is?

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.770
It's Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.530
In 1985, or 19-- I'm
trying to do the math here.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.290
It was the 20th
anniversary in 1910,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.490
so 1990-- I thought
it was 1985--

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.060
celebrated their anniversary.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.940
And they had been started
at MIT to sort of explore

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.180
where media and technology
could all meet up.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.190
It's actually a
couple of buildings

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.236
that house a bunch
of small research

00:06:32.236 --> 00:06:34.110
groups, two dozen little
research groups that

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.500
more or less have free
rein to just explore

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.810
whatever they want.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.790
On the occasion of
the anniversary,

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.590
this wonderful new
identity system

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.920
was created by a guy who
was then at the Media Lab

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.342
named Richard Tay.

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:51.300
Then he came to Google.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.610
I think he might still be
at Google in California.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.807
He's a great, great,
great designer.

00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:57.640
And if you don't know
what that looked like,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.200
this is what it was.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.280
And the trick with
this was, that thing

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.110
you see there was just one
permutation of the logo.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.270
He had written an
algorithm or something,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.800
or someone wrote some algorithm.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.120
You guys all know
what algorithms are.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.036
I use that word a lot.

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:15.289
I really don't
know what it means.

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:16.830
I went to art school
so I didn't have

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.550
to take anything beyond
Algebra II in high school.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.190
I apologize.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.670
You can kick me out
now if you want.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.740
So within that system,
there's a bunch of squares.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.800
And then those
squares have colors

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.640
that extrude off the squares.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.600
And then it makes 40,000,
supposedly, different versions

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.760
of that thing, OK?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.770
So it's really-- I
thought was really cool.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.930
I saw this thing and I was like,
that's really, really cool.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.480
I wish I'd done that.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.600
To my surprise, the
founder of the lab,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.010
Nicholas Negroponte,
called me up and said, hey,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.080
could you design a
logo for the Media Lab?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.140
And I said, but you have a logo.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.359
He said, what do you mean?

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:56.650
I said, that thing that
Richard Tay did with the 40,000

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.441
different versions.

00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:59.859
He said, oh, you know,
that's not really a logo.

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:01.400
That was a thing
for the anniversary.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.550
We want a logo logo.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.080
And I wasn't sure what
he even meant by that.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.147
So I went up to
Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:08:09.147 --> 00:08:10.980
where MIT is, where the
Media Lab is, and we

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.100
had a series of meetings.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.266
And I finally figured out
what he was talking about.

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:16.110
I met with some other
people up there.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.000
And yet I sort of
really-- I actually

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.784
met with Richard and
[? Rune, ?] another designer.

00:08:20.784 --> 00:08:22.700
The two of them had
actually done that system.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.095
And I said look, they've asked
me to mess with this thing

00:08:25.095 --> 00:08:26.470
and I don't want
to mess with it.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.570
So give me some advice.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.360
So I met with them to
understand what they were doing

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.440
and to see what the
whole system was.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.606
So I'm just going to show
you the presentation I did

00:08:32.606 --> 00:08:34.590
for the first time we did it.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.260
This is the thing I've
never shown anyone before.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:37.760
OK.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.679
So the Media Lab
actually has a history

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:45.060
based on the architecture of
the original building, which

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.920
is by IM Pei.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.550
And then in the IM
Pei building, there

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.000
was a couple of
art installations

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.320
that a designer named
Jacqueline Casey riffed on.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.140
See all these little
stripey things?

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.840
So she created this identity
that had little stripey things,

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.380
see?

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.679
So that was her idea.

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:05.720
So everyone's business
card had a different bunch

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.590
of stripes on them.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.215
So this idea of everything kind
of being the same but different

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.760
was already there right
back at the very beginning.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.830
It was the 25th
anniversary, not the 20th.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.140
The 25th anniversary,
Richard and his team

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.910
did something based
on a new building

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.930
that the Japanese
architect Maki did for them

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.490
that was-- in addition to
the Pei building, the IM Pei

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:29.990
building.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.980
And this shows a little
bit of that in action,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.910
if you can see that.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.990
So the good qualities of that
are that it sort of extends

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.639
that original identity in a way
that I thought was thoughtful.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.180
It's a metaphor for
the new building,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.810
because the building
had atriums,

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.790
and it sort of did
stuff like that.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.230
And the last one,
it sort of was just

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.920
a demonstration of how ingenious
and innovative and imaginative

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.550
the MIT Media Lab was.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.740
However, the shortcomings
were-- as I finally

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.630
got them figured
out-- it sort of is

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.220
very-- what's the word for it?

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.550
It's a look at me sort of logo.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.590
It kind of like
demands attention.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.590
And part of the issue
they have is that all

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.990
these other-- they have all
these other things going

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.907
on there that like to be
the protagonist as well.

00:10:12.907 --> 00:10:14.490
So here's this other
thing that really

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.960
is supposed to just be kind
of signing off or endorsing

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.270
those things, but it's very
active and clever for that.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.759
And then it has this
entropic sort of thing.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:28.300
And entropy is another thing
I'm not sure I fully understand.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.380
But as I understand it, it has
do with the general dissipation

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.810
of energy over time.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.922
So those 40,000 different
versions, I actually

00:10:35.922 --> 00:10:37.880
talked to the person who
was head of marketing.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.810
I said, well, how do you
decide which of the 40,000

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.090
different versions to use?

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.000
If someone says, send me your
logo, what do you send them?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.520
She said, oh, I just send the
same one over and over again.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.210
So they sort of-- it's tiring to
manage 40,000 different logos.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.520
And I said, do
people think, well,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.841
this logo is better for this?

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:54.340
No.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.335
The thing that makes
them great, the fact

00:10:56.335 --> 00:10:58.230
that they're all sort
of the same and equal,

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.980
actually makes
them not work well

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.720
to distinguish meaningfully any
of the activities of the lab.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.357
And then also, it's really
hard to look at that thing,

00:11:08.357 --> 00:11:10.690
particularly when it's changing
all the time, and think,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.525
oh, when you see that,
think MIT Media Lab.

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:13.650
So it needs a name with it.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.480
So we said we would
figure out a way

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.790
to do something that recognized
the legacy of the lab,

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.600
make it a little bit
stronger and louder,

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.810
and come up with a
way that would let

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.030
it work with everything else.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.390
So remember this grid.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.630
This is the grid that
underlies Richard Tay's system.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.630
We started with that grid.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:36.390
And then we decided we would
build this alphabet from that.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:43.600
So every one of these letters,
M-I-T- M-E-A-D-I-A-L-A-B,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.065
are all based on that
basic configuration.

00:11:48.065 --> 00:11:49.190
So I thought, this is nice.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.770
We're sort of paying a little
homage to the 25th anniversary

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.280
thing.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.040
And then you get something like
that on one line, or like that.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.030
Now look carefully
at that, because this

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.020
is-- when we went up to show
this to Nicholas Negroponte

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.110
the first time, he said,
oh, you almost got it.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.907
And I'm like, what?

00:12:06.907 --> 00:12:08.740
And he said, oh, this
is all you have to do.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.500
So I'll show you in a second.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.350
He said, just take
away those two things.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.120
Then it's a perfect square.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.170
And I said, but-- and
he said, no, it still

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.440
says MIT Media Lab.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.000
It's like MIT Media Lab.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.604
So this is why he's the
head of the Media Lab,

00:12:25.604 --> 00:12:27.270
or the founder of the
Media Lab, and I'm

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.460
just a vendor, basically.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:35.840
So it almost works, I think.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.950
And you can sort of
make it-- so but this

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.200
is the thing I liked the best.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.350
You kind of could
take that thing,

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.010
and then superimpose
the other thing on it,

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.551
and it sort of seemed
to kind of have

00:12:43.551 --> 00:12:45.090
the same basic underlying DNA.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.990
I liked that part of it.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:53.460
So then we did a bunch of little
animations to show, really,

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.510
it's there, right?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:03.980
Or maybe you prefer this one,
MIT Media Lab or something.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:12.370
Or-- cute.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.105
Or-- this is
everyone's favorite.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.170
Voila.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:17.670
OK.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.380
So then from those
eight letters,

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.040
it's really easy to
extrapolate the whole alphabet.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.540
And so then we said, you can
do everything in that alphabet,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.500
and hurray.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.110
And so see how it
says Mediated Matter?

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.810
That's one of those two
dozen research groups

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.300
they have there.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.640
And Molecular Machines, Opera
of the Future, Social Computing,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.630
Synthetic Neurobiology
, et cetera, et cetera,

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.610
all written in
the same typeface.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.700
And stationery, business cards.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.200
You can have a
square business card.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.190
As long as you're not
going to be practical,

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.689
why not have a
square business card?

00:13:49.689 --> 00:13:52.990
Custom roll tape, posters,
presentation slides.

00:13:56.456 --> 00:13:58.080
So these are just
quick sketches we had

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.371
done to kind of sell this idea.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.150
And you see it becomes like
a pattern in the background.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.554
For some reason, I've got a
designer who just-- I've never

00:14:10.554 --> 00:14:12.970
seen him wearing cufflinks,
but I think he just fantasizes

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.845
this world of important
people who are always

00:14:14.845 --> 00:14:18.595
like mafiosa, kind of like
wearing cufflinks that

00:14:18.595 --> 00:14:19.540
needs logos on them.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.123
And then he has that
piece of base art

00:14:21.123 --> 00:14:23.267
and he knows how to
Photoshop on it, I think.

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:24.350
That lady with the button.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.200
So that was that, right?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.699
OK.

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:32.962
So communicates the name,
flexible and neutral,

00:14:32.962 --> 00:14:34.170
builds on the current symbol.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:40.254
But Nicholas and his is guys
couldn't-- they presented this.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.920
I was never there for
the presentations.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.062
He said, OK, it's up to
us to kind of convince

00:14:44.062 --> 00:14:46.520
all our colleagues, the faculty
and the staff and everyone,

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.850
and get excited about this.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.750
And he couldn't put it over.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.754
They wouldn't accept it
as the right solution.

00:14:53.754 --> 00:14:55.170
I actually think
the thing that he

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.530
saw in it, that crazy thing
where the 11 became nine, just

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.570
somehow is just one of those
cases where it's a square peg,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.910
and the hole is almost
square, but not quite.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.000
And you just think, give me
another hammer, and you go,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.500
bang!

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.916
And it's still-- all you guys
have been in that situation,

00:15:11.916 --> 00:15:12.630
I assume.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.630
And sooner or later you
realize that it just

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.630
isn't going to work.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.270
And they're a wonderful client.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.380
They're just so
great to work with.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.760
They're so trusting
and supportive.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.280
So they said, you know, let us
think about this for a while.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.200
We're just going
to take a pause.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.330
Then about a year later,
they called me back

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.650
and they said, OK.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.270
We want to try again.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.880
And we want to do something
really clear and simple.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.860
Forget about anything
that came before.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.110
What would you do if you
could do anything you wanted?

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.180
To And I actually
dread that question.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.180
You know, I became a
graphic designer, remember,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.310
specifically because I
don't want to do anything.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.851
I want people to come to me and
say, I have a forklift truck.

00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:50.700
Our name is Clark.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.870
What do you got?

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.770
And I say C-L-A, got it!

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.420
But if they say, we
don't have anything.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.190
We have nothing.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:00.930
What do you got?

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.220
I'm like, what do you
mean, what do you got?

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:02.900
What do you got?

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.562
So they said, go for it.

00:16:05.562 --> 00:16:06.270
What do you have?

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.090
So we came up with
this thing instead.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.650
So this was basically what
we presented the second time.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.030
So there's something really
interesting about MIT

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.330
in that it has two
Titanic figures

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.240
in American graphic
design, at least,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.710
this lady Jacqueline Casey
and this lady Muriel Cooper.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.390
Muriel Cooper,
along with Nicholas,

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.420
was one of the
co-founders of Media Lab.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.400
Jacqueline Casey was the lead
graphic designer for decades.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.430
Really remarkable.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.600
Two women in a
over-the-top, high tech,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.540
quintessential American east
coast high tech environment.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.730
And they basically
defined the way

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.710
that MIT looked for decades,
through the '60s and '70s,

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.330
into the '80s.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.410
Interestingly enough--
usually I ask,

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.790
are there any graphic
designers here, or people

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.140
who know about design at all?

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:54.720
Thank you.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.594
So name some
typefaces, et cetera.

00:16:56.594 --> 00:16:58.260
I'm not going to get
too deep into that.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.720
But Jackie Casey, as
much as anyone else,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.720
introduced Helvetica
to the United States.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.390
Other people get
the credit for it.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.444
She actually played
a big role in it.

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:09.319
Here's some of the
posters she was doing back

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.510
in the '60s and '70s.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.690
Very influenced by
European design.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:16.030
These are really
visionary, cool things.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.900
Muriel Cooper,
this is early stuff

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.390
she did about manipulating
type and data in 3D space,

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.710
that she really made the
reputation of her students

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.160
and the early days of
the Media Lab based on.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.520
And so they're both brilliant,
brilliant designers.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.540
And note that thing there.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.690
That was by Muriel Cooper.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.180
She did that in the early '60s.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.350
If you don't know it, I
bet it's in here somewhere.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:44.520
That's the mark for MIT Press.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.320
She did that, I think,
in '62, I believe.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.920
And imagine how hard
this was to sell in '62.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.920
I will now explain to you
why this says MIT Press.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.870
M-I-T-P. But it also looks
like books on a shelf.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.400
Also, it looks kind of
digital in some vague way.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.510
And there are sketches
showing, OK, I'll

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.330
put a dot there, cross
that, close that up.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.080
Are you happy now?

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.636
But luckily she talked them
into doing something abstract.

00:18:10.636 --> 00:18:12.510
And this thing has been
around now since '62.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.301
And they said, we want
something like that.

00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:16.750
Not 40,000 versions,
not something that

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.070
has to be blah, blah, blah.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.590
We want something
that's that simple, OK?

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.110
OK.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.350
Easy.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.634
Now I asked what you wanted.

00:18:24.634 --> 00:18:26.050
Now they tell me
what they wanted.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.610
Thanks, guys.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.640
So first we sort of
looked at the way

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.980
you could write the name.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.760
The full name, abbreviated.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.500
Then we looked at--
when we you this sort

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.610
of work, you generate
lots of stuff like this.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:44.740
I think of some of these
are interestingly bad.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.730
Some of them are just bad.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.072
Some of them are boringly
bad or predictably bad.

00:18:49.072 --> 00:18:50.780
I don't know, they're
really problematic.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.410
We did a lot of those things.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:58.220
Then finally, almost
guiltily, I said,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.070
remember that seven
by seven grid we had?

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.790
Maybe there's something
we could do with that.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.240
So we thought, OK, if we
sort of combined a letter

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.960
for-- like M and L with the
words MIT Media Lab-- maybe we

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.190
could start with that thing.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.523
Remember that we were told
not to worry about that thing

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:18.710
any more, but I was
still obsessed with it.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.119
Underneath it, remember is this
49-unit grid, seven by seven.

00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:25.410
So if you-- remember, we
built all these letters off it

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.180
before.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.190
All's we need now are two
letters, an M and an L. There's

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.340
the M, there's the L. Makes
an overall kind of L for lab,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.840
which is what they
call it for sure.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.390
Put MIT Media Lab next to it.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.240
So that seemed
interesting enough.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.910
And then I remember-- I have a
young man working for me named

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.740
Aron Fay who's really great.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.040
And I'd like to take full
credit for everything

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.460
you see right now at
the Design Museum,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.040
and the Designs of
the Year exhibition.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.017
I vaguely remember
saying, you know,

00:19:57.017 --> 00:20:00.440
it would be cool if we used
the same system to do logos

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.380
for all the research
groups at the Media Lab.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.350
And it was Friday.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.080
And I said, have a nice weekend.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.550
Then I walked out.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.150
And I came in on Monday.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.660
Here's those groups.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.930
And Aaron said, I
think I got something.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.890
And what he had was a
logo for each of them,

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.180
built on the same scheme.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.430
See, there's an A and a C
for Affective Computing,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:26.360
a B for Biomechanics, CC, Camera
Culture, CP, Changing Places,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.171
Civic Media, Design Fiction,
Fluid Interfaces, all the way

00:20:29.171 --> 00:20:29.670
through.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.900
And what was cool about this was
they all sort of went together.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.150
But it was like a bunch
of different logos.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.640
They all go together like
the previous schemes.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.164
But this time, each
of those groups

00:20:39.164 --> 00:20:40.830
can grab one of these
things and sort of

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.087
think they've got it made.

00:20:43.087 --> 00:20:45.420
And not only that, but there
are lots of different ways,

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.350
once you've established
the rule set

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.350
for how you make these,
the underlying grid,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.400
you can rotate the things.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.360
Each of these could be a
different version, actually.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.997
So then we did this
little animation for it.

00:21:02.997 --> 00:21:56.510
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.010
Voila.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:57.650
So OK.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.150
So that one worked.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.042
They liked that one.

00:22:01.042 --> 00:22:01.542
Thank you.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.010
The reason it worked
was that I think

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.370
it struck a balance
between a central theme

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.410
and the variations.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.340
The variations were sufficient
to help each of those research

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.670
groups engender a sense
of esprit de corps,

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.850
but the central theme helped
them feel unified that they're

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.320
all about one big idea,
which is the innovation that

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.530
is enabled by the environment
created by the Media Lab

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.890
overall.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.490
And what was really
cool about it--

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:38.142
and I think what people miss
when they focus on G-O-O-G-L-E,

00:22:38.142 --> 00:22:39.850
and the way it's
written in the new logo,

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.490
is that that actually is really
an extension and an embodiment

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.150
of the overall design language,
that material design language

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.916
that you guys have
been developing.

00:22:49.916 --> 00:22:51.290
And I think it
all fits together.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:52.820
And I think when
this sort of thing

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.480
works the best-- I don't know
if Clark Forklift Trucks has

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.270
a whole design language
that goes with that logo--

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.720
but I think you guys definitely
have an integrated design

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.940
language that can help people
answer all kinds of questions,

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.180
not just where do
I put the logo,

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.580
or what does it look like,
but how do I solve this?

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.149
How do I design this little
part of a bigger product?

00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:15.190
How does that product fit
in with something else?

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.920
I think good design can tell
you how things go together

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.850
and give you a characteristic
way to make everything appear.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.410
So what was really
nice about this,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.080
it gave us this kind of like
coherent design language.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.790
I remember when it was
getting ready to launch,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.700
people said-- we did an
alphabet with it, too.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.130
We kind like updated that old
alphabet, did an icon system.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.132
So this is the Maki building.

00:23:38.132 --> 00:23:39.590
See, there's an M
on that elevator,

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.480
an L on that elevator.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.146
When the elevators
are on the same floor

00:23:42.146 --> 00:23:43.810
it sort of makes the logo.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.340
We redid the signage
in their buildings.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.440
So then you can take the
ingredients of the logo

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.660
and upend it to kind of
have an arrow pointing up.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.630
It's very low tech.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.710
It's like a 49-bit
logo, in a way.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.380
But I sort of thought,
the only thing that's

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:05.650
timeless-- this is sort of the
equivalent of doing a cube out

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.090
of marble as a sculpture.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.180
It's not going to change.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.260
It's going to endure.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.727
It can't be made--
it's not going

00:24:11.727 --> 00:24:14.310
to look any more old fashioned
than it looks today, because it

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.815
already looks old fashioned.

00:24:15.815 --> 00:24:18.065
And so they have a lot of
screen-based communications.

00:24:18.065 --> 00:24:21.290
It works lovely as a pattern.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.730
When different labs
share the same area,

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.490
they can put a sign like that.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.550
And then if you ever go--
anyone ever been there?

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:32.650
If you go there, they
sort of-- it's open plan,

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.080
and they have lots of
tours coming through.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.170
And the groups will put up
a sign to say who they are

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.490
and what they do.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.130
Lots of media stuff like this.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.350
Kind of simple way of,
like, being inside the logo,

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.160
if you work there.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:54.010
Boulders, floor plans,
[INAUDIBLE], posters.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.440
Oh, and then when two groups
collaborate on something,

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.200
they can superimpose
their things

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.450
and get some new hybrid thing.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.330
They launched the new
identity at an event

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.290
they had there for
their community

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.300
that they titled
"Deploy," partly,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.200
I think, in honor
of the new logo,

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.060
but because of other
things as well.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.699
And so you see it says
D-E-P-L-O-Y on the back there.

00:25:16.699 --> 00:25:18.740
And so they did a whole
bunch of stuff with that.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.150
All these posters
basically say "Deploy"

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.980
in different ways using
the same language.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.840
Black and white.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.040
Tote bag carried
by a gal wearing

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.420
a black and white striped shirt
in front of a black brick wall.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.190
That's how to do it.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.410
Little button.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.380
Some smaller buttons.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.050
This is not toilet paper.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:45.615
It's packing tape they
actually made, crumpled up.

00:25:45.615 --> 00:25:46.490
We just made that up.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.340
I don't think it's
physically possible to have--

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.940
but they could.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.750
And made with a little
bit of love, too.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.160
So perfect timing.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.140
Thank you.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.925
It's time for questions
now, if you want.

00:25:57.925 --> 00:26:01.464
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:01.464 --> 00:26:02.380
MALE SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.356
So we have at least 10,
15 minutes for questions

00:26:05.356 --> 00:26:06.480
if there are any questions.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.670
You have to shout
out nice and loud,

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.900
and Michael can repeat it.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.858
MICHAEL BIERUT: I will.

00:26:09.858 --> 00:26:10.550
I will.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.215
Yes.

00:26:11.215 --> 00:26:13.590
AUDIENCE: Do you value rejection
in the creative process?

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:14.240
MICHAEL BIERUT: Do I value it?

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.760
I love it.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.130
I really, really love it.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.780
I'm so glad you
asked that question.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.280
OK.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.790
So when I'm
presenting something,

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:27.590
the thing that really scares
me, the thing I really dread--

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.360
and I hate it when
it's happening--

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.007
is, you see how this
is-- I'm not putting

00:26:33.007 --> 00:26:34.090
this on just for you guys.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.540
This is sort of how I get when
I'm presenting design work.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.910
I get sort of progressively
more animated and excited

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.230
because I'm excited about it.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.188
I'm not trying to sell.

00:26:41.188 --> 00:26:44.290
I just really like--like
I said, I like what I do.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.540
And I'll be behaving like this,
and the people I'm talking to

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:55.020
will sort of be like-- and
then at the end, they'll say,

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.126
you know, well, you've certainly
given us a lot to think about.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.270
And then I remember the
first time, the first couple

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.360
times I got really rejected.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.330
And I remember going to one
thing where, literally, it was

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.470
a much smaller group than this.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.690
And I was about as
far as I am from you.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.940
And I was talking.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.130
And I remember this
was the old days,

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.820
and I think I just-- I
didn't even have slides.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.570
I was presenting with
pieces of cardboard,

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.980
like Don Draper in "Mad Men."

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.590
I had boards, right?

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.570
And I probably had 20 boards
with my designs on it.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.450
And about the second one,
everyone in the front row

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.140
started kind of doing body
language, things like this.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.327
And kind of like-- and
then by the third one,

00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:44.910
by the fourth one,
they started, like,

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.531
literally-- I'm this far away.

00:27:47.531 --> 00:27:49.780
Like you and your friend
there would kind of go like--

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.220
And I had one of those weird
out-of-body experiences,

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.694
where I'm still talking, I'm
saying, and then for the logo,

00:28:02.694 --> 00:28:04.610
we decided-- and as I'm
talking, I'm thinking,

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.030
boy-- I had this other dialogue.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.390
It's so odd the way I can
hear my voice inside my head.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.020
How is that?

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.290
Your brain is up here,
and your mouth is there,

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.760
and you hear yourself talking.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.810
And I was having this
kind of like sense

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:17.994
of detachment from reality.

00:28:17.994 --> 00:28:19.410
I was actually
losing track-- then

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.350
I started just getting really
focused on how many boards were

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.330
left, because I just
thought, as long

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.996
as-- it was like
Scheherazade, actually.

00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:27.247
As long as I keep presenting,
everything will be fine.

00:28:27.247 --> 00:28:29.579
And then eventually I have
to say, so what do you think?

00:28:29.579 --> 00:28:31.240
So predictably,
these guys hated it.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.280
And I was young then, and I
didn't know what to do with it.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.821
Now when that happens, I stop
on the third thing, and I say,

00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:38.320
wait.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.210
You guys really don't
like this, do you?

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.640
Tell me why.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.420
And I have to admit, some of
the best meetings I've ever had

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.270
proceeded from that question.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.750
And sometimes I'll be with
some of my younger designers

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:50.250
on my team.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.540
And someone will bring
up some objection

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.000
to what we're showing.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.970
And I think your
natural impulse is

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.120
to rush to the defense of
the thing you're showing,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.870
the poor thing you're
showing, which needs

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.430
to be defended at all costs.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.570
And I don't do that anymore.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.750
I just kind of
like, give me more.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:08.942
Give me more.

00:29:08.942 --> 00:29:10.775
I mean, do you hate it
because of the color?

00:29:10.775 --> 00:29:12.592
Do you hate it because
of the typeface?

00:29:12.592 --> 00:29:14.300
Do you hate it because
of the basic idea?

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.920
Do you hate me?

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.900
And I really will-- and
if one of my designers

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.920
tries to defend the thing,
I'll no, no, wait, wait, wait.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.440
Go on.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.148
And then I'll repeat
it all back to them.

00:29:25.148 --> 00:29:26.910
I'll just make
sure I got it all.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.567
And what's really interesting
is it that every once in a while

00:29:31.567 --> 00:29:33.650
I'll present to someone
who just loves everything,

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.610
and they really do
love everything.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.250
But almost every
time, someone has

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.767
some objection, or
some reservation,

00:29:39.767 --> 00:29:42.100
or some criticism, or something
they just outright hate.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.670
And I just find those things
really much, much more

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.930
interesting than, oh, I love it.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.000
It's so great.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.500
Every once in awhile someone
says, I love it, it's so great.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.410
And that's interesting
enough for me.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.310
I mean, I'll take it.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:59.170
But people rejecting
you is so fascinating.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.760
And in a way, the luckiest
thing we had with this

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.390
was, that first
idea was not right.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.340
It really was not right,
and it was correct

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.830
that it was rejected.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.590
And in a way, if I have
any regrets at all,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.681
it's that I just played
the whole thing through.

00:30:15.681 --> 00:30:17.430
And had they accepted
it, I would've said,

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:21.380
congratulations, enjoy
your new graphic identity,

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.820
knowing that it wasn't
quite right, actually.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.000
So confessing right
before you all,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.210
if I had a shortcoming that
I would do over myself,

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.660
I would've said,
maybe you're right.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.670
This isn't quite right.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.045
I'm not sure it's
going to do it.

00:30:37.045 --> 00:30:39.980
So in a way, I don't reject
myself enough, actually.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.744
I guess I'm just so hungry to
have other people reject me.

00:30:42.744 --> 00:30:44.910
There's some kind of
psychological component to that

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.076
that I'm not eager to explore
right in front of you.

00:30:47.076 --> 00:30:49.052
However, that couch
awaits me, and maybe I'll

00:30:49.052 --> 00:30:51.410
just lay down and
free associate later.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.710
Yeah.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:53.654
There.

00:30:53.654 --> 00:30:55.320
AUDIENCE: How do you
separate objections

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.800
based on personal bias?

00:30:58.702 --> 00:31:00.160
MICHAEL BIERUT: So
the question is,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.300
how do separate objections
based on personal bias

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.470
from ones that are
based on rationales?

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:14.170
Well, sometimes I think
that all objections

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:18.290
are based on personal bias,
because particularly, there's

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:23.090
part of every-- almost
every kind of design

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.080
expression, every
product you guys design,

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.920
every decision that anyone
making anything makes--

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.480
some of decisions are made
because they are answering

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.700
a functional requirement.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.030
And you can actually say,
yes or no, this is right,

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:38.710
that's wrong.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.010
We'll do this just because
this works better than that.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.980
But almost always, there's
still some things left over

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.520
that someone has to decide.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.330
And there is no right or wrong.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:55.510
And people hate to
call that taste.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.410
People hate to call that style.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.150
But I mean, it really
is a dangerous thing,

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.210
and it really is taste.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:09.700
And so when someone
rejects something,

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.199
I sort of will assume it's
some combination of all

00:32:12.199 --> 00:32:12.740
those things.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:18.710
I try not to have a
conversation based on taste just

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.470
because it's so arbitrary.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.200
So I'll try to ease us back
into something that has more

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:31.130
to do with the objective
world that we can all together

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.510
agree on.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.400
You know, you like blue,
but all your competitors

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.580
use blue, so if what you
want is differentiation,

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.480
blue may not be the thing that
gets you differentiated, right?

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.396
On the other hand,
maybe you really

00:32:46.396 --> 00:32:47.520
don't want differentiation.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.570
Maybe you want parity
with all your competitors,

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.080
you want to fit in.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.535
And then people can have--
they're almost relieved

00:32:54.535 --> 00:32:57.680
to have that discussion,
because it makes a lot of people

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.230
nervous to talk about having
an opinion about a color,

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.791
actually.

00:33:00.791 --> 00:33:02.040
So they don't want to do that.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.882
They want to talk
about something

00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:05.090
you can put on a spreadsheet.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.850
So it's a complicated
thing to work through.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.880
And a lot of it is-- in the
back of my head, sometimes,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.140
it's like, you really don't
care one way or the other

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.639
at the end.

00:33:13.639 --> 00:33:15.940
Just let me do it my way,
because I really do care.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.540
And I think there's a lot of
designers who lead with that.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:24.850
And it sort of takes nerve
and kind of arrogance.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.980
And I'm not sure I have
either of those things.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.920
So I usually just kind
of do with a patient,

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.430
kind of conversational one.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.630
Yeah.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.046
AUDIENCE: How do you maintain
your artistic integrity when

00:33:36.046 --> 00:33:37.670
a client is challenging it?

00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:48.380
MICHAEL BIERUT: OK.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.982
So the question is,
how do you maintain

00:33:53.982 --> 00:33:55.440
your artistic
integrity when you're

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.523
working with a client who
might be challenging it?

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.725
There are cliches about
people from the Midwest,

00:34:04.725 --> 00:34:07.707
the Midwestern United States,
like Ohio, where I'm from.

00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:09.290
One of them is that
we're very polite.

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:15.520
And I do think I'm really
polite, and unconfrontational.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.080
So I can count-- I
don't think I've ever

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.090
had a meeting where I actually
stormed out in a huff,

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:25.170
or even raised my voice.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:28.520
I mean, I just don't
do that, not at work.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:35.750
I mean, like watching a sports
event-- I mean, I just--

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.389
I'm very
unconfrontational at work.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:41.320
So this idea that-- and
also, I have to admit,

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.290
I don't value my own
artistic integrity

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.400
that highly at the
end of the day.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.550
I don't, actually.

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:50.530
I mean, someone's asked
me to do a job for them.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.179
And you know, say what you will.

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:58.820
But I put this deck
together for you guys.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.050
I just looked at it now.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.380
But over in Cambridge,
Massachusetts,

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.370
they look at this stuff
all day, every day.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.350
This is their thing.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.470
This isn't my thing,
this is their thing.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.302
And as far as I'm
concerned, it has nothing

00:35:10.302 --> 00:35:11.510
to do that they're paying me.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.260
It has to do with the fact that
I've created a house for them

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.120
to live in.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.720
And it doesn't matter if I
think there's something really,

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:24.120
really fun about having
stairs with no railing

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.730
because I think that
looks really cool.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.174
If my client has
six-year-old twins,

00:35:30.174 --> 00:35:32.690
they're going to fall off the
stairs and kill themselves.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.340
So it doesn't matter,
my artistic integrity.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.940
I have to hold my
nose and say, OK, I

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.440
have to figure out a
way to protect your kids

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.700
on those stairs, right?

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.870
So usually if there's-- artistic
integrity doesn't come into it.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:48.680
I do dislike people
that are horrible

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:54.660
and mean, or are dumb,
horrible, and mean.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.930
If they're dumb and nice,
sometimes that's OK.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:02.200
And I actually like--
smart and mean I actually

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.960
don't mind that much.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.610
It's dumb and mean that
is just intolerable.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:09.420
So again, there's a lot
of people-- I mean, to me,

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.455
I just will quietly walk
away from certain things

00:36:12.455 --> 00:36:14.580
where I can kind of tell
it's not going to go well.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.480
It has much less to do
about me as an artist,

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.190
and just more to do
with, given that you're

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.130
awake X many hours
a day, and you

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:26.282
spend this much of your wife
working, how much of that time

00:36:26.282 --> 00:36:27.740
do you want to
spend really dealing

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.620
with unpleasant people
who, for some reason,

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.960
have the energy to make you do
things you don't want to do?

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.250
I mean, if you're
lucky and you structure

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.290
your life and your business the
right way, you can set it up

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:44.304
so you're in a position
to avoid a lot of that

00:36:44.304 --> 00:36:45.720
without hurting
anyone's feelings.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.590
I've never told anyone,
you're a jerk, and I hate you,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.470
and I don't want to
work with you anymore.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.200
I usually say, it's
not you, it's me.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.760
I'm sorry.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.370
This isn't working, so if
you don't mind-- so I do.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:56.870
Yeah.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.678
Sorry.

00:36:58.678 --> 00:37:01.654
AUDIENCE: My question is
about the relationship

00:37:01.654 --> 00:37:06.614
between technology
and visual identity.

00:37:06.614 --> 00:37:08.610
Does it matter?

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.627
MICHAEL BIERUT: So the
question is-- correct

00:37:12.627 --> 00:37:16.940
me if I'm saying this
wrong-- but we're at a point

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:21.720
now where, potentially,
an institution

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.980
or an organization's
identity could

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.860
be adapted almost infinitely
by not just its users,

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.800
but by its audiences, to
work in different ways.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.999
And is this a good idea?

00:37:33.999 --> 00:37:35.540
Is this what the
future holds for us?

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.710
I actually think the
answer to both those things

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:42.180
is yes and yes.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:49.200
I don't think it's-- sometimes
a situation calls for something

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.080
which is unequivocally
immalleable.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.780
It's not going to change at all.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.790
Other times, it's-- what
I've gotten really interested

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:05.780
in lately is the idea that--
I've noticed that some

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:12.890
of the brands I admire the most,
actually, have very little--

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.177
they've got a real
kernel at the core.

00:38:15.177 --> 00:38:17.260
But it's not that big, and
it's not telling people

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.630
that much what to do.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.330
We have this store over in
the states called Target.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:27.310
You guys-- OK, so Target's
this inexpensive store

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:30.492
that has a reputation for from
being hip and design conscious.

00:38:30.492 --> 00:38:32.200
And one of the genius
things about Target

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.560
is their name is Target.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.060
And back in the
late '60s, they went

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.670
to some really good designers
and said, we need a logo.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.230
And these great designers
came back to them and said,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.220
we got it.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.410
It's a dot with a
circle around it,

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.700
and underneath we're going
to write the word target.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.499
Now if that happened today
on social media-- like,

00:38:49.499 --> 00:38:50.790
my five-year-old could do this.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:53.290
How much do these
people get paid?

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.240
Total fail.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.480
People would say, it's
not clever at all.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:04.610
But because they weren't clever,
they weren't preemptively

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:09.390
clever on behalf of every future
generation, all these great ad

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.160
agencies, all these
great designers, all

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.060
these great marketing people,
all these great business people

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.150
have done all these
really interesting things

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.470
with that basic, simple
piece of geometry.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:22.920
And it was enabled not
because-- what made it possible

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.890
was the simplicity of
that original conception,

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:27.250
and I would almost
say the humility

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:32.060
of the designers who actually
put that forward as the idea.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.271
Very recently I did a logo
where I literally was thinking,

00:39:35.271 --> 00:39:37.020
I really think this
is the right solution.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.260
The only thing wrong
with it is that no one

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.740
will think I'm clever.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.780
It just isn't clever.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.690
There's nothing clever about it.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.500
I'm not even sure
this is that clever.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.350
The music video
makes it look kind

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.260
of ingenious and everything.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.069
But I don't think--
inherently, it just

00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:54.610
is this kind of
workmanlike of thing.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.246
What I like about it,
too, is that I remember,

00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:00.620
there were like
two dozen groups.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.560
If I recall, about
half of them liked

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.700
the logos we did for them.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.390
The other have didn't
like their logos.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.840
And I was like, this is simple.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.370
I mean, it's a 49-square grid.

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:18.430
And once you explain the
rules of the geometry, what's

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:19.050
your idea?

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.660
And they would come back
with things, and we'd say,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.826
that'll work if you do this.

00:40:21.826 --> 00:40:24.840
And then eventually we--
through a very quick series

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.500
of kind of fun
negotiations-- co-designed

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.620
every one of the remaining
logos with the users.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.520
And I don't remember even
which ones those were,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.774
because it was sort of the
system designed it in the end.

00:40:36.774 --> 00:40:38.940
So I think there's lots of
different examples of how

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.148
that'll happen in the future.

00:40:40.148 --> 00:40:44.740
I think that it's partly--
it's certainly enabled

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.750
or accelerated by technology.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:52.680
But in a way, some symbols
of world religions,

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:58.220
or countries, or the peace
sign, simple things that people

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.600
can draw in the sand,
or with a piece of chalk

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.040
on a wall-- in a
way, those things

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.550
are the ultimate
distributed design systems.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:11.090
And it has less to do,
I think-- it has as much

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:12.700
to do with the
inherent simplicity

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.283
of the original conception as
it does with the technology that

00:41:15.283 --> 00:41:15.970
enables it.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:20.075
Is that a long and-- Yeah.

00:41:20.075 --> 00:41:21.741
AUDIENCE: One of the
things I have to do

00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:22.860
is go and find customers.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.820
Now I have three options in
terms of showing them product.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.970
Either I go with
the Google logo,

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.070
or I brand it for
them specifically,

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.620
or I just use a made
up, fictional company.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.369
Which one do you
think resonates best?

00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:37.160
MICHAEL BIERUT: OK.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.240
So some of you guys
must face this problem.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.050
When he goes in to a
potential client or customer,

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.535
he can brand-- you're branding
a prototype or something,

00:41:47.535 --> 00:41:48.160
I imagine, or--

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.660
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.662
Just the stuff that you
could tell the customer

00:41:50.662 --> 00:41:52.620
that they have the ability
to brand themselves.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.110
MICHAEL BIERUT: They have the
ability to brand themselves.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.659
He can put the
Google logo on it,

00:41:55.659 --> 00:41:57.075
he can put their
name on it, or he

00:41:57.075 --> 00:41:59.930
can put, like, Newco or some
other pretend name on it.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:00.920
Which is the best one?

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.990
You know, it's funny.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:10.090
I think if Google
were a startup--

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.740
this is just my opinion, OK?

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.430
I've been here for
all of an hour or two,

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.890
so just take this as you will.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.340
I think if Google were
an unknown startup,

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:26.410
it would have a sort of
requirement to kind of really

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.130
establish its name out there.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:32.010
I think, if anything, Google,
like a lot of other companies,

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.550
sort of has the other problem.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:38.680
They're just seen as being--
I think your customers may

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.246
welcome the fact
that you're kind of,

00:42:41.246 --> 00:42:42.840
oh, you put our logo on it.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:46.950
That seems beneficent, in a way.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:50.870
And I think the only
reason not to do

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.120
it is if their own logo is
so ugly it makes everything

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.050
look terrible, right?

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.590
I assume.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:02.160
Or else if you just kind
of set it in your typeface

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.182
that you use for alphabet
and all that other stuff?

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:06.640
That's another way
you could do it,

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.098
I suppose, just to neutralize
the whole thing a little bit.

00:43:09.098 --> 00:43:12.092
AUDIENCE: So you think the logo
resonates well with customers?

00:43:12.092 --> 00:43:14.472
They don't get sick of
seeing their own logo?

00:43:14.472 --> 00:43:15.430
MICHAEL BIERUT: No, no.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:17.530
Customers don't get sick
of seeing their own logo,

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:18.300
you kidding?

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.050
No, they love seeing
their own logo,

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.360
particularly if they're going
in with the fear of thinking

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.840
that they're giving something
up going into a situation.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.070
To see themselves acknowledged
in that way, I think,

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:30.028
is probably reassuring.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.160
I've done lots-- in that book,
you'll find some examples.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.720
There's some work we did
for Saks Fifth Avenue, where

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.802
basically we were asked to
do a brand new logo for them.

00:43:40.802 --> 00:43:42.010
We couldn't come up with one.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.050
Instead, we found a logo
they had from the early '70s

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:46.720
and did this sort
of remix of it.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.090
I remember going to that
presentation so happy,

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.970
thinking, they can't hate
this because it's already

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:53.572
their logo.

00:43:53.572 --> 00:43:55.030
They can't say, we
don't want that.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.280
You can't say that.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.490
You already have it.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:58.070
Ha ha!

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:01.610
So you know, I think that
people just really-- I mean,

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:05.470
logos are weird
because on one level,

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:09.570
they're this weird piece
of commercial marketing--

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.890
they're a commercial
marketing tool.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.180
On the other hand, people
do take them personally.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.860
It's someone's signature.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.490
It's the flag that
they fight under.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:23.030
It's the sign over the door they
go to five days a week or more.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:26.360
So it does mean a little bit
more to them than just colors

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.934
and shapes, I find.

00:44:28.934 --> 00:44:30.200
MALE SPEAKER: One more.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.760
AUDIENCE: If you
were a client, how

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.450
would you choose a
graphic designer or agency

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:33.991
to work with?

00:44:36.448 --> 00:44:38.722
MICHAEL BIERUT: The question
is, if I was a client,

00:44:38.722 --> 00:44:40.680
how would I choose a
graphic designer or agency

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.221
to work with?

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.640
That's a really good question,
because I actually think that

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.200
that's-- when people are
trying to get good design out

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.430
of a process, I think.

00:44:58.432 --> 00:45:00.140
There's some people
in the movie business

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.110
who sort of say
the same thing, is

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:04.820
once you have the script,
the director, and the cast,

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.765
and maybe the director
of photography, the movie

00:45:07.765 --> 00:45:10.774
is 95% done before
anything starts filming.

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:16.410
It can only get 5%
better or worse,

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.991
because those ingredients
are like setting the tone.

00:45:20.991 --> 00:45:23.240
And I think the same is true
when you hire a designer.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.360
I think you're making the
primary decision about what

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.240
the outcome is going to be just
through that, because once you

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.180
do that, you're already
kind of putting yourself

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.860
on a certain track, whether
you do it knowingly or not.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.050
Just like a lot of
decisions one makes in life.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:42.780
Why did you go to that college?

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.610
What would have happened if
you wouldn't have sat down

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:50.050
at that particular seat at
the cafe next to that guy?

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.610
And then all of a sudden
your life is changed, right?

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:56.300
Thus it also is with choosing
a designer, I suppose.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.760
I mean, I would love to
hire designers all day long.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.470
I think there's so much
good work out there now.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.950
It's all so visible.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:07.840
I just would see things
that you admired,

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.050
and then find out
who's doing them,

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:13.110
and then meet those
people and see

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:14.570
whether you like those people.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:17.740
if you find somebody like
who does work you admire,

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.990
and you're someone they like
and you do work they admire,

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:25.070
that's true love, isn't it?

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:30.680
I've been married
for going on 40 years

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.410
now, or 35 years, actually.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:34.840
Dating the same
girl for 40 years.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.090
So I know all about true love.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.260
Ask me about that sometime.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.030
You had your hand up before.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.930
I just want to have
one more question.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:43.340
AUDIENCE: So my question
was, how much time

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.720
needs to be spent
researching the client,

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.724
understanding their
culture, their DNA?

00:46:47.724 --> 00:46:50.390
MICHAEL BIERUT: I actually think
that's really a critical thing.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:53.180
And I think that
it's something that I

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:58.030
imagine-- it's tough no
matter what the situation is.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:03.720
And people usually assume
that researching a client,

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.860
and understanding
what the situation is,

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:08.450
is really necessary
when that situation is

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:12.280
kind of complicated or exotic,
or no one understands it.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.160
I've actually found that
it's much worse when--

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.160
the more dangerous thing
is when everyone thinks

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.360
they understand it already.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:24.947
It sort of is-- one thing
that's nice about designing for,

00:47:24.947 --> 00:47:26.780
like, the Media Lab,
what I just showed you,

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.760
is that what they do seems
complicated and mysterious.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.880
But everyone-- for
instance, I think

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.800
a lot of the reaction that
came out about the Google logo

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.174
had to do with,
everyone thinks they

00:47:39.174 --> 00:47:41.090
know everything there
is to know about Google,

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:45.820
because they're on your
site all day every day.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.319
And what else is there to know?

00:47:49.319 --> 00:47:50.360
They think they know you.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.110
They wouldn't presume to
know that much about a lot

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:54.402
of other entities in the world.

00:47:54.402 --> 00:47:55.943
But they think they
know you already.

00:47:55.943 --> 00:47:57.340
And I think that
that's actually,

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.550
from a designer's point of
view, much more dangerous.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.090
I think it's because you
assume you know it all already.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:06.260
And the questions always
are, what don't we know?

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.967
What do we know today that
isn't going to be true tomorrow?

00:48:08.967 --> 00:48:11.050
What do we anticipate is
going to happen tomorrow?

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.496
What do we have to put in place
for the thing that's going

00:48:13.496 --> 00:48:15.190
to happen five years from now?

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:18.260
So I think understanding
those sort of factors.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:22.030
And I think, just
as importantly,

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.820
getting a sense overall of
what the culture is like,

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.660
and what the spirit
of the place is like.

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.527
Those are really fundamental
to both establishing

00:48:30.527 --> 00:48:32.860
the kind of rapport that makes
for a fun design process,

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.320
and for ultimately coming
out with a good solution.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.990
And it's true for a
really big organization.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.780
It's true for a
really small one.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.190
Well, thank you so much.
