00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.204
And, uh... now it's time
to play Is This News?

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:06.173
Is This News?

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.478
There's this form of attention
policing on social media

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.081
where people get upset about
a news site publishing a story

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.316
they don't find newsworthy,
and they handle their outrage

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.719
in the most
productive way possible:

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.654
by whimpering,
bewildered, into the void,

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.289
"How or why is this news?"

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.225
So I'm gonna show you a tweet of
someone crying out in the dark

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.394
about a story they have deemed
unfit for publication,

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.696
and for 250 points I want you
to explain to them

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.466
why it is in fact newsworthy.
First up,

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.269
"A water main break
is the lead story on the news.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:37.204
One person is without water."

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:40.207
@AmericasBarbie asks,
"Why is this news?"

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.242
-Ron Funches.
-Uh, because it was Ariel

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.944
from <i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:47.047
Oh! Yeah, that's
really important.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.284
That's really important.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:51.685
Jordan.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.153
Uh, because that person is Jesus

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.821
and he has a wine tasting
this afternoon.

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:57.024
Yes, points.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.592
Wait a minute...
Oh, I'm a little...

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.893
I'm sorry, I didn't...

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:02.229
You have to bring your own wine
to the wine tasting?

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.697
-Yeah. -Okay.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.766
He's a giver, all right?
He doesn't want to take.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.001
Hey, guys, I brought
my own wine. Oh, Jesus,

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.403
-you're the best.
-I am.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.104
Oh, great.
Next up,

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:12.606
"Jeremy Corbyn
won't name his cat

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.409
and instead
simply calls it 'the cat'."

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.912
@SuneiaO_o says,
"Why is this news?" Ron.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.881
Uh, because that's a dog, Chris.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.920
Points.
Mike Yard.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:30.457
Uh, because he named his son Son
and his daughter Lady Son.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.061
Yeah, points.
Points.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.362
Easy to remember.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.231
Next up, "Kylie Jenner is down

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.499
to get hit in the face
with a hot dog."

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.035
-@emmaenders asks,
"Why is this news? -(man whoops)

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.606
Don't "woo" that.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.242
I know why you're "woo"ing that,
and that's not okay.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.417
I brought a hot dog...
Put the hot dog away!

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.219
Ron.

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:01.455
Why is this news?
It... Because it means

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.223
she reads my letters, Chris.

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:06.093
Yes, points.
Points.

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.162
Aah!

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:10.464
Jordan.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:12.332
Uh, because she has to find
something to do

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:13.767
that her sisters
haven't already done.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.736
Yeah, points.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.608
Points.

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.610
Next, you guys,
uh, there's a cat

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:26.914
who looks like Adam Driver
that got adopted. Uh...

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:30.551
-YARD: That's so weird.
-Yeah, dude.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.352
That's so crazy.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:36.123
Wow.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.058
That's amazing.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:41.061
I... I don't even know why we
have to answer why this is news.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.329
That's (bleep)...

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.064
YARD:
It's totally news.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.666
Why is this news, Ron Funches?

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.835
Uh, because that cat
killed Han Solo.

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.804
All right, points.
Points.

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:52.906
Finally, Mexican
drug lord El Chapo

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.908
had 'testicle implant
for erectile dysfunction'

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.176
while on the run.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.078
@ogoeric asks,
while laughing and crying,

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.781
"this is news because?"
Jordan.

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.916
Well, because I thought
I was donating my testicle

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.520
to a ball-less orphan.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.488
Uh...

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.728
It hurts so much to see it
in front of me like that.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.832
Uh, points. Mike.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:21.134
Because Mexican doctors
are so skilled

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:22.836
that they can perform surgery
while the patient

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.936
-is still running.
-Yeah, points.
