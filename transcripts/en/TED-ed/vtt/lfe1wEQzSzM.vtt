00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:11.617
Where did Russia come from,

00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:13.160
why is it so big,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.888
and what are the differences 
between it and its neighbors?

00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:20.393
The answers lie in an epic story
of seafaring warriors,

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:22.612
nomadic invaders,

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:28.525
and the rise and fall of a medieval state
known as Kievan Rus.

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:29.769
In the first millennium,

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.230
a large group of tribes spread through
the dense woodlands of Eastern Europe.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.866
Because they had no writing system,

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:40.915
much of what we know about them
comes from three main sources:

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.297
archaeological evidence,

00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:47.423
accounts from literate scholars 
of the Roman Empire and the Middle East,

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:51.504
and, lastly, an epic history called 
the Primary Chronicle

00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:55.938
compiled in the 12th century 
by a monk named Nestor.

00:00:55.938 --> 00:01:00.271
What they tell us is that these tribes
who shared a common Slavic language

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.117
and polytheistic religion

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:08.002
had by the 7th century split into
western, southern and eastern branches,

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.270
the latter stretching from 
the Dniester River

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.550
to the Volga and the Baltic Sea.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.913
As Nestor's story goes, after years of
subjugation by Vikings from the north,

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:21.514
who, by the way, did not wear 
horned helmets in battle,

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:26.778
the region's tribes revolted
and drove back the Northmen,

00:01:26.778 --> 00:01:30.177
but left to their own devices, 
they turned on each other.

00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:32.980
Such chaos ensued that, ironically,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.276
the tribes reached out to the foreigners
they had just expelled,

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:40.456
inviting them to return 
and establish order.

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:46.397
The Vikings accepted, sending a prince
named Rurik and his two brothers to rule.

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:50.480
With Rurik's son, Oleg, 
expanding his realm into the south,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.667
and moving the capitol to Kiev,

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:55.300
a former outpost of the Khazar Empire,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.735
the Kievan Rus was born,

00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:03.190
"Rus" most likely deriving from 
an old Norse word for "the men who row."

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.530
The new princedom had complex relations
with its neighbors,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.109
alternating between alliance and warfare
with the Khazar and Byzantine Empires,

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.255
as well as neighboring tribes.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:16.987
Religion played an important 
role in politics,

00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:19.750
and as the legend goes, in 987,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.442
the Rus prince Vladamir I decided
it was time to abandon Slavic paganism,

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:29.357
and sent emissaries 
to explore neighboring faiths.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.932
Put off by Islam's prohibition on alcohol

00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:34.918
and Judaism's expulsion 
from its holy land,

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:37.901
the ruler settled on Orthodox Christianity

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:42.039
after hearing odd accounts 
of its ceremonies.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.894
With Vladimir's conversion and marriage
to the Byzantine emperor's sister,

00:02:45.894 --> 00:02:48.779
as well as continued trade 
along the Volga route,

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:52.570
the relationship between 
the two civilizations deepened.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.333
Byzantine missionaries created an alphabet
for Slavic languages

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.907
based on a modified Greek script

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:03.845
while Rus Viking warriors served as the
Byzantine Emperor's elite guard.

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:05.355
For several generations,

00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:09.883
the Kievan Rus flourished
from its rich resources and trade.

00:03:09.883 --> 00:03:13.380
Its noblemen and noblewomen married
prominent European rulers,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.239
while residents of some cities 
enjoyed great culture,

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.277
literacy, and even democratic freedoms 
uncommon for the time.

00:03:21.277 --> 00:03:23.556
But nothing lasts forever.

00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:28.796
Fratricidal disputes over succession
began to erode central power

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:34.696
as increasingly independent cities
ruled by rival princes vied for control.

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:37.487
The Fourth Crusade 
and decline of Constantinople

00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:41.723
devastated the trade integral 
to Rus wealth and power,

00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:45.288
while Teutonic crusaders 
threatened northern territories.

00:03:45.288 --> 00:03:48.965
The final blow, however, would 
come from the east.

00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:51.038
Consumed by their squabbles,

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:53.903
Rus princes paid little attention 
to the rumors

00:03:53.903 --> 00:03:56.410
of a mysterious unstoppable hoard

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.606
until 1237, when 35,000 mounted 
archers led by Batu Khan

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:05.914
swept through the Rus cities,

00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:10.515
sacking Kiev before continuing 
on to Hungary and Poland.

00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:15.237
The age of Kievan Rus had come to an end,
its people now divided.

00:04:15.237 --> 00:04:17.870
In the east, which remained 
under Mongol rule,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.535
a remote trading post, known as Moscow,

00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:23.973
would grow to challenge 
the power of the Khans,

00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:26.253
conquering parts 
of their fragmenting empire,

00:04:26.253 --> 00:04:28.794
and, in many ways, succeeding it.

00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:31.587
As it absorbed other 
eastern Rus territories,

00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:36.023
it reclaimed the old name 
in its Greek form, Ruscia.

00:04:36.023 --> 00:04:39.871
Meanwhile, the western regions
whose leaders had avoided destruction

00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:42.949
through political maneuvering 
until the hoard withdrew

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.467
came under the influence of Poland
and Lithuania.

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:47.806
For the next few centuries,

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:49.666
the former lands of Kievan Rus

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:51.642
populated by Slavs,

00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:53.232
ruled by Vikings,

00:04:53.232 --> 00:04:54.488
taught by Greeks,

00:04:54.488 --> 00:04:56.295
and split by Mongols

00:04:56.295 --> 00:05:00.568
would develop differences in society,
culture and language

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:02.456
that remain to the present day.
