Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, this is jad you're about to get an episode in a couple seconds, but first a quick curtain pole. Okay, so some of the episodes that we put out on radio lab are, I don't want to see easy, but like relatively contained. You have a couple producers working for a few months on a story. More often though we get into situations like, like the story that we're going to share with you today, just one from lots of Nasr where behind the scenes you had four producers working for nearly a year solid or take a story like rhino hunter or the gondolier just a few months back. Those stories took multiple years to report and produce and they involved a level of production that was basically on par with an indie movie. Like that's how ambitious we're trying to be in the cost. Oh, let's talk about costs. When you add it all up and I'm talking the reporting hours of producing hours, fact checking, digging through archives, getting people on planes, the equipment, all of it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       For some of these bigger episodes, it can sometimes get north of a hundred grand. Freaks me out to say that, but it's actually true and yet shows up in your feed for free, which is great as it should be. Here's the rub of all the millions of people who have Radiolab in their feed and we asked them all to give cause we are listener supported and I'm proud of that only 0.72% of the people who listen actually give money actually raise their hand and say I'm in 0.72 we're not even at one whole cookie so that's what I want to change right now. My challenge to you guys listening is can we get this to 1% just 1% what that means. What that means is $8 a month, $8 a month. That amount will keep this thing that we're all a part of healthy and growing like are you in?

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       Are you down? I'm talking to you listening right now. Are you in? If you are, go to radio lab.org/donate or text the word give to the number seven zero one zero one again, that's the word. Give to the number seven zero one zero one if you do it now, add an incentive. We'll send you a pair of noise canceling headphones. It's just our way of saying thanks for joining in because there's no way around this partnership. We are listener supported, not for profit. Radio lab happens when you happen 1% we can do it. Just a quick note. This story, uh, contains some profanities here and there, like even there a couple. So just know

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       that before we get going. [inaudible] wait, you're listening. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       you are listening to radio lab radio from w n y s hey, hey. Hey, I'm John Abu [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today we are going to start. Okay, so let's start with our producer. Lots of Nassar. Yeah, well let's just, let's just go back to San Francisco on a particular day at a particular time and a particular woman. Hello. Hi, is this Sarah Jane? Yes, it is woman named Sarah Jane Moore. Sarah Jane. Okay. So does the San Francisco, the particular date was September 22nd, the particular time 1975 it's a Monday morning. It. Was it a nice day? Oh yeah. I don't remember anything different, so I assume it was a nice day marriage. Sure, sure. I was kind of, you know, in my own head. I remember. So Sarah Jane on this Monday morning, she wakes up early, drops her nine-year-old off at school, runs a few errands, then she drives downtown to this, this big fancy hotel. What was the name of the hotel?

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       Uh, this, I think it's the Saint Francis, isn't it? I'm 87 years old. Don't expect me to remember little details like that. Okay. All right. Fair enough. Yeah. Yeah. But at any rate, you know, I parked in the parking garage across right across from the hotel as a park, but there's a parking garage underneath, walked over and walked across the street that was, there were sidewalks on both sides of the street. There were people on both sidewalks. She joins the crowd across the street from the hotel. It was very crowded. A couple of thousand people. It's like, it's like a big scene and there was a barrier, a rope barrier, right to keeping us back on the sidewalk. And my plan had always been to be back in the crown. Um, you know, and I was dressed like every other middle age one that was there. What were you, do you remember what you were wearing?

Speaker 2:          00:04:56       I mean I, I, I'm sure there's, uh, oh, there are pictures of it. Yes. I was wearing, I was wearing slacks. That was, that was at the beginning of when it was natural for women to wear slacks. I had a coat on and I was carrying a purse and I went back into the middle of the crowd cause I hadn't planned to do anyway. I thought a man come up against me and socialize as I was in that day and time, I spun around a slap his face cause she sees this guy, they're big, strong guy, blonde hair. Look at him and realize that it was current crowd pressure, that he had not done anything out of, out of ordinary that [inaudible]. So I turned back around and uh, went on about my business. Uh, I was then pushed up. The crowd pressure was such, I tried to stay back in the crowd, but I got pushed up almost onto the ropes in the front right up on the curb of the sidewalk. That's right. I had not planned to be, uh, and, and he apparently was still right behind me, so maybe he was pushed out by the crowd also. And so Sarah Jane is just crammed into this crowd and she's just standing there and were you, were you nervous? Oh No. Huh. You set out to do something and I was just going about and doing what I had set out to do. So she waits and she waits and an hour goes by and two and three and then finally

Speaker 4:          00:06:16       [inaudible] out of the hotel comes none other than the [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       president of the United States, Gerald Ford, and he has police and secret service and they're all coming. They're walking out of the hotel to get in his car, which was parked there on the street, but he sees the crowd. Sarah Jane actually says he looks directly at her and he waves you waves to the crowd and everyone starts applauding. And cheering. Now, right at that moment, Sarah Jane reaches her right hand into her purse and pulled the gun out of my purse, a 38 caliber revolver. She cocks it and then she takes aim right at Gerald Ford's head.

Speaker 5:          00:07:02       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:07:02       and then

Speaker 5:          00:07:10       [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:07:11       Mr Freud did not fall. The bullet flies a few feet to the right of Ford chips. The wall behind him, Ford freezes in place. Sarah Jean never planned to take a second shot. No, she's just still standing there with my hands still in the air, holding the gun, looking over the smoking barrel of the gun and she's got enough time if she wants it. But before she can take that second shot, the blonde man behind her lunges at her, grabs her gun arm, pulls it down and deflects it for just that crucial second that these police officers nearby need to get to her. They tackle her, they take her gun and they pin her to the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       So I couldn't move. And by that point the secret service has whisked off the president into the limousine and I was immediately picked up and carried across the street into the hotel, arrested and eventually, uh, she went to prison and she served 32 years in prison. Huh. Uh, and then, and then after that was released on parole and then we talk to her, we a that prepared to be told the uh, first person narrative from the perspective of someone who's about to assassinate the president. That was not what I was expecting. I was hoping that, um, wait, can you explain though why it is she decided to shoot the guy? Yeah. Why? Why did you shoot? Well, well, surgeons never fully explained that. And in fact, when, when I asked her, well, this is not, she was like, I'm not going there. This is not an interview about what was driving me or about what I did or why I did it. This is an interview about Mr Sippel simple. Yeah. Oliver sipple, he's the random blonde guy who just happened to be standing next to Sarah Jane Moore that day. The guy who grabbed her arm. And Save the president's life. And he paid dearly for that. I actually called up Sarah Jane and had her tell that whole story because I was actually interested in what happened to all of her Sippel after that because had he not reached down and, and put his hand on my arm, none of this would have happened to him.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       Wait, what happened to them? So all of our civil actually died in 1989 but, um, before we get to the story, I just want to give you a picture of the guy. So, uh, just a Google search, Oliver sipple Ford or something. Wait. Okay. Wait, I see the picture. I say, look, this is a muscular guy, kind of blonde hair. He's a, he's a, he's a, um, he's a handsome guy. Yeah, he's hilarious. He's a little bit, James Dean and Marlon Brando had a baby, kind of, he feels like an all American. He feels all American. There's something all American about him. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. We're bringing in another all-american for this story. Uh, Daniel Looser editor at Oxford University press. Um, and a few years ago, I was like, probably more than five years ago, I wrote a, an article, uh, about Oliver sipple. But anyway, to get back on track, September 22nd, 1975, Sarah Jane Moore fires that shot.

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       Oliver sipple grabs her arm, the police wrestled more to the ground and then the police actually grab all of her to pull them inside the hotel to question him. Cause there's initially some confusion about what he was doing there and some thought that, you know, he might have been a suspect and so he's in this hotel trying to light a cigarette, but he just couldn't do it because he was shaking so hard. It turns out Oliver had served two very rough tours in Vietnam, loud noises, which would make him very unhappy. Um, I think this is the sort of thing we might call post traumatic stress disorder now. But when eventually all of her started to come down, the secret service were like, what are you even doing here? It was Kinda hard for him to answer because it's like he didn't even really know.

Speaker 2:          00:10:58       It was just like, well, I don't know. I was taking a walk and I just bumped into this huge crowd of people asked what was going on. People are like, oh, like Gerald Ford is going to be here, you know, the president is going to be here. So he said he thought I might as well see him. And then he was standing there for a couple hours until he saw a flash of metal, realized it was a gun, reacted quickly, instinctively. And then you guys all pulled me in here. That's how we came to be here. So he's questioned for three hours. He goes home, home to his fourth floor, walk up and there's a reporter there waiting for him. But he, he just wants to sort of be left alone. And he told this reporter, um, quote, I'm a coward. I don't know why I did it. It was the thing to do at the time. And then even after that, he just keeps getting phone calls from reporters and some of them learned that he was a marine. And so they would ask them questions like, Oh, was it your, you know, was it your training? Is that why you did this heroic thing? But he said like, Oh, you know, listen, don't mention any of that stuff about the marines. You know, like, let's keep that under wraps. Quote. I'm no hero or nothing. But

Speaker 4:          00:12:07       the next day, yesterday in San Francisco, a shot fired all of her story shot across the country, aimed afflicted by an ex marine and be up. And I'm better on named Oliver's simple. He's names on television, that marine, all of simple, the front page of newspapers, where's there's headlines like x marine deflects weapon as woman shoots. That's the La Times Chicago Tribune hero tells how we deflected woman's arm. And so despite his best efforts, Oliver becomes a national hero for a day and it appears that he sort of thought that would be it. Maybe his friends would give him a pat on the back, buy him a couple of rounds, and then, you know, over the next couple of days that all sort of like rippled out of control because that very same day that all over it was being painted as a hero. This guy named Herb Kane,

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       the long time San Francisco Columnists walked into his office and on his answering machine were two messages saying, Hey, that guy Oliver sipple a hero saved the president's life

Speaker 7:          00:13:07       is gay. Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       Was He, was he out? Well, he was sort of out and sort of not. What does that mean? Well, to explain, you've got to understand this particular time and place. So let's just, you know, take a magic carpet ride, close your eyes and let the sound take

Speaker 8:          00:13:29       your wet city has emerged where homosexuality is not only tolerated but it's dry, sometimes labeled with a flying captain, the Queen Study of the wet. So San Francisco is a great day. It's the gay day happy, happy day was one of the first cities in America to have a gay pride parade. And in the 70s, a wonderful boys go to bed with boys and girls, got to bed with girls and for gay people. San Francisco was like this shelter from the storm. Many of us were immigrants from somewhere. This is Ken Maley, Longtime San Francisco resident

Speaker 4:          00:14:03       gay activist who at the age of 19, uh, came to San Francisco from Kansas,

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       from Kansas because what the west offered was the ethereal promise, if you will, of reinvention. You could cross a line in which your past stayed behind you. It was a place where you could be out, but to the people you left behind, you could still be in. So, uh, until for all of her, you know, he came from Michigan, from a working class family. Uh, he had a lot of brothers and sisters. I think he was one of eight children until after the war. When he got his San Francisco, he actually started going by the name of Billy Billy, Billy sipple. And he was perfectly open about his sexual orientation and would tell anybody who asked that he was a gay man, but you know, he never told his family. And so all of her lived like a lot of gay people at the

Speaker 9:          00:14:52       time. This double life. Yeah. And do we know that this is the reason why civic unity of San Francisco or was there a differential because Harvey milk was there, the Harvey milk, you know, famous gay activists, San Francisco politician.

Speaker 8:          00:15:05       He was friends with Harvey Milk, The New Yorker, an immigrant from New York.

Speaker 9:          00:15:09       Turns out Oliver had actually met Harvey a decade earlier in New York, and I just want to mention this because I think it's so cool at different points in time, they actually dated the same guy who was the inspiration for sugar plum fairy sugar there he came and hit the streets in Lou Reed's walk on the wild side. Look at the silver Udon and please the, it's just a fun fact, just a fun fact. That's it. But I'm all over in Harvey. They were pretty good friends. They corresponded, stayed in touch when they lived in different places in the country. Actually, Harvey even loaned all of her money sometimes because all of her didn't have a job. He collected disability from his time in the marines. But anyway,

Speaker 8:          00:15:46       by the beginning of the seventies when Oliver got to San Francisco, reconnected with his old friend, Harvey was uh, shall we say, evolving into a huge figure there, but gay public figure. Ken was actually friends with Harvey worked on one of his campaigns. But this, I'm sorry. No, no, no. And I'm just thinking like one of the things we were talking about on the phone was about sort of the, the kind of two different schools are two different, but the segue to that. Oh, perfect. Okay. Yeah, yeah. This older other, I would say older, but other generation of gay mostly men was that they were content to go to tea with the mayor or public official or some kind of, they would show up to like a rally wearing jackets and ties and like asked for their rights politely. They really weren't, shall we say activists because according to Ken, the activism came when in the late sixties, early seventies you had young gay men and women who came out of the Vietnam War. Protests into the world. Took a look around.

Speaker 10:         00:16:52       The CBS News survey shows that two out of three Americans look upon homosexuals. We've discussed discomfort or fear.

Speaker 8:          00:17:00       Police are still raiding bars.

Speaker 10:         00:17:02       They consider discrimination in jobs and housing.

Speaker 8:          00:17:05       People are still getting beaten.

Speaker 11:         00:17:06       One of them, it said, a clear faggot. We're going to beat the shit out of you. Center to that effect. We're going to kill you

Speaker 8:          00:17:12       both violently and in nonviolence.

Speaker 11:         00:17:15       Got Up in the middle of the street. They knocked me down and started beating me with their hands and their feet, their elbows, uh, tried to muffle my screams.

Speaker 8:          00:17:24       And after a while a body of people get to a point where they just will not take oppression anymore. So in came the activists like Harvey Ponytail, Mustache, he was the banker turned hippy.

Speaker 10:         00:17:40       You know, you're lying, you know, you're changing the statements around. He was very outspoken. I question what is your real motive behind it? Very militant and stopped this phony issue that you know was a phony issue to Harvey saying that I gave her a smile, should have the right to say gay people were living in a half-life opportunity. I am gay. That is a part of society, period. Not being able to be who they were. Every gay person must come out.

Speaker 5:          00:18:12       [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         00:18:12       you must tell your immediate family. You must tell your relatives. You must tell your friends if indeed they are your friends. You must tell your neighbors.

Speaker 12:         00:18:22       You must tell the people you're working with. You must tell the people in the stories you shop in and runs. Once you do, you will build so much better.

Speaker 5:          00:18:40       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:18:40       and so cut back to

Speaker 10:         00:18:43       September 22nd, 1975

Speaker 4:          00:18:46       in the blink of an eye, all of her civil becomes this hero. And that same night, all of his friend Harvey, here's about all this news

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       and kind of senses. Wait, maybe there's an opportunity here. So

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       hmm. He picks up the phone and he calls the columnist. Herb became a very, very well known, well loved gossip columnist and Cain isn't there. So milk leaves a message on his answering machine and he basically says, look, I'm a friend of all of our symbols. I've known him for years. All of our Sippel worked on my campaign for supervisor. So basically with, without simple's consent,

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       Harvey out at him milk out at him. But what was Harvey milk thinking that he would do this? Well,

Speaker 10:         00:19:38       for Harvey, I think the stereotypes, the lies, the innuendos of gay people as limp wristed and drag queens and stuff. The distortions. Okay. People are child molesters. Well, here's a true gay hero,

Speaker 4:          00:19:53       a square jawed heroic marine who seemed to be a sort of like regular, like red blooded American. And so Harvey said, and this was written down by his biographer who I'm quoting, it's too good an opportunity for once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that Kaka about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       wasn't there? Somebody said, no, no, no, no. You got to ask the guy for it. You can't just do that. Harvey just did it. Really? Yeah, he just did it. So cane in the next morning, Keene arrived at his office. He listens to the message and Kane tries to call simple, but he can't reach him. But there was another guy who is a gay activist. His name was, uh, the reverend ray brochures. He was the head of what's called what was called the lavender panthers. Um, and he also independently called Herb Kane to say, oh, that guy all over civil. Everyone's talking about on the news. Yay. So you've got two independent sources, both of people who said that they were friends with Sippel and that he was gay. And for Kane, I think this was juicy. This was a juicy thing. Um, and he, uh, was this, let me just like go back and get this. So two days after the assassination attempt, Kane's column comes out.

Speaker 13:         00:21:19       And the way that he wrote it up, this is the precise paragraph. One of the heroes of the day, Oliver, Billy Sippel, the ex marine who grabbed Sarah Jane Moore's arm, just as her gun was fired and thereby may have saved the president's life, was the center of midnight attention at the red lantern, a golden gate avenue bar. He favors Reverend Ray Broshears, head of helping hand center and gay politico, Harvey Milk, who claimed to be amongst simple's close friends, described themselves as proud. Maybe this will help break the stereotype.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       And then that day, this guy named Darryl Lemke,

Speaker 13:         00:21:52       Lemke lem, B k e

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       picks up his issue of the chronicle, sees herb Keynes column, and I reported it to the office, the Office of the Los Angeles Times.

Speaker 13:         00:22:02       I was a reporter for the La Times in San Francisco. And so my office told me good. An interview with Oliver sipple.

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       But really quickly before we get there, we actually managed to find the recording of this very specific interview in the La Times collection at the Huntington Library in Los Angeles. And I think the reason they hung onto it was because it was kind of controversial. So the night that Keynes article comes out, Daryl goes to Oliver's house, Oliver's there,

Speaker 13:         00:22:33       do reporters from the sentinel over there also.

Speaker 11:         00:22:36       I'm just, I don't know

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       that right there is Darryl.

Speaker 11:         00:22:39       He gave me Andrew's favorite. Oh sure.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       So they're all sitting in Oliver's living room and, and what the reporters are all wondering is, have you heard from the president? The president hadn't bothered to thank him at that point,

Speaker 11:         00:22:53       present kind of words, what they call metals and freedom. People for outstanding marks offered. You never had any brought back to the White House weeks ago? Certainly. Would you like to be [inaudible]? Well yeah, I stood in line for three hours to see you

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       and that voice right there, that's Oliver.

Speaker 11:         00:23:13       You didn't have time to meet at that occasion, I don't think. Have you heard from the mayor? Wow. I've heard from number I heard only from the press and porters and uh, reporters in the press and that you have been hard to get ahold of. I only have to dig dignity, but then I'm sure the mayor could find you guys access to these records that know where you are. Can we go on that round? Yeah. Okay. Um, for some reason San Francisco Police Department has now referred to any inquiries about you to the sex crimes and missing persons detail. That's something I think you should know.

Speaker 9:          00:23:59       Something Oliver should know because this is, again, this is at a time when the assumption was that all gay men were just pedophiles. Pervert.

Speaker 11:         00:24:07       I mean, when I said background, this is information that cannot be printed. Well, can I, can [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:24:12       Darryl actually asks if he can call somebody and ask about it.

Speaker 11:         00:24:15       Yeah, well, you J at right? Yeah. Uh, no, I don't want it. Well, you want baby damn there. Any reasons as to why the number is five five, three one three, six, one who was the guy to talk to? [inaudible] Sullivan or Heifer. Now I found out

Speaker 9:          00:24:33       Daryl calls local authorities, but he can't get ahold of anyone.

Speaker 11:         00:24:37       Thanks again. He took the call back around one where I have said nothing to you about that. Do you have any sex crimes on your record? Never had the sex events in my intent. I've never been arrested much of him being drunk a couple times, but I don't think there's no more in the world. Hasn't been dropping. How, what'd you like us to check that out further to sing? If there's more they're getting

Speaker 9:          00:24:57       and then the tape recorder goes off, it comes back on,

Speaker 11:         00:25:01       uh, well who do I call with some authority with the police department

Speaker 9:          00:25:06       and now Oliver's on the phone with the police department.

Speaker 11:         00:25:08       Yeah. Just to check the balance. Yeah. Well money and Jonathan sipple and I'd like to know why I've been turned over to your department. Sex crimes and missing person. This is me. Yes, that's correct sir. Yes sir. I'd like some information. A bunch of press came over. A lot of, bunch of, just three people from the press came over this afternoon and they said they were trying to get some information about me in the police department and I was turned over to a sex and crimes act. What the hell is on a lot about, oh, I see one. Jesus. God. I mean, I said, what the Hell is going on? Okay Guy. I tried to call the mayor's office just now and I tried to call the chief of police office just now. What the Sam Hell is going on? Okay, thanks a lot guy. Yeah, just the opposite. One of the officers that was involved with the assassination of Sasha Nation of Chad is in that department. That's all. That's why it's being churned. Does that make any sense to you? You got me very shook up young man. Well, I was just about to go downtown and whip some ass somewhere. We find out anymore about, you know,

Speaker 9:          00:26:29       now the reason this tape is so controversial is because according to all of her, before the interview began, before the, you know, recorder started rolling. Um, he had said to the reporters from the Sentinel, um, okay, I'm going to talk to you guys about my sexuality. But then he had said to Darryl, I don't want you to write anything about that. I don't, I don't want that in a national paper. Darrell says he doesn't remember that. But then right here in this interview, this thing happens where Daryl says,

Speaker 11:         00:27:00       oh, I'll make one more try on the gay a thing that

Speaker 9:          00:27:04       I'll make one more try on the gay thing.

Speaker 11:         00:27:06       You don't, you don't want to change your mind on it.

Speaker 9:          00:27:09       You don't want to change your mind on that.

Speaker 11:         00:27:11       No. Uh, I just don't want to change your mind that maybe we quote you as saying homosexuality has nothing to do with this. Even calling and saying that, uh, if I were a homosexual, I was not, you can quote me on that. It doesn't make me any less than a man than what I am.

Speaker 5:          00:27:29       Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:27:33       But I think that that has nothing to do with the accurate or right himself. So I don't think you should be pushing for that.

Speaker 5:          00:27:42       Cool.

Speaker 9:          00:27:45       And eventually,

Speaker 11:         00:27:46       hey, that's great. Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:27:49       Interviewing [inaudible]. And Darryl says that when he left that interview, he felt like when it came to all of her sexuality,

Speaker 14:         00:27:56       they didn't want to be quoted.

Speaker 9:          00:27:57       That was it. Like, just don't quote me on it, but still,

Speaker 14:         00:28:00       I was trying to report from all sides of audits. The big side for me was that he was a heroin is president. United States was a very slow on the take and thanking him for saving his life.

Speaker 9:          00:28:12       And Darryl thought that all of her sexuality, the fact that he was gay might have something to do with that because just seven months earlier

Speaker 15:         00:28:19       on March 6th, Sergeant Leonard Method, a bitch disclosed to a supervising officer at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia that he was a homosexual. And one of the stay in the air force,

Speaker 9:          00:28:29       this air force sergeant named Leonard Matlovich who had the purple heart, had the bronze star. He comes out that he's gay and he's kicked out of the air

Speaker 15:         00:28:39       in conversations here, people say that, you know, we're discharging this queer, that queer thrown them out of here for us. I mean, I'm sorry, I just burned up with just am I a coward here and I'm just gonna stand here and never really collect the protection of, uh, my fellow minority grouping and just keeping quiet and my conscious just wouldn't let me do it anymore. I had to come forward and say, no more America.

Speaker 9:          00:29:00       And now you've got this ex marine save the president's life and it's two days later, he still hasn't heard from the president. So for Darryl, even though all of her had said don't make this about my sexuality,

Speaker 14:         00:29:14       I still thought it was an, it was a national story and it was pretty hard to ignore it after a hurricane. It started the ball rolling.

Speaker 9:          00:29:22       So that night after the interview, Darryl calls in his story to the La Times office and he uses this phrase, um, he says that Oliver's an ex marine who was quote, a prominent figure in the gay community,

Speaker 14:         00:29:36       put it down away in the story, but the rewrite guy put it in the lead really and made it the big thing.

Speaker 4:          00:29:43       And so three days after the assassination attempt, the La Times runs the story with the headline. Uh, no call from President Hiro in forge, shooting active among SF gaze

Speaker 14:         00:29:55       and, uh, the La Times at a news service.

Speaker 4:          00:29:59       And so Darrell's story, it goes, I mean, it goes everywhere.

Speaker 15:         00:30:03       Another strange twist to the story

Speaker 4:          00:30:05       headlines are like gay vet or homosexual hero.

Speaker 15:         00:30:09       It's been reported that the experiene who deflected Mrs. Morris shot on Monday, is well known in San Francisco's gay activist circles.

Speaker 4:          00:30:17       And so it was not just running in Los Angeles, it's also running in Chicago. It's running in Dallas, it's running in Indianapolis, and it's running a, you know, of all places in all of our sickles home town in Detroit.

Speaker 14:         00:30:32       I guess what I'm wondering is if you have a guy who says, please don't talk about this, this has nothing to do with what I did yesterday. Shouldn't that play some role in what you decide to write or not to write? Well, no. You know, news news sources are always reluctant to talk. And so a, I guess I took it as my duty to take up that angle, especially as such involved the president of the United States. Right. But, uh, w if you were to do it all over again, would you do anything differently? Uh, I don't know. Uh, I hadn't taken into account maybe, uh, the potential harm saying it. I don't know if I'd do it over again or not.

Speaker 5:          00:31:31       [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         00:31:31       but not able to turn back the clock for something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:31:53       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:31:53       the clock marches forward after the break.

Speaker 5:          00:32:04       [inaudible].

Speaker 16:         00:32:04       My name is Jaz Adam and I'm calling from Los Angeles. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       I just want to remind you that we are at the moment raising money to support the making of radio lab. We did a little math earlier and we figured out that of our listening audience, uh, only 0.72% of our audience actually contributes money to the making of the show and we are listener supported, not for profit radio and podcasts. So we rely on our listeners. So we only got 2.7199999999999998% we're thinking with a little concerted effort, all of us, we can tick that up to 1% can we do it? Can we get to 1% that is the challenge. If you're in, if you're up for this, if you want more stories like the one you're hearing, help us out with a pledge of $8 a month. Just eight bucks a month. Go to radio lab.org/donate or text the word give to the number seven oh one oh one that's the word. Give to the number seven Oh one oh one and thank you. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:33:40       this is Radiolab. We're back with the story of Oliver sipple from reporter producer with lots of Nasr. So the assassination attempt was on Monday and on Thursday sipple and his lawyer call a press conference. Well, I think you all know this. There's all other symbol who shape the president's wife and he has a prepared statement on a subject that's appeared in the press today.

Speaker 17:         00:34:03       Okay. In the past few days I have been asked many questions having to do with my sexual preferences to what I had been asked, whether or not I am gay or homosexual. This is, there is, this is my reply to the line in question. The first reason you are interested in my in me is the fact the woman who tried to shoot the president t, I'm sorry, I'm still nervous. Excuse me.

Speaker 18:         00:34:38       No,

Speaker 8:          00:34:40       this is her handwritten statement and he's having a little difficulty reading it. We xeroxed it in order to get it to you this afternoon. Reason. First reason you were interested in me is the fact that I do.

Speaker 17:         00:34:51       Oh, okay. I couldn't get the words there. We'd go right from whatever. My sexual orientation has nothing at all to do with saving the president's life just as the color of my eyes or my race has nothing to do with what happened in front of the St Francis Hotel on Tuesday. My sex, sexuality, my sexuality is a part of my private life and I have not. I have no edits. No. It has no bearing on my response to the act of a person seeking to take the life of another. I'm first and foremost a human being who enjoys and respects life. I feel that a tradition person toward worth is determined by how he or she responds to the world in which they live. Not on how or what with or with whom a private life is share [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:35:56       you bet. He basically says like, stop. Stop. It's kind of as simple as that. Yeah. But there's something else that happens in the press conference that is, makes the whole thing, I mean so much more personal. And it actually was the very reason that all of her called the press conference in the first place.

Speaker 17:         00:36:14       I want you to know that my mother called me today that she could not walk out of her front door or even go to church because of the pressures she feels because of the press stories concerning my sexual orientation. Naturally, I never participated such interference with my family's relationship, which I, when I said, when I supposedly say the president's life,

Speaker 9:          00:36:45       Oliver would later say that, uh, when he was talking on the phone with his mother, she said to him, I don't want to speak to you ever again. She hung up on him and also hung up. Did you call him uncle? Uncle Oliver? Yes. I called him uncle Oliver. Yup. This is George sipple jr Oliver's nephew. He told me that, uh, most of all of his family stayed in Detroit. Uh, all of his two brothers and his dad worked together at an auto plant there.

Speaker 2:          00:37:16       They all worked for General Motors. And the stories that I've heard is that

Speaker 9:          00:37:20       the day after all over saved the life of President Ford.

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       They walked in and everyone wanted to like buy them a beer, you know, everybody on the factory floor, um, was congratulating them, patting them on the back. You know, your brother's a hero, your son's a hero when, you know, when they would take their, their shift break, this is the old days, right? They'd take a shift break and they'd go to the bar and everybody wanted to like buy them around the drinks. So then the news comes out and whatever date, couple of days later that he's this gay marine and there's teasing on the, on the factory floor teasing and then teasing or teasing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:37:58       [inaudible] yeah. And George says, what happened, his reporters back in Detroit just sorta descended on Oliver's parents

Speaker 2:          00:38:06       to get more of the story. And so they kept knocking on my grand mother's door and she, I guess apparently told them to go away. I guess neighbors were harassing her. She thought the media was harassing her. My grandmother just said, I don't want to deal with it. And so don't, don't come knock on the door, leave us alone. They just wanted it to go away and won't go back to their private lives.

Speaker 9:          00:38:27       Now one of the things that I found actually after talking to George were these interviews done with Oliver's family after the news broke that Oliver was gay and there's just a whole, I just want to read you this one particular passage here. Have you talked to any other members? This is from George F Sippel. Um, who is all of our symbols, brother. Uh, have you talked to any other members of your family since September, 1975 about Oliver? Um, I mentioned it once to my father. Question and what was his response? What did he say? And if you can remember, I was on afternoons then and I had seen him because I had come in early and he mentioned the fact that the next person that even said he had a son named Oliver, he was going to literally break their damn neck. Whoa. So his dad was like, this is from his brother. Talking about his dad's reaction. They're talking to the dad. Yeah, and then so then the brother says, and he told me quite clearly in two letter words, just forget you got a brother and I let him alone. He never

Speaker 17:         00:39:33       or anticipated such interference with my family's relationship, which I, when I said when I supposedly saved the president's life, this is all I have to say on this subject. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. Any questions and go to minister to my lawyer. I like to ask the simple question, what would you, what would you like to see happen? I know. No, I'm just, I'm very set up. I may even have to go see a doctor when this, I'm very emotional. I've got an I. I just, I'm feeling very sad for my family. It's awful. Just off and nothing more to say.

Speaker 9:          00:40:16       Can you tell us the story of the letter? Wow. I wish I would've. I wish I went abroad. I do have it, but I didn't bring it today. The same day is that press conference, which was a three days after the assassination attempt. Gerald Ford actually did write a letter to Oliver Sipple, which was then released publicly. It's a nice letter, its White House Stationery White House envelope. It's basically Ford telling my uncle that, you know, he's thankful to him for this heroic deed. And he signed it. Jerry Ford, which I've been told that Gerald Ford signed different ways. So if he signed Jerry Ford, it meant something. It was like a personal touch. Ah, well there's this other chapter where your uncle says to the president, I guess writes. Yes, we found it. We found a letter. We found a letter in the Gerald Ford Library. It's from your uncle to the president. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:41:16       And I did not, I did not know about that letter. Really. I have the letter right now. So it's the date on into September 30th, 1975 so here's what it says. Uh, dear. Mr President, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. You said it was what it was when? September 30th, 1975 so that would be a couple days after he got the letter from Ford. This was so obviously at this, the, he got my grand mother. Must've hung up on him. Right. Um, and then he wrote the letter. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like cause he could because he couldn't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's really interesting. Yeah. Well, and then stop me anytime if you have thoughts or reactions. [inaudible] dear Mr President, thank you for taking the time to write to me in view of some of the events since the unfortunate attempt on your life on Monday, September 22nd I really appreciate your publicly thanking me.

Speaker 9:          00:42:09       As you probably know, there have been a number of stories concerning my personal sexual orientation in the news media. These stories have caused great anguish to my parents and to the rest of my family. I am sure my mother hung up on me when I first called her after these stories began to be published. I know you are concerned with very many matters which are too important and pressing for you to be concerned with the details of my private life. However, the unexpected and glaring publicity which has been given to my private life has very seriously disrupted my family relationships. Mr President, it is a very hard thing to have your mother and family not want to have any contact with you. I know that your schedule is heavily occupied, but I respectfully request that you take the time to see my family or at least call my family. The telephone number is three one, three, eight zero. I love my family and I do not want to be separated from their love and companionship. Your help will be gratefully appreciated respectfully, all over w simple.

Speaker 5:          00:43:18       Well that's sad.

Speaker 9:          00:43:30       Saturday to think that nothing came of it,

Speaker 5:          00:43:36       you know? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 19:         00:44:00       [inaudible] we

Speaker 9:          00:44:00       tried really hard to find out if Ford ever made that call. Uh, the, the archivists at the Ford Library, they, uh, went through his call logs and there was no evidence that he ever made that call. And then we talked to George Jr and he talked to, you know, everybody in his family and they don't remember it either. Anyway, you can't say for sure, but as far as we can tell, uh, that call never happened. But we did find out that the same day that all of her sent that letter of back to Ford, he and his lawyer filed a $15 million lawsuit against the press. Really? So I'm saying saying what? That the newspapers when they publicized that he was gay without his consent, they violated his privacy.

Speaker 2:          00:44:47       Okay. Walking out of civic center, Burt onto civic center in San Francisco.

Speaker 9:          00:44:53       It's just, it's one of those cases where it pulls your head in one direction and it pulls your heart in the exact opposite direction. And so, so we wanted to get into the legal case files and we could not find them. We looked and looked and looked and then we found them. You found them? We found. Where'd you find them?

Speaker 2:          00:45:10       Uh, so the clerk's office is, I guess not surprisingly right off city hall.

Speaker 9:          00:45:15       They were at this court in San Francisco. And so we recruited this guy, this researcher, historian of the Gay Movement in San Francisco. A great name, Joey Plaster. And He, okay, so I'm going to need your Id. Okay. Went and got the files for us. And then when we found them, it turned out the were like house and thousands upon thousands of pages.

Speaker 2:          00:45:35       And is that everything? That's everything. Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:45:38       So the issue, you know, it's, it's a very fundamental issue for those of us in journalism and to help us make sense of the arguments, you know, lurking in those pages. What is privacy and what is invasion of privacy? We talked to Dan morain editorial page editor of the Sacramento Bee. He actually first heard about the case in journalism school and also wrote about all of our simple way back in the 1980s. So anyway, okay. So here's the first page of the file. The lawsuit was against the chronicle,

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       the cases, Oliver w sipple plaintiff versus the Chronicle Publishing Company.

Speaker 9:          00:46:11       It was against the La Times, uh, de Moines Register, the Chicago Sun Times the Denver Post, the Indianapolis Star, and the San Antonio Express. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:46:18       Let's see. So this is a, the deposition of all of her simple. Let's see.

Speaker 9:          00:46:25       So one of the arguments that the lawyers for the newspapers were making is that all of her sexuality was not actually private

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       lawyer. Were there any people that you knew in San Francisco's and say September, 1975 who knew that you were homosexual? Simple. Yes. Lawyer. Approximately how many people? Simple. I have no idea. More than 10 yes. More than 50 yes. More than a hundred yes.

Speaker 9:          00:46:50       People in New York who knew he was gay. There were people in Dallas who knew he was gay and it kind of, they settle in the like in the hundreds.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       Did you tell anybody before in September of 1975 that you were homosexual? If I were asked, I am asking you, I don't know what you were asking

Speaker 9:          00:47:06       and they make the argument in newspapers, lawyers that, hey, this was already somewhat public a fact, but his personal business was his personal business. I

Speaker 2:          00:47:17       have never attempted to obtain publicity for the fact that I am gay or predominantly homosexual and my sexual orientation was a private citizen. I had made my home approximately 1,800 miles away from, but

Speaker 13:         00:47:30       my parents and my family so that I could move somewhat freely in the gay community without the fact that my sexual orientation getting back to my parents and family and it goes on,

Speaker 9:          00:47:39       but the newspapers made this other argument that was like, okay, whether or not you're living a double life, whether or not you wanted to or whether or not you had to, there's something here that's bigger than that, that's bigger than you,

Speaker 13:         00:47:49       which was he was a private citizen who thrust himself as anybody would hope they would do. He ran toward, he went toward danger and when he did, he also thrust himself into the public eye.

Speaker 20:         00:48:04       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:48:04       and the journalists, when you're in the public eye, you become something else entirely. You become a public [inaudible].

Speaker 15:         00:48:10       Yesterday in San Francisco, a shot fired

Speaker 9:          00:48:13       when that happened to all of her, he lost his right to privacy.

Speaker 15:         00:48:17       Oh, I'll make one more try on the gay thing,

Speaker 4:          00:48:20       and the newspapers argued when it came to of sexuality. No, it was news at the time. It is was an it all pregnant at times has been my judgment that Mr Sippel, his activities in the gay community are highly significant in newsworthy for two important reasons. First,

Speaker 15:         00:48:36       on March 6th Sergeant Leonard Methadone, a disclosed that he was a homosexual.

Speaker 4:          00:48:40       Sure. So like we said, when Daryl Lemke was writing that article about all of her, you had this big story about the u s air force trying to kick this guy, Leonard Matlovich out because he was gay and Oliver has heard nothing from the president. The President leader said that he, that had nothing to do with all of her being gay, but to people at the time, the suggestion that the president's expression of gratitude to Sippel might've been affected by rumors of simple's activities than the gay community that was new

Speaker 15:         00:49:07       newest secretary. Nothing was asked if that was the reason President Ford has not yet personally thanked him. Second lie, the innuendos

Speaker 4:          00:49:15       simple as public display of here, wisdom and saving the life of the president of the United States

Speaker 15:         00:49:19       distortions. Okay. People with child molesters

Speaker 4:          00:49:22       presented an image that gay people are like everybody else, that they're heroes image, certainly contrary to the stereotype of persons associated with the gay community as weak and UNHEROIC figures, which is to say this is newsworthy, this is

Speaker 9:          00:49:37       worth knowing. And it is something that the whole country wants to know. And, and the value of that is more than the value of, you know, this individual person's privacy. Do they make it that explicitly? I mean, sort of putting it in terms of the public benefit outweighs the private privacy. Yeah. Hmm. Um, so all of this case, it dragged on for nine years. So, uh, from 1975 to 1984. Um, but this is, I'm quoting a judgment. The record shows that the publications were not motivated by Morbid and sensational prying into appellant's private life, but rather were prompted by legitimate political concerns, I. E to dispel the false public opinion that gays were timid, weak, and UNHEROIC figures. And to raise the equally important political question, whether the president of the United States entertained a discriminatory attitude or bias against a minority groups such as homosexuals. So the court tossed Oliver's case out, he lost. He didn't get a dime.

Speaker 13:         00:50:42       I mean if you think about, it is weird that a journalist can just take a person's most private details and then if it feels relevant, like if they can make that argument, they just put it out there. Like if we, if we were to go silent because somebody says don't say that about me then and the government backs him up. It is, if it's meaningful than the person out of which the meaning is being pulled painfully has nothing to say about it. That's just weird to me. It's, it's really hard. I mean I was thinking about this like even sort of on the train coming over here again, Daniel looser and it's like the thing that like makes journalism laws so complicated and the things that make an invasion of privacy discussion so difficult is that like what makes something not an invasion of privacy is not that it's okay. It's that it's politically, you know, relevant. So like the s the fact that the story, the fact that the private details of his life are politically relevant means that it's not an invasion of privacy. You know, it doesn't mean that it isn't rude or that it doesn't hurt. It means that it's an appropriate story to feed out, to publish. But I, but I do think like,

Speaker 9:          00:51:56       why should the journalists be the only ones to decide what is newsworthy? It's not like, why is it that then journalists, you, you just pick up a notepad and a pencil and all of a sudden you have so much more power to say what's sayable then than anybody else?

Speaker 13:         00:52:14       Well, I mean, we have a, this sort of long tradition of that in the United States. I mean like, that's like what the first amendment is. I mean, I dunno, I mean, it's like, yeah, sure. Like, it's like why do journalists get to decide that? Well, like who would you rather have decided? It's not a perfect system, but it's, you know, it kind of works. So Oliver, just like this,

Speaker 9:          00:52:35       this is pretty Sir Tracy Hunt who was in on the interview.

Speaker 13:         00:52:38       Somebody whose life is basically kind of sacrifice to the altar of the first amendment. And it's like sad way. Yes. Um, yeah.

Speaker 19:         00:52:54       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:52:54       yeah, it feels like he was sacrificed from all sides actually. Yeah. It feels like there's this one kind of man in the middle. And then there are all these forces around him, these like these larger than life forces, like the White House. There's the game movement, there's the freedom of the press and, and all these people are, are sort of batting around all these, all these enormous and important abstractions. And then in the middle of it, there's this guy that just, he's trampled by all of them. And so what ends up happening to in the end, well, apparently some people in the gay community during and after the lawsuit felt that he was trying to go back in the closet, so they sort of turn their backs on him. Uh, he surprisingly, he was friends with Harvey milk till, till the end. Like when Harvey Milk was assassinated, all of simple went to his funeral.

Speaker 9:          00:53:50       Um, and he did have one brother, George Sr, who, who stuck by him throughout, but, but his parents did not. Uh, and they never fully accepted the fact that he was gay. And, and two, when his mom died, uh, it, it, it was so bad that, uh, all of our samples, father didn't let him go to the funeral and because he, he sort of, he had so, so few people I guess at the end and because there weren't, you know, a lot of news articles about him and cause a lot of people in the gay community from that time have died. Um, because of the AIDS crisis, uh, it was really hard to find out what happened to all of our civil and those last five years of his life. Um, and the only way we could was because when we were talking to Daniel Looser, he mentioned this interview that he did with this guy named Wayne Friday.

Speaker 9:          00:54:44       He was a friend of Oliver's Wayne Friday was sort of like a, a pillar of the community in San Francisco, like a pillar of the gay community. And then also a sort of political figure and he was a cop and you know, he was, he was, he sort of fingers in every pie, uh, kind of thing. Wayne died last year, but Daniel's still had the transcript of their conversation about all of our simple's last days. And so to absorb that or just sort of speak that we found an actor, uh, the very gifted, uh, Gordon Pinsent and we had him read it for us.

Speaker 5:          00:55:21       Okay.

Speaker 21:         00:55:21       Okay. Let me have a go.

Speaker 5:          00:55:25       Okay.

Speaker 21:         00:55:26       Uh, I, uh, I forget, was it 1975 the Sarah Jane Moore or, Yeah. Then I met him around 73 he was a swamper had a gay bar called the cockpit.

Speaker 5:          00:55:39       Okay.

Speaker 21:         00:55:40       Swan brothers, they cleaned the borrowers at night? No, they set the bar up for the next bartender in the morning. That's what I did today. He did it at two or three different bars. He was always at the bars. I'd see him. We actually became friends because we had discovered we were both from Michigan.

Speaker 5:          00:55:55       Okay.

Speaker 21:         00:55:57       Bill was a good guy. It was just so fucking alcoholic. I mean, he'd get his disability check once a month and he called down one of the bars in the tenderloin where he used to hang out was called Queen Mary's pub. He'd go in there the day he got his check, swear to God he'd, he'd spend his whole fucking check on everybody and he'd get broke the rest of the month. He just couldn't control. And so, and he was a little bit of a Blowhard, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       easy. Get drunk, Tim's loud and need get posted on the bars.

Speaker 21:         00:56:30       I used to drive him home, had an apartment on Van Ness, had a little studio, maybe have a one bedroom on the first floor at about Turk. He'd be drunker than Hell at the barn. I drive him home. So I always knew where he lived. And after this thing with Ford, it really fucked his mind. Simple was a broken guy. After that, the whole thing worked out, the publicity of it all. And the fact that everyone knew he was a Faggot, you know, he said to me a couple of times, I went to the Marine Corps and I got hurt. And now what am I known for, for being a faggot? And I'd say, no, you're not. You're known for saving the president's life. He won't be known for what you did in bed for Christ sake. But he would get drunk and niched. I'd be moaning that I'd sit there in the barn with him and I'd talk to him about it. Hey man, it is what it is. But he was just, he was just down to nothing.

Speaker 5:          00:57:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 21:         00:57:34       this thing happened and had overcame him. It was too much for him to handle. And I think he got to feeling sorry for himself and his family. Just many a night I would sit in the bar with a pill Sippel and he'd cry on your shoulder and you'd say, okay, simple. It's time to go home. And then I drive him home.

Speaker 21:         00:58:08       I remember it was raining, it was pouring fucking rain. Bruce called me at my office over at the DA's office and said, Wayne, will you do a wellbeing check on? Simple for me. And I said, why? And he said, nobody has seen the dude. He hasn't been around for awhile. So we go up there together and it was raining and I'm ringing the bell ringing. The bell rang. He doesn't answer. I noticed on his door there were these little stick and things posted and he had befriended this little old lady who lived next door. They kind of looked after each other and she had left all these notes. Bill, call me, I can't get ahold of you. So I rang the manager's bell and I was a little filler Vietnam guy. I showed him my badge and I said, you gotta let me in. And so he did and the door opened and I knew what was going on. It's the smell. It's a smell. You'll never forget. It's a sickening, sweet smell. Bill was sitting in the chair, he was bloated. He was bloated out real big.

Speaker 5:          00:59:28       Okay.

Speaker 21:         00:59:30       He had a bottle of Jack Daniels sitting there and the television was still on. The coroner told me he'd been dead about 10 days as near as I got fake hair. Got It. I didn't know he was only 47

Speaker 5:          00:59:52       okay.

Speaker 21:         00:59:53       I thought he was older than that. Anyway, I got the guide who opened the door for me and the minute he did, I said close it and then I had to stand there and wait for the car now.

Speaker 5:          01:00:21       No,

Speaker 21:         01:00:22       I remember it was over here at the Campbell, a funeral home on market street and then we buried him out in gold get national cemetery in San Bruno

Speaker 5:          01:00:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 21:         01:00:34       and I remember it was, it was very small.

Speaker 5:          01:00:39       Yeah.

Speaker 21:         01:00:40       Casket wasn't open.

Speaker 21:         01:00:43       The funeral was just, I mean there were more media than anything else. I'd seen him buy drinks from more people than were at that funeral. He could have been buried in Arlington if they'd made an issue out of it. I mean, shit, there he was, this national icon, a gay whatever and [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:01:07       I am
