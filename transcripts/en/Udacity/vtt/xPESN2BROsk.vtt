In a web or mobile product, instead of building a physical prototype,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you need to have a low fidelity app or website available for customer feedback.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What does low fidelity mean?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well that's just kind of my description of you don't need an entire finished website

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but you should at least have a wireframe.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And if you don't have a wireframe, you should at least have a PowerPoint of mockups

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or a flash demo or something so people could see not only what you're describing in words

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but actually could say, "Oh I get it!"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now remember, don't demo that first. Your goal here is to first understand the problem.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I make people sometimes who would like to give demos to leave all that stuff home

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
when you're first having the problem discussion.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But the minute you get into well would something like this solve your problem for a web/mobile app

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you really want to get feedback on a low fidelity app as quickly as possible.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And when we teach this as a class, literally by the second week of the class,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
if you're building a web and mobile app you have to have your site or wireframe up and running

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so people can actually see it and give you feedback.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Later on, you're going to build what I call the high fidelity app

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and that tests your understanding of the solution.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This actually has most of the features. It might not have health files.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The graphics might not be complete but a high fidelity app gives you more resolution

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and we really didn't like that color, the button was in the wrong place, etc.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This helps you avoid building products no one wants,

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and it maximizes the learning per time spent on the product and on customers.
