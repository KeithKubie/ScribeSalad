00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.490
BRAD TEMPLETON: All right,
why don't we go ahead.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.860
Welcome.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.960
This is Authors at Google.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm Brad Templeton from Google
X. What we have today are two

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.770
of the most respected writers
of science fiction,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.670
particularly hard science
fiction, I think, we have in

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.540
the field, Gregory Benford
and Larry Niven.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.960
Both of these men have been
nominated for, and won,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.090
science fiction's top awards,
the Hugo award

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.840
and the Nebula Award.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.550
You've probably read Larry's
books in what's called the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.200
Known Space series, including
works like "Ringworld" and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.910
"Neutron Star." Gregory, I
think, got his first big hit

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.890
with "Timescape," although I
know you had other things.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.760
But that won you the
Nebula Award.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.920
Gregory's also a professor
of physics at UC Irvine.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.970
And he is also now a biotech
entrepreneur, having worked to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.930
found a company called
Genescient, whose goal is to

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.010
stop human beings from
dying like flies.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.850
And he may be able to answer
some questions

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.670
about that, as well.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.870
They have a new book that's just
come out this week called

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.069
"Bowl of Heaven," that we see
on the screen, and they're

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.900
going to talk about that.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.430
And there's many other things in
their careers that I'm sure

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.390
will be interesting to us.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.690
And then we'll have Q&amp;A.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.040
GREGORY BENFORD: Thank you.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.540
LARRY NIVEN: Quite a crowd.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.175
GREGORY BENFORD: Nice crowd.

00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:25.520
See, and they're very orderly
and everything.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.030
This is a talk mostly about--

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.170
of course, what everybody in
the room probably knows--

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.320
about the idea of what were
called Big Dumb Objects.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.020
We'll get to that.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.460
But here's "Ringworld,"
Larry's.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.360
Remember "Ringworld"?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.050
It's been 42 years.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.700
LARRY NIVEN: It has been.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.470
We celebrated the 40th
anniversary by running a

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.085
reprint and a lot
of publicity.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.540
"Ringworld." Let me talk
about the Big Dumb--

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.680
[FEEDBACK]

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.280
LARRY NIVEN: OK.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.140
Trying that again.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.170
Let me talk about the Big
Dumb Object concept.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.289
I like David Gerrold's phrase,
which was the Enormous Big

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.630
Thing, as the plot
line for a story.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.370
It sounds like nothing
happens.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.650
The key to nothing happening was
not our first discovery;

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.470
it was all the marvelous, empty
cities found by Conan

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.775
the Cimmerian and Tarzan
of the Apes.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.590
Empty cities can be explored
without things

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.860
happening all at once.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.570
You can discover what's
going on.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.260
You can find the interesting
things.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.250
You can get attacked
by the interesting

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.120
monsters, one at a time.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.870
You drop Conan the Cimmerian
into New York City, he'll be

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.570
bewildered for a long time.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.820
GREGORY BENFORD: Mostly
by the New Yorkers.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.180
LARRY NIVEN: So I wrote
"Ringworld" as

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.780
nearly emptied of rulers.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.110
Nobody's running it.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.570
People came to be running it
in later volumes, but for

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.920
"Ringworld," you don't even
see who built it.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.650
It's just there, and
you can explore--

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.910
well, with sky cycles
you can explore--

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.820
about one quarter of the
distance across the width, is

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.710
how much got explored
in "Ringworld."

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.980
And that was my point.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.760
It's just too big to look at.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.970
Notice, however, it's 93 million
miles in radius, 600

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.830
million miles in
circumference.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.370
It's the Earth's orbit,
approximately.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.910
And it's entirely filled
by a habitat.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.090
I made it a million miles
across, but that's arbitrary.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.330
You could make it two, or
half, whatever you like.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.410
It's so big that air leaking
over the rim walls, which

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.450
stand 1,000 miles high
at either edge--

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.240
air leaking over the rim walls
doesn't rob you of your

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.810
atmosphere in any decent time.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.780
It can last millions of
years doing that.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.460
GREGORY BENFORD:
Yeah, that's--

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.890
LARRY NIVEN: Sorry.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.280
GREGORY BENFORD: And that's
what makes it dumb.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.160
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.470
Well, it is perhaps
a dumb idea but it

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.440
gives you better visuals.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.620
And I was after the visuals.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.450
GREGORY BENFORD: It's dumb in
the sense of being struck dumb

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.010
in awe at the prospect of even
exploring the thing.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.290
You see, it's too big to cross,
but it's not too big to

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.200
write about.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.050
And the whole point--
next slide--

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.610
is that this book, this whole
idea, descends also from

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.490
something probably all of you
know, the Dyson Sphere idea.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.840
Because Freeman Dyson just said,
look, a really advanced

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.020
civilization will use all the
energy that's getting wasted

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.580
into the night sky
by its star.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.730
And it'll absorb it, and
use it for something.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.430
And then, of course because of
the laws of physics, it'll

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.640
re-radiate it into
the infrared.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.966
So the thing to look for, and
the reason this is published

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:21.200
as a scientific paper, not
just as speculation, is

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.930
unexplained infrared objects
that are very compact

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.180
in the night sky.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.880
By the way, I'll get to a recent
grant given to look for

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.210
exactly that, in a little
bit, at UC Berkeley.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.000
LARRY NIVEN: The point of the
idea is that you can find it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.590
You don't have to wait for
people who want to talk to us.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.560
Super-powered beings who have
been civilized for a billion

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.890
years are not likely to
want to talk to us.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.360
But if they've built Dyson
Spheres, you can find them.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.010
GREGORY BENFORD: The galaxy
might easily be full of

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.810
entities that don't really,
especially want to talk to us.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.080
For example, New Yorkers.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.440
So the whole idea comes also
from later ideas that people

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.420
have manifested.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.220
Like, if it's in the stage of
being built, it's going to

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.270
take awhile to build this.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.590
You could get a Dyson Swarm of
solar-powered satellites and

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.540
habitats like this.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.840
LARRY NIVEN: Next

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.720
GREGORY BENFORD: Or--

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.250
and you could put them in
various kinds of orbits that

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.910
would make it look like,
what's called a Dyson

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.690
Bubble, like this.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.370
And there are all kinds of ideas
about how to maintain

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.220
these structures, and therefore,
over time, you

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.526
would use up the resource.

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.010
LARRY NIVEN: Next.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.020
GREGORY BENFORD: And so, toward
the end it might even

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.660
look like this.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.250
And therefore, this is actually
an object we could

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.470
look at using Kepler and another
satellites, and the

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.550
recently finished infrared
search called WISE.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.810
That's an acronym, as usual.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.860
Next slide.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.540
And therefore, a grant was just
gotten by Geoff Marcy

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.920
over at UC Berkeley that will
use the Lick Observatory,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.130
right over there on the hills,
to look for Dyson Spheres,

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.870
using the best data we now have
accumulated from those

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.140
two missions, the WISE
and the Kepler.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.950
And you could actually, if you
care to, you could put this in

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.830
as a public charity actually.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.230
If you go to that address, you
can make a donation to the

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.186
Dyson Sphere search.

00:07:25.186 --> 00:07:26.900
BRAD TEMPLETON: Why are you
looking at me, in particular?

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.740
GREGORY BENFORD: Well,
because you're a

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.990
large infrared object.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.847
Walked right into
that one, Brad.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.838
BRAD TEMPLETON: I'm a skilled
engineer, but my job is

00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:39.820
pushing a next button
on a slide.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.230
GREGORY BENFORD: Exactly so.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.080
So you see, this is an
ongoing project.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.950
I mean, I've known Geoff
Marcy a long time.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.910
And I knew he was interested
in this, and while we were

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.060
writing the novel, it
all came to mind.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.370
Now it actually, coincidentally,
just in time

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.370
to come out with our book, is
the news that he got the

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.650
grant, $200,000.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.090
You'd be amazed what you can do
for such a small amount of

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.300
money at Google.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.860
Next.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.050
Here's the definition of
a Big Dumb Object.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.810
I'll give you a minute
to read it.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.900
OK, time's up, and--

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.750
this is Google, right?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.380
No, go back to it.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.840
Go back to the last slide.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.450
LARRY NIVEN: Their minutes are
still 60 seconds longer.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.992
GREGORY BENFORD: This is from
Peter Nichols, a noted SF

00:08:24.992 --> 00:08:30.270
critic, who said, basically
it's an interesting--

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.429
as Larry pointed out-- it's a
great narrative structure

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.130
because nobody bothers your
protagonist while he staggers

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.190
around, trying to understand
what's going on.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.950
And that actually is useful
in "Ringworld" and Conan.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.840
Because Conan, apparently,
doesn't seem to

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.535
be that bright anyway.

00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:47.250
LARRY NIVEN: But it is
the amateurish--

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.760
the semi-amateurish
way to write.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.630
I knew I was young and foolish
and needed more skills.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.560
when I wrote "Ringworld."

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.510
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.980
This, by the way,
is from an essay

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.870
that's on my own website.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.580
With Peter's permission, I put
the whole essay up about

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.100
re-reading hard science
fiction.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.510
It's a lot of thoughts
about it.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.800
You can go to GregoryBenford.com
and go down

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.880
in the blog--

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.150
or somewhere on that site, among
the articles, I think,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.920
and it's got his essay.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.710
OK, time's up.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.460
Next slide.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.280
And of course, if you've been
around in this field long

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.680
enough, you know that there
were the ONeill fashion.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.940
The big fashion of the 1970's
was writing about these

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.080
cylinder colonies that we would
put in space and have

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.790
habitats, and so forth.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.260
Gerry O'Neill pursued this in
great detail, and showed that

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:33.920
you could do it.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.490
And it was a good idea.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.490
And then, as typical in many--

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.920
much of the evolution of science
fiction, it fades away

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.310
and you get another idea.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.270
I can remember when I started
reading SF in the 1950's, the

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.620
big idea was telepathy.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.260
Whatever happened to
that idea, right?

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.550
Next.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.270
LARRY NIVEN: Robert Silverberg
happened to that idea.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.620
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes, see,
Robert Silverberg.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.420
Although Connie Willis is
writing a telepathy novel now,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.900
she told me.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.430
Next.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.340
BRAD TEMPLETON: Pre-cognition
sort of failed too as a theme.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.760
I wonder why they didn't
see that coming.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:08.940
GREGORY BENFORD: That's good.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.250
And then "Rendezvous
with Rama"--

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.220
Arthur C. Clarke.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.890
Big alien artifact, suspiciously
like an O'Neill

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.560
colony, comes into the solar
system, and takes off for

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.580
parts unknown.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.290
And you explore it.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.910
And again, there appears
to be nobody in charge.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.130
There's some aliens
crawling around.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.480
They turned out to be
maintenance features.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.970
Nobody knows what the
hell this was

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.720
for, and then it goes.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.410
That's the thing is you try to
leave the wizard behind the

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.930
curtain, if you possibly can.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.180
Next.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.390
And this is ours.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.070
That's the Bowl of Heaven.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.150
That little bright point,
that's the star.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.620
The big blue and white zone is
the main habitable zone, but

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.310
you actually could live under
that rather tan-colored

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.290
section, which is mirrors.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.457
Not entirely mirrors,
but mostly.

00:11:00.457 --> 00:11:01.800
LARRY NIVEN: Notice
something here.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.810
If you start with a Dyson
Sphere, and work within the

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.680
laws of physics as we know them,
you're bound to wind up

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.060
using just the equator, and
spinning it for gravity.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.530
You spin it for gravity.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.870
The equator is the only thing
that will hold an atmosphere,

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.210
because from the higher levels,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.420
atmosphere will flow down.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.570
In this object, you still have
to pocket the atmosphere to

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.130
avoid losing it.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:38.840
But the half-Dyson Sphere
doesn't quite work.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.160
You wind up with a Ringworld
with a wok-shaped lid, and a

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.450
hole in the lid, if you're
going to make it move.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.530
GREGORY BENFORD: Tell
them the title.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.840
LARRY NIVEN: The title
is "Bowl of Heaven."

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.620
GREGORY BENFORD: But our first
title was "Wokworld." Somehow

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.100
it didn't seem to quite--

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.290
LARRY NIVEN: And then I borrowed
a term, which I had

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:07.270
seen 48 years ago, for a cartoon
done for a set of

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.830
cartoons done about
the Ringworld.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.480
One of them laid out the plot
line in a few hundred words,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.400
and called it "Cupworld." You've
got a half of a Dyson

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:24.550
Sphere, space ports in the
handle, and night and day

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.043
provided by orbiting tea bags.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.240
GREGORY BENFORD: And somehow
that didn't get written up.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.260
I don't know why.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.150
LARRY NIVEN: "Cupworld" wasn't
good enough. "Bowl of Heaven"

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.890
works just fine.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.910
GREGORY BENFORD: And you'll
notice there are other

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.710
features here.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.860
Those mirrors in a great
fraction of the bowl reflect

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.430
back on to a tiny spot on the
surface of the rapidly

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.660
rotating star.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.390
As you know, stellar
rotation gives you

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.680
strong magnetic fields.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.140
It's true on our [? sun. ?]

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.150
Very high magnetic fields.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:02.570
And this concentrated energy
ignites a flare which turns

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.490
into a jet.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.340
It bulges out and then the
magnetic fields that are

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:13.230
entrained focus the jet so it
streams through the knothole.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.680
The whole system is
going somewhere.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.870
LARRY NIVEN: The star is
accelerating and the Bowl

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.060
follows because of
gravity, and some

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.600
fancy magnetic fields.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.730
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.060
And here I was again able to
moonlight because I've

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.770
published several dozen papers
on the dynamics, the

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.300
stability, and origin of the
jets that come from the

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.490
accretion disks around both
stars and black holes.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.250
And I published them in
"Astrophysical Journal," gone

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.280
to a lot of conferences, and
then decided to use that

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.660
expertise, because jets form
naturally an astonishingly

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.700
large number of times.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.020
We now have seen hundreds of
jets coming from black hole

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.630
regions around the universe.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.070
And there are dozens around
black holes and

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.430
stars in our galaxy.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:07.760
So the jet and the Bowl all make
an integrated system that

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.980
is a transport system that
people could live in.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.160
Mysteries ensue.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.090
LARRY NIVEN: It's a Big Smart
Object because it needs

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.160
constant maintenance.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.610
You don't dare lose
your civilization.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.120
You lose your civilization,
you've lost your habitat.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.940
It'll spin out of control, it'll
impact the sun, it'll go

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.210
straight to hell.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.050
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:36.300
Yet much of the land in the
Bowl of Heaven is natural.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.270
It's a natural habitat.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.510
It has enormous parks.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.560
They utterly dominate.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.020
It's not just a big
New York City.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.320
And so you have to wonder, why
was this built, who built it,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.020
and what's its point?

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.470
And obviously the point is that
it's going somewhere,

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.500
unlike "Ringworld."

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.120
Interesting plot point, right?

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.050
All of this is the pre-thinking
before you write

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.310
the first line.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.940
And in the first line someone is
waking up-- a human, a guy,

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.100
a biologist--

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.350
on a starship that's headed
for a planet called Glory,

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.670
because the watch officers--

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.000
almost all the expedition
is in the deep

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.070
sleep, and fairly cold--

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.320
the watch officers suddenly saw
appear off to the side,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.150
this thing, because they
had overtaken it.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.710
Because you couldn't
see it from behind.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.080
The star was blocked.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.170
And the jet wasn't quite
luminous enough to register at

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:29.890
a distance.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.340
And the thing is about
a quarter of a

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.520
light year away anyway.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.490
LARRY NIVEN: What Greg hasn't
said is, this thing is

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.530
accelerating directly away
from Earth, with the same

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.410
target as the spaceship that
contains our protagonists.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.860
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.660
LARRY NIVEN: They were
bound to catch up.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.080
The Bowl wasn't big enough to
see until they got closer.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.820
And of course they're moving
through the flare.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.090
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.950
Which has some implications
about what's been happening to

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.670
the starship, which we'll let
you discover when you read the

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.920
Google discounted book.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.960
So all of this is the beginning
of the plot.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.960
Notice how much thinking you've
got to do before you

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.730
can write the first page.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.440
It really does help to plan.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.970
LARRY NIVEN: Until you write
the first page, it's all

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.860
recreation.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.710
Collaborations don't become work
until you start writing.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.030
Until then it's just fun.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.350
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:34.080
Until then it's an excuse
to meet in a bar.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.010
LARRY NIVEN: I have spent a
whole afternoon walking with a

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:43.050
guy named Michael [? Crew ?],
carving out a novel as we

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.220
walked around the hills
of Berkeley.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.710
We get back to the house, and we
find out that neither of us

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.960
actually wants to write.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.330
GREGORY BENFORD: You suck
all the fun out of it.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.690
That's the thing.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.070
Don't eat the cream first.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.800
That's the usual rule
about desserts.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.050
Yes.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.730
The Bowl spins quite rapidly, as
you would guess, to create

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.170
an artificial gravity.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.829
And as you'll see, in your
location the Bowl--

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.790
and all the bowl has
habitat in it.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:17.750
It's not just mirrors plus a
habitat somewhere else--

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.619
you can have very
light gravity.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.500
And therefore the species
are different.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.380
The living conditions
are different.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.210
And the humans in this novel get
to experience several of

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.540
these different g's.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.860
The main equatorial section is
called the Great Plain, and

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.740
it's at 0.8g.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.400
This sketch is in the book.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.890
Use your own work.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.860
LARRY NIVEN: The sketches, the
visuals, all of the visual

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:49.140
were done from sketches
we made by Don Davis.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.690
We took a flat fee for doing
several paintings.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.580
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.810
Next.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.160
Several paintings indeed,
because this is a close up of

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.100
the Don Davis.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.360
He's a guy I've known since
Chesley Bonestell introduced

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.680
him to me, and Don
was 18 years old,

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.620
back in the late 1960's.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.300
Here's a close up.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.460
You can see the mirror zone.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:18.330
And you can see the storms above
both oceans and land in

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.640
the Great Plain.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.210
And you'll see everything at
such a scale, you can't tell

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.070
anything about the inhabitants
at this range.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.350
Which is largely true of the
Earth, except for some large

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.190
constructions.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.440
Next.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.630
So the--

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.510
LARRY NIVEN: In fact the thing
looks so planet-like that you

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.080
have to keep remembering, and
the protagonists have to keep

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.450
remembering, you're looking
across interplanetary scales,

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.020
objects as far away as Mars.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.110
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah but you
can tell essentially the major

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.970
characteristics over an
interplanetary distance.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.380
And so this is a scene that
occurs fairly early in.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:11.820
The way for this starship to
actually maneuver in is, first

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.020
it has to lose some velocity,
and it wants to explore the

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.950
object, so it flies up the
jet, to decelerate.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.500
Great scene to write.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.300
And this is a Don
Davis painting.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.890
You'll see the larger
version in

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.270
unfortunately black and white.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.220
Although in the e-Edition
maybe it's in color.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.860
I actually haven't even looked
at the e-Edition.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:38.460
And notice the large magnetic
coils around

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.240
the rim of the knothole.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.950
And there's some other magnetic
features too.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.910
There's a lot of magnetism in
this, because I've done a lot

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.280
of classical electrodynamics,
and I taught it at UC Irvine--

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.725
the advanced class.

00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:52.740
They've got a graduate class.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.990
To me the most important
technology of the last 200

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.940
years has clearly been
that that derives

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.540
from the Maxwell Equations.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.690
I mean, it's made this
company, right?

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.700
I mean it's the key
technology.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.160
And we're still mining it.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.000
Only a few months ago, some guys
at Imperial College in

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.080
London announced an easy way
to produce a coherent

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.040
microwave emitter from a solid
by flashing light on it.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.330
Completely a new discovery.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.440
It's going to revolutionize
microwave transmission.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.040
It's amazing where you don't
even have to tune.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.270
LARRY NIVEN: And it gets
us cheap [? sugary ?]

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.840
[? cereals. ?]

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.420
GREGORY BENFORD: That's right.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.470
Yeah that's an immediate
application.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:38.770
Here's a view from standing in
the Great Plain, looking out

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.060
into the distance on
a very clear day.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.810
This is a clear day.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.990
It has a deep ocean, which
is held in by a

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.510
membrane at the top.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.650
And this is the kind of view
that we imagine would be true

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.840
if you were able to stand there
and look across at and

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.190
see such great distances.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.070
This is on a clear
day, remember.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:02.100
So you see some fading with
distance but not a lot.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.350
Next.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.090
And here's another part
of that view.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.790
It's all part of one painting.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.190
You'll notice in the foreground
there's what we

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.120
call a zig-zag tree, which is
an adaptation we haven't

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.800
explained yet to this world.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.220
There's a human walking
over toward the left.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.730
And you can see the scale, as
the whole thing just runs away

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.480
into the distance, over
colossal distances.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.150
It's inverse to a planet, in
that the horizon tilts up, so

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.300
you can see great distances.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.730
But there's something
else in there.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.470
Next slide.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.790
Something else within
view, and it's this.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.410
This is an animal.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.260
It looks like a fish because
it flies through

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.050
the air, very slowly.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.300
It's like a giant blimp.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.740
And it's actually the
means of transport--

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.890
one of the means of transport
that the inhabitants use.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.930
Because, guess what, there's
not going to be a climate

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.720
change problem here because
there are no fossil fuels.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.240
You have to get around
in some other means.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.720
You could make fuels
of course, the

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.460
way we do with ethanol.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.750
But it's cheaper to get around,
since you've got a lot

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.980
of time, in a method that
doesn't burn something.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.270
Because you have to be careful
of the environment.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.810
You don't want too
much oxidation

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.850
to run out of control.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.420
So that's some of the
environment that we have spent

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.640
a whole lot of time and
fun in designing.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.860
The whole strategy of the first
book is to show you a

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.200
lot of things, let you reach
some assumptions, and then

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.920
undermine them and prove them
false in the second book.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.180
That's what makes
it fun for us.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.700
So anything more about--
this is called a sky

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.520
fish, by the way.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.120
It's called by the humans
a sky fish.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.200
LARRY NIVEN: You can't
pronounce the

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.810
word in Bird Folk.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.240
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah because
the Bird Folk are the people

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.770
who run this place, and they
have a lot of feathers.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.260
And it's one of their major
modes of expression.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.620
And they regard these curious
primates, who come on-board

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.560
and have to be, of course,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.460
immediately grabbed and corralled.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.680
I mean, you don't want new
influences, right?

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.390
You don't want instability in
the Bowl, because instability

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.320
means death.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.710
But these primates have this
curious thing that--

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.820
I mean they make gestures
with their arms.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.690
They have these funny little
facial expressions, and they

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.450
try to convey meaning
with them.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.480
But they don't use the full
glory of a fan feather

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.240
presentation.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.930
They can't change colors.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.150
They can't rattle, and
rustle, and move.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.970
I mean it just shows you
how limited they are.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:43.750
Poor things.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.000
And they have this kind
of simple starship.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.960
Well we've seen a lot
of those before.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.810
They come and go, you know.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.580
It's a different attitude.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.730
LARRY NIVEN: We've been
avoiding some

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.670
spoilers, so far.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.400
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes and we're
going to keep avoiding

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.860
them, aren't we?

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.270
LARRY NIVEN: That was
topic I was--

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.850
I'm not going to tell them about
the Builders, right?

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.560
GREGORY BENFORD: Oh, right

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.140
LARRY NIVEN: As with
"Ringworld," you don't know

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.775
much about the Builders until
you get into the book.

00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:15.770
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.640
Because it's just too damn much
to show you all of New

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.920
York in one day, right?

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.750
LARRY NIVEN: But the Builders
do go onstage quick.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.690
They have to with a Big Smart
Object because that's who is

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.820
running everything.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.964
Their quite obvious,
quite obtrusive.

00:24:31.964 --> 00:24:32.960
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.530
But there's an old saying--
my father was a

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.830
professional army officer.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.080
That's how I ended up spending
three years in occupied

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.840
Germany, three years
in occupied Japan.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.310
And I learned things about
hierarchies, both in Japan and

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.200
in the army.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.600
When you go into the GQ, the
General Headquarters, the

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.400
first person you meet
is not a general.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.890
That rule applies to the Bowl.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.530
Next slide.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:05.050
Conservative means careful
because Big Smart Objects

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:11.080
means it's not mutually stable
like the Ringworld was

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.490
supposedly first
thought to be.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.190
It turns out it's not
usually stable.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.940
In fact I gave the problem of,
calculate the stability of the

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:22.030
Ringworld as a problem on the
qualifying exam for the PhD at

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.520
UC Irvine, one year.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.060
And guess how many people out of
18 candidates managed to do

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.780
the calculation correctly, and
reach the right conclusion.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.570
One?

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.660
Do I hear two?

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.580
Zero?

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.490
How many pessimists--

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.290
how many vote for zero?

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.310
Yeah, well you're right
to be skeptical.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.960
The correct number is
two, out of 18.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.650
They said it was one of the
toughest problems they had

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.430
ever had on an exam,
because they hadn't

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.790
seen one like it before.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.060
And you see, I wanted to
privilege the people who had

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.900
read "Ringworld." I've never
said that in public before.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.545
It was 1977, so they
had a chance.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.270
OK.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.150
BRAD TEMPLETON: Really, because
we did that one in

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.730
high school integration.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.680
I mean just, no mass,
no gravity

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.580
inside a disc or a sphere.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.030
We did that.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:14.480
But anyway.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:14.990
GREGORY BENFORD: That's right.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.600
Yeah I mean you can do it.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.610
It's just an interval.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:22.470
LARRY NIVEN: They were using
"Ringworld" calculations at my

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.730
high school last
time I visited.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.040
GREGORY BENFORD: You can
calculate the potential field,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.230
and then show that the lateral
movement increases the energy,

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.580
and therefore the system
will go that way.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.440
So that Ringworld will simply
slide into the star.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.860
If you push it will
just keep going.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.100
Like a ball rolling
down a hill.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.240
LARRY NIVEN: Which is why there
are attitude jets in the

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.060
second book.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.510
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.270
And so in "Bowl of Heaven"--

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.010
actually, I think I left
this out deliberately.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.320
It'll be in the second book--
somebody says, how come they

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.760
just don't turn off
the jet and coast?

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.010
Think for a minute.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.870
LARRY NIVEN: Bowl.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.120
Interstellar wind.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.070
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.160
And the star.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.070
Who wins?

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.160
It's a complicated
dynamics problem.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.080
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.490
The wind stops the Bowl.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.790
The sun, being more massive
keeps going.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.950
You lose your sun.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.830
Now what?

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.620
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:29.200
But it could be, if you're in a
low density region that the

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.560
sun's gravity wins.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.330
And either way it goes,
it's unstable.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.260
If you turn off the
jet you're dead.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.630
The Bowl is spinning, that keeps
your orientation, but it

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.030
doesn't help you with
the instability.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.660
And there are other
problems too.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.940
How is this maintained?

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.470
By a complicated set of magnetic
fields, a rapidly

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:50.640
spinning object with electrical
charge, generates a

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.740
magnetic field.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.110
And lots of great engineering,
which I hope will form the

00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.890
basis for future qualifying
exam questions.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.010
Well you've probably
read this one.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:03.870
Is this the last?

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.700
No it's not.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.210
Yeah.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.890
So smart means vigilant.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:09.600
You can read that.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.850
It's more effective.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.910
LARRY NIVEN: I didn't deal with
the problem of drilling

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:26.660
in the vacuum on the Ringworld,
long ago.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.030
It's the reason you don't
find oil wells.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.540
GREGORY BENFORD: But if you're
on the Bowl, and you drill

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.140
through, you're not only going
to be sucked through by the

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.220
vacuum, you have a velocity
relative to the rest of the

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.220
background of a hundreds
of kilometers a second.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.550
And it's going to get you
into trouble because the

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.930
outside of the Bowl--

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.760
we have some interesting things
about this in the

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.800
second book--

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.240
the outside the Bowl is
not just bare skin.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.580
It has constructs on it.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.220
It's useful.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.200
So you're almost certainly going
to run into something.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.240
So it's going to be a very
bad idea to think about.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.600
And they have safeguards
against that.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.980
The point about this is to say,
why should we think about

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.000
this enormous object?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.050
Well it's a way of thinking
about, what would intelligent

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:22.490
life do, if it really had a lot
of time, and a big energy

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:27.840
budget, and had motivations
that are not ours.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.710
There's an old story told about
bringing an aboriginal

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.740
from Australia in the 19th
century to London.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.070
And he looked at St. Paul's
Cathedral, and these

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.130
buildings, and these streets,
and he said, you know, this is

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.090
very impressive, but
why did you do it?

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.420
Why did you bother?

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.310
I mean, he couldn't see the
point of building large

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.850
buildings and a city.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.140
It just didn't seem like
something he wanted to do.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:55.040
Well maybe the Bowl of Heaven
will be something that we

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.720
wouldn't want to do,
but somebody did.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.670
And who was that?

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.820
That's really the thrust
of the book.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.692
And, oh by the way, why is it
going to Glory, the target for

00:30:03.692 --> 00:30:05.630
the starship.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.450
And then some other things.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.810
As we always say toward
end, events ensue.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.610
This is why it's fun to
write these books.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.360
It's because it's just kind of
fun to fool around with ideas.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.280
And from the point of view of
the guy whose published over

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.590
200 scientific papers, it is
very much like doing science,

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.240
when it's really good.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.010
That is, you're having
new ideas.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.950
You're working them out
in a rigorous way.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.980
The writing, as Larry said,
is the hard part.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.570
LARRY NIVEN: And things
keep surprising you.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.220
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:36.730
That's right.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.480
And so we keeping kicking
my ideas back and forth.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.320
LARRY NIVEN: We've been hard at
work on the second book as

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.600
we drove around the Southern
California area.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.240
If you can carpool, you
can collaborate.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.970
Yeah and it's more productive
than just

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.900
listening to classic rock.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.620
So it's a fun process.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:03.760
And our intention is to finish
this subject in two books.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.500
Now "Ringworld" has how
many books now?

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.710
LARRY NIVEN: "Ringworld"
is four, and

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.090
"Ringworld" is finished.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.410
It was going to be one.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.570
GREGORY BENFORD: Until
further notice, then.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.410
LARRY NIVEN: This one, we
planned two, and we're still

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.350
planning two.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.180
It's not going to be one of
those seven-part trilogies.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.810
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.350
Or even a three-part trilogy
because trilogies--

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.940
the classic problem with
trilogies is the

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.180
middle book, right?

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.270
How to eliminate this problem,
make it two books.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.040
Seems simple.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.130
So, why don't we do Q&amp;A?

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:40.550
But it actually announces part
of the narrative strategy of

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.390
telling such stories.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.410
So we thought what's
the opposite?

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.850
LARRY NIVEN: It's
a critic's term.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:49.880
It's a critics who was not
impressed by a flood of Big

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.140
Dumb Object stories.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:32:00.210
"Ringworld" followed by
"Orbitsville," and the

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.670
"Rendezvous with Rama,"
and several others.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.410
GREGORY BENFORD: And
Farley's books--

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:08.590
He wrote a Big Dumb Object
trilogy, which is the only

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:13.220
part of his work which is out
of print, he told me.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.120
LARRY NIVEN: Well, he broke
too many physics

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.050
laws with that one.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:16.800
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah,
that's true.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.550
LARRY NIVEN: And bent
probability a lot too far.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.140
BRAD TEMPLETON: Wait a minute,
are you talking about "Titan?"

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:21.690
LARRY NIVEN: Yes.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.880
BRAD TEMPLETON: That
wasn't dumb.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.070
LARRY NIVEN: Wasn't it?

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.770
No, you're right.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.270
Someone was in charge.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.970
GREGORY BENFORD: Oh there was
somebody charge, yes.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.320
That's true.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.980
But it tended, like most ideas
in science fiction, to have a

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:39.610
half-life of roughly a decade,
and then to go away.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.270
So now it's back.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:42.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.050
Thanks for coming.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.990
It's great fun to
have you here.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.660
How are the inhabitants
protected

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.750
against ionizing radiation?

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.820
LARRY NIVEN: Lots of atmosphere,
for one thing.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.270
And for another, that sun is a
wretched little red dwarf.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:56.820
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.440
LARRY NIVEN: You've got the
flare, but it's generating

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.250
mostly heat.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.160
Check me out on this, because
you're the expert.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.810
GREGORY BENFORD: That's
true. , No, I mean,

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.060
about what you said.

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:09.640
LARRY NIVEN: OK.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.550
GREGORY BENFORD: But it's
also the magnetic field.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.780
LARRY NIVEN: Hundreds of
kilometers of atmosphere being

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:22.240
held in by what is essentially
the far future descendants of

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.530
a sandwich baggie.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:24.960
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.460
Right.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:30.250
But the whole region is
magnetically dominated, and so

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.760
you fend off an lot
of cosmic rays.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.830
LARRY NIVEN: Flare
is confined.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.990
If you fiddle with the flare,
you're going to get ionizing

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.790
radiation where you
don't want it.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.080
Something to remember.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.190
GREGORY BENFORD: That's right.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.470
The trick in the system is that

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.920
the jet is very dangerous.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.670
And it will always
work perfectly,

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.020
until the second book.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:57.780
AUDIENCE: So you said the Bowl's
going somewhere, and

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:58.690
you said it's hard to stop.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:59.940
LARRY NIVEN: The Bowl is a
spacecraft and it's been

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.840
traveling for a long time.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.100
It's visited many,
many places.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.920
AUDIENCE: Well, anyway, you said
it would be very hard to

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.870
stop, or I assume, even turn,
and get into an orbit.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.530
So what the heck's going
to happen about that?

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:13.760
LARRY NIVEN: There's lots
of space out there.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.139
Light years are big.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:16.080
Light years are big.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.140
You don't need to make
a hairpin turn.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.150
And if you did, you could
do it around the sun.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.310
AUDIENCE: But even an
infinitesimal turn would, I

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.380
assume, give you the same
problems you described with

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.429
turning off the jet.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:29.900
GREGORY BENFORD: Well, remember
you could apply

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.469
torque over a very long time.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.429
Yes, as he said, you could
make the turns slowly.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.070
It has to.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.469
The knothole is only so big.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:43.500
But, 747's don't make
house calls.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.389
You fly by, you've got time,
you send faster ships, you

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:54.219
explore the region, and
then, you keep going.

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:56.790
LARRY NIVEN: And launching a
spaceship is fairly easy.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:01.880
You just drop it off
the edge, at around

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.116
600 miles per second.

00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:06.030
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.780
AUDIENCE: A pivot from plot
to business, for a

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.820
moment, if you would.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.270
I'd be interested in your two
perspectives as authors on the

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:13.390
changes in the publishing
industry,

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.500
specifically related to--

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.430
I don't know about the rest of
you, but I don't buy many of

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.400
these in paper form anymore,
and I'd be interested in

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.920
seeing how this looks from
your side of the pen.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.170
LARRY NIVEN: I carry a Kindle.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.590
BRAD TEMPLETON: Can you get
Play Store on the Kindle?

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.020
GREGORY BENFORD: I don't
waste time either.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:39.750
LARRY NIVEN: I got my Kindle
free from Jeff Bezos, at a

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:45.940
three-day party he threw for
around 40 of the people, and

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.475
their wives and husbands,
whom he wanted to meet.

00:35:49.475 --> 00:35:49.930
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.370
And the Kindle was signed.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.410
That's another thing about
collectors, is they want the

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.450
print edition, you know,
information stored in the

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.460
bodies of dead trees, because
you can get them signed.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.320
There are ways around that.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.720
I mean David Brin and I reissued
a novel of ours,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.960
"Heart of the Comet," and we
give away a card that we have

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.550
signed that is that card "Heart
of the Comet." You can

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.960
keep it on your file if you
want, but otherwise it's an

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.930
electronic edition.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.310
Although there is a
Print on Demand.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.970
But what you're talking about is
the big war that's going on

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.140
in publishing.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.190
And at the moment it's really
like the opening chapters of

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.030
World War II.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.400
It's all offense, no defense.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.760
We were just doing a signing
on the Queen Mary, Saturday

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.330
night for the Independent
Booksellers of Southern

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.200
California, their
annual meeting.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.680
And there were several speeches

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.850
at the banquet about--

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.210
well they were Amazon
hate sessions.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:48.810
Right?

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.630
I mean it was like a
scene from 1984.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.990
Everybody chants about
Big Brother.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.920
And at the same time New York
publishing was getting

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.690
hollered out.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.440
You can tell it by the growing
incompetence of the staff who

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.730
had been recently hired, when
they fired the executives.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.860
No one seems to understand that
up ahead in the future,

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.320
there's some kind
of equilibrium

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.340
we're going to approach.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.950
And no one seems to be really
thinking forward about that

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.220
equilibrium now.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.040
Barnes and Noble is tottering
and may collapse, the last big

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.010
chain that's across
the continent.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.282
The independents are finding
niche markets, such as a Books

00:37:29.282 --> 00:37:32.740
Inc, one of my favorite
bookstores, is actually a

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:36.670
chain about, what, seven
or eight stores.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.260
Very good store.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.550
And they make a point of being
up on everything and knowing

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.280
what's going on.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.390
You walk into a store, they got
the book you heard about

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:49.510
today on NPR, or read in
the "New York Times."

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.630
But how does this all work?

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.390
I don't know, except the writers
are actually, I think,

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.400
in many ways the biggest
beneficiaries, because we now

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.240
have options.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.720
We can control our work.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.600
I am reissuing my novels
selectively.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.210
Although I know I could get
publishers to reissue them, I

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.580
can reissue them myself.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.620
I can hire the artist.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.940
I hired a copywriter--

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.190
a copy editor.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.760
I've got a promotional
editor I use.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.860
Even to revisit novels I've
written before and prune them

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.740
up, and change, or readjust
the physics.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.420
I care about that
kind of thing.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.290
I'm working on a novel of mine
from the from the aughts,

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:29.220
"Cosm," which is actually
set at UCI.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.180
And it was a nice chance to
satirize other members of my

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.430
department.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.620
Some of whom, luckily,
are dead.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.930
BRAD TEMPLETON: Coincedence?

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:44.180
GREGORY BENFORD: Some say not.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.960
So we can choose our markets.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.110
We could choose to do print on
demand, or just e-Edition.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:57.150
I've done both.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.000
Larry's starting to reissue
his books in this way.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.910
The point is, the books are
going to be always available,

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.690
at least in digital form,
or print on demand.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.920
That's a whole new landscape
for a writer.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.660
And for this first time
in my career--

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.930
our career--

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:14.580
there's a sense of real opening
for the writers.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.170
And you may not think about it
right away, but there's the

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:22.420
publishers, and the bookstores,
and all that, But

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.920
they wouldn't have a business
without us.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.470
And we're getting some control
of how we want

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.260
the fields to work.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.440
And that's a good feeling.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.740
LARRY NIVEN: For your sense of
proportion, my first novel, I

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.816
had to settle for
4% royalties.

00:39:38.816 --> 00:39:39.230
GREGORY BENFORD: God.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.820
Really?

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.650
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:41.290
GREGORY BENFORD: "World
of Ptavvs"?

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.830
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah, well
I was a novice.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.310
4% royalties.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:49.540
My agent later argued them into
a bigger proportion, but

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:55.900
most people get 10%
or 8% royalties.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.330
And you get that after you've
been in the field two or three

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.580
books deep.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:11.310
HG Wells used to get 25%,
an amazing figure.

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.930
He got that, I presume,
because he put

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.650
some money into it.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.740
He was part of the backing,
of the backer.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.730
I'm getting--

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:28.100
my agent is putting out my books
as the contracts lapse,

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:33.630
and one by one they're going
into electronic print, for

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.800
which I get 85%.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.420
My agent keeps the 15%
she's entitled to.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.380
This is an amazing change.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.200
GREGORY BENFORD: It feels great
to do something better

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.450
than HG Wells.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.790
LARRY NIVEN: Absolutely

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:59.200
GREGORY BENFORD: So, to conclude
on that, it's a time

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.370
of the greatest change since
that guy named Gutenberg.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:07.480
And it will mean an enormous
amount particularly to the

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.680
vast majority of humanity
that has never really

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.130
had access to books.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:17.050
I've been to India a lot, and
Africa, and believe me, these

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:20.030
are people who are starved for
information, and have been so

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.690
for thousands of years.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.170
Can you imagine the civilization
that was

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.500
information starved forever?

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.950
Well read the history books.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.350
That's most of human history.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.850
This is really going
to alter humanity.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:36.840
And I, with my biases, think,
look, I come from a small town

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.720
in southern Alabama.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.630
Information starved?

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.940
I know what we're
talking about.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.180
I went to-- my brother and I--

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.110
I'm an identical twin--

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:47.210
went to a one room schoolhouse
when we were growing up, in a

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.180
farm community.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.200
It changes your view
of the world.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.230
LARRY NIVEN: That it does.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:42:00.220
AUDIENCE: So our species used
to build things, that-- you

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.460
know we have ruins from
millennia ago, and now you're

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.590
in front of a room full of
people who routinely get woken

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.380
up in the middle of the
night because our

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.520
system needs our help.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.230
So I'm wondering if you see sort
of a broad societal trend

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:21.450
towards building smarter
objects that need more

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.190
maintenance.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.970
LARRY NIVEN: Smarter objects
that need more maintenance?

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.450
Obama would support that.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.000
Jobs.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.970
GREGORY BENFORD: You
mean Steve, or--

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.220
LARRY NIVEN: No, I mean jobs.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.600
GREGORY BENFORD: That is an
interesting way to look at it.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.580
But the reason is, of course,
that builds a

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.860
society of smart people.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.270
I mean people who can manage
a complex system.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:54.680
If you're building the pyramids,
a Big Dumb Object,

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.030
you don't need literate
people.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:05.190
So it's easy to be impressed
by gargantuan things.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:09.540
But Gargantuan Smart Things is
qualitatively different.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.440
I wrote a whole book, which in
fact I'm going to bring back

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.627
in print within a year or so,
called "Deep Time." The

00:43:15.627 --> 00:43:18.190
subtitle was "How Humanity
Communicates Across

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:21.410
Millennia." It's nonfiction
about my experience of trying

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.300
to design long-term messages
in various places, like the

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.700
nuclear waste facility in New
Mexico, and the Cassini

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.840
mission to Saturn.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.500
And one of the things I learned,
to my astonishment,

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.360
is that there were many museums,
and art galleries,

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.080
and libraries in the
ancient world.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.420
Guess how many survived the
collapse of the Roman Empire,

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.960
or other empires?

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.340
Zero.

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.140
Parts of them were left over.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.120
None of the institutions
survived.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.511
So, if you really want a
long-term message, in the

00:43:54.511 --> 00:43:58.940
ancient past anyway, you should
invest in granite.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.340
Carve it deep and leave
it in a desert.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.700
AUDIENCE: I'm a big
"Ringworld" fan.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.430
And recently computer graphics
imaging has, I think, made it

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.160
possible to actually make
movies out of this.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.330
Not that it might fit in two
or three hours, but I just

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.780
wondered what you thought
of those kinds of ideas.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:19.080
And, I think, in general the
idea of books are wonderful

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.700
because you don't need any
computer graphics imaging.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.050
You can think of it
in your mind.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.350
But now we have the technology
to do all these kinds of

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:30.340
movies, and are we making
readers dumber by making these

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.470
movies with big explosions?

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.000
LARRY NIVEN: Are we making
readers dumber by showing so

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.096
much in a movie?

00:44:38.096 --> 00:44:39.640
GREGORY BENFORD: Well we're
making moviegoers dumber.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.850
But tell them about the
"Ringworld" movie.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:50.110
LARRY NIVEN: The "Ringworld"
movie has suffered over the

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:53.690
decades because I signed some
papers I shouldn't have early

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:54.550
in my career.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:45:02.320
But we renegotiated a contract
a couple years ago and now

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.890
that the guy who has the right
to has shopped it to MGM.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.440
That's all I know.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.720
The movie is at MGM.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.660
And if [? Mandel ?]

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.820
fails to come through
with it, I get a

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.630
chance to make a movie.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:20.870
But that won't happen
for a little while.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:22.280
GREGORY BENFORD: But everything
you say about

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.700
special effects is quite so.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.470
AUDIENCE: You don't really
need actors anymore.

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:29.340
GREGORY BENFORD: No, and you
don't even need a big budget.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:34.240
Remember the movie "Moon" made
by the son of a famous rock

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.960
star for, what was
it, a million?

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:44.370
It was some small sum, and it
made tens of millions, because

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:45.740
there was a good script.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.700
And it was a smart script.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.080
And the special effects
were cheap.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.260
LARRY NIVEN: I'm remembering
"Tom Corbett, Space Cadet."

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.240
when you had to imagine
most of what you were

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.810
supposed to be seeing.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:58.930
GREGORY BENFORD: Hell,
you had to imagine

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.990
what you were seeing.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.620
I mean, rocket ships,
in which the exhaust

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.050
rises, as it goes across.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.750
Yeah, well.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:10.580
I mean, it never occurred to
them, apparently, to turn the

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.420
camera sideways and just have
a rocket ship come down like

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.910
this, so the exhaust would
appear to be going away from

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:18.550
the rocket.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.420
LARRY NIVEN: Do you know how
they got freefall in "2001: A

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.880
Space Odyssey"?

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.980
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah they
spun the giant hoop.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.460
LARRY NIVEN: They put the
astronaut on a line, and then

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.950
shot him from underneath so
that the line didn't show.

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:34.720
Now he's in freefall.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.090
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:40.300
And it was remarkably
convincing.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.550
It really was.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.790
Arthur Clarke gave me a
photograph of him walking

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:52.070
through that rotating drum that
they use for the interior

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.120
of the spaceship.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.240
Do you know the famous
establishing shot where the

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.020
guy appears to run
over the ceiling?

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.570
And he did the same thing.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.370
He said there's a film of him
doing the same thing.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:01.400
But I haven't seen it.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:07.520
But it was funny to see him in
this futuristic context, which

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.780
now lies in the past, "2001."

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.740
AUDIENCE: I like the way they
did the special effects for

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:17.660
"Apollo 13" to get
the zero gravity.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.970
Back to something
you just said.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:21.410
So on the one hand, we have
electronic books, which means

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.480
you can reissue things, you can
publish things, you make

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.870
more money with it, which I
think is wonderful by the way.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:29.000
The downside is, something that
you just said, if you

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.910
want it to last, put
it in granite.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:33.570
One of the reasons I don't buy
electronic books is I don't

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.900
want Amazon deciding that, for
some reason, I didn't buy

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.860
their electronic book, after
I've already got it.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.940
You know, I want to keep it.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.480
I want to have my own backup,
and my own copies.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.740
GREGORY BENFORD:
Well, buy both.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:48.350
AUDIENCE: Well, it
it's in print.

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.310
But again, if it's in print,
or if it's only

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:51.210
in electronic form.

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.490
I can go to the used bookstore,
and look forever,

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:55.010
and maybe find it,
and maybe not.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:59.160
Where do you stand on that sort
of DRM restrictions--

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.395
you know, high price, low price,
and mass distribution--

00:48:01.395 --> 00:48:02.645
kind of thing?

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.780
LARRY NIVEN: I like
cheaper books.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, me too.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.380
GREGORY BENFORD: Except ours.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.606
AUDIENCE: If you keep it up,
everybody buys them, right?

00:48:14.606 --> 00:48:17.090
So, it's kind of a tradeoff.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:18.630
LARRY NIVEN: I want
my ideas spread.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:20.780
I don't even mind pirates
very much.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.400
I mind them some.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.130
GREGORY BENFORD: True.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:25.470
What you bring up is
a serious issue.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.430
First, I'm against DRM.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.980
Second, if you really want to
keep your electronic books

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.060
safe and preserved forever,
well you could put them in

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.420
orbit where I don't think
they can reach them.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.320
But it's always good
to have a backup.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.250
I mean, that's what I tell
people when they say, what is

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.700
it like to be an
identical twin.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:47.960
I say, have a backup.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.820
So I too like physical books.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.940
And I have a few electronic
books but I don't

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.300
mostly read that way.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.030
But they're crowding me
out of my houses,

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:04.744
so there's the downside.

00:49:04.744 --> 00:49:06.400
LARRY NIVEN: Me too.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.990
If you can't bear to throw away
a book, you're in trouble

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:11.630
eventually.

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:13.190
They pile up.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:15.314
GREGORY BENFORD: And
thank you for it.

00:49:15.314 --> 00:49:18.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:19.020
GREGORY BENFORD: Oh great.

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:20.240
BRAD TEMPLETON: Oh, there
are books I've

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.470
wanted to throw away.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:25.450
GREGORY BENFORD: Well, you know,
as a conservationist,

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.700
you could burn them for heat.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.820
Which further has a benefit that
other people will not be

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.570
troubled by reading.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:36.340
BRAD TEMPLETON: So, you've
touched on this a little bit,

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.180
but I was wondering if you might
want to talk a little

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.320
bit more about collaboration.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.080
I mean, I think, Larry, you're
becoming known as a great

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.190
collaborator.

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:46.258
Once, when I was angry at Jerry
Pournelle, I told him,

00:49:46.258 --> 00:49:48.040
you know Jerry, you write really
good books when you

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.330
work with Larry.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:51.417
So.

00:49:51.417 --> 00:49:52.550
GREGORY BENFORD: And he said?

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:55.910
LARRY NIVEN: I think he
was flattered, myself.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.605
I write really good books
when I write with Jerry.

00:49:58.605 --> 00:49:59.490
BRAD TEMPLETON: No,
you do actually.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:01.520
I think the two of you together
do stuff that you

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.680
don't do on your own.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.810
So tell me what is about the
collaborative process that

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.600
makes that happen.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.050
LARRY NIVEN: You learn each
other's strengths.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:14.320
Jerry's, for instance, are with
military and politics.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.290
Mine are with aliens, and
characters who go crazy.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.690
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah,
that's true.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:21.570
Crazy characters.

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:22.110
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:26.330
When a heroic character is
wading his way through a sea

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:31.690
of troubles, fighting his way
toward a goal, that's Jerry.

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:34.210
The character goes
nuts, that's me.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.180
GREGORY BENFORD: It says so
much about your lives.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.880
LARRY NIVEN: Collaborations
are more fun, and more

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.800
friendly, than sitting at your
typewriter all alone writing.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.390
Of course, as a collaborator
you're going to do a lot of

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:54.010
that anyway, because you don't
live together in the same

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.260
house unless you're
man and wife.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.820
Jerry and I live about 25
minutes away from each other.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.550
Greg lives an hour and a
half away, maybe two.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.470
But we've got the internet.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:18.310
When we didn't have the
internet, Jerry lived a little

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:22.970
closer and it was easier, but
we still had to carry texts

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:24.250
back and forth.

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:25.550
BRAD TEMPLETON: What, are you
saying as soon as he got the

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:29.510
internet, he moved further
away from you?

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:30.840
LARRY NIVEN: You got the
right idea, but I

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.665
was the one who moved.

00:51:32.665 --> 00:51:33.120
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.090
To a bigger house.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:34.950
Bigger still.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:36.510
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:37.650
The books were piling up.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:41.380
We had to move to
a bigger house.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.750
GREGORY BENFORD: You're
quite right.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.820
We have different strengths.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:49.890
You know, physicist He's
an alien tech--

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.490
He's an alien.

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:55.500
LARRY NIVEN: Greg has got the
electromagnetic fields that I

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:59.410
don't know very much about it.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.870
GREGORY BENFORD: But it's also
true that writing is a lonely

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:06.520
business, and you can
advance your ideas

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.320
faster by speaking them.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.980
We all know that.

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:14.390
And kicking ideas back and forth
generates new ideas at a

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:18.055
much, much faster rate than
sitting there staring at a a

00:52:18.055 --> 00:52:19.140
cathode ray tube.

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.490
Or a stream of some kind.

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:24.070
It's just one of the strengths
of human beings.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:25.950
We are a collaborative
species.

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:26.260
Right?

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.220
That's why we talk so much.

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:33.012
LARRY NIVEN: I do not have the
patience to be a scientist.

00:52:33.012 --> 00:52:34.650
I knew that fairly early.

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:40.760
GREGORY BENFORD: And there's
a deeper thing here.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.430
Modern science fiction, by the
way, which invented fandom--

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:48.320
the word and the thing itself,
and fanzines, and all that--

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.920
came out of the scientific,
technical culture.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.880
It has always been marked by a
high degree of collaboration.

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.380
And that is true in
the scientific

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.840
and engineering culture.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.110
This is not true in the
literary culture.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.310
Collaborations are rare.

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.080
It's because they come
out of an older,

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.670
and different culture.

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:08.380
Scientists inherently
collaborate.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.710
By far, the majority of all
scientific papers are

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:12.260
collaborations.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:16.150
A high fraction of SF work
is collaboration.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:18.920
A minority, but far higher
than in other fields.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.470
Even in mysteries, there are
very few collaborations.

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.080
Westerns, romance novels--

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.340
they're almost all individual
writers.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:26.920
Not so, in science fiction.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.670
And so it underlies the fact
that science fiction is a

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:33.070
cultural expression
of the dominant

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:34.860
force in modern times--

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.470
science and technology.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:40.370
Try to imagine the last two
centuries without science and

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:42.990
technology, and its
rate of change.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.620
Actually try to imagine the last
two centuries without the

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.640
United States of America, but
that's another discussion.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.370
So you ought to realize this
is actually part of a very

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:58.760
much larger phenomena that
is taking over the world.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.760
We have many competitors
in Asia, and so forth.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.970
They're copying our methods.

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.880
Some years ago, at the World
Science Fiction Convention in

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.810
Tokyo, I spoke to the team of
six editors from the Chinese

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:13.410
science fiction magazine.

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:15.470
We've never had a science
fiction magazine, and they had

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.540
six editors.

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.210
It's a monthly.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:20.650
It has circulation of about a
third to a half a million

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:25.550
copies, whereas "Analog" sells
about 35,000 a month.

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.860
And the Chinese government
supports this magazine--

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:32.700
subsidizes it-- because they
want to invert the process.

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.960
You see, the first science
fiction magazine was "Amazing

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.970
Stories" published by a group
of radio magazines.

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:42.220
And it was the anomaly
inside there.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:45.100
And it's the only one that
anyone remembers now.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.910
The Chinese want to draw their
own people into the culture of

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:52.410
science and technology and the
habits of mind, by using

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.800
science fiction.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.880
They're inverting--

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.970
reverse engineering--

00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:58.080
what we did naturally and

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.040
spontaneously in the 20th century.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.040
So this has been an important
phenomena

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.480
going around the world.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.070
And it's the reason there
are now science fiction

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:07.760
conventions in India, and other

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.790
seemingly unlikely places.

00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:11.820
Africa, even.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:15.200
And it's part of the shaping of
human culture that is being

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.140
done by you, the technological
elite.

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:26.710
BRAD TEMPLETON: So I
think we're running

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:28.600
close to the end.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.830
I'll ask one last question,
actually, because you two are

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:34.230
both well-known for being
specialists in hard science

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.360
fiction, by which I like to call
realistic science fiction

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.810
that actually follows
the physics.

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:41.230
And now it's not just necessary
to follow physics.

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:43.850
I often say romance novels have
excellent physics, and

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:48.410
they barely violate
those laws.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.080
They may violate the laws
of chemistry, but

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.690
not the laws of physics.

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:52.770
GREGORY BENFORD:
And of biology.

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:54.670
BRAD TEMPLETON: But what is it
that you feel is the great

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:55.770
virtue of hard science
fiction?

00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:57.680
What is it that makes-- when you
sit down to write, why do

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.250
you feel that that's what
you must write?

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:03.660
LARRY NIVEN: I'm not a fanatic
on the subject.

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.510
I have written science
fiction.

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:07.290
I've written fantasy.

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:10.150
I have written detective
fiction.

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:13.400
When I get up the nerve, I
write detective science

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:20.560
fiction, and I've got to tell
you, it's the hardest work.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.380
I generally write science
fiction because that's where

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.380
my ideas come from.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:31.330
I've got no contempt for every
other field of fiction.

00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.220
They will all teach you
to read, and reading

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.470
teaches you to think.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:43.380
There was a phenomenon
called Laser Books.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:49.040
Laser Books was going to be
science fiction, as produced

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:53.320
by a house that produced
mostly romance--

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.580
well, all romance novels.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.190
They were going to branch out,
going to be science fiction,

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:01.630
going to be the label that
sells, rather than the

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:02.880
author's name.

00:57:04.928 --> 00:57:08.400
This, as far as I was concerned,
was a great way to

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.240
train readers to read, and
eventually they would grow up

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.310
and read my stuff.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:19.570
As it turned out, the name
was what sold anyway.

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:23.220
And I do mean the name
of the author.

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:28.980
Robert Gleason, my favorite
editor, told me that he was--

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:32.830
he tends to travel among the
people who transport the books

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:36.290
to the stores, the
distributors.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:43.420
He told me he was at a bar where
they were gathered, and

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.670
from the next table he hears,
there's only one Laser Book

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:53.550
that sells at all well, and
it's by one author.

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:55.086
And his name [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:03.350
It turned out to be Jerry
Pournelle's Laser books were

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:07.360
the only ones who sold
well, among Laser.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:10.900
And Laser bowed out gracefully,
returned all

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:18.530
rights, got out of the field,
and it was one of those happy

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:23.660
stories, as far as people who
think that the author's name

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.290
ought to be what sells
books best.

00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:28.540
BRAD TEMPLETON: All right, well,
on that note I'd like to

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.280
thank our two guests for a
fabulous presentation.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:38.247
[APPLAUSE]
