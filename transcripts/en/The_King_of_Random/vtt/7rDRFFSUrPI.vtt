00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.300
BOOM!!!!!!!

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480
Hey guys, This week I figured out a way

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.340
to turn these cheep disposable water bottles

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.120
into super awesome exploding targets that go off with a sonic boom

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.400
I'm going to show you how to make them

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.920
These little "bottle blasters" are so simple to make and extremely gratifying to use for target practice

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.620
because when they get hit... They let out a sonic boom that sounds like gunshot and rocks your world!

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.040
The best part is, they are relatively safe to handle and practically free to make

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.980
All you need to get started is a tubeless tire valve, a one and a half inch steel end cap, and an empty water bottle.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.420
You can see these valves are one and a quarter inch long, and I got this pack of 2 for about three dollars at a local auto parts store.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.780
All you need to do is drill a 5/16th inch hole right into the center of the bottle cap.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.340
So once you get your hole drilled out, you might just want to use a pair of pliers to clean out any excess there, get that hole about as clean and smooth as possible.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.940
This will give you a little space to pull the valve through, if you grip onto it with a pair of pliers and tug

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.500
it should lock into the neck and create an airtight seal

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.420
Now the next step is to drill a half inch hole right into the center of this steel plug.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.120
So let's go ahead and do that next.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.800
Okay, so now we've got our finished valve assembly, as well as a half inch hole drilled into our steel cap.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.480
The only thing we need to do now, is bring the two together.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.820
Now to make that happen, just take the tip of your valve and stick it into the center of the hole

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.360
Lock onto the threads of your valve with your pair of pliers and give it a little tug

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.800
And you should fell the valve pop right into place

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.100
And it will hold securely into the end cap

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.460
And that right there my friends is pretty much it!

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.760
Super low cost and easy to make, and now to add the exploding target, you need to screw a water bottle into place and go pump it up

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.040
Let's test this thing out

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.980
Now at this point, you can pump up these bottles with a bike pump

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.060
and they will be ready to go, but just to take things to the next level

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.220
I created some of these templates on photoshop that you can have for free

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.520
Simply cut them out and wrap them around the bottle and you can see it give them a whole different look

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.980
with a professional looking built in target

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.840
How cool is that?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.280
Simply take something like a bike pump, and attach it to the valve on the bottom

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.580
And we are going to pump this up to about 50 - 60 psi

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.200
but you don't want to a lot higher than that

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.600
Not with a water bottle

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.100
You can see, right between about 55 and 60 psi, the bottle starts crackling

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.120
and it starts changing shape as well

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.380
You don't really want to get it too much more full than that

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.540
This one's ready to blow up

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.860
Shon: God!

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.900
Grant: What would you compare that to, a gunshot?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.000
Shon: That was louder than a gunshot, that was like...

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.560
Shon: at sonic boom, it was... I don't know, oh my god

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.320
Grant: Now just for fun, I went down to the dollar store and found one of these plastic sand castles

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.780
that I tried using for a base

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.480
Which is not nearly as practical as using a steel end cap

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.760
but it is a lot more fun

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.220
Now if your planning on using something like a slingshot to set it off

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.120
what you really want to do is round up a bunch of pebbles like these

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.620
These ones have really sharp edges

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.180
That's going to be great for tearing open the skin of those bottles

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.520
Okay, so apparently rocks and slingshots have no problems taking out these targets

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.320
So just for fun, we are going to try blowguns next

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.940
Wooh, that was amazing

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.180
Now if you want to take things to the next level, you can stop by the dollar store and pick up

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.260
a pack of side walk chalk, like these

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.440
And if you crush them up into a fin powder, and load those into the bottles

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.640
and when you hot the target

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.940
It explodes into a cool colorful cloud of dust

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.800
How cool is that?

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.680
Alright guys, so in conclusion, for very little effort and very little money

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.400
you can make your self some really awesome exploding targets

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.740
and the best part is, all your targets are free

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.620
all you need to do is find some cheep plastic water bottles, which i am sure you have

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.760
Just keep in mind that when these explode, they sound like gunshots in the neighborhood.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.900
So just make sure your on good terms with your neighboors

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.460
Well, thats it for this video guys. Let me know what you would use these exploding targets for

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.740
in the comments below

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.320
and I will look for you in the next project video. I'll talk to you then

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.280
I think I got my phone a little bit too close to that shot

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.200
Thats a lot of chalk dust
