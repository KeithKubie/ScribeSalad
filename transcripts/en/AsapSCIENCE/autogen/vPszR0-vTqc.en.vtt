00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.140
 We all know that you should stay away from toxins like mercury 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.280
 A 200-mg dose will kill you 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.280
 Or polonium, which requires only a gram of material vapor to wipe out 50 million people 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.280
 But you know that 70 cups of coffee contains caffeine 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.340
 Enough to kill a person weighing 70 kg? 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.920
 This amount of caffeine can cause heart palpitations or even cardiac arrest. 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 Your favorite choice of drinks is alcohol? 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.440
 13 consecutive cups can be fatal too! 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.380
 Because alcohol is inhibitory it stops 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.160
 The brain area that controls basic life functions 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.900
 Such as breathing and heart rate. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680
 Too much fluid can generally be dangerous. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.640
 Although the effect of water poisoning takes a long time about 6 liters causes a tumor in brain cells 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.540
 Leading to headaches, convulsions, coma and death in extreme cases, 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.200
 But if you do not drink water or consume too much salt, 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.100
 Your cells will begin to contract, leading to a condition known as hypernatermia, 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.360
 48 teaspoons of your favorite spice at one time 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.420
 Enough to cause this interaction 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.300
 Which also leads to convulsions, coma or even death. 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.860
 Immerse your head underwater or simply hold yourself 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.820
 This will take about 4 minutes without oxygen 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.080
 Causing a severe brain injury that causes your death within 6 minutes. 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.980
 Only in rare cases can some divers 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.760
 Hold their breath for more than 20 minutes. 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.020
 The rice can also deprive you of oxygen! 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.100
 what do you say?! 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.220
 If you've swallowed the cherry seed, do not worry too much. 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.100
 Just do not bite another pill. 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.260
 Contains one or two grains of wild cherry seeds 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.120
 On cyanide and it is enough to eliminate you. 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.820
 Cyanokride ions inhibit cystochrome (coenzyme) 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.300
 And makes your cells unable to use oxygen. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.960
 Speaking of hypoxia, 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.940
 At an altitude of 8,000 feet above sea level 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.740
 Our bodies can not adapt to the limited amount of oxygen 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.120
 Which is known as the "death zone" in mountain climbing 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.980
 Just because it is too high can kill you. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.400
 In 1930 he arrived (Robert Pershing) to 8 feet and 11 inches 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.440
 This high pressure caused the circulatory system 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.200
 And structural pressure on his bones, 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.600
 He died at the age of 22 years. 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.440
 Researchers assume that every 2 cm above 5 feet decreases 1.3 years of your life. 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.600
 If you are concerned about the life of your pet you must have heard of not giving them chocolate 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.820
 The same chemical (theobromine) can also kill us. 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.540
 Oxidation of our bodies (theobromine) more effectively 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.020
 Although 1,000 mg / kg would be fatal to humans 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.260
 Which is equivalent to 85 full size chocolate plates at the same time. 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.440
 You can crave a lot of chocolate after your sprouting, 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.200
 But you need to eat 22 kilograms of marijuana to become at risk of dying 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.820
 The amount required for the overdose is to smoke a large bottle of it 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.820
 About 60 kilograms of marijuana and just 15 minutes to stimulate death! 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.940
 Which explains why no single death is documented 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.260
 Directly related to the consumption of a large amount of marijuana! 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.920
 Raising your music may be amazing and fun too 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.660
 Just do not raise it higher than 185 decibels 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.840
 The amount of atmospheric pressure resulting from it can blow up your lungs 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.780
 Or alternatively a clogged configuration can settle in your heart. 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.280
 It can also keep your neighbors awake all night. 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.920
 While it is uncertain how much the body can survive without sleep, 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.360
 Studies were conducted on mice who were subjected to continuous sleep deprivation 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.440
 It lasted about two weeks before her death. 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.500
 The world record for human beings is more than 11 days, 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.640
 But surprisingly no long-term effects were documented 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.320
 After he was prevented from sleeping. 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.100
 Got the urgent question you want to answer? 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.320

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.200
 We will analyze and compare different foods and drinks 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.180
 To put things in perspective.
