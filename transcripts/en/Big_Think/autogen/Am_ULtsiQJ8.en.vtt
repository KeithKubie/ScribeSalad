they enter the dominant culture and

they enter the dominant culture and
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.110

their kids start to speak the dominant

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
their kids start to speak the dominant
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.430
their kids start to speak the dominant
language and they lose touch with the

language and they lose touch with the
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.260

old ways and pretty soon that language

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
old ways and pretty soon that language

monoculture as this happens and so we

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
monoculture as this happens and so we
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.010
monoculture as this happens and so we
actually have kind of a closing window

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
actually have kind of a closing window
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840

you know we're trying to get this

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
you know we're trying to get this
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.149
you know we're trying to get this
genetic snapshot of what our ancestors

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
genetic snapshot of what our ancestors
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.490
genetic snapshot of what our ancestors
bequeathed to us these genetic trails

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
bequeathed to us these genetic trails
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380

that lead all over the world before

they're all mixed and mashed together

you know this is probably a good thing

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
you know this is probably a good thing

socially everybody's coming back

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
socially everybody's coming back
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.460
socially everybody's coming back
together and mixing up and it's going to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
together and mixing up and it's going to
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.899
together and mixing up and it's going to
be harder and harder to tell one group

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
be harder and harder to tell one group
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450
be harder and harder to tell one group
from another but it makes our lives very

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
from another but it makes our lives very
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760

very difficult as population geneticists
