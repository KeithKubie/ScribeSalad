00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.660
Andy and I are going to start out
by taking a few measurements.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.200
&gt;&gt; So, what we have are two circles.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.172
We've got a big one,
which is a bike tire.

00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:09.790
And we've got a little one,
which is a pie.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.470
&gt;&gt; We're going to be
measuring the circumference,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.933
which is the length all the way
around the outside of the circle.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.332
And we're also going to be
measuring the diameter,

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:20.165
which is the length across the circle.

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.360
&gt;&gt; All right, so
let's start with the bike tire, and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.682
measure it's circumference.

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:26.570
I'm going to start here and
go all the way round.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.748
Thanks for helping, Rachel.

00:00:29.748 --> 00:00:31.501
And there we go.

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:33.939
Now I'm going to measure the length
of this using the tape measure.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:34.926
Or, Rachel will.

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:38.246
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, and it's 88 inches.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.060
I'm going to write that down.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.375
&gt;&gt; Okay, so now let's measure
the circumference of the pie.

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:52.486
And again, I'm going to start here and
ask Rachel to help hold it.

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:55.169
And go all the way around.

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:57.750
All right, and
when we measure the length of that.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.520
&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's 28.25 inches.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.457
I'll write that down too.

00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:06.895
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:09.940
&gt;&gt; And now, let's measure
the diameter of the bike tire.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.460
Looks like it's 28 inches.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.853
And the diameter of the pie

00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:21.463
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:21.463 --> 00:01:24.980
Is about nine inches.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.194
Now that we've measured
the circumference and

00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:30.930
the diameter of both the bike tire and
the pie, it's time for a quiz.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.000
Divide the circumference
by the diameter for

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.930
both the tire and the pie and
do your answers here.

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:38.460
Round to two decimal places.
