00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For your next homework what I'd like you to do is make a signup page

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that validates a user's input.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It should ask for 4 things--a name, a password, verify the password, and an email address,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which will be optional.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If the user submits something that's invalid, it should print out an error message,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and if it is valid, it should redirect to a welcome page.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'll give you a demo of this now.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here's my signup page. It's running at this URL.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If I were to type in a valid username and passwords and an email

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and click submit, watch the URL.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We get redirected to Welcome--username equals spez--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where it prints out Welcome, spez!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now a couple things that this should do.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If you don't enter a username and you submit, we should get an error message.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Likewise, if we don't enter a password, you should get an error message.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If we submit an invalid username--this one's invalid because it has a space in it,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and I'll include in the notes what a valid username is--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we should still get an error message.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If I include 2 passwords that do not match, I'll also get an error message.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now notice that when we included an invalid username, we kept the username in the form,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but when we included an invalid password, we blanked the passwords.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That is intentional.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The email address is optional.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I can type in 2 matching passwords. I can make this a valid username.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
When I submit this form, it says Welcome.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Okay, all is well.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If I type in an invalid email address, and I'll include for you what makes an email address

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
valid for our purposes, we should get an error message on that field as well.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That's not a valid email.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Be sure to read the notes, and when you've got this all working,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
please enter the URL here. Good luck!
