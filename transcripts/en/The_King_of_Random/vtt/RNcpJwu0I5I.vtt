00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.250
You can turn a mousetrap like this into a fun little 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.160
handgun, that will shoot projectiles with power and 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.020
precision!  In this video we'll be converting these 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.200
traps into affordable little firearms.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.200
I picked up this two-pack of traps for only 98¢.  

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.230
These are the "Tomcat" brand, and I chose them 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.250
because of this yellow bait pad that I'll be using 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.070
later.  I got a piece of 2x2 and cut it to the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.030
height of 4 fingers, and that's going to be my 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.140
handle.  To modify these traps, we'll get them out 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.240
of the packaging, and start by removing the bait pad 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.070
from this heavy duty support staple, and setting it 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.210
to the side.  Using some needle nose pliers, we can 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.200
remove the staple from the base, and grab a marker.  

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.070
We're going to need to place some dots over the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.020
cat's heel bone, the elbow, and one where the ear 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.230
meets the eye.  A drill and an 1/8" bit will help 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.220
turn those dots into holes, that should end up 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.120
looking like this.  I've got 2 screws from a door 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.150
hinge that will work well for fastening the trap 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.240
onto the top of the wood handle.  The back overhangs 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.220
about 1/4" and when the screws are set, the trap is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.230
secure.  Now the locking pin will need to be 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.090
shortened, so holding it over the spring and looking 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.230
down from the top, a mark is made so that it lines 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.110
up just past the remaining hole.  The snips on my 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.140
pliers will cut that to size, and I'm double 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.150
checking that the length is good by holding it next 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.280
to the hole.  It's pretty much flush with the edge, 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.040
so I'll finish it off by bending the tip back just a 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.130
touch, so it angles up at about 45º.  The other trap 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.220
still has a locking pin that can be easily removed, 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.070
and used to help form the trigger for the pistol.  

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.150
This hole is just large enough to allow the trigger 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.100
to pivot freely.  On the top side, I'll cut the pin 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.190
flush with the spring, and then bend it over forming 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.250
a hook shape.  This will prevent it from slipping 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.260
back through the hole.  There's only one thing left 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.140
to do and that's to add this launching pad.  So with 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.210
the hooks facing up, it get's clipped onto the trap 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.000
hammer and slid all the way to the right side.  Then 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.080
we simply lift the hammer up, and tuck the pad 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.010
inward so it lays down flat on the platform.  This 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.190
mousetrap handgun is finished and ready for testing.  

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.010
Setting the firing mechanism works about the same as 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.200
setting the trap, only this time we push the trigger 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.210
up from the bottom so the hook slides over the 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.200
locking pin, catching it in place.  It's a 3 step 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.090
process to pull the hammer back, set the pin, and 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.190
secure it with the trigger hook.  By squeezing the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.270
trigger gently, you can watch the catch slide off 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.100
the pin, causing the gun to fire.  It's time to add 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.040
some ammo and these Airsoft BBs hold perfectly in 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.180
the center groove.  A quick test proves they fire 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180
straight ahead, so I've made a little target for 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.050
practice.  These things are pretty fast, and I'm a 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.010
little surprised the pellets aren't penetrating the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.040
paper, even when shot at close range.  To address 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.160
that problem I'm putting pellets on every hole to 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.050
attempt a shotgun approach.  That's a lot more 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.030
dramatic, and the spread is about 70º, so it's 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.220
obviously more effective closer up.  With a bit of 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.040
practice, it's pretty easy to set, but if you're 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040
feeling lazy, you could just hold the hammer back 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.150
with your thumb, and release when you feel like it.  

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.090
This also opens up an option for a rapid-fire 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.230
approach.  Make sure you stay well back when 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.280
firing because there's a real danger of losing an 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.180
eye when the locking pin snaps back and hits you.  

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.250
Alright, for a little variety, I've placed a penny 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.030
on the launch pad, and it's a powerful shot.  Back 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.150
at my make-shift target range I'm interested to see 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.050
if the penny does any better than the Airsoft 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.190
BBs.  ..And that's a definite yes.  The gun shoots 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.260
straight ahead by moving the ammo forward on the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.080
pad, because the targets are lower, and this is 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.040
essentially a hand held mini-catapult.  It's obvious 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.290
that the coins get the job done, and are 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.160
surprisingly consistent.  By sliding the penny 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.010
further back, the launch angle is  shifted upward 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.060
and targets higher up can be hit, even when the gun 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.220
is held level.  I experimented with other sources of 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.230
ammunition, like this metal washer, a glass pebble, 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.270
a bracelet bead, a bottle cap, and found that pretty 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.040
much anything small and dense like a little stone 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.020
gave satisfying results.  I made some more guns and 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.010
painted this one black because I liked how that 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.180
contrasted against the yellow launch pad.  Well now 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.260
you know how to make a powerful handheld mousetrap 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.120
gun, or maybe two if you're feeling ambitious?  

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.190
That's it for this project.  If you enjoyed this
