00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay, you're doing great. You've really learned a lot of powerful mathematics in the last 20 minutes,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so let's think how we're going to use this.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It doesn't seem to make sense to keep calculating the sine of 37 degrees

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
every single time we encounter a triangle with a 37 degree angle.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This number is never changing. This sine will always be 3/5.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What they did in Eratosthenes' day was calculate large tables of trigonometric ratios.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They would find the sine, cosine, and tangent of a variety of angles and save it away

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
for future reference--here's an example table of trigonometric ratios.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
In the columns, we have sine, cosine, and tangent and we have these values computed for,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
well just a few degrees here--40, 41, 42 degrees.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In a better table, we'd have a larger range of angles and higher resolutions

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so we'd have 40.1 degrees, 40.2 degrees, and so on, but this will work for now.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What this table allows us to do is something really amazing, so let's say we have a triangle and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
it's a right triangle with an angle here of 42 degrees and let's say we know this length its 1000 meters.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
How can I find this length? This is something we haven't done yet.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What I can do is say, "Ah, I know that the ratio of this side to this side is

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
totally independent of how long these sides actually are. "

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In fact, this side being adjacent to 42 degrees and this side being hypotenuse

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
looks like we're going to want to use a cosine which compares adjacent to hypotenuse.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In fact what I can say is that the cosine of 42 degrees which I can look up in my table is 0.743

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
must be equal to the adjacent side, I'll call that x for now, over the hypotenuse

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and the hypotenuse is the length of 1000 meters.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This is a huge, huge tool to have because now all we have to do is multiply by 1000 to solve for x

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and we find that x is equal to 743 meters.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now I'm going to give you a shot. Let's call this unknown length y.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Can you go through a similar set of steps may be you won't be using cosine this time

00:02:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to figure out how long is this side y.
