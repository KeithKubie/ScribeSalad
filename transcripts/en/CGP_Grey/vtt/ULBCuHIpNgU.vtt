00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.220
## Script

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.760
This is not the confederate national flag:

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.330
When the United States split in twain during
the civil war this was the first flag her

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.490
rebel half used: The Bonnie Blue which she
copied from the Republic of West Florida.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.490
No really.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.790
This country existed: a border disagreement
between Spain and the US over the Louisiana

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.160
purchase gave some local rebels an opportunity
take over a fort in 1810, declare independence,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.380
as required with a flag, and run a government
-- for 78 days until The United States put

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.470
an end to that.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.170
*Anyway*, fast forward to the Civil War and
when Mississippi seceded from the Union she

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.700
adopted the flag of the tiny country that
had been within her borders.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.230
And it became the unofficial flag of the rebellion
but not for long.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.350
Blue wouldn't do.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.860
That's a Yankee color.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.190
The new confederate government asked for deigns
submission and got several.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.480
Including one from a German/Prussian artist
in Alabama who possibly took design cues from

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.690
the Austrian Empire.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.690
And Betsy Ross.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.540
(Side note: while we are talking about misnamed
flags, Betsy Ross probably didn't design this

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.340
flag -- there's no evidence to support that
she did, only stories from long after she

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.280
died -- Lady Godivia style.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.550
But we're getting off track here.)

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.940
The confederate government selected this as
her official flag and named it the "Stars

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.900
and Bars" -- so calling this the stars and
bars is wrong on two counts: that's not it's

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.040
name, this is a cross.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.040
These are bars.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.650
New flag adopted off to war, but on the battlefield,
the flag's similarity with the Union's was

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.100
confusing what with all the terror and smoke.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.890
Nonetheless the Confederacy stuck with her
flag, but her Army wanted to avoid friendly

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.350
fire and so took one of the rejected designs
and squarified it into a battle flag.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.590
The navy too, liked this design and eventually
switched, though using a brighter, presumably

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.000
non-yankee blue.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140
The popularity of the official flag decreased
in the confederacy as time went on (even as

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.140
they kept increasing the stars) while the
popularity of the battle flag grew.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.729
So in 1863 the Confederate Government tried
again, and went with white sticking the battle

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.100
flag in the corner.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.221
This was *better* in sense that the flag looked
less like the Yankee's, but *worse* in that

00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:54.790
the international symbol of surrender was
now in the background.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.270
The army stuck with theirs.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.100
Two years later, the confederate government
*again* changed the flag, adding a red bar

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.450
and a new, tough name.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.570
Also, the design *slightly* rectangularlified
the battle flag.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.700
This could no longer be mistaken for surrender
and was the last flag as 36 days later the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.720
confederacy surrendered.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.890
So this design was never technically the flag
of the confederate government -- but... close

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.170
enough.
