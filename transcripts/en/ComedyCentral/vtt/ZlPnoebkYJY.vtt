- We need to get
another car, man.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.447
I ain't gonna lie to you,

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.249

to be pushing this shit.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.752
- Mike, if you don't shut
your fat ass up and push.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.121 align:start size:97% position:3%

the show sees us, that's all.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.722 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Why are you worrying
about people from the show

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.658
seeing us, man, we parked
30 miles away, man we good.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.893
- I'm not sure.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.998
- Bullshit, man, did ya'll

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.278
- Is that your car?

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.780
- [Together] Yeah.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.017
- Broke as fuck, man. (laughs)

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:55.188
Oh, six guys in
one car. (laughs)

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.657
- Shut up, bitch!

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.293
(hip hop music)

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.840 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hey, hey some
softy from the show

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.444
just slid through
my DMs saying "hey"

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.945
- [Together] She trying to fuck.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.081 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Hey, no no no, she just said
"bring one of your friends"

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.782
for her roommate.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:23.616
- Nope.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.985 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Well I know what
you're asking.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.154
- I would, man, but
I got bubble guts.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.156
You don't want me there.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:33.159
- As you can see, I'm very busy.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:33.993
- Mike.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.764 align:start size:88% position:13%
- (laughs) You better
get out of my face, dog.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.199
You know I got a girlfriend.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.267 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Mike, please, come on,
Mike, you gotta come with me.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.502
- Nigga you know I love,

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.137 align:start size:84% position:16%
we just started
having raw sex, man.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.538 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Mike, I know you
love your girl.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.173 align:start size:84% position:16%
We all love your girl.
- What?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.576 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Listen, I promise you,
just sit on the couch

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.711 align:start size:97% position:3%
and ignore the sounds
coming from the other room.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.713
(claps)

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.583
Smashing sounds, Mike.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:02:00.553
I'm just gonna dip
it in and rip it out.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.323 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Don't ever visualize
that to me again, but okay.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.859
- All right guys, tow
truck is on its way.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.794
- Oh god, thank you.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.829
- But it's gonna
cost another $500.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.731
(they groan and complain)

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.932
- Come on man, what the fuck?

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.935 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So we've got to gather
up $500 first, so...

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.738 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You know, if I hadn't
bought some condoms earlier.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.740
- I got two pennies
in the glove box.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.575
- We can't just use the
check from the show?

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.910
- All the banks are
closed right now.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.145
Where we gonna cash it?

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.980
- Emmanuel, why
is that an issue?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.982
We in the hood, you
can cash a check

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.084
at a children's hospital, my G.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.118 align:start size:84% position:16%
- All right, that's
a good point.

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:32.986
Cam, come with me.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.454
- Why I gotta go?

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.222 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Because you've got a
license, I need someone...

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.490
- You ashamed of
being in your 20's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.192
and don't have no
license? (laughs)

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:40.193
- No he not.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.063
- Great, Cam, come with me,

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:47.300
the rest of y'all,
stay by the car.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.302
Me and Cam will be back.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:57.010
(siren sounds in distance)

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.511
- Mike, you ready?

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:03.983
- Hey man, I feel like my ass

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.586
is about to give
birth to gremlins.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:10.957
Hey, I gotta shit man, come
on, we gotta get out of here.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:11.958
- All right.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:17.730
- It's coming around like
my head is coming out.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.737 line:0%
- You look a lot different
in your profile picture.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:25.939
Close enough.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.907
- Gremlins comin
out my ass, oh god.

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.909 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you stripping
to pay tuition?

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.911
Because you look
like a stripper.

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.112 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What's up with
the little guy, huh?

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.347 align:start size:84% position:16%
What are you smiling
at, little guy?

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:35.915
Turn down for what?
