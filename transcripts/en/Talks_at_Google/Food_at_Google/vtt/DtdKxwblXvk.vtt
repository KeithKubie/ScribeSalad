JENNA: And I am
personally super thrilled

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.840
to have today Amanda Haas,
who is not only a cookbook

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.040
author, but a Director of
Culinary for Williams-Sonoma.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.480
And the specific book we're
going to talk about today is

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.070
the "Anti-Inflammation
Cookbook,"

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.450
which I think connects very
deeply with our mission

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.070
to really show you how food
connects to how you can feel,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.790
and how you could
be your best self.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.160
So please join me
in welcoming Amanda.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.616
AMANDA HAAS: Thank
you, everyone.

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:27.560
Hi, thank you, Jenna.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.020
I'm so excited to be here today.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.478
And I think it's
interesting as she

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:32.479
was sharing your
mission with me,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.089
we are very well
aligned in that.

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:35.130
JENNA: Very much so, yes.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.990
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah,
so hello everyone.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.010
What a beautiful space to be in.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.910
As I was preparing
this week and thinking

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.200
about who my audience
was, I was really

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.010
thinking about how your work
affects my life every day.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.240
Like I wake up really
early every morning.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.570
And one of the first things
I do while I make my coffee

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.760
is go to Google
News, and read what's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.830
been perfectly curated
for me every morning,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.120
and get my taste of the world.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.270
And then get on with my day,
and do something like come here,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.590
and it's Google Maps.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.470
And then I get to
work, or I come here,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.030
and I'm with my family,
and what do I do all day?

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.870
I Google things.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.130
And so you have made my life so
much easier through your work.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.160
And it's so meaningful.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.324
So it's a real
pleasure for me to get

00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:14.990
to share my passion
and my work with you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.440
all today, even for this
short amount of time.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.070
So two of the things that I'm
the most passionate about.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.840
One is teaching
people how to cook.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.700
So I don't know how
many of you spend

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.970
a lot of time in the kitchen.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.560
But I love instructing
and teaching people

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200
how to cook every day.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.650
And then the other
thing I love is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.460
this conversation between
what we eat and how we feel.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.850
And as it pertains
to inflammation.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.890
So that's going to be a
part of the conversation

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.420
that we'll just weave into
the cooking piece today.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.275
So thank you for spending
this time with me.

00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:44.900
I know that there
are many other things

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.490
you could be doing today.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.310
So start off with a
question, how many of you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.820
have seen the movie
"Ratatouille?"

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.985
Oh.

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:55.570
Almost everybody,
I'm not the only one.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.140
I think it's my
favorite Pixar movie.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.520
We'll see if "Finding
Dory" beats it this summer.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.650
But the thing I love about that
movie, if you haven't seen it,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.160
is that there's
this great theme.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.240
And Remi, the rat, who's
so inspired to cook,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.180
and doesn't care
that he's a rat,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.870
worships Chef Gusteau, right?

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.340
And Chef Gusteau, the Parisian
chef who'd won all the awards,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.580
and is a great cook, and
has his Michelin stars,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.890
his motto was anyone can cook.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.170
And when I saw
that movie it just

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.100
really resonated with me because
I do think anyone can cook.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.710
But as an instructor
and a cookbook author,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.390
I think a lot of
the responsibility

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.030
is on me to teach you how to do
that and how to write recipes.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.920
Or talk to you in
a way that makes

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.700
it so easy you want
to go home and try

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.520
to recreate these things today.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.730
So whether you are nine or
you're 60, it doesn't matter.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.980
Hopefully when you
leave here today

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.420
you'll want to
take these recipes

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.940
and make them for
yourselves at home.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.320
The other part of this
conversation that we'll have

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.600
is, why should we even care
about inflammation or food,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.300
and how it makes us feel?

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.630
And for me, it's a
really personal journey,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.860
like it is for everyone.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.710
And food is such
a personal thing.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.969
But basically over
the last 20 years

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.760
I've been suffering
from some health things

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.650
that no one could
really explain.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.130
We joke that I kind
of look normal,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.190
but I didn't feel normal.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.180
So you know, allergies,
and asthma, and eczema,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.400
and then I started getting
chronic heartburn as I aged.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.969
And then got signs of
rheumatoid arthritis

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.010
that we couldn't explain.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.032
So all of these problems, and
back problems my whole life.

00:03:25.032 --> 00:03:27.240
And it was so interesting
because I tried everything.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.990
I tried all kinds
of regular medicine.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.120
I tried East meets
West-- acupuncture,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.340
acupressure, physical therapy.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.740
And about seven years ago I
walked into an allergist's

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.450
office, and I started
listing my ailments,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.880
and I was crying because
about once a year I

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.720
would just be so upset
about this, wondering

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.360
why can't I get better?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.680
And he stopped me, and
he said, Amanda, there's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.340
some really good news here.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.740
Everything that you're
talking about is inflammation.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.320
It's just a different form
of inflammation in your body.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.640
And all that meant was
that your body is reacting

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.080
to some outside irritant.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.377
So he said, guess what?

00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:00.960
You're a cook.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.882
You can fix this.

00:04:01.882 --> 00:04:03.590
I know that there's
something that you're

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.880
eating that is making
you feel terrible.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.500
And it's showing itself in all
of these ridiculous things that

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.900
are going on with you.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.246
So he sent me away.

00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:13.120
And he also said, and
once you figure it out,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.100
you've got to do
something about it.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.016
You've got to like shout
it from the rooftops,

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:17.089
if you can fix this.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.579
So he told me, quit gluten.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.870
I don't want you having a
bite of gluten for two weeks,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.100
and tell me what happens.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.740
And fortunately
or unfortunately,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.860
the changes were so
profound within two days,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.300
I couldn't even believe it.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.010
And so I was almost
angry at myself

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.150
that that's the last
thing that I'd turned to.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.350
That I used food as my last
solution, instead of the first.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.170
And so what happened is
it became super empowering

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.820
to know that what I was eating
could make me feel great,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.570
or it could make me feel
terrible really quickly.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.410
And that every choice I make
when I sit down at the table

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.130
affects my well-being.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.080
So this book is a
culmination of that journey.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.130
And hopefully it
pertains to a lot of us

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.180
because it's not just
about what I can't have,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.310
or what I can have, it's
more about explaining

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.990
what's gone on with food,
and why so many of us

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.710
are reacting to
different types of food

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.060
now that we didn't used
to have problems with.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.370
And the whole idea
that, let's explain it

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.550
with this great doctor who has
spoken to Google before Dr.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.810
Bradley Jacobs.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.225
He talks about the ingredients,
and why a lot of us

00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:16.850
are struggling.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.860
And then I say, let's just
throw those out the window,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.590
and let's cook with ingredients
that make us feel really great.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.190
So Gusteau said anyone can cook.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.750
I think if I had
a motto mine would

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.350
be, I want people
to say about me,

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.020
her food tastes
so good you don't

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.150
care that it's good for you.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.851
It's just delicious,
and comforting,

00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:34.350
and all of those
things, and it just

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.120
happens to be really,
really good for you.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.620
So today we're going to cook
two of my favorite recipes

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.374
from the book.

00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:41.040
JENNA: Excellent

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.998
AMANDA HAAS: And I'm
going to use Jenna to help

00:05:42.998 --> 00:05:44.710
get me going on all of this.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.670
And I am not a vegetarian.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.720
Are there any vegetarians here?

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.350
One, two, OK, a couple, three.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.110
Yeah, so as I've kind
of been on this road

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.620
to wellness I definitely
realized I was

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.585
eating too much animal protein.

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.210
And I've been taking
a greater interest

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.760
in understanding
where it comes from,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.210
and what animal protein
I'm choosing to eat.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.750
So that being said, I wanted
to develop some recipes that

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.920
are much more approachable and
delicious that are vegetarian

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.460
for my family to eat all week.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.070
And that are really
simple to make.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.950
So I cheated in the spirit
of television, right.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.560
You can just speed things up
a little bit for us today.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.860
JENNA: Google Vision.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.609
AMANDA HAAS: Google
Vision, we'll call it,

00:06:22.609 --> 00:06:24.710
right, I love that.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.650
This is a red lentil curry
that I'm going to make.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.830
And all I did to start was
start sauteing some onions.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.655
So many cultures
and so many recipes

00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:35.780
start with something like,
put some oil in the pan,

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.965
put it over medium heat,
saute for eight to 10 minutes

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:42.870
the onions until they're
soft and translucent.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.810
I like to remind people that we
want to look for visual cues,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.310
right?

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.820
I can write it and say, cook
them for six to eight minutes.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.530
But everybody cooks differently,
temperatures are different.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.260
And so you can see
here I let them get

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.360
pretty brown and caramelized.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.860
The sugars have
released, and that's

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.250
why they'll be brown,
and soft, and delicious.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.110
If you were just to
throw all of this liquid

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.670
in without doing that, you
wouldn't soften the onions,

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.610
and you would never get
any of that sweetness.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.710
So we want that, the fancy
term, the maillard reaction,

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.270
of the onions to
cook and the sugars

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.895
to be released to
come out because it's

00:07:12.895 --> 00:07:15.306
going to add so much flavor
to what we're making.

00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:17.680
So you're going to see this
in a million types of recipes

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.420
from all around the globe.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.910
And it's a really nice
way to start things.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.790
So my onions went for
probably six to eight minutes.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.820
And now I'm going
to add some garlic.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.830
This just goes for about
a minute because garlic

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.929
burns really quickly.

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:32.470
And if it burns you're going to
get that really bitter taste.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.636
And it's going to spread
throughout the curry, which

00:07:34.636 --> 00:07:35.260
we don't want.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.250
We want it to still be
delicious and sweet.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.410
So I'm going to add that.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.900
Garlic and onions are both
from the allium family,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.430
which have amazing
anti-inflammatory properties

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.300
on their own and help
with digestion too.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.090
I've got fresh ginger.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.980
And we talk a lot in the
book about ingredients

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.470
and the positive
benefits of them.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.030
What's interesting
in Asia, and as I

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.140
try to educate myself
more on Asian cuisines,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.590
everywhere from Thailand,
which this kind of comes from,

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.790
to India, they've all been
using spices and herbs that are

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.570
really good for us for ages.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.910
And so I had to get
away from pulling

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.520
from a lot of the Mediterranean
recipes I'm familiar with.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.560
And try to pull in the rest
of the world in my cooking.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.851
JENNA: Yeah, I think global
spice perspective is really

00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:22.120
important, especially
in bringing flavor

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.640
to things like vegetables
without a ton of salt,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.010
or sugars, or oils.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.760
Like you can really build a
lot of foundational flavor

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.800
just through spices.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.258
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah,
it's incredible.

00:08:32.258 --> 00:08:33.840
And I think that
a lot of times I

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.276
use salt generously when I cook.

00:08:35.276 --> 00:08:37.150
But the thing is when
you're cooking at home,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.664
you'll never use as much
salt as in a restaurant,

00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:40.289
which is great.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.205
JENNA: You really don't
want to know generally

00:08:42.205 --> 00:08:43.072
restaurant recipes.

00:08:43.072 --> 00:08:44.030
AMANDA HAAS: You don't.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.194
And so I don't worry about
how much not salt I add.

00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:46.860
JENNA: Not here.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.940
AMANDA HAAS: Right, yeah.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.500
But not here.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.080
Never.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.205
JENNA: Never, never, never.

00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:53.134
AMANDA HAAS: But the thing is,
spices give you so much flavor

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:54.550
that you'll probably
find yourself

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.650
cooking with less salt, if
you're using a lot of spices.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.720
JENNA: Absolutely agree.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.969
AMANDA HAAS: So I just put
in a blend of Garam Masala,

00:09:00.969 --> 00:09:02.660
and they can vary
a little bit what's

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.810
in it-- coriander, cumin,
I can't name all of them

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:05.490
off the bat.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.270
But it's like a really
nice warm blend of spices.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.040
And it's just going to
add a ton of flavor.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.740
And then I added
this red chili paste,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.130
which it doesn't want
to move around the pan.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.000
But that's OK.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.760
It's going to dissolve
a little bit when

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.340
I add my other ingredients.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.830
I'm going to turn up the heat on
this amazing induction cooktop

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.671
that you have.

00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:25.920
All I'm looking for here is
to cook this a little bit.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.800
So if you can see in this
pot, the red chili paste

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.060
is going to turn a little
bit more brick in color.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.640
It's going to turn a
little more orange.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.630
And that's just bringing
out the flavors in it,

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.490
again, before we add
those other things.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.100
Is there an oil I
prefer to cook with?

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.280
So I talk about different
oils in the book.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.400
I love olive oil for a
lot of the things I do.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.800
I'm using canola oil in this,
which has some great health

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.410
benefits as well.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.380
It's a really
neutral tasting oil.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.210
So if I don't want the oil to
be the strong flavor in it,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.060
I'll usually cook with canola.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.660
And the one thing that
I look for in oils, I do

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.150
look for organic and non-GMO
because so many of those things

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.530
can be sprayed so
heavily with pesticides.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.491
Canola is one of those.

00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:10.240
So there are some great
ones on the market

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.156
now that you can find
at your local store that

00:10:12.156 --> 00:10:15.730
say non-GMO and organic for a
fairly inexpensive price, which

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.630
is great.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.800
So can you see how that
all just looks dark.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.440
And look at all that stuff
on the bottom of the pan, all

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.940
that brown stuff.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.300
It's what I like to
call yummy goodness.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.259
JENNA: Yum yums, I think
is the technical term.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:28.050
AMANDA HAAS: It is.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.130
I'm pretty sure it is.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.671
JENNA: The yum
yums at the bottom

00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:32.170
AMANDA HAAS: And
so basically that's

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.570
all of that
caramelized goodness.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.070
And you don't want
to get rid of it.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.920
You want to be able to bring it
into the flavors of what you're

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.420
making.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.120
The fancy term of what I
just did, we're deglazing.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.230
And so see how I can
lift off all of that.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.840
I put some cold
liquid in the pan,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.260
and it's going to react with
the food on the bottom of it,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.090
and just lift it right up.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.500
So I just put in a little
of my liquid to start.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.690
And all of that is going to
become part of this foundation

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.780
for this curry,
which is delicious.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.950
So whether you're doing a
vegetarian dish like this,

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.460
or you're doing something that's
meat-based, like a protein,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.370
you know steak, beef
caramelizes really

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:13.430
well like that, you want all of
that back up into your sauce.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.070
We would never want
to throw it away

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.346
unless you happen
to really burn it.

00:11:17.346 --> 00:11:19.249
You would have to start fresh.

00:11:19.249 --> 00:11:21.790
But now that it's in I'm going
to crank this up a little bit,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.030
and add the rest of my liquids.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.620
OK, great.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.078
So I'm going to
bring it up to high

00:11:26.078 --> 00:11:28.065
just to bring it to a simmer.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.350
Water is a very
underutilized ingredient

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.310
I think when you cook.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.580
And it's kind of like were
just talking about oils.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.270
When you want something neutral,
but you need the liquid,

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.879
don't forget about it right.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.920
You could certainly do
chicken stock or vegetable

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.199
stock, if you wanted.

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:46.240
But you're adding another
flavor component there.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.450
So I'll use water
when I don't have

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.680
stock for things like risotto.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.020
You can totally use it to
interchange with things.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.830
And I just don't
want stock competing

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.339
with these other flavors that
I've got going on in the pot.

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:00.130
JENNA: Interesting.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:00.879
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:04.070
So now what we're going to do is
just add a couple more liquids.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.120
And this is so easy
in that you're just

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.740
putting a bunch of
things in at once,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.920
and then we're going
to let it simmer.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.700
We're going to add
the other components.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.907
Coconut milk.

00:12:11.907 --> 00:12:13.490
You guys can read
in the book as well,

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.730
coconut oil got a really
bad rap for a long time

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:16.920
because we were refining it.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.910
But it is we're finding
basically that great rule

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.550
of thumb that if it
comes from nature,

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.700
it's probably good for you.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.040
JENNA: Yeah, if
you leave it alone.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.790
AMANDA HAAS: Right,
if you leave it alone.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.170
And so coconut oil is
having a total comeback.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.872
JENNA: Oh yeah,
so hot right now.

00:12:29.872 --> 00:12:31.330
AMANDA HAAS: It's
so hot right now.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.450
It really is.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.350
Coconut milk, I
love cooking with.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.100
And again, it's giving you
that awesome depth of flavor,

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.980
and some fat to add
flavor when you're

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.520
cooking vegetarian things.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.390
Fat is flavor, as we like to
say in the culinary world.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.850
And so I think a lot of people
when they love to crave steak,

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.029
and crave chicken
with skin, and things

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:52.320
like that, it's the fat that
we love in our diet, which

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.880
can be really good for us.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.640
But I love to look for
things that can replace them.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.080
I'm going to add some lime
juice too for the acid,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.304
so it balances the
richness of the coconut.

00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:05.470
And then, Jenna, I wasn't
talking to you about this.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.345
Who was I talking to?

00:13:06.345 --> 00:13:06.950
Oh, with Chef.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.491
I was talking to
Chef Didi about this

00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:12.255
at the beginning, how agave
syrup is already a hot thing.

00:13:12.255 --> 00:13:14.380
We're already starting to
see in the food community

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.660
that we're probably not
that crazy about it anymore.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.650
And that the best natural
sweeteners are honey and maple

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.744
syrup, as you find
them in nature.

00:13:21.744 --> 00:13:23.660
And so it's interesting
because they think now

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.610
agave syrup can spike
your blood sugar

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.165
in ways that were
not crazy about.

00:13:27.165 --> 00:13:28.440
JENNA: That's so interesting.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.040
AMANDA HAAS: Right?

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.581
Because it's got
more fructose in it.

00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:32.950
JENNA: Yeah, but that
was kind of counter

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.640
indicated a couple years ago.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.104
AMANDA HAAS: Exactly.

00:13:36.104 --> 00:13:37.770
JENNA: You always
have to pay attention.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.195
The food world
evolves so quickly.

00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:40.570
AMANDA HAAS: It
does, and I think

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.330
you can't chase every trend.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.730
But I think, again, it comes
back to some common sense.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.350
And what I loved about having
a doctor partner with me

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.030
on the book is that he could
kind of prove my hypotheses.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.510
And he was saying,
you know stick

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.051
to things that are natural, and
just don't use a ton of them.

00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:56.870
So agave I was using.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.610
But I've switched
to honey at home,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.504
and I put maple
syrup when I need to.

00:14:01.504 --> 00:14:02.795
I put maple syrup in my coffee.

00:14:02.795 --> 00:14:04.490
I don't know why I
think that's tasty.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.074
But I love it.

00:14:05.074 --> 00:14:06.073
JENNA: That's delicious.

00:14:06.073 --> 00:14:07.460
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah,
so we're going

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.740
to do a little agave for sweet.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.770
And just bring this up
to a simmer before I add

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.240
the lentils.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.560
And then we're going to
let those cook for about 10

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.840
or 15 minutes on their own.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.290
And then just put in some
vegetables to finish it off.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.730
And that's the dish.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.067
So it's pretty straightforward.

00:14:24.067 --> 00:14:26.400
The one thing to keep in mind
as you're making something

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.610
like this is that you can
totally make it your own.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.130
So a lot of times we'll
do chicken in this.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.990
If I have a chicken or I roast
a chicken, I'll add part of that

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.600
into this dish.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.970
You could do tofu,
if you are vegetarian

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.160
and you want another
source of protein.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.680
You can switch up your veggies
to whatever's seasonal.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.620
JENNA: Sure.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.120
AMANDA HAAS: If you
want more color,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.099
I'll put broccoli in it
instead of cauliflower.

00:14:47.099 --> 00:14:48.390
JENNA: Bell pepper even, maybe.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.830
AMANDA HAAS: Bell pepper
would be delicious.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.288
And I would probably
cook those off

00:14:51.288 --> 00:14:54.160
with the onion at the beginning
just to kind of caramelize

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.810
and sweeten those
up a little bit.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.932
So far so good?

00:14:57.932 --> 00:14:59.640
JENNA: Curry can be
a good kitchen clean.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.140
Like, oh what do I have
in the veggie basket?

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.857
AMANDA HAAS: I totally
agree with you.

00:15:03.857 --> 00:15:05.190
And that's normally how I do it.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.580
I was laughing when I saw
this recipe because I'm

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.121
like, when's the
last time I actually

00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:10.535
cooked the recipe like this?

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.800
I was like it's
normally I always

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.700
have something green
in my refrigerator.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.284
Or the other thing I love
to do is roast vegetables

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:19.200
off at a really high
heat because, again, they

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.560
get caramelized and sweet.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.260
So if you think people
don't like cauliflower,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.850
I don't know if you like
cauliflower over here,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.760
roasted it's a lot sweeter.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.470
So you can always
roast off vegetables,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.511
and then put them in here
at the last minute too.

00:15:33.511 --> 00:15:35.330
And it gives a different
element of flavor.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.370
So you can see that
everything's simmering now,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.020
which is right what I want.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.390
Got my water.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.927
Do we have a lid
for this big pot?

00:15:43.927 --> 00:15:44.510
We'll get one.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.840
Thank you, Chef.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.280
And all I'm going to do is
turn it down with the lid on.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.100
And let it simmer,
which means I just

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.580
want a little bit of a bubble
going when the lid's on.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.610
If steam is coming
out of it like crazy,

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.380
you'll know that
we are cooking it

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.800
at too high of a temperature.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.530
So can someone be my
volunteer to watch

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.670
the clock for about
10 minutes, 10 or 15,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.150
and let me when time's up?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.790
Thank you.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.756
Thank you, lovely
assistant over there.

00:16:09.756 --> 00:16:11.340
JENNA: Thank you.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.940
AMANDA HAAS: So let's
put a lid on it.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.720
And then we'll move
on to another recipe

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.800
while we're waiting
for this one to finish.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.130
I think three will be good.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.330
OK, great.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.420
So this literally when
it's done cooking there,

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.840
we're just going to
add our vegetables in.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.970
And then I'm going
to teach you how

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.490
to season it, and taste for
flavorings at the end of it.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.660
But great recipe to take home,
and make your own, and really

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.480
just practice kind of
the foundation of it,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.470
and going from there.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.680
JENNA: And what would you
generally serve that with?

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.054
AMANDA HAAS: So I like to
serve it kind of as the entree.

00:16:39.054 --> 00:16:42.380
And today you will try
it with some brown rice.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.900
So it's really nice if you
want to do it like that.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.320
This would be a really typical
weeknight meal in my house

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.653
because you could make it ahead.

00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:51.630
And actually the flavors
develop even more, which I love.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.030
So with some rice,
or even quinoa

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.670
if you wanted on the
side would be great.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.660
It'd be really great.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.160
We're just going to do
a little change here.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.860
And then let's talk
about our quinoa

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.069
while we get ready to
do the whole salad.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.560
Who here likes quinoa?

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.839
Yeah.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:10.980
It's been a total change.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.020
No, shaking your head.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.530
You're in the same camp
I was for a long time.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.319
So when the lovely
doctor told me

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.430
I couldn't have gluten
anymore, my first thought

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.874
was I was going to
get fired from my job

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:24.200
because we create
products all day long

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.250
that are full of gluten.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.180
You know like amazing baked
goods, and cookies, and bread.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.386
So that was my first fear.

00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:31.760
And then my second
was that I was

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.500
going to have to learn how to
like quinoa because it really

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.870
never did it for me.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.060
I love couscous.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.870
I love all those great
grain salads you could get.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.700
But a couple of tricks,
which I learned,

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.756
which are so much better.

00:17:42.756 --> 00:17:44.130
And Jenna, do you
mind handing me

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.530
that chinois, that big sieve
that's down on the end?

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.030
Thank you so much.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.400
One is that quinoa naturally
has a natural pesticide

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.760
on it called saponins.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.184
And when you rinse the
quinoa, you rinse that off.

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:58.100
So if any of you ever
had it, and you're like,

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.266
there's this taste about
it that you just don't like

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:01.740
or I can't identify,
it's probably

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.459
the saponins on the quinoa.

00:18:03.459 --> 00:18:04.250
JENNA: Fascinating.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.190
AMANDA HAAS: Weird, right?

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.930
JENNA: Yeah, I never heard that.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.346
AMANDA HAAS: Right, so it's
like to rinse or not to rinse?

00:18:08.346 --> 00:18:09.740
Now, to rinse is what I say.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.710
So you rinse those off.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.130
And then it's a really
easy formula for cooking.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.590
And it's just like rice.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.920
So I love formulas
when I'm cooking,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.837
just so that you do it
once, and you remember.

00:18:20.837 --> 00:18:22.878
JENNA: I think you're
speaking to the right crowd

00:18:22.878 --> 00:18:23.696
in that regard.

00:18:23.696 --> 00:18:25.890
AMANDA HAAS: Am I?

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.440
I love it.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.023
I love having a foundation, and
then you can make it your own.

00:18:29.023 --> 00:18:31.360
But with quinoa, like rice,
all you're going to do

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.590
is two parts water
to one part quinoa.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.720
It's that simple.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.010
And a little bit of
salt. Again, if you

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:42.610
wanted to put it in a stock you
could if you want more flavor

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.110
in that.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.410
I usually just do it with water,
and then a little bit of salt,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.810
and you're good to go.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.880
So I'm just going to put
this right in the pot.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.122
And then I'm going
to eyeball my water.

00:18:54.122 --> 00:18:55.580
You know what I
love about cooking,

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.560
and this is why I'm not a great
baker, because it doesn't have

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.600
to be that exact all the time.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.630
It's OK to eyeball things,
or change out ingredients

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.320
when you have something else.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.830
So you start with
that foundation,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.110
and then you get to
make it your own.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.420
Put this over here.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.670
Jenna, I'm going to have you
watch some of this stuff.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.820
No actually, I'm going to put
you to work on the vinaigrette

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.140
as well.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:18.660
I forgot--

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:18.740
JENNA: I don't know.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.640
AMANDA HAAS: --I have
another job for you.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.730
So this is literally how
we're going to do this, folks.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.234
Two parts water.

00:19:26.234 --> 00:19:27.150
JENNA: Very technical.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.790
AMANDA HAAS: Very,
very technical, right?

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.185
Pinch of salt. I always keep
salt and pepper at the cooktop.

00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:35.310
You know they're going to
be your best friends when

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.220
you cook.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.610
And another thing to remember
is that you taste all the time

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.110
as a cook.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.400
You know if you wait until the
end sometimes it's too late.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.360
So you want to be
tasting as you go.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.920
And you'll watch me
taste the lentils

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.650
before I add the
veggies back in just

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.470
to kind of see where
we are on the flavors.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.500
I'm pretty sure it's
going to need salt.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.470
And I'll do the same
thing as I cook and make

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.610
these other things for you.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.460
So always make
sure you're tasting

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.350
and adjusting as you go.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.470
Now let's see if I can
use this fancy cooktop.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.362
I can.

00:20:03.362 --> 00:20:05.070
JENNA: So how long
for quinoa, generally?

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.153
AMANDA HAAS: So quinoa is
really easy in that it's

00:20:07.153 --> 00:20:10.120
about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.140
Can you guys see
actually on my spoon

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.940
how are these tiny, cute,
little grains right?

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.800
They're actually seeds.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.900
It's going to split.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.710
And it's going to give
this cute little white seam

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.584
on the outside of it.

00:20:20.584 --> 00:20:22.714
So all we're looking
for it to do is split.

00:20:22.714 --> 00:20:25.130
And you can overcook it just
like you'd overcook anything.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.890
It's certainly not
the end of the world.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.190
But I'm probably going to
check it at about 12 minutes.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.740
And then let it
go as long as 20.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.067
So we'll see how
hot this cooktop is,

00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:37.900
and give it a whirl.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.820
I'm going to let that come to a
boil before I put a lid on it.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.410
JENNA: All right,
what's the plan?

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.243
AMANDA HAAS: So the
next plan, what we'll do

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.130
is we'll make the
vinaigrette for the quinoa

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.399
while we're waiting for
these other things to cook.

00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:50.315
How many of you have
made vinaigrettes before?

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.359
Yeah, OK, fantastic.

00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:55.900
One of the things
that I love, Jenna,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.389
is that if you go and you buy
salad dressing or vinaigrette

00:20:58.389 --> 00:21:00.180
at the store, it's one
of those things that

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.430
can be loaded with
sodium and salt.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.980
And you don't need the
extra fillers in them.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.320
They're so easy to make at home.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.170
When people ask me
what's one of the best

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.340
things you could do
for yourself at home,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.710
I say make vinaigrettes.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.340
And you can do a big batch.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.520
I love to just make
a huge thing of it.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.592
And again, it's about
proportions and ratios.

00:21:18.592 --> 00:21:19.800
So we're going to learn that.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.760
And then you just
keep them around.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.910
Oh, I love how everything
is made for us here.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:26.466
It's amazing.

00:21:26.466 --> 00:21:28.215
Do you want to bring
this up here for you?

00:21:28.215 --> 00:21:28.715
JENNA: Sure.

00:21:28.715 --> 00:21:30.890
AMANDA HAAS: And then I'm
going to grab the garlic.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:35.217
And then we're going to just do
one really basic vinaigrette.

00:21:35.217 --> 00:21:36.800
People always ask
me, especially where

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.879
I work at Williams-Sonoma, we
sell the most amazing tools

00:21:39.879 --> 00:21:41.420
ever, they're like
what do you really

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.710
have to have in your kitchen?

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.720
Like a knife, a great knife A
great knife and a great cutting

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.220
board.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.200
I love both things.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.500
So I'm going to show you a
little trick today with one

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.360
of my favorite knives.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.609
And first, I'm going to just
push down on that garlic.

00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:53.620
See how I do that?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.190
Because I want to mince it, and
I want to get it really fine.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.250
But this salt is going
to act as an abrasive.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.890
So when you go to
chop it it's just

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.670
going to kind of like
bring it together.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.382
It's really, really easy.

00:22:04.382 --> 00:22:06.090
And then I'm going to
have you finish off

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.050
the vinaigrette for us.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.070
JENNA: For sure,
that's a fun trick.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.097
I didn't know that one.

00:22:09.097 --> 00:22:11.180
AMANDA HAAS: It's kind of
like a little chef hack.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.810
You look really
serious and fancy,

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.370
and it's not that hard to do.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.730
Can I get a second timer for my
quinoa please for 12 minutes?

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.784
Thank you.

00:22:20.784 --> 00:22:23.200
All right so I just sprinkled
a little bit of kosher salt.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.570
Kosher salt's got a
larger grain to it.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.050
And I put that on the garlic.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.508
And now watch what
I'm going to do.

00:22:28.508 --> 00:22:30.140
I'm just going to
start chopping.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.690
You can hold it.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.320
You guys see how I'm
holding the knife?

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.020
Just got my thumb and my index
finger around it like this.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.522
It creates stability.

00:22:38.522 --> 00:22:40.480
And what you'll see is
that all I'm going to do

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.000
is rock my wrist.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.400
I'm not going to be taking
the knife up like this.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.190
You can usually just keep the
tip of your knife on the board.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.520
And you let your
wrist do the work.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.950
So I'm just going to
start to chop this.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.040
But it would be a lot
more slippery if I

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.080
didn't have the salt on it.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.740
And then what you can do is
kind of press all this together.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.050
And this is going to help
me form like really finally

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.469
chopped pieces of garlic.

00:23:04.469 --> 00:23:05.260
JENNA: Fascinating.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.801
AMANDA HAAS: So if
you do a ton of it

00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:09.420
at once it's actually easier
if you have a bunch of cloves

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.190
because you've got more surface
area kind of to work with.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.460
But I just kind of press it.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.530
It's kind of fun, right?

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.490
You look really
grown up and serious.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.730
Morgan over there has
got this mastered.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.810
So great.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.390
Just keep bringing it back
together and chopping away.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.955
I just don't want really
huge chunks of it.

00:23:29.955 --> 00:23:32.080
So when you're eating the
salad, you're like, whoa,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.860
I just got so much garlic.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.020
Again, it's so great for
just digestion garlic is.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.790
And so I try to use
it whenever I can.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.820
And in vinaigrettes it adds
a great layer of flavor.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.500
OK, so I'm putting
this in as my base

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.720
because this is one
of my favorites.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.327
Who's ready to talk formula?

00:23:53.327 --> 00:23:54.160
JENNA: What you got?

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.294
AMANDA HAAS: OK, really easy.

00:23:56.294 --> 00:23:57.710
The opinions have
changed on this,

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.560
but I like to use two parts
oil to one part acid when

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.990
you're making a vinaigrette.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.670
And then usually if you
don't want to be broken

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.666
you can use a binder.

00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:06.165
JENNA: OK.

00:24:06.165 --> 00:24:08.670
AMANDA HAAS: So You can use as
much of a binder as you want.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.880
Some of the ones we
love to use, mustard,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.000
so like a Dijon mustard, it'll
bring it all together for you,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.170
mayonnaise I love mayonnaise
a little too much.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.750
You could use egg yolk, you
know that's a classic one.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.790
People also in very old styles
of cooking use blood, not a fan

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:26.544
personally.

00:24:26.544 --> 00:24:28.210
Haven't done that
since culinary school,

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.812
and I probably will never again.

00:24:30.812 --> 00:24:31.520
JENNA: Maybe not.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.228
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah,
no, I'll pass on that.

00:24:33.228 --> 00:24:34.110
Thank you very much.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.220
Not my thing.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.436
So I'm starting with garlic.

00:24:36.436 --> 00:24:38.310
And you could add any
aromatic that you want.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.350
You could add fresh
herbs if you want.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.544
You can add something
for sweetness.

00:24:42.544 --> 00:24:43.960
But now all I want
to do is I want

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.710
to start by adding my binder.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.590
So Jenna, if you want
to put the Dijon in.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.780
Do you need a little spoon?

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.710
There you go.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.310
And then we have
a whisk for you.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.070
Perfect.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.600
I start with a
pinch of salt, guys.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.810
And then now I want
you to take your acid.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.949
So today we're
using lemon juice.

00:25:03.949 --> 00:25:06.490
This is kind of my version of
like a healthy Caesar dressing,

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:07.810
if you wanted to do.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.810
And I just want you
to whisk that in.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.680
If you wanted you
could use orange juice,

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.545
lime juice, balsamic vinegar.

00:25:14.545 --> 00:25:15.670
You know there are so many.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.730
I use a lot of sherry vinegar.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.440
So completely depends
on your taste.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.250
When I'm making
salads that I want

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.930
to taste really fresh and clean,
I usually go toward citrus.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.632
I just love the flavor of strong
citrus in my vinaigrettes.

00:25:28.632 --> 00:25:29.340
JENNA: All right.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.670
AMANDA HAAS: So look
at how easy that is?

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.711
See, already figured out.

00:25:31.711 --> 00:25:33.440
So that was your one part acid.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.090
And now you need two parts oil.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.120
JENNA: All right, what
kind of oil are we using?

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.420
AMANDA HAAS: We're
going to use olive oil.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.211
And we're just going
to eyeball this again,

00:25:39.211 --> 00:25:40.952
crazy people that we are.

00:25:40.952 --> 00:25:42.160
JENNA: Getting crazy in here.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.493
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah, so you can
add a little bit to start,

00:25:44.493 --> 00:25:45.620
and whisk it in.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.880
And you'll see it
start to come together.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.380
One of the coolest
things about this

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.280
too is if you whisk too quickly,
and you're not emulsifying

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.860
as you go, doesn't matter.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.140
Just put it in a jar, and
shake it as hard as you can.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.080
And it'll bring
it back together.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.810
You've clearly done
this once or twice.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:02.900
JENNA: I don't know
what you're talking.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.360
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah, she's
like, no, I don't know.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.680
I just do it every day.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.020
JENNA: First time.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.920
AMANDA HAAS: But so
far, so good right?

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.040
Not too hard to do.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.840
But it can totally change
the way your food tastes.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.560
And it's a really easy
thing to do at home.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.820
My younger son thinks
he's super cool because he

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.150
can make a vinaigrette right?

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.240
And it sounds super fancy.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.110
JENNA: Pretty
cool, I don't know.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.310
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.274
But it's nice to have around.

00:26:25.274 --> 00:26:26.690
Then when you come
home from work,

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.360
it's so much easier
to make a salad.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.734
JENNA: You, make
the vinaigrette.

00:26:29.734 --> 00:26:30.620
You wash the greens.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:30.870
AMANDA HAAS: Yes.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:31.630
JENNA: You, chop the veggies.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.130
AMANDA HAAS: Exactly.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:32.950
JENNA: I like it.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.930
AMANDA HAAS: Exactly.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.050
You'll just see all kinds of
Mason jars in my refrigerator.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.300
It looks like a little
scientist's workshop, right.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.200
There's balsamic, there's
a citrus one usually.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.890
I like to do one if I'm
making Mexican food where--

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:46.780
Oh, thank you.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.030
I've got my queue
to check my lentils.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.460
--I'll do some with like
a chipotle and adobo,

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.340
and use that as the base.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.710
And then add honey and
orange juice and oil.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.810
One of my favorites, or lime
juice should be good too.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.000
Check it out.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.090
This looks good.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.990
I'm going to taste, like
I promised you I would.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.630
Let's see.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.112
It's tasty, but it needs
more salt, for sure.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.510
Oh let's add the veggies now.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.200
Let's be wild.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.944
Not too much is
going to go wrong.

00:27:20.944 --> 00:27:23.360
That's the other thing about
cooking when people are like,

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.540
what if I mess it up?

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.510
Guess what, who cares?

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.830
It's so cool to be cooking.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.010
And people love when you
cook for them, right.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.930
And so sometimes we mess up.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.560
My family has to eat
all of my mistakes.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.130
There are a lot of them.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.400
JENNA: That's good
lessons always too.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.380
Then what you did wrong,
you don't do it again.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.912
AMANDA HAAS: Absolutely.

00:27:40.912 --> 00:27:43.120
You know especially cooking
my way through this book,

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.490
where I had to use
different ingredients than I

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.300
was used to or more of
things than I was used to,

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.870
I messed up a ton.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.540
But it's kind of fun.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.590
It's part of the journey.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.673
JENNA: How long did it
take you to write the book?

00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:55.910
AMANDA HAAS: Oh my.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.610
It took me a long time to write
the proposal because I couldn't

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.670
figure out how to
present a topic that was

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.730
so serious to people, right.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.079
JENNA: It's not a serious book
though, it's very accessible.

00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:08.620
AMANDA HAAS: So I wanted to kind
of tell that personal story,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.620
and make people feel
like they could relate.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.677
So it took me probably four
months to write the proposal.

00:28:14.677 --> 00:28:17.260
And keep in mind I was doing it
on nights and weekends, right,

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.990
outside of my regular job.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.610
And then probably
a solid six months

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.932
on the weekends cooking to
develop all the recipes.

00:28:22.932 --> 00:28:24.640
I'd try to do like
five or six a weekend,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.000
and then just
throw parties where

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.320
you invite your
whole block over,

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.270
and be like, what do you think?

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.080
Critique me.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.160
Which everybody did by the way.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.210
But it worked out.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.370
So it's good.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.080
I added the cauliflower
and the garnet yam.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.220
I'm going to give it another
10 minutes for my lovely timing

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.434
team.

00:28:42.434 --> 00:28:44.100
And let's see how
this is doing in here.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.850
Oh, we'll turn up a little bit.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.300
Every cooktop's
different, right.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.400
So if I tell you to cook
on low or medium low, again

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.215
that visual cue, you just
want to be barely bubbling

00:28:54.215 --> 00:28:56.590
while it's simmering, and it
wasn't doing that quite yet.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.710
So we'll check on that.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:58.570
JENNA: Right, how
do we know we're

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.930
done with the vinaigrette?

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.250
AMANDA HAAS: So again,
we're going to taste.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.560
I want a little pepper in mine.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.020
I know that Jenna.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.150
Let's put that in.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.060
And, of course, you can add, if
you like things really peppery,

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.810
use a ton more.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.650
One interesting
thing about pepper

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.180
is that, you'll read
about in the book as well,

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.330
it's a thermogenic.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.990
And so when you combine
it with other spices,

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.320
it releases the bioavailability
of that spice more,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.502
which is a crazy term
for saying it makes it

00:29:26.502 --> 00:29:27.710
absorb into your body better.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.550
So tumeric, you hear a lot about
with anti-inflammatory cooking.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.170
It's an amazing ingredient.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.929
You'll usually see
it with black pepper

00:29:34.929 --> 00:29:36.470
because black pepper
makes it I think

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.010
2,000% more available to
be absorbed into your body.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.510
JENNA: Wow.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.400
AMANDA HAAS: So black
pepper's amazing.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.204
How does it taste?

00:29:43.204 --> 00:29:44.120
JENNA: Delicious, FYI.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.911
AMANDA HAAS: Is it?

00:29:44.911 --> 00:29:46.830
Oh, good, see you're pro.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.450
Next time, you want to go
crazy, do lime juice, right.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.922
JENNA: That would be good.

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:51.880
AMANDA HAAS: I like it.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.379
JENNA: Yeah.

00:29:52.379 --> 00:29:54.610
AMANDA HAAS: And going
into something like quinoa,

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.068
you want it to be
a little bit more

00:29:56.068 --> 00:29:57.990
pungent because
quinoa is so neutral,

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.430
it can kind of taste flat.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.490
JENNA: Give it a punch.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.410
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah, like on
lettuce I like it like this.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.826
And when you get
it in the quinoa,

00:30:04.826 --> 00:30:06.390
we might want a
little bit more acid

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.200
to give it a little
more flavor, OK.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.570
So our vinaigrette is done.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.340
And now we can start working
on the other components

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.470
of the quinoa salad.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:14.507
JENNA: All right.

00:30:14.507 --> 00:30:16.340
AMANDA HAAS: With the
magic of Google Vision

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.920
it just all slides
into the picture here.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.492
We do it all.

00:30:20.492 --> 00:30:21.950
AMANDA HAAS: I'm
going to teach you

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:25.560
guys a couple of knife skills
and what did you call them?

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.115
Google hacks.

00:30:26.115 --> 00:30:26.380
JENNA: Hacks.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:26.810
AMANDA HAAS: Hacks.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.059
We're going to do some kitchen
hacks for you right now

00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:32.700
to make it easier
to make this salad.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.190
Any questions as we're going?

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.751
We're good?

00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:36.251
Yeah?

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.540
Yeah, so a lot of people do
use egg yolks as a binder, raw.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.070
And so if you don't want
to be eating raw egg yolk,

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.390
you definitely steer
clear of that one.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.610
Yeah, I love the flavor.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.590
But a lot of people
are nervous about that.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.544
Rightfully so.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.900
OK, so we have all of these
beautiful things all ready

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.167
that we're going to put
into our salad today.

00:31:00.167 --> 00:31:02.500
And I'm just going to teach
you how to do these yourself

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.067
a couple other ways.

00:31:05.067 --> 00:31:07.150
So people always say to
me, what's your best tool?

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:08.460
And I joke, it's called a knife.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.918
But really, like everything
here you could do with a knife.

00:31:10.918 --> 00:31:13.280
And then there are a couple
other little tools I like.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.570
So I wonder too, I don't
know if you guys have

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.910
any more green onions back
there hiding in the kitchen.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.680
But I'll show you one
more trick, if you do.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.346
That'd be great.

00:31:20.346 --> 00:31:20.930
Thank you.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.138
But first with the carrots,
let me show you something

00:31:23.138 --> 00:31:25.400
that's just a fun trick.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.917
You guys this space
is so amazing.

00:31:27.917 --> 00:31:29.250
I don't know who had to do this.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.639
But look at how
gorgeous this is.

00:31:31.639 --> 00:31:33.930
My carrots aren't going to
look this beautiful and this

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.950
perfect, pretty amazing.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.100
So I'm just going
to peel my carrot.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.820
This is my favorite
peeler, by the way.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.850
This is what I use
all day, every day.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.690
I like to do things as simply
as possible for recipes.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.790
But the thing is we
eat with our eyes.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.250
We want things to
look beautiful.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.530
And so any time I can
do a little short cut

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.920
and make it really
pretty, I like to do that.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.660
And for some reason
most of us think

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.850
things are really pretty
when they're on the bias,

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:04.980
you know when they're cut on an
angle, instead of straight on.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.520
It's funny.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.330
JENNA: Well, it's
fancy that way.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.390
AMANDA HAAS: Right,
then so you can do this,

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.100
which is slightly on the bias.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.200
Or you can cut them, even
with this I'll show you.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.410
So for green onions, otherwise
known as scallions, all I do

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.510
is cut the tops off.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:28.090
And then you just want to
put your knife at an angle.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.882
And I'm just going to
start slicing across them.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.590
I don't know why,
doesn't that look nice?

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.060
It's like fancy, super fancy.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.830
It just elevates the
look of the recipe.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.240
So we're going to do that.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.690
See again, I'm just using my
fingers to stabilize the knife,

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.500
and keeping the tip of
the knife on the board.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.779
And then the oh-so-imporant
claw on the other side.

00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:51.820
When you keep your fingers
wrapped underneath you

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.150
don't have to worry
about cutting them off.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.300
So an important
little tip for us.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.800
Watch, I'm just
going to go straight

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.400
into the quinoa with this.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.150
In you go.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.660
And then I'll add the pine nuts
that's there in front of me.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.980
Pine nuts are really
expensive right now.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.980
They're hard to come by.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.500
And so I love them for flavor.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.080
I love them in my pesto.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.030
But another alternative
would be roasted almonds

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:18.870
would be delicious.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.036
Or you can buy slivered
almonds, and just toast them

00:33:21.036 --> 00:33:22.210
in a pan really quickly.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.455
I also love pistachios
in salads or cashews.

00:33:25.455 --> 00:33:28.080
So I teach you how to toast them
on a sheet pan, where you just

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.010
put them in an oven for
a couple of minutes.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.220
That's the less finicky
way to do it because they

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.217
won't burn so quickly.

00:33:33.217 --> 00:33:35.300
But if you're watching
them and you pay attention,

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.550
you can do them on the cooktop.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.950
And just toast them
really quickly.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.330
And make sure they don't burn,
and get them off the heat.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:41.880
JENNA: Don't get distracted.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.930
AMANDA HAAS: Don't
get distracted, right?

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.200
JENNA: Every time I do it,
I inevitably burn some.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.710
AMANDA HAAS: Right.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:46.690
JENNA: Oh, what did you say?

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:47.189
Burnt.

00:33:47.189 --> 00:33:49.290
AMANDA HAAS: Burnt in
that amount of time.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.240
JENNA: Literally.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.920
AMANDA HAAS: You're
totally not kidding.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.900
How do I store mine?

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.790
I store my nuts in
the freezer, actually.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.900
I think it extends the
life of them a little bit.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.820
So well-sealed in the freezer.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.980
Yeah, unless I'm going to
use them really quickly.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.200
AUDIENCE: But I never do.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.040
AMANDA HAAS: Right.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.920
Yeah, so keep them stored
tightly in the freezer.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.618
Currants, I love
balances in salads

00:34:09.618 --> 00:34:12.159
where you've got a little bit
of every flavor component going

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:12.659
on.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.020
So something sweet,
currants are great.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.190
They're small, so they're
easy to mix through things.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.540
If you want them really plump
and juicy in your salad,

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.831
you can rehydrate them by
just putting them in a couple

00:34:22.831 --> 00:34:24.052
tablespoons of hot water.

00:34:24.052 --> 00:34:26.510
So while I make this I would
let them sit in the hot water.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.850
And they just get a little
plumper and juicier for you.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.739
Another one would be,
I love dried cherries,

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.844
dried blueberries are delicious,
cranberries of course.

00:34:35.844 --> 00:34:37.510
Again, this is one
of those things where

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.400
I'm a stickler about organics.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.940
Thank you for the quinoa cue.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.570
Because they're such
small, soft fruits

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.880
that they can absorb all
those pesticides so quickly.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.040
So I think it's worth
paying a little bit extra

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.449
for the organic.

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:54.860
So can you guys see
my quinoa right here?

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.909
Can you see how it's split?

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:00.210
So you're going to see this
little white seam popping out.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.750
And as always I'm
going to taste,

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.250
and see where we are on it.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.210
It's like pasta.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.540
You want it to have a little
bit of a bite, but not too much.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.730
So I'm going to let it go
for about two more minutes.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:14.600
You can see the liquid
in there too, Jenna.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.770
JENNA: And do you expect
that it will absorb it all?

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.206
AMANDA HAAS: If it's a
perfect day and the humidity

00:35:19.206 --> 00:35:21.330
is right in the world, and
everything's great, yes.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:22.970
If not, I would just
put it right back

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:23.710
through that chinois.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:24.560
JENNA: Chinois, yup.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.682
AMANDA HAAS: And just
skim off the water.

00:35:26.682 --> 00:35:28.140
And then another
great little trick

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.830
for cooling it down quickly,
you could let it sit in the pot

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:31.880
and turn off the heat.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.620
I'll put mine onto a big baking
sheet and just spread it out,

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.390
and it cools down in
a matter of minutes.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.680
And then you're ready to go
and put it into your salad.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.599
So let's do one more
little trick here

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:44.015
with the largest carrot I think
I've ever seen in my life.

00:35:44.015 --> 00:35:45.514
JENNA: It's a pretty
healthy carrot.

00:35:45.514 --> 00:35:48.020
AMANDA HAAS: That is
a big carrot, right?

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.050
You could certainly save
the scraps, you guys,

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.080
for anything like
a veggie stock too.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.760
So I love it when I can cook
and save things like that.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.820
So this is a super fancy
thing we're going to do.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.736
I'm going to teach you
two things-- julienning

00:35:59.736 --> 00:36:00.820
versus dicing.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.380
But julienning, my friend,
Melissa, taught me this,

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.710
you're going to slice the
carrot at a bias, again.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.130
These big fancy pieces,
and then look at this.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.630
I don't know why I think this
is the coolest trick I've ever

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.300
seen.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.095
I'll get this out of
the way while we do it.

00:36:17.095 --> 00:36:18.720
Literally, I don't
think I learned this

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.660
until about two years ago.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.690
And I thought she was so
smart for teaching me this.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.050
And I always make her teach
other people the same thing.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.980
So you can line them up, and
then you just cut across,

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.740
and you hold them down.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.080
So if you stack them
on top of each other,

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.280
that one is a little
too thick, you

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.610
can just move really quickly.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.422
So you could certainly do one
thing with a piece at a time.

00:36:38.422 --> 00:36:40.380
But if you stack them
over each other like that

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.900
and overlap them a little
bit, you'll go faster.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.570
So that's just a
really pretty way

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.219
to make something look a little
bit nicer for your salad.

00:36:48.219 --> 00:36:50.760
They did that for the cover of
the books, so I'm like forever

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.570
I'll be julienning.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.770
But I just tell people
to dice it, you know.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.394
So show you a dice too.

00:36:56.394 --> 00:36:58.810
One really important thing
when you're working with knives

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.750
is that you want to be
working with flat surfaces.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.920
You know it's scary to have
something rolling around

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.836
on a cutting board for
you when you're working

00:37:05.836 --> 00:37:07.370
with something this sharp.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.940
And so I like to
cut something off

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.620
like a sweet potato,
a potato, carrots,

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.190
I always like to give myself a
steady base when I'm slicing.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.674
So then I'm just going
to cut right through.

00:37:17.674 --> 00:37:19.090
I don't know if
you guys can tell,

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:21.230
but this knife is
so sharp that it's

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:24.076
so easy you don't have to put
a lot of pressure on things.

00:37:24.076 --> 00:37:25.700
So if you're putting
a lot of pressure,

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.840
you're probably needing
to sharpen your knives.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.250
So I'm just cutting it
into even thickness pieces,

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.624
and then I'm going
to cut across.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.430
And then I'll turn it,
and I'll cut across again.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.210
So you can be
exacting or you can

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:44.200
move as quickly as you'd
like depending on how perfect

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.970
you want your salad to look.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.700
So that's a large dice.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.930
You can certainly do smaller
for something like this.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.918
So it's closer to the
size of a currant.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.160
And we're good to go.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.740
Little bit smaller here.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:07.090
Chef's team does
it better, I swear.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:10.610
Again, this is why I'm
a cook, and not a baker.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.015
So it's just practice.

00:38:12.015 --> 00:38:14.390
It's just practice of doing
the same thing over and over.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.610
And it's great to practice on
carrots, and onions, and things

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.560
that you have around
the house all the time,

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.580
and work on your knife skills.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.630
It's good.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.970
I'm going to add
these julienned ones.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.080
JENNA: The fancy ones.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.980
AMANDA HAAS: And then I'll ad
her fancy, fancy pants ones.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.460
They're gorgeous.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.410
And then the last
trick for radishes.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:36.610
Now, you can certainly,
certainly do this with a knife.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.480
But can you see how
perfect these are?

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.427
I mean they're like
all perfectly even.

00:38:40.427 --> 00:38:42.260
I don't know if they
used a mandolin or not.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:46.300
But this is my one gadget that
I'm obsessed with at work.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.640
And I don't even use
like the fancy mandolins.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.020
You can get some that are
really big with huge disks

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.020
that you can change in
and out, which I love.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.030
This is just a
smaller, easier version

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.820
of this that has four pads here.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.540
And all I'm going to do, again,
I want a steady surface, right?

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:07.641
And it comes with a guard,
so you can be extra safe.

00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:08.890
You can do this a couple ways.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.380
You just slide it right
over, and you're not having

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.250
to put a lot of pressure on it.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:14.924
So I love that.

00:39:14.924 --> 00:39:16.590
And then when it gets
down close and you

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:20.140
want to watch your
fingers, just like that.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.690
JENNA: Also you should not look
away while you're doing this.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:23.550
AMANDA HAAS: I'm like yes.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.799
JENNA: Finger comes right off.

00:39:24.799 --> 00:39:25.890
Well, you have the guard.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.280
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah,
but that's one time

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.790
where I'll cut corners because
I think it's so much easier.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.270
And I love how consistent it is.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.310
You have to be really
good with a knife

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.060
to make them look that
perfect every time.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.510
JENNA: And if you get one
of the small ones, like they

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.230
make a lot like this that
are even just with a handle.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:42.010
You don't have to
wash a big huge one.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.770
I have a big huge one,
it's just so much to wash.

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:45.600
This is easier.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.100
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah,
I agree with you.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.012
And I think that
it's super fast.

00:39:50.012 --> 00:39:51.470
And it's a tool I
use all the time.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.380
It's got some shredding
blades for cheese,

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.200
or lettuce, or things
like that as well.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.800
So I use that little
tool like crazy.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.632
JENNA: I think they're
indispensable for like gratin.

00:40:00.632 --> 00:40:01.840
AMANDA HAAS: Oh, great point.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.264
JENNA: Right, like potatoes.

00:40:04.264 --> 00:40:06.180
AMANDA HAAS: Exactly,
makes a huge difference.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.710
I agree with you.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.050
So that's all we're doing
for the salad, you guys.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.550
And it's just really
about mastering

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.070
two things, like how
to cook your quinoa

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.520
and how to make the vinaigrette.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.060
And then the rest
becomes whatever

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.620
you have that you like.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.180
We're going to add some
herbs to it as well.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.490
And put it all together.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.270
So you can see on this
quinoa now too, it's fluffy,

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:28.540
the grain is split, right?

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.040
I'm sorry I keep
calling it a grain.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.050
It's a seed, technically.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.237
But that's all you
have to do with it.

00:40:34.237 --> 00:40:35.820
The thing I love
about quinoa as well,

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.450
Jenna, is that it stays
at room temp really well.

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.240
And it lasts in your
fridge really well.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.060
So I started using it like
as a base for stir fries too.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.610
I'll do a savory stir fry.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:47.360
Looks like this is done as well.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.490
And then it lasts in
your fridge for days.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:54.330
So something you can think
about making ahead again.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.827
Actually I can have
you do that for me,

00:40:56.827 --> 00:40:57.910
while I check the lentils.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.950
Do you want to toss that
with some of the vinaigrette?

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.120
And then we'll taste it.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.690
JENNA: [INAUDIBLE] they're
brining it back over there.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:03.648
AMANDA HAAS: Oh, great.

00:41:03.648 --> 00:41:04.270
Fantastic.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.680
So let's take a look at this.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.854
Looks delish.

00:41:08.854 --> 00:41:11.020
I don't know if my vegetables
are cooked enough yet.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.895
We're going to taste.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.770
Mm.

00:41:17.552 --> 00:41:19.010
I like it when my
food tastes good.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.460
I don't know why I'm always
surprised when it works out,

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.960
I'm like, oh, that's
actually tasty.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.335
But it's just such
a joy to cook.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.487
JENNA: Toss it in
this bigger bowl here.

00:41:34.424 --> 00:41:36.090
AMANDA HAAS: It needs
five more minutes,

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.150
and then it will be done.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.152
The veggies are almost cooked.

00:41:39.152 --> 00:41:41.360
But I don't want them to be
so crunchy, you're going,

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.510
huh, what's that about?

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:47.640
And then we'll finish both of
these off with fresh herbs.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.390
And herbs, the thing
that's so interesting again

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.410
when I really started to
do my research on this,

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.610
is that all of these
different ingredients

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.710
have different health benefits,
which I find so fascinating.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.069
You know that if you just
grew a garden, and you go out,

00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:01.860
and you start pulling
different things, how

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.340
they're all different for
you in different ways.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.850
And so mint has great
digestive properties to it,

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.320
which we're going to
use in this salad.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.110
We're going to finish the
curry off with cilantro,

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:17.280
and get some great health
benefits from that as well.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.060
Let's put the mint in now.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:19.970
That's our mint.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:20.865
Yeah.

00:42:20.865 --> 00:42:22.490
We'll mix that in,
and then I'll taste.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.080
How's that?

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:23.871
JENNA: Sounds good.

00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:25.480
AMANDA HAAS: Thank you.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.670
It's so fun having
someone do this with me.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:29.490
I'm not used to it.

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.440
JENNA: I'll take it.

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.960
AMANDA HAAS: We do our
own dish too at work.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.960
We wash all our dishes.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.168
So if you guys need me to
stay and do dishes, I'm in.

00:42:35.168 --> 00:42:36.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:40.210
Mm.

00:42:43.844 --> 00:42:46.260
It's crazy to say, but this
has become one of those things

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.830
that I actually crave now.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.060
You know it's so clean,
and it's so delicious.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.154
But you have it, and
you feel like you

00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:54.070
know you're doing something
good for yourself.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.319
But it's still like, I could
eat a whole bowl of this.

00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:57.880
It's kind of crazy.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.850
I'm going to add just a
little bit more oil, and then

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.026
a little bit more lemon juice.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.110
Bless you over there.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:11.840
And let's taste.

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.320
See how vibrant it is?

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.278
That's the other thing.

00:43:19.278 --> 00:43:21.470
I love anything where you
can have this many colors.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.425
And it's just appealing.

00:43:24.425 --> 00:43:25.550
You want to try it with me?

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.380
Tell me what you think.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.500
JENNA: Of course, I want to try.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:27.770
AMANDA HAAS: Spoon for you.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.512
JENNA: I thought
you'd never ask.

00:43:29.512 --> 00:43:30.470
AMANDA HAAS: Thank you.

00:43:33.152 --> 00:43:36.975
What do you think
it needs more of?

00:43:36.975 --> 00:43:38.672
JENNA: Maybe a bit more salt.

00:43:38.672 --> 00:43:41.560
AMANDA HAAS: Mm-hm.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.700
I agree.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.950
JENNA: That sweetness from
the currants comes through.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:45.670
It's really delicious.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:46.480
AMANDA HAAS: You like that?

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.320
JENNA: Yeah, it's great.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.028
Right at the end.

00:43:48.028 --> 00:43:51.150
AMANDA HAAS: Let's add
a little more salt.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.080
Again, it's so nice when
you can add as you go.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.637
We don't want to overdo it.

00:43:55.637 --> 00:43:57.470
JENNA: Yeah, I mean
better to add at the end

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:01.957
than to end up with something
too salty or pungent.

00:44:01.957 --> 00:44:04.540
AMANDA HAAS: And salt, many of
you probably already know this,

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.080
but salt just brings out all
of the flavors in your food.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.632
So you'll see it in a
lot of desserts as well.

00:44:09.632 --> 00:44:11.590
When you're working with
chocolate and vanilla,

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:13.410
it brings out all of
those great notes.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:19.635
And so it's an amazing
ingredient to use.

00:44:19.635 --> 00:44:20.135
Mm.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.445
Delicious.

00:44:24.445 --> 00:44:25.070
JENNA: Love it.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:25.856
AMANDA HAAS: We did a good job.

00:44:25.856 --> 00:44:27.370
JENNA: All right,
well, yes, I'll

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.249
take some credit,
this much credit.

00:44:30.249 --> 00:44:32.040
AMANDA HAAS: So we'll
just finish this off.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.280
And while we're
waiting for this,

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.060
does anybody have any
questions about what

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.260
we're making here today?

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm going to
start with the breakfast quinoa

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.190
[INAUDIBLE] from the book.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.570
AMANDA HAAS: OK, yeah.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:44.750
FEMALE SPEAKER: But I'm looking
to create a vegan burger that

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.580
would knock people's socks off.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.440
AMANDA HAAS: That
would not be what?

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Knock
people's socks off.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:49.890
Do you have any ideas?

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.840
AMANDA HAAS: Do
I have any ideas?

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.340
I do.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.730
And a lot of them involve,
it's funny, quinoa, again,

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:55.400
and beets.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:55.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ah.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.506
AMANDA HAAS: I don't
know if you've ever

00:44:57.506 --> 00:44:59.720
used beets to create some
sort of a veggie burger.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.224
But I'd be happy to send
you some ideas for it.

00:45:02.224 --> 00:45:03.640
We went through
this phase at work

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.670
where we were trying to create
the best veggie burger ever.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.440
My boss's husband is vegan.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.200
And he was obsessed with
this one burger he'd had.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.610
So I'd be happy to
send you some ideas.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:17.460
Beets are great for texture,
and getting like that meatiness.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.130
Mushrooms too, if
you like mushrooms,

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.340
can be a great component,
quinoa, oats sometimes.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.660
So I have some ideas.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.240
JENNA: Yeah, you got
to get that umami.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.840
AMANDA HAAS: Recreate it.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.440
Especially vegan without
egg, it's trickier, right?

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.240
And so, I'd be happy to help.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.250
I think all of us in the
test kitchen combined

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.000
could come up with
something good for you.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.579
Maybe I should do it for my
next book, which is crazy.

00:45:40.579 --> 00:45:42.370
JENNA: Do you have an
idea for a next book.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:43.310
AMANDA HAAS: I think so.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:44.310
JENNA: Is it super secret?

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:44.890
Can you share?

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:46.160
AMANDA HAAS: No, it's not
secret at all because now I

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.368
can bounce it off all of you.

00:45:47.368 --> 00:45:49.240
And maybe I should
ask you after you've

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.500
tried more of the recipes.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.060
But I was really surprised at
how much this topic resonated

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.330
with people because you know
you hear the word inflammation,

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.539
and it sounds like, I don't
know, like it's for my mother.

00:46:00.539 --> 00:46:02.330
Like it's something
that you deal with when

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:03.413
you're a little bit older.

00:46:03.413 --> 00:46:06.610
But when somebody use the
term to describe my health,

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:08.790
I was like, wait a
minute, that's weird.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:12.250
I was 38 when I started
to figure this out.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:14.490
And I'm hearing from
people of all ages.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.800
And I'm hearing from people
who have autoimmune issues.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.470
You know so many people come
up to me at my kid's baseball

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:22.250
games, and say, I have
Hashimoto's, or I've

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.710
got other thyroid issues,
and I changed my diet,

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:26.070
and I feel so much better.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.100
JENNA: Or chronic pain.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.990
AMANDA HAAS: Chronic, all
these arthritic symptoms.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.740
JENNA: Absolutely.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.198
AMANDA HAAS: So I
think that I want

00:46:33.198 --> 00:46:35.820
to keep doing more of this
food, but make people understand

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.300
truly that it can be really
easy and approachable.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.770
And these recipes are
all very straightforward.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:43.510
But maybe put more of like a
weeknight, or like a family

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:44.250
spin on it.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.660
So it's very overtly saying,
you can make this kind

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.170
of food every day for everyone.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.870
JENNA: Super easy, you
could do this all the time.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:49.360
I love it.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.693
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah, so I'd
love your feedback after this,

00:46:51.693 --> 00:46:53.020
if you have any ideas.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.270
JENNA: How good is that salad?

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.450
AMANDA HAAS: You like?

00:46:55.450 --> 00:47:00.710
Even if you don't like quinoa,
you don't have to say yum.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:01.335
JENNA: It's OK.

00:47:01.335 --> 00:47:03.820
AMANDA HAAS: But it's become
my standby, my replacement

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.350
for couscous, for sure.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.050
What do you think over here?

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:07.774
You're good?

00:47:07.774 --> 00:47:08.690
Oh my gosh, fantastic.

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:10.230
JENNA: You could make it
with a different base.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.730
AMANDA HAAS: Oh,
absolutely you could.

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:12.750
JENNA: Yeah, farrow would
probably be delicious.

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.260
AMANDA HAAS: Oh my gosh,
it would be delicious.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:14.850
JENNA: Yeah.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.350
AMANDA HAAS: Barley,
you could do it

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:18.446
with a lot of different grains.

00:47:18.446 --> 00:47:20.070
You certainly don't
have to use quinoa.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:21.486
JENNA: And you
know, I would argue

00:47:21.486 --> 00:47:24.430
you could make a very similar
salad with our salad bar

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:25.950
ingredients here.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:27.290
We have cold greens.

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:28.150
AMANDA HAAS: Oh
my gosh, amazing.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.400
JENNA: We have quinoa and farro.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.050
AMANDA HAAS: You do?

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.424
JENNA: Lots of
those ingredients.

00:47:30.424 --> 00:47:33.720
We always have lemon
juice and olive oil.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.022
So you could absolutely
throw this together.

00:47:36.022 --> 00:47:38.480
And I think you're going to
start seeing more of this stuff

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.839
out and about too, these amazing
grain-based prepared salads.

00:47:41.839 --> 00:47:43.130
AMANDA HAAS: I love this place.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.000
I'm like, I want to eat
lunch here everyday.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.260
I'm telling you, this is
only my second time here,

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.030
and I can't believe
how amazing it is.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.170
So that's pretty cool you've
got access to these things

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:55.970
everyday.

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.495
And quinoa is a complete
protein, actually.

00:47:58.495 --> 00:48:00.750
So when you really do
need to be able to think

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:02.240
for the rest of
the afternoon, it's

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.790
a great source of
protein to have around,

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.472
and a wonderful option.

00:48:07.472 --> 00:48:08.930
JENNA: Yeah, that's
something we've

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:11.900
been talking a lot about
lately is different types

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.370
of protein in your diet.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:16.906
I think the American diet is
very focused on animal protein.

00:48:16.906 --> 00:48:17.655
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah.

00:48:17.655 --> 00:48:20.520
JENNA: But there's all of these
other great protein bases you

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.940
can get in something like this.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.148
So, I think a lot of people
would see this and think,

00:48:24.148 --> 00:48:25.970
yeah, I need to put
some chicken on that,

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:26.840
or something on top of it.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.690
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah, right,
something to add to it.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:29.065
JENNA: But at the
end of the day,

00:48:29.065 --> 00:48:30.260
this is a complete protein.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.010
AMANDA HAAS: Yeah.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:33.810
JENNA: This is a really solid
source for sustained energy.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:34.810
AMANDA HAAS: Absolutely.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.489
And I think that's my
thing, for the longest

00:48:37.489 --> 00:48:40.030
time I didn't feel like I was
having a complete meal unless I

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:42.770
saw shrimp or chicken
or something on that.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.620
Totally great on its own.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.570
Avocado becomes my other
one, just as a standby.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:50.070
JENNA: Well, that I would want
just because I would want it.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:53.070
It's terrific.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.850
AMANDA HAAS: So this
is done as well.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:56.766
And I'm just going to
add a little bit of lime

00:48:56.766 --> 00:49:00.010
to it because as I taste it,
I love when you have something

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.230
sweet that you add some
acid to it to balance it

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:03.070
out a little bit.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.564
And I just want a
little bit more.

00:49:04.564 --> 00:49:06.230
And then I'm going
to have you taste it.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:07.354
And tell me what you think.

00:49:07.354 --> 00:49:09.000
JENNA: Do you do
herb in that as well?

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.500
AMANDA HAAS: I'm going
to top it with cilantro.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.230
JENNA: Oh, yum.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:12.880
AMANDA HAAS: So you
could mix it in.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.650
Again, sometimes when you're
working with lentils and curry,

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.440
it's not that beautiful.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.610
No offense to my deliciously
anti-inflammatory recipe here.

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:26.000
But I love finishing things off
with herbs to just balance it.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.290
And one interesting rule
of thumb that you always

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:29.880
learn in cooking school
is that you would never

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.080
garnish with something that
you don't want in the recipe,

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:32.580
right?

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.340
So if the recipe
has basil and mint,

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.860
you wouldn't just throw
parsley on the top.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.680
But I actually want the cilantro
to be part of this recipe,

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.980
so I'm going to garnish with
it, and not put any in it.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.830
It can turn kind of dark, if you
put it in, and then let it sit.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:48.900
And so that's the only reason
I'm not mixing it in directly.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.646
So we're going to just finish
it with a little lime juice.

00:49:51.646 --> 00:49:53.270
And then you can tell
me, Jenna, if you

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:58.200
think it needs more
seasoning before we're done.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.160
JENNA: Hovering
excitedly with my spoon.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.159
AMANDA HAAS: I'm going
to give it a splash, just

00:50:02.159 --> 00:50:07.140
one little pinch of salt.
And I'll give it a stir.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.267
JENNA: Clearly, everybody was
super into the quinoa salad.

00:50:12.267 --> 00:50:14.016
AMANDA HAAS: Or you're
just really hungry.

00:50:14.016 --> 00:50:14.640
JENNA: It is.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.900
Well, we do it at lunch,
but we don't tell them

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.996
that's why we do it.

00:50:17.996 --> 00:50:20.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.947
No, it's because it's
delicious of course.

00:50:22.947 --> 00:50:25.280
AMANDA HAAS: It's weird though
how these foods can start

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.410
to feel really fulfilling.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:29.920
And I went and cooked at a
magazine recently in New York,

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.440
the week my book came out.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.740
And everybody was so cute.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.364
I did a ton of food from it.

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:36.530
But they're like, we still
feel good about ourselves

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:37.030
at the end.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:38.590
Like you're not
feeling too full,

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:41.111
or like you did something
bad, or that you're so full

00:50:41.111 --> 00:50:42.110
you can't think anymore.

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:42.790
JENNA: Yum.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:43.100
AMANDA HAAS: You like?

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:43.710
JENNA: I like it.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:45.001
AMANDA HAAS: You think it's OK?

00:50:45.001 --> 00:50:46.120
Enough salt, enough acid?

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:46.200
JENNA: Yeah.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.574
AMANDA HAAS: OK,
fantastic, good.

00:50:47.574 --> 00:50:48.800
JENNA: I like it a lot.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.630
AMANDA HAAS: So guys
those are two recipes

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.440
that are really
basic go-to's for you

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.797
that I hope you loved today.

00:50:55.797 --> 00:50:58.380
JENNA: How long do you keep the
vinaigrette in the fridge for?

00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.370
AMANDA HAAS: How long do you
keep the vinaigrettes for?

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:01.320
A really long time.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:06.360
I think I should probably say
one to two weeks, two to four.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.539
Yeah, a couple of weeks
is fine, absolutely.

00:51:08.539 --> 00:51:10.080
If you're putting
things in them that

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.095
don't last as well, like
garlic can go a little bit,

00:51:13.095 --> 00:51:14.780
I'd keep it at a week.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.810
But vinegar preserves things
really well too, right?

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:21.392
So, yeah, a couple of
weeks, you're good to go.

00:51:21.392 --> 00:51:23.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'
love to ask something,

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.270
which is, when we were talking
about throwing the raw egg in,

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.570
I'm just curious, do you
think the nature of the egg

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:30.246
is important?

00:51:30.246 --> 00:51:32.620
AMANDA HAAS: I could talk to
you about this all day long.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.860
Yes, I do think the nature
of the egg is important.

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.610
JENNA: All our eggs
are not created equal.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:37.350
AMANDA HAAS: They are not.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.058
And it's just like I
think when you start

00:51:39.058 --> 00:51:42.447
talking about animal proteins.

00:51:42.447 --> 00:51:44.030
A couple people
brought up in my book,

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.480
like I can't believe you
would put beef in your book,

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.960
this is anti-inflammatory.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.270
Like I had a doctor say that.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:52.530
But when you start to really
understand animal proteins,

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:55.170
and how important it is to find
out where they're coming from,

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:56.660
and how they're
raised, you realize

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.520
that grass-fed beef can work
for you in a really amazing way.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.670
And it's full of
omega-3 and omega-6s,

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.070
and has a profile
similar to salmon.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:08.000
So when you ask about
eggs, it's the same thing.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.821
To joke about "Portlandia," have
you guys ever seen that show?

00:52:10.821 --> 00:52:12.570
[INAUDIBLE] chicken,
well, did the chicken

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:13.420
come from down the street?

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.128
Well, can I go see
the chicken before you

00:52:15.128 --> 00:52:16.280
make the chicken for me?

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.990
But I think it is
really important

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.010
to know where these
things are coming from.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:25.106
And so for eggs I look
for organic and pasture.

00:52:25.106 --> 00:52:27.480
What's so amazing now is you
can go to the grocery store,

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.460
and on most eggs it'll
tell you how it's

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:30.715
been raised, which is amazing.

00:52:30.715 --> 00:52:31.360
JENNA: Cage-free, yup.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.530
AMANDA HAAS: It's going to
change the flavor of it.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:35.446
And it's definitely going
to change the health

00:52:35.446 --> 00:52:36.780
properties of it as well.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.780
Yeah, great question.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
so I've been interested

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.890
in I guess diets, for
lack of a better word,

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.600
that health issues
for a while, primarily

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.650
on the digestive side.

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:51.890
So I've tried gluten
free, to paleo,

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.680
to then the latest that
I've kind of resonated

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.260
with the most, but is the
most difficult, is low FODMAP.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.468
So I don't know if you are
familiar with that at all,

00:52:59.468 --> 00:53:02.540
but, like, for example, the
worst offenders are gluten.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.290
So that's fine, but
also garlic and onion.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:05.110
AMANDA HAAS: Exactly.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:06.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: Which makes it
a really difficult experience.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.880
AMANDA HAAS: Tell me
again, you said low FODMAP?

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.900
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.025
AMANDA HAAS: It's so funny.

00:53:10.025 --> 00:53:12.770
I just had a girlfriend
bring this up to me.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:13.715
What's your name?

00:53:13.715 --> 00:53:14.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Lucy.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.420
AMANDA HAAS: Lucy
has been trying

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.430
to work on some diets that
help digestive problems, which

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:20.950
is something I get
into in the book

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:23.270
as well, kind of about what's
going on with our guts.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.550
You hear a lot these
days about a leaky gut,

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:27.950
or digestive issues
around certain foods.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:30.780
So trying gluten free, and
paleo, and then the FODMAPS

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.189
diet, which is
definitely different.

00:53:33.189 --> 00:53:35.730
And there are some foods that
make it much worse than others.

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.380
I think it's
fascinating, and I just

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.910
started to read up on it
probably about a year ago.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.630
I had a girlfriend say she
had huge success with it.

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:44.520
And so I think it
speaks to the fact

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.570
that we are all
different, right?

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.700
And so I can share
the story of for me,

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.100
I realized right
away that gluten

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.470
was one of the big ones for me.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:54.620
And then dairy was a
secondary one for me.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.490
But it's a matter
of figuring out

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:58.940
what's affecting you
positively and negatively,

00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:59.890
and going from there.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:02.580
So I always encourage
people to try

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.180
things to feel better that way.

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:07.260
And it's hard to eliminate
foods from your diet,

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.890
and then try to work them
back in to see what happens.

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:11.020
But we're all unique.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.870
And so you might
find that that is

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.350
the way you need to eat
for the rest of your life,

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:17.670
and that you feel
amazing that way.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.770
I will say, just
speaking from someone

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.900
who was told they couldn't have
anything, how easy it was when

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:25.782
I realized that gluten was what
was making me feel terrible.

00:54:25.782 --> 00:54:27.240
People are like,
don't you miss it?

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.230
Yeah, I miss great
pizza, of course.

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:31.760
But I feel so much
better that it doesn't

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.500
feel like a sacrifice anymore.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.640
So that's my only positive
spin on it for you,

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.390
is that if you find
out that it's honestly

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:40.190
one of these things that we
are used to eating a ton of,

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:42.860
you'll be OK, and you'll
feel so much better.

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.110
JENNA: And it could be
something innocuous.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.250
I have a friend who's son,
it's artificial coloring.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:49.980
AMANDA HAAS: Oh my gosh.

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.140
So funny, huge.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:54.110
JENNA: Insane, like
one stick of gum,

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:56.959
and he's completely off
the rails for a whole day.

00:54:56.959 --> 00:54:57.750
AMANDA HAAS: Right.

00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:59.624
JENNA: And I was asking
her, how did you even

00:54:59.624 --> 00:55:01.110
figure out that was the thing?

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:01.780
AMANDA HAAS: That was it?

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:03.560
JENNA: And it was a similar
process with doctors.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.110
But I noticed it's
on your list as well.

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:06.318
AMANDA HAAS: It's on my list.

00:55:06.318 --> 00:55:08.501
JENNA: Yeah, it could be
something so innocuous

00:55:08.501 --> 00:55:09.750
that you would never think of.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.115
But until she started trying.

00:55:11.115 --> 00:55:12.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: And dyes
are in your medication too.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:13.468
AMANDA HAAS: They are.

00:55:13.468 --> 00:55:14.902
FEMALE SPEAKER: I recently
was prescribed medication,

00:55:14.902 --> 00:55:16.336
and I said, I can't take that.

00:55:16.336 --> 00:55:19.290
I took it Friday night and
went out until Sunday noon.

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:21.380
And they said, oh, because
it has this dye in it.

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.830
I said, well, I'd like
the version without.

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:25.680
AMANDA HAAS: It doesn't exist.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.500
That happened to my
dad like 30 years ago.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.070
And he's a doctor.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:29.880
He has asthma.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.213
He's like, I'm having an
allergic reaction to the asthma

00:55:32.213 --> 00:55:34.480
medication you're
giving me with food dye.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.335
But food coloring's
on that list.

00:55:36.335 --> 00:55:38.640
And I think it
goes back to again,

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.840
it was really frustrating for
me to realize that it took me

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:44.340
20 years to realize that, if
it doesn't come from the ground

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:47.430
naturally, it's probably
not that good for us.

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:50.930
And so that's a great example
of one as well that many of us

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:51.710
are sensitive to.

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.420
JENNA: Yeah, and I hope that
awareness to that type of thing

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.090
will push change
because really, why

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:58.447
does a medication need to
be dyed a particular color?

00:55:58.447 --> 00:55:59.280
AMANDA HAAS: Purple.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.600
JENNA: It's totally arbitrary.

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.010
AMANDA HAAS: Right.

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:03.218
JENNA: Yeah, so we can tell
all of the medications we

00:56:03.218 --> 00:56:04.574
take apart from one another?

00:56:04.574 --> 00:56:06.240
It's indicative of
maybe other problems.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.340
AMANDA HAAS: Right, yeah, it is.

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:10.310
JENNA: Well, thank you
so much, everybody.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:11.700
AMANDA HAAS: Oh, it's such
a treat to be here today.

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.600
Thank you.

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.720
JENNA: Thanks for spending
some time with us.
