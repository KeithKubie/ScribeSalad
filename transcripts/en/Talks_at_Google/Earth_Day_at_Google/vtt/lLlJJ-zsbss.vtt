PRESTON BAILEY:
Thank you very much.

00:00:06.786 --> 00:00:08.064
Thank you.

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:09.440
Thank you so much.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.540
I would like to start
by thanking Google

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.056
for this extraordinary
opportunity.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.370
Very often, when I meet
people, and they say,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.540
Preston, what do you do?

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.950
And I say, I design events.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.300
And sometimes, they have
no idea what that is.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.640
What does it mean,
design events?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.830
To put it in simple
words, what I do

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:44.280
is create spaces that are
dramatic and beautiful enough

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.390
for a party.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.030
It's just that simple.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.390
Every single time that
I design an event,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.390
my goal is always to
have the guests walk in

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.320
and say, oh my god, this is
the most incredible thing

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080
that I've ever seen.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.410
Mind you, this is
not always easy,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.560
by the way, a lot of times,
especially with New Yorkers.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.260
New Yorkers are a
little bit jaded.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.180
They will walk into a
Preston Bailey space,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.310
and they say, oh, here he goes
again, with lots of flowers.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.910
But the goal is always to
amuse, entertain, and mostly--

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.130
and I think one of the
most successful events

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.330
that I do is those events that
the guests are so entertained

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.350
and they're so delighted that
they never want to leave.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.110
How did I start?

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.560
I started because I was in
desperate need of a job.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.410
It was 1980.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.180
I was broke.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.400
And a very good friend of
mine, the interior designer

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.180
Vicente Wolf,
suggested that I do

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.570
flowers for one of his clients.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.470
That meant going to the floral
market in New York City,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.420
picking up some flowers,
bringing it to the apartment,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.790
and distributing it.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.550
Well, to tell you the
truth, it was a nightmare.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.100
I had absolutely no
idea what I was doing.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.800
I went around these
clients' homes,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.740
and at the end of the day,
I would get phone calls

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.480
like, Preston, the
flowers are dead.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.455
I remember there was this one
client that I did her flowers

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:28.080
or did a party.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.954
And she would come out
at the end of the day,

00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:32.260
and she said, Preston,
what are those flowers?

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.450
And of course, I had
no idea what they were.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.080
And I would make
it up, like, those

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.450
are floreleas from
South America.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.700
But I went along.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.520
Then, of course,
these are the '80s.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.916
So the event industry was
just getting going there.

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:49.830
There were just florists.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.000
That's how I started--
just doing flowers.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.340
And then the '90s came.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.120
And as far as I'm concerned,
a goddess was born.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.660
A goddess by the name
of Martha Stewart.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.430
Martha taught
America and the world

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.390
that it was perfectly fine
to go into your backyard,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.820
pick up some leaves,
bring them to your table,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.460
and decorate them.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.530
I mean, this woman taught
America that they could cook.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.950
She even taught us
how to make wine.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.017
I mean, as far as I'm
concerned, she can do no wrong.

00:03:27.017 --> 00:03:28.600
And have you noticed
she is much nicer

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.390
since she got out of jail?

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.170
She really, I mean this
woman has become so nice.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.590
So the '90s came, and
as I struggled along

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.200
to get my business
on the ground,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.050
I had the privilege of
meeting Joan Rivers.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.170
And Joan Rivers was one of
my first clients that came in

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.670
and she said, Preston,
listen, I would

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.250
love to create this setting that
is so incredible that it looks

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.680
like an opera set, that whenever
my guests walk in, they say,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.810
oh my god, this is just
the most incredible thing

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.770
that I've ever seen.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.750
You can see one of the images
that almost 20 years later, I

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.920
think is still holds up.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.370
The concept of event
designing started developing.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.800
Not only was it important to do
beautiful flowers in a table,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.520
when my client walked into
a ballroom and saw a room

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.559
and said, Preston,
I hate the walls.

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:35.350
I said, no problem.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.150
We can change it.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.630
I hate the ceiling.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.400
Again, no problem,
we can change it.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.090
And so emerged
within my business

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.030
what's called event designing.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.150
For us, that is translated
in transforming a space.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.100
A room that exists in a certain
way, and each time the guests

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.660
walk in, it looks different.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.975
So today I have a few
images to show you

00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:06.940
of the concept of
transformation.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.850
Recently, we did an
event, a wedding.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.320
And you have to understand that
for transformation, there's

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.570
a few things that we use.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.990
One of the things that
we use is set design.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.680
Other is lighting,
new technology,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.740
but most importantly, flowers.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.650
That is my tool.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.260
The way that I design
and create a space

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.541
is very heavily flowers.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.040
Why?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.910
Because I love it.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.159
If I could, I would just
cover the world with flowers.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.760
It's that simple.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.570
But anyhow, so this
event was over a pool,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.260
and it was a ceremony.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.900
And the client wanted us to
create this-- basically this

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.640
small building for her
daughter to get married.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.650
And as you notice,
in this section,

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.640
we start creating with
thousands of orchids,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.600
knitting them very carefully.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.420
And finally, this is the
product that ended up.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.160
And if you can see it
from different angles.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.940
This is one angle.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.650
Another one.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.860
And as you look closer,
we created this chapel

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.795
for the wedding
of the gentleman.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.360
Designing is about
creating surprises.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.940
It's about creating
elements that you walk in,

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.590
and you're so in awe.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.240
That is basically, I
think, the importance

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.460
of surprises in an event.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.310
As we move along, if
you notice the detail.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.426
This is all crystals and
flowers very carefully sewn in.

00:06:39.426 --> 00:06:40.350
Tents.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.650
I loved designing a tent.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.150
Why?

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.120
You have this
perfectly blank canvas

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.500
that you could create
whatever you like.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.222
But I think it's
not only the inside

00:06:49.222 --> 00:06:50.430
of the tent that's important.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.110
It's important also
to design the outside.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.380
So, of course, in
this tent, we wanted

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.280
to create the feeling
of a glass house.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.750
As the guests walked in,
this is the interior.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.850
As we've been building
it, and of course,

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:10.100
the final project is this,
a clear looking space.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.100
Transforming at tent.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.410
Transforming a space.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.250
And for the tables,
of course, we

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.060
did these tall accented pieces.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.040
Another sample of
transformation is an event

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.470
that we did in the
south of France

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.880
that we created a ballroom
in a tennis court.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.380
Ultimately the final
project is this.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.360
And of course, creating certain
structure, the ceiling is open.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.720
And of course, the
smallness of the table.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.380
As we move on, we see a
ceiling transformation.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.550
I did an event-- I happen
to love French gardens

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.780
by the way-- and while
doing this event,

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.500
I suggested to my
client that I wanted

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.980
to create a [INAUDIBLE]
garden in the ceiling.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.370
And she thought I was
crazy, but anyhow,

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.880
this is the final product.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.490
It's an empty ballroom, and
this is the final product.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.430
So what do I do?

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.970
What do I do?

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:15.350
My job is to take my clients'
fantasies and desires

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.840
and bring them to
reality, as much as I can.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.610
I'm not always successful, but
I'll certainly keep trying.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.020
We can see another
form of-- of course,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.090
this is all of the
details of the wedding.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.540
Another form of a restaurant
is the popular Nobu Restaurant

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.429
in 57th Street.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.919
And they wanted to create
a winter wonderland.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.950
And of course, this
is the final product.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.880
The idea to having
the guests walk in

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.440
and absolutely not
recognizing the room.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.850
As we move on, events.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.160
What is so unique about events?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.120
I think one of the great
things at the moment

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.360
is that there are these amazing
artists out there, by the way.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.690
They're really, really
incredible people

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.000
that are creating
incredible work

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.040
that I consider to be artistic.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.310
But anyhow, this is
an event that we did.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.340
As a follow up, this is
a royal wedding actually

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.870
that we did in the Middle
East where the bride very

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.360
dramatically walked
down the aisle.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.780
She sits in the throne.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.795
This is the area that
she came out from.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.770
This one, I think, is
really very interesting

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.380
because we did it
in Jakarta, and I

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.560
wanted to create
a sculpture that

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.720
did not involve
any flowers at all.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.250
And I basically purchased
literally 10,000 light bulbs,

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.290
and anyhow, we created
this installation which,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.800
in Chinese, means
double happiness,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.810
creating a dramatic statement.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:53.410
Of course, this was for the
party portion of the evening.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:58.400
As a surprise, the guests walked
in and saw this sculpture.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.960
This is an event in New York
City at the Waldorf Astoria,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.100
transforming the ballroom
from this to this.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.690
And of course the tails
are very important.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.840
The ceiling, if you see, we
created this starry night.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.520
As we move on, this
is a wonderful event

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.950
that we did that we wanted
the impression of moving

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.280
from spring to winter.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.250
So as the guests walked
in, this is what they saw.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.440
As the evening progressed,
it turned into spring.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.720
Using technology, lighting,
every single new technology

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.210
that emerged, we try to
incorporate in creating events.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:47.259
As we move on, so we went from
flowers to transformation.

00:10:47.259 --> 00:10:49.050
And there's a new part
of the business that

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.010
is emerging that I find that
is incredibly interesting.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.670
So a lot of clients
and also businesses,

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:01.220
they want to create a temporary
structure, just for one event.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.890
A lot of times, they
call it pop-up place.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.100
They might keep
it up for a week.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.920
Sometimes they'll keep
it up for a month.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.340
But there's a couple of
structures that we designed.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.630
One of them that I
did, a bubble tent

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.440
that is the size
of a football field

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.270
in the middle of the desert.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.130
And as you walk in the
tent, this is what you see.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.720
And if you notice
in this image, one

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.620
of the fun things
that I created was

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.285
to create a dance floor that is
made out of all flowers, that

00:11:35.285 --> 00:11:36.840
is covered that
people could dance,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.450
and it basically was
made out of all flowers.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.320
This structure stayed up
for at least three weeks.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:50.680
And another structure that
we built also is of course--

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.220
and this, by the way, is at
least 20 to 30 feet high--

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.370
so as we're building
it of course,

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.400
and then this is
the final product.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.440
And one of the beautiful
things about the inside

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.650
of the structure is that
the ceiling was retractable,

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:12.980
meaning that at one point we had
actually fireworks that amused

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.510
and entertained the guests.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.696
As we move on, this
is another section.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.195
The dance was a
little bit more fun.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.270
I was so surprised
one day when I

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.480
got a phone call and somebody
suggested that maybe I

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.980
should start doing
public exhibits.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.270
And one of the problems
with the events that I

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.150
do-- it's not really a
problem-- but one of the issues

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.800
is, of course,
that it's only seen

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.280
by a certain amount of
guests, which is great

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.770
because these guests
leave, and they

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.210
will carry this in
their memory forever.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.440
But the public exhibits
for the reason that I like

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.430
is because there's more
than many people that

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.030
comes to see it in many days.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.390
So this one is one that
we did in Los Angeles,

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.130
just a few orchids, not a lot.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.050
And as you see, and again
the peacock concept took off,

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.960
and we did another version
in the south of France,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.440
and another version in
Covent Garden in London.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.270
We did move on from
peacocks, and we

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.010
created this bridal design
at the public library

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.920
at New York City.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.000
And even when you
come into my office,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.374
you see my dogs on my desk.

00:13:30.374 --> 00:13:31.540
This is my desk, by the way.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.510
These are the best dogs --
you don't have to walk them.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.200
And, of course, this
is an installation

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.510
that we did in Jakarta
with 500,000 butterflies.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.850
We created this large
structure in the middle--

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.260
of course they weren't live,
these butterflies-- this is my

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.230
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.720
So anyhow, for the
new year in Hong Kong,

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.410
we created these installations.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.740
Of course, it was
the year of the horse

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.850
that we created
this installation.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.170
At the moment, at the
Wynn in Las Vegas,

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.760
Mr. Wynn, which as far as I'm
concerned is a brilliant man,

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.010
had the idea of creating
this hot air balloon made out

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.880
of 100% flowers.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.770
And also, he also created
a carousel made out

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.940
of all flowers.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.070
And of course the carousel is
all mobile, and it goes around.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.220
For me, this is an
amazing opportunity

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:35.870
to be able to create my
work from florist to event

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.020
design and, of course,
now it translate

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.270
into the public installation.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:45.590
This is the most recent wedding
that I did for Mr. Sean Parker.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.000
Mr. Sean Parker I think is
a brilliant, brilliant guy,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.020
and he just wanted to
create the ultimate wedding

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.200
that we had in Big Sur.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.100
In Big Sur-- this is Mr.
Parker and his wife--

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.210
the entire theme of the
event was Game of Throne.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.780
The images-- everyone was
dining outside in the park.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.540
As you move along,
this is a night image.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.610
This is the ceremony area.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.690
As we move on, we see
them getting married.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.260
So I think it's very
tricky to do weddings

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.300
outdoor, and the reason why is
because it's so vast that you

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.650
have to create statements that
are so powerful that you could

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.060
actually see the decor.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.180
This is the traditional space.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.640
And of course, this is at night,
the wonderful lighting creating

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.400
a fun event.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.310
So what do I do?

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.340
What do we do?

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:52.420
I have a company that the
main purpose is to entertain.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:57.240
The main purpose of my company
is to get into my clients' head

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.840
and truly try to
see what's there

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.700
in order to bring
it out for life.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.310
OK.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.400
Thank you so much.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.720
Now some questions, if
anyone has questions.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.187
AUDIENCE: Welcome to Google.

00:16:16.187 --> 00:16:17.270
PRESTON BAILEY: Thank you.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:21.390
AUDIENCE: I'm very interested
in your project management

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.380
process, because we
do a lot of projects

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.760
here, not at the scale
of a football size,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.360
but it could be analogous.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.640
What are some of the
project management

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.250
tips that you can share with
us today that we could possibly

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.050
apply to say, software
development or even

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.190
client development?

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.100
PRESTON BAILEY: I think that's
a very good question actually.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.470
Creating a project is a
very, what should I say,

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.580
linear process.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.880
First you have to
decide what is it

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.870
that you're trying to
promote, what is it

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.040
that you're trying to
sell, or what ideas

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.530
that you're trying to promote.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.720
Once you have that, I think
it's a matter of going back.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.140
What I normally do, I create
a storyboard with everything

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:07.940
that comes to mind.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.310
I get together with
my design team.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.369
If we're designing
a corporate event,

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:15.859
if we're designing
an opening, we

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.319
look at all of the
elements that exist

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.890
that we need to replicate.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.790
Once we do that, then
comes the fantasy portion.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.170
How can we create something
that, either out of flowers

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.440
or of lighting, that
tells the story,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.910
that tells the story in
a way that it's noticed.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.470
As you notice, most of my
job is not understated.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.200
There's nothing
understated about my job.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.840
But I think when I first
started, even though I could

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.010
not do all of this, I always
try to create one statement that

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.740
tells the story, whatever
that statement could be.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.797
And once you have that
one-- it could be out of,

00:17:55.797 --> 00:17:56.880
as I said, out of flowers.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.670
It could be told
in different ways.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.430
Once you have that
statement, then you

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.000
could just go from there.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.500
I design it.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.330
I meet with the client.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.260
I present it to them.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.230
The presentations for
me is very serious.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:16.960
Usually I give them not only
one but three different designs.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.920
I love designing.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.615
So does my team, so
it's not a problem.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.820
They will choose at least
one, and sometimes they

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.260
like all of them.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.580
And whenever that happens,
they will choose elements

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.640
from each one of them in
order to make it real.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.980
But I think from a
creative point of view,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.810
you should just
go crazy designing

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.762
until you feel that you
really get the right one.

00:18:40.762 --> 00:18:41.595
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:18:41.595 --> 00:18:42.678
PRESTON BAILEY: Thank you.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.400
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious what's either

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:55.400
been the most challenging and/or
your favorite installation

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.560
or design, and why.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.690
PRESTON BAILEY: Right.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.910
I've always said that
my most challenging job

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.820
is the one that I'm working at.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.020
And the reason is
a very simple one.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.770
We've come up with these great
ideas and this scale thing,

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.090
and the reality of it is that
I've never seen it before.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.960
So for us to see that
process come to life,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.240
it's very nerve wracking.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.830
Recently, I had a very
traumatic experience, actually

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.920
in Florida.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.790
We did an event in Florida, and
we built this beautiful tent

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.600
with these big,
hanging structures

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.950
with flowers and crystals
and everything else.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.560
And all week, all week
it threatened to rain,

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.930
but nothing came.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.360
The moment the guests starting
walking into the tent,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.130
it poured, but not only poured
but with a wind that literally

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.180
everything was
swinging like this.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.785
And my client was
standing beside me,

00:19:57.785 --> 00:19:58.740
and she's in a panic.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.940
And I'm like, it's OK,
nothing's going to fall.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.200
Meanwhile, I was
absolutely freaking out.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.380
And the reason I
say this, is for me,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:13.100
seeing that job come
to life is exciting,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.720
because my favorite
job, because I'm

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.530
seeing it for the first time.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.030
And also I think the risk
of things going wrong.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.990
No one wants to admit
that things go wrong.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.440
That's a lie.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.510
Every single job that I've
done, things have happened.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.860
So for me, seeing an event come
to life is an exciting process,

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.060
and usually that
is my favorite one.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:40.440
Once that's said, I think one of
the most fun party that we did

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.180
is something that we did
for Oprah a while ago

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.110
that I thought was incredible.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.753
OK.

00:20:45.753 --> 00:20:46.620
Good.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.460
Thank you.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.500
Any other questions?

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.375
AUDIENCE: Your work it's
absolutely stunning.

00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:54.170
PRESTON BAILEY: Thank you.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.961
AUDIENCE: And clearly
you have good fortune

00:20:55.961 --> 00:20:58.780
to work with very large budgets.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.990
So if you didn't, if you
were constrained with budget,

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.570
what would be some
suggestions you'd

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.850
have for others
given that situation?

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.120
PRESTON BAILEY: And this
is a blessing and also

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.360
a curse to have
this large project.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.300
It really is.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.760
But I think that
everyone forgets

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.030
that when I first started,
I only had like $100

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.700
to work with.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.470
Two years later, I had $200.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.420
$500, years later.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.910
The budgets kept
growing very slowly.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:35.080
So I think designing, it's
not a matter of budget.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.720
Clearly you can have much
more fun with lots of budget.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.140
But it's really
a matter of being

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.740
able to allocate whatever you
want to spend, and spend it

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.230
wisely.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.110
That's it.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.460
It's just as simple as that.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:54.030
If you can't do this set
design, do it with candles.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.040
A very easy way to
transform this room,

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.690
if I get 500 votive candles and
just put them over, that's it.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.350
That's a decoration.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.610
And each candle
costs what, 50 cents?

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.680
So it's really not a
matter of the budget--

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.750
it's really a matter of taking
whatever resources you have,

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.500
try to be as inventive
as you possibly can.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.040
And you could come up
with something fun.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.760
OK.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.860
And again, another
advice that I have

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.840
is the elements that you use.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.680
Try to use elements
that are inexpensive

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.660
but just repeat them a lot.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.700
As I just said,
with votive candles,

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.410
if you just do a lot of
votive, you have a design.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.230
If you want to use
flowers, try to get

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.290
a flower that is very cheap.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.850
Separate them,
repeat them, you also

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.470
have a design that is impactful.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.390
And you have to
decide if you want

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.100
a design that is
understated or impactful.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.080
I go for the second.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.988
OK.

00:22:54.988 --> 00:22:55.488
Thank you.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:06.780
AUDIENCE: Hello again.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.860
Do you let your ideas
flow and go along

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.570
as you start planning
an event, or do you

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.320
have everything in
place before you start?

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.860
And are you in
competition with yourself?

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.570
PRESTON BAILEY: That's
a very good question.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.880
Years ago, I used to
hear from my clients--

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.320
I would do this job
and present it to them,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.750
and the day of the
event they would walk in

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.360
and say, Preston, this is
not what I had in mind.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.800
And I learned the hard way
that I do not leave anything

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.670
for surprise or for chance.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:45.880
The process is, the client hired
me, they gave me a deposit.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:51.280
Once they do, I start designing,
and I do it by renderings.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.850
We use all the
different programs,

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:57.980
and we give them at least three
choices, all in rendering.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.870
Once they choose what
they like, then we

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:05.330
set up either small settings,
tables, pieces of the event,

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.410
to actually show them.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.580
We usually photograph
it, and give them a copy

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.750
and we keep a copy.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.250
This way, there is
no room for, this

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.560
is not what we have in mind.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.480
We try to show them everything
as much as possible.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.050
And as far as my
ideas, I think, I'm not

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.650
one of those designers
that walks into a room,

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.230
and it's, this is it.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.810
Not at all.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.840
Usually I have to work for it.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.580
I usually go into the
space, hang out there

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.770
for a day or two.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:41.350
Come back, create a story,
and it develops from there.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.580
It's something that comes
not-- you have to work for it.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.060
I envy those designers
that they come up,

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.270
and they got it immediately.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.790
For me, it's more of
a process of sitting

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.210
with it, go for a
run, go to the gym.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.320
I think about it.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.150
I write in the
morning, and then it

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.088
starts developing
into something.

00:25:01.088 --> 00:25:01.588
OK.

00:25:01.588 --> 00:25:02.088
Thanks.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.697
AUDIENCE: So obviously every
event and every project

00:25:12.697 --> 00:25:14.280
seems to be very
different, but what's

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.610
kind of your typical timeline
from that first meeting

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.870
you have with a client
up into the execution

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.724
of the event itself?

00:25:19.724 --> 00:25:20.640
PRESTON BAILEY: Right.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.470
A comfortable
timeline, I think, is

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.000
anything from six
months to a year.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.780
I think that is a
comfortable timeline.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.500
We have had events-- I think
we did-- what did we do?

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.790
Actually, a few years ago,
I did Mr. Trump's wedding,

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.400
and we had one month.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.790
Literally he came in and
said, we want to get married.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.340
What can you do?

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:43.840
Mr. Trump.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.040
We threw everything
together of course.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.570
And it was a very rapid process.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:57.000
Also, I think you could err
in having too much time.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.160
Which is great, I love
to be booked two years

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.820
in advance, one year in advance.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:01.740
I think it's great.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.170
It's good for business.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.950
But to tell you the truth,
your design sensitivity

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.030
changes in two years.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.890
Things that I like
now, I didn't like

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:12.930
two years ago and vice versa.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:17.650
But I think six months
to a year is comfortable,

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.250
not only from a
design point of view,

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.990
but for my pricing
point of view.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.210
I could certainly
design the job,

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.830
price it out carefully,
competing prices

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.710
to see which one is best.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.670
And if we do something
at last minute,

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.590
I usually have to
rush and just buy

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.330
whatever the first thing--
use the vendor that

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.480
first comes to mind.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.980
But to answer your question,
I think six months to a year

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.300
is a very comfortable time.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:46.800
OK.

00:26:51.157 --> 00:26:52.990
AUDIENCE: What was the
most surprising event

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.934
you were ever asked to design?

00:26:54.934 --> 00:26:56.600
Because it looks like
weddings, and then

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.690
corporate events,
and then holidays.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.490
Is there one that
sticks out that was

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.172
something you hadn't thought of?

00:27:04.172 --> 00:27:05.630
PRESTON BAILEY: I
had a client once

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:10.070
that invited me and a
group of her best friends

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.650
to go to an island--
I think it was

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.410
Grenada, one of those islands.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.680
And they had a private
plane, and everybody

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.300
jumped into the private plane.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.720
What no one knew is
that we had decorated

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.970
the plane for a wedding.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.199
So while they were flying
to their destination,

00:27:28.199 --> 00:27:29.740
while they were
flying, they actually

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.960
got married in the plane, which
I thought was really cool.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.020
Another time that is a
little bit of a sad story,

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.370
but I think it also was fun.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:43.050
There was this couple
that I did a wedding for,

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:46.230
and their families
were fighting a lot.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.610
So they decided to
come to me and for us

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:53.960
to design a Preston Bailey
wedding with everything.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.780
And the two of them
got married alone.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.050
So in a way, they
eloped by themselves.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.900
But they really went
crazy with the design.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:06.480
And later, they took videos,
and they invited both families,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.510
had a big party and
showed the wedding

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:12.580
to them, which I thought that
was such a good solution.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.090
And they had a great time.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.920
They had a 30 piece band.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.160
I mean they really
did it as if it

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.220
was a wedding for 300 people.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.440
And then later on, of course,
they had a private party.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.437
I thought that was pretty cool.

00:28:26.437 --> 00:28:27.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:34.765
PRESTON BAILEY: Any
other questions?

00:28:34.765 --> 00:28:37.173
AUDIENCE: I can't
get to the mic.

00:28:37.173 --> 00:28:38.006
PRESTON BAILEY: Yes.

00:28:38.006 --> 00:28:40.047
AUDIENCE: Where do you
get your inspiration from?

00:28:40.047 --> 00:28:43.645
You have a great sense
[INAUDIBLE] design team,

00:28:43.645 --> 00:28:46.791
but where do your next
ideas spring from?

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:48.790
PRESTON BAILEY: I get my
inspiration from drugs.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.210
No, I'm kidding.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.230
That is a joke.

00:28:55.961 --> 00:28:57.210
Where do I get my inspiration?

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.230
Several places.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.350
I mean, clearly images.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.850
First of all, Pinterest,
which, by the way,

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.720
is like a friend and an
enemy at the same time.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.220
Why?

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.350
Because these ladies walk
in with all of these images,

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.120
that either they want the exact
same thing, which I don't do.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.680
And I usually say, no, we
can't do the same thing.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.770
But I think that the
good thing about them

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.310
is that they are full of ideas.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.610
The theater.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.190
I love fashion.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.060
I look at fashion.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.477
Just a matter of
paying attention.

00:29:31.477 --> 00:29:32.976
I'm walking down
the street, and I'm

00:29:32.976 --> 00:29:34.440
seeing what are
the ladies wearing

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.640
and what are the
colors of the season.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.000
It's really a matter of
being present where you are.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.690
Luckily, at the moment
I do travel a lot,

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.790
and I have the
privilege of visiting

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.010
these incredible cultures that
have the most inspiring ideas.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.200
Recently, for the first
time, I came from Bahrain,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.060
for instance.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:00.840
And again the entire culture is
just amazing in their design,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.270
in the prints.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.130
So it's really a
matter of taking ideas

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.830
from every place, especially
when you're designing a job.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:11.980
You're paying more attention
to whatever is around you.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.250
But the main inspiration
for me comes from nature.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.290
If you see my work,
it's very nature driven.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.196
Years ago, I went to Washington
for the cherry blossom weekend.

00:30:24.196 --> 00:30:25.820
I don't know if you've
ever been there.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.670
If you haven't, you should.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.650
I saw the most incredible trees
and absolutely rows and rows

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.650
of cherry blossoms.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.540
And at that moment,
I said, imagine

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:41.340
what it would be like to have
that beauty and bring it in.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.740
And for that reason, most
of my work tends to be so--

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.940
or I try anyway-- to
make it very powerful.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.090
That you walk in, and
it's like, oh my god,

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.840
this is like so incredible.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.830
So nature is really a big
force of my inspiration.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.780
AUDIENCE: Do you have any tips
for designing in a smaller

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.270
space?

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.280
PRESTON BAILEY: Yes.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.505
Yes, yes yes.

00:31:11.505 --> 00:31:14.160
There's such a
basic, simple trick

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.110
about designing smaller space.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.980
Uplight the walls.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.260
You take this room.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.130
You notice that it's
in darkness right now.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:30.240
If I just uplit the walls,
immediately it gives it depth.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.870
And it's the same thing
with a small space.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:36.050
Immediately it starts
looking bigger.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:40.780
So visually it
changes immediately.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.130
Also, people make the
mistake that in small spaces,

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.900
they put a lot of things in.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.090
You should do the opposite.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.450
Try to empty it as
much as possible

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.520
and just create elements
that are valuable,

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.500
elements that are going to
tell a story, a statement.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.210
But those are the
two basic things

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.170
that I think are very
effective in creating

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.360
a space that is not very big.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.885
And again, whenever you have any
question, just use candlelight.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.511
Uplight the walls, and
just use lots of candles.

00:32:15.511 --> 00:32:16.010
Why?

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.941
Do you have a--?

00:32:16.941 --> 00:32:18.024
AUDIENCE: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.204
PRESTON BAILEY: I'm curious.

00:32:25.204 --> 00:32:26.620
I would help you
if you wanted to.

00:32:28.977 --> 00:32:29.810
Any other questions?

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.490
PRESTON BAILEY:
Thank you so much.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.448
I really appreciate it.

00:32:35.448 --> 00:32:36.940
Thanks a lot.
