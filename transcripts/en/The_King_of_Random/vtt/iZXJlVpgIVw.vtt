00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.349
Hey, what's up guys welcome back to another day experimenting with pyrotechnics Aujormom

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.760
We're going to be mixing a little nail polish remover with some ping pong balls to make nitrocellulose lacquer

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.250
Now for a lot of my pyrotechnic experiments

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.590
I've used this Visco fuse; this is falling leaves

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.220
But the problem with it is not waterproof which means if it got wet or got submerged in a puddle of water the fuse would go out

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.740
So the purpose of today's

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.260
Experiment is to use nail polish remover and ping pong balls to make a nitro cellulose coating which will hopefully make it so our fuses

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269
can burn underwater

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.080
Seriously apparently it burns underwater. That's no good

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.500
That was really interesting because last week when I was testing this experiment all the fuses

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.519
I put in water went out completely but today they all seem to be burning just fine

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.789
I've tried four different fuses and all of them burn underwater, so the results can be very inconsistent, but that's okay

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.710
We're going to go ahead and make nitro lacquer anyway

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.789
Because it's a really cool experiment and just because we can so here's what we want to do

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.079
We want to get some kind of a small jar with a lid and a couple of these ping-pong balls you get at a sporting

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.050
Goods store the ping pong balls from the Dollar Store will not work

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.519
They need to be these professional branded type thing pong balls to get a sporting Goods store now

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.899
if you've got the right kind of ping pong balls

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.800
There's a really cool trick. You might already be familiar with it happens when you touch it with a flame

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.000
Ping pong balls are highly flammable they go up in flames very very quickly and leave very little residue

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.060
And that's because these things are made mostly of Nitrocellulose

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.860
So to make a nitro set of those lacquer all we have to do is take a few of these ping pong balls and use

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.860
Some nail polish remover to dissolve them

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.800
Things are going to happen a lot quicker and easier if we start shredding our ping pong balls into smaller pieces

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.700
So take that like a pair of scissors and cut them up into the smallest pieces you can get and drop them into a small jar

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.300
So here we are guys after about two minutes

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.820
We've got two ping-pong balls

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.650
Reduced to very small pieces now

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.949
all we have to do is transfer these pieces to our small glass container add a little bit of nail polish remover and screw on

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.729
The lid then shake it up and wait

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.580
How much nail polish remover do we add that is the question I guess we're going to experiment and find out

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.220
I'm going to pour in enough just to come to the top of those pieces

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.500
All right, it's been a couple of minutes, and if we take the lid off now and take a look inside

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.970
You can see our crispy flakes of Ping-pong balls have turned into a goo

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.319
Kind of turn Mushy here

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.348
And I suppose the longer we let that fit in the acetone the thinner and runnier it will become

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.600
But this is the goo that we're looking for

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.640
We're going to thin that out a little bit more you can see our ping-pong balls are almost turned into a paste

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.980
Looks like a paper mache paste

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.799
so that's pretty cool guys you can see that after just about three minutes our ping-pong balls have dissolved in the nail polish remover to

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.469
Form this goopy paste, which kind of looks like wallpaper paste now if we add a little bit more nail polish remover

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.470
we can make this liquid even runnier and in

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.429
contrast if we let it sit out for a while the fumes will vaporize off and make the substance hard again

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.409
So theoretically I suppose you can cast ping-pong plastic into just about any shape you want alright

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.400
Let's open this thing up until we got here

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.600
ooh, nice and creamy

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.060
almost looks like school glue

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.209
pyrotechnic Elmer's glue I kept adding nail polish remover until all the big chunks dissolved and now it's very smooth very runny

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.959
And it's almost like paint which means we could use it as a pyrotechnic coating

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.060
Nexus Titleist lego, haha! I love it

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.980
The nail Polish remover is extremely flammable ping-pong balls are extremely flammable. Do you think this stuff mixed together is extremely flammable?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.300
oh yeah, very flammable

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.800
so we have just created a pyrotechnic paint that makes me wonder what we could paint with it

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.300
Look at a nice, shiny surface that creates

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.600
pyrotechnic paint

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.400
that looks cool, the patterns it burns

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.000
Little Nitro Legos

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.200
It's amazing that when I put the fuse into the lacquer here it softens up and becomes extremely flexible

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.500
Which makes me wonder if the coating isn't already infused with the nitrocellulose lacquer? I'm betting it probably is

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.620
Now the lacquer has hardened you can see the fuse's gone sniff again; doesn't send like it did before

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.160
Now it goes out. It works great before we apply the coating

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.300
That's weird

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.400
The nice thing about it is how quickly that burnt off

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.100
from a little paint

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.949
So now here we are guys we turned nail polish remover and some ping- pong balls into a white mushy goop that

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.830
I'm going to call pyrotechnic paint and there are a few interesting things about its characteristics that we learned during these experiments today

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.710
We started our experiments today with ping-pong balls and nail polish remover and the intent to make a waterproof coating for fuses

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.660
But in testing our fuses we found that they already burn underwater

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.200
and that's probably because they've already got nitro lacquer built into them

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.722
we also found that we could change the consistency of our lacquer by adding more nail polish remover and stirring it in

00:06:55.722 --> 00:06:57.280
or just by letting it sit out for a while

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.880
so the acetone could evaporate

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.029
next we tried smearing the stuff on a piece of wood and found that it actually does work as a lacquer to help seal and

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.060
preserve the finish

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.770
But we also realize that this lacquer is extremely flammable and while it can be poured into any mold or painted on any surface,

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.909
if it comes into contact with any kind of a spark or a flame, things can get pretty hot pretty fast

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.740
now for one final experiment,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.160
I wondered if we could make a firecracker that would burn off and explode underwater as well

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.240
But in testing those we found that they just went off by themselves anyway in a spectacular fashion mind you

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.300
Ouch my ears.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.200
woah!

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.560
Dang!

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:53.869
So there you have it guys now you know how to turn nail polish remover and ping pong balls into pyrotechnic paint
