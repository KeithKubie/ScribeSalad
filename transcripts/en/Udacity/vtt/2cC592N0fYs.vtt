00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.820
Let's look at the solution to our BTB and BHT quiz. The question this time is,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.200
which BHT entry do we access for each

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.899
instruction? There are 16 entries in the BHT,

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.356
and we said that we access the BHT

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:18.619
using the lowermost bits of the instruction address.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.340
That they are not the same for all

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.478
instructions. In this case, our instruction address has

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:32.369
the following bits. For the move instruction here we have C000, because every

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.470
instruction is 4 bytes in size, the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.770
lower most 2-bits are never changing; they're

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.580
always going to be 0 for our instructions. And now because

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.520
we have 16 BHT entries, we take the next 4 bits and this is the number of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.775
the BHT entry. In this case we're accessing the BHT entry number 0. Now

00:00:56.775 --> 00:01:02.830
let's look at this other move instruction here whose address is C004. C00 are

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:10.292
not changing, what is changing is 4. Four in binary 0100. Again we discard

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:13.148
these bits because they're never changing among

00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:15.664
instructions, and this is the number of the

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:22.140
BHT entry. So the entry that we access here is 1. Now you can tell that for

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.033
instruction 8 here, this is going to be 10, so we are going to access the

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:35.338
BHT entry number 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. If we reached 15 we

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:39.720
will then wrap around to 0, but we never reach it. So this is really what we get
