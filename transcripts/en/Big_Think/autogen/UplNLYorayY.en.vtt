not all loves are created equal as far
as the brain is concerned studies have

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379
as the brain is concerned studies have
 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.609
as the brain is concerned studies have
looked at activity in the brain when

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619
looked at activity in the brain when
 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.730
looked at activity in the brain when
recalling passionate or romantic love

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740

different centers definitely are more

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
different centers definitely are more
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.010
different centers definitely are more
active than the words they put people

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020
active than the words they put people
 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.170
active than the words they put people
into the functional MRI and they said

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180
into the functional MRI and they said
 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.569
into the functional MRI and they said
think about your partner or think about

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
think about your partner or think about
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.290
think about your partner or think about
your lover and certain areas lit up or

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
your lover and certain areas lit up or
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.110
your lover and certain areas lit up or
they said think about your mom and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120
they said think about your mom and
 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.299
they said think about your mom and
different areas lit up which is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
different areas lit up which is
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.599
different areas lit up which is
important because different areas are

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609
important because different areas are
 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.489
important because different areas are
responsible for the release of different

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499
responsible for the release of different
 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.860
responsible for the release of different
neurotransmitters which then come to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
neurotransmitters which then come to
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.319
neurotransmitters which then come to
affect your future feeling states and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
affect your future feeling states and
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.879
affect your future feeling states and
future behaviors so during romantic or

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:55.889
future behaviors so during romantic or
 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.520
future behaviors so during romantic or
passionate love what happens from a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
passionate love what happens from a
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410
passionate love what happens from a
neurotransmitter standpoint those

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
neurotransmitter standpoint those
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.199
neurotransmitter standpoint those
chemicals that are released when you

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:03.209
chemicals that are released when you
 

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:06.649
chemicals that are released when you
have that particular experience dopamine

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
have that particular experience dopamine
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.650
have that particular experience dopamine
goes up dopamine is essentially the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660
goes up dopamine is essentially the
 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.160
goes up dopamine is essentially the
neurotransmitter of reward so it is a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
neurotransmitter of reward so it is a
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.750
neurotransmitter of reward so it is a
neurotransmitter that's released when

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
neurotransmitter that's released when
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670
neurotransmitter that's released when
you have new or novel experience but

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
you have new or novel experience but
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140
you have new or novel experience but
particularly experiences that are

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
particularly experiences that are
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.800
particularly experiences that are
reinforcing like gambling or something

addicted to it there are changes in
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.240
addicted to it there are changes in
other neurotransmitters as well so if

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250

with them partially because of that
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.699
with them partially because of that
neurotransmitter there are other

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
neurotransmitter there are other
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.050
neurotransmitter there are other
neurotransmitters that actually also

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060
neurotransmitters that actually also
 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.800
neurotransmitters that actually also
change vasopressin which has to do with

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810
change vasopressin which has to do with
 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.229
change vasopressin which has to do with
stress level and so there's this whole

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239
stress level and so there's this whole
 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.990
stress level and so there's this whole
pan of plateau flicker of a release of

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
pan of plateau flicker of a release of
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.390

intimately cuddly attached and and
 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.840
intimately cuddly attached and and
stressed actually it is a stressful

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850
stressed actually it is a stressful
 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.949
stressed actually it is a stressful
condition to some degree to be really

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959

released in lust okay which I'm going to

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580
released in lust okay which I'm going to
 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.259
released in lust okay which I'm going to
say is like the earliest stage perhaps

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269
say is like the earliest stage perhaps
 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.460
say is like the earliest stage perhaps
and so that's why to some degree it can

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
and so that's why to some degree it can
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.590
and so that's why to some degree it can
be good to give it a little bit of time

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
be good to give it a little bit of time
 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.900
be good to give it a little bit of time
before you invest too much in this

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910
before you invest too much in this
 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.290
before you invest too much in this
