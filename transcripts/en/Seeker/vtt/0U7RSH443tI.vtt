00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.080
Our scientific world is both expanding and
getting more precise every day.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.059
We’re pushing the boundaries of what we’d
ever thought possible...but that means the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.070
way we measure that science has to keep getting
more precise too.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.590
Are we ever going to hit the limit of what
we can see...and therefore what we can discover?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.720
Well, new research has now given us the world’s
fastest camera--so that’s a step in the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.740
right direction.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.890
Hashtag ‘no filter’.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.750
To give you the whole picture, back in the
1920’s a pioneering electrical engineer

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.829
named Harold Edgerton made history when he
was able to capture images of things that

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.000
happened on the microsecond scale--that’s
one-millionth of a second

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.350
Flash forward to today, and we’ve moved
beyond the microsecond.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.760
Many research facilities around the world
want to explore stuff that’s happening in

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.630
the femtosecond range.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.260
That’s a quadrillionth of a second.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.040
Literally millionths of a billionth of a second.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.800
What kind of things happen that fast?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.180
Well for one, LASERS.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.320
Lasers that fire femtosecond pulses can help
us explore the tiny nooks and crannies of

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320
our universe.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.219
They’re being used in materials processing,
to fabricate micromachines and biochips.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.829
Ultrafast pulse lasers have enabled fields
like biophotonics, which let us image the

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.420
function of live tissues in 3D--which has
helped us expand our understanding of the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.189
physical function of the human brain.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.090
And these kinds of laser pulses are essential
for photochemistry and photobiology, fields

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.519
that let us see natural reactions on a molecular
level.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:33.619
So the ultrafast laser equals ultrasmall imaging

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.619
scale.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.310
BUT the problem here is that it is so freaking
hard to get a picture of what’s happening

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.219
at the femtosecond speed, you guys.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.439
It’s REAL snappy.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.659
Until now, the best way we’ve had to image
the interactions that happen anywhere even

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.599
close to this pace are what are called ‘streak
cameras’.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.039
You have to capture multiple pulses over a
period of time to create what is basically

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.079
a stop motion video of the interaction.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.169
It’s not the most accurate picture of what’s
happening and in some experiments, the material

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:06.639
is too fragile to fire the laser at it multiple
times.

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.680
You ONLY get to fire the laser once.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.450
So how do you take a picture?

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.040
If you’re the researchers in this experiment,
you make a hybrid.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.000
This new technology is called single-shot
10-trillion-frame-per-second compressed ultrafast

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.870
photography--or T-CUP for short.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.510
It combines a version of the typical streak
camera with a static camera and then uses

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.590
a mathematical technique called radon transformation
&nbsp;to yield images of the laser-material interaction

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.920
at a resolution of--as the name state--a trillion
frames per second.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.470
Which is a heck of a lot more accurate than
previous attempts.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.950
This new camera system can combine the frames
it captures to make a movie where we can actually

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.470
see the movement of light.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.470
This camera is basically like recording in
1080HD after only being able to look at something

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.470
in gif quality.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.470
And the team’s not done yet!

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.540
They have plans to keep increasing the precision
of this camera, hoping to get the resolution

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.710
all the way to a quadrillion frames per second.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.900
This is the fastest camera ever created, capturing
the behavior of a femtosecond long laser pulse

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.890
passing through glass, fast enough to image
nanoscale interaction between the laser and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.890
the matter.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.800
And see how it takes a pretty long time to
pass through the beam splitter in the middle?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.200
That’s something we’ve never been able
to visually see before, and that’s really

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.150
important to experimental design and function
of laser systems.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.210
Frame by frame, we are getting closer to being
able to actually see the tiny details of the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.210
world.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.160
This new level of insight will allow us to
ask new questions--both about the light itself

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:48.460
and everything it helps

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:57.770
us see.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.560
My favorite thing that can be imaged at the
molecular level is photosynthesis.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.470
Using femtosecond laser pulses, we can generate
X-rays that help us see INSIDE cells, down

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.840
to the individual proteins that act in photosynthesis...some
of this process is actually still a mystery

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.840
that we’re trying to uncover.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.430
