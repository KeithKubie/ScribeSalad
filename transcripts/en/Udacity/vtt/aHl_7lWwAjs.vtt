00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.824
We're going to continue solving equations and this time, we're going to solve

00:00:02.824 --> 00:00:06.780
some radical equations. We'll use our knowledge of radicals and powers to help

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.094
us out. When we solve radical equations like this one, we want to isolate the

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:16.318
square root or the root on one side of the equals sign. This equation already

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:20.124
has the radical on one side of the equals sign. This radical is actually a

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:25.462
grouping symbol, and the quantity p plus 1 is underneath of it. So, when we're

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:30.553
trying to find the value of p, we want to undo the square root. To undo the

00:00:30.553 --> 00:00:35.450
square root, you want to square both sides of our equation. We know this since

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.144
a square power undoes the square root. So, try finishing this problem. What

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:41.550
would you get for p?
