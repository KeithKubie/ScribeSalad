00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.530
Today on the podcast. Robert, we're going to talk, um, constitutional law, uh,

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.480
federalism and uh, and the intricacies of international treaty practice.

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.520
Oh God. You're ready. No, no. It's going to be good. It's going to be good.

4
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.880
It's gonna be good cause I have. Hello. Hey guys. Hi Kelsey. Hello.

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.650
Kelsey Padgett has reported this segment and just listen to how it starts.

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.520
So the story starts with a betrayed spouse.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.680
We see in those much better. I'm coming back to my seat. You get some popcorn?

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.550
My name is Dunkin Hollis. He's not the betrayed spouse. Nope.

9
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.780
I'm a professor of international law here at Temple University in Philadelphia

10
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.270
and I'm Nick Rosencranz and not him either.

11
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.570
I'm a professor of law at Georgetown.

12
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:50.830
I'm also a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute.

13
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.600
So Mrs. Bond, that's her. That's our Patreon spouse.

14
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.540
Carolyn Bond 36 lives in a suburb of Philly.

15
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.780
Discovered that her husband was having an affair with her neighbor. Actually,

16
00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:04.660
it was worse than that. This woman is her best friend.

17
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.330
Not only that, uh, she finds out that her friend is pregnant, uh,

18
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.770
via her husband. He got her practice.

19
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.670
Oh my God. Yeah. And this is her best friend and her husband had 14 years,

20
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:24.640
you know, she was quite upset, distraught, enraged, I would imagine. Yeah.

21
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.440
Carol made threats. There were confrontations.

22
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.800
The other woman is named Melinda Hanes by the way. And eventually

23
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.760
Carolyn Bond, she did what anyone would do.

24
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.360
She got a bunch of toxic chemicals and I do it all the time.

25
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.600
And she tried to poison her best friend repeatedly or the backup for a second.

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.600
Where would she have gotten the chemicals from? She worked, I believe at a lab.

27
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.290
She works for a chemical company, I think it's Roman Haas.

28
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.730
So she's a biochemist. She's actually a microbiologist, but she uh,

29
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.110
grabbed some chemicals from her office.

30
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.670
I think she also ordered some off the internet,

31
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.390
amazon.com but they're pretty serious chemicals. Like what? Well,

32
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:04.620
one was arsenic based and in large enough doses.

33
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.090
And when I say large doses, I'm talking teaspoons, not gallons. It can,

34
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.910
you know, um, cause serious injury and can be fatal. So anyway,

35
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:14.670
she took these chemicals, she went over to her best friend's or well,

36
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:16.080
her former best friend's house,

37
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.110
and she spread them on the door knob and on the mailbox,

38
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.860
the door to her car. And they're visible, I guess. I guess you can see them.

39
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.010
So the best friend is unfold. Nope. She calls actually the local police,

40
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.910
local police tell her to take her car to a car wash. They said, Yo, you know,

41
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.010
it could be drugs, would get the car washed off. They kind of just blow her off.

42
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.960
Uh, but it keeps happening over the course of like half a year.

43
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.440
This happens 24 times 24 powder attack according to the court briefs.

44
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.390
You know, the police were just not being very responsive.

45
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.180
She called them over a dozen times and they tested it to see if it was cocaine.

46
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.840
But once they figured out it wasn't, they didn't really do anything.

47
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.160
So finally tells the post office and it was the post office that actually sent

48
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.450
out postal inspectors and they set up a hidden camera and they videotaped

49
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:10.030
Caroline bond in the act. They get it on tape.

50
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.020
That's how they identify her as the person putting the chemicals, you know,

51
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:18.280
on the mailbox. I didn't know the post office did stuff like that to be honest.

52
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:22.900
I didn't either. That's so, I think of them so differently now. Yes.

53
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.810
And I'm, I think if there's a moral to the story, it is,

54
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.790
do not mess with the males. They take that, they take that very seriously.

55
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.550
Actually, there's a whole lot more going on than just messing with the mail

56
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.660
<v 2>because of what happens next. Um, so according to Nick Rosenkranz,</v>

57
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.440
generally things like assault or tempted murder, those are state crimes.

58
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.890
In most circumstances. The federal government can't charge you with murder.

59
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.650
The post office, that's a federal institution.

60
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.330
So when they caught Caroline bond,

61
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.960
they kicked this up to the federal attorney who then went ahead and brought a

62
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:55.980
federal keys.

63
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.383
<v 0>And here's the thing,</v>

64
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.710
they ended up charging Carolyn Bond with [inaudible] violating the international

65
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.850
chemical weapons treaty. What we should be clear,

66
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:12.851
the victim got a tiny thumb Byrne and ran cold water on it and was fine.

67
00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:17.340
So this is, we're not, this is, um, this is not murdered.

68
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.200
All the more odd, very odd. When I played in someone, I'm,

69
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:24.610
the last thing I'm thinking about is violating an international treaty.

70
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.370
We should never have you over for lunch. But no, really,

71
00:04:28.371 --> 00:04:30.800
why would they charge you with that? I don't understand. Well,

72
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:32.450
if you actually read the treaty,

73
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.220
the statutes and police says that it's a crime to use a toxic chemical for other

74
00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:40.530
than a peaceful purpose. That's the exact language. And that guy that,

75
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:41.450
that's John Bellinger.

76
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.770
I served as the legal advisor for the Department of State Under Secretary

77
00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:49.280
Condoleezza Rice. And John says that even though it sounds a little weird,

78
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.150
this is exactly what this treaty was meant for, for people using chemicals,

79
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.050
highly toxic chemicals or non peaceful purposes. Exactly right.

80
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.950
And that's what happened here.

81
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.300
Imagine if she had killed a bunch of postal workers then I don't think anybody

82
00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:05.900
would complain. But the charger with an international treaty violation,

83
00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:08.660
that just seems, it seems too big for the little lady.

84
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.460
It was really odd to her lawyers too. I bet they're like, look,

85
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.960
in the constitution you have laid out what the federal government could do.

86
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.520
This is not one of those things.

87
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.110
You can't just take a treaty and use it to reach into the very local life of a

88
00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:27.830
normal person. That's a huge overreach. Sneaky frankly.

89
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.720
And now this case is before the Supreme Court and it's become an ideological

90
00:05:32.721 --> 00:05:34.850
battle that goes way beyond Carolyn Bond,

91
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.760
her cheating husband or her adulterous best friend.

92
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.340
And I would argue that this case is weird as it is racist,

93
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.710
some really important, uh,

94
00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:46.070
issues about how the world is changing and about one of the most fundamental

95
00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:49.280
questions that is at the heart of America.

96
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.600
I really believe that. Well, you have to defend that position. What do you,

97
00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:57.410
what do you mean? Let me take you back to the beginning. Okay, sure.

98
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 3>My name is Joseph J. Ellis. I am a historian.</v>

99
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.890
I've written the book called founding brothers.

100
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:07.010
And my most recent book is called, what's it called?

101
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.150
Revolutionary Summer. You have a modest man.

102
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.750
Joseph Ellis has written a Pulitzer Prize winning author.

103
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.640
He's written a bunch of books about the founding of our country. Um,

104
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.740
the revolutionary war,

105
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.770
and there is a scene in one of his books were called American creation didn't

106
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:25.420
sell as many as sounding brothers.

107
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.340
It doesn't matter to me because he has this one passage that when I read it,

108
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.360
I was like, wow, I've never thought of this country that way.

109
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.840
But to set the scene, or you want to be real specific, September,

110
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.520
September, 1787 in Philadelphia, you know, it's abominably hot.

111
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.370
Yet all of these great men crammed into a State House.

112
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:46.070
I mean George Washington Fisk guy is a stud

113
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.670
63 and war hero. This is overwhelming. Alexander Hamilton was there, Hamilton,

114
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.910
he would've got the highest grades on the LSA teas. I'm telling you,

115
00:06:55.911 --> 00:07:00.050
this guy was really smart. Even Ben Franklin who's pushing 81 at this point,

116
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.190
Franklin Stair, oh, they all came together to try and figure out like,

117
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.460
how do we do this? Like if you think about it,

118
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:09.890
it was a puzzle because you've got these 13 colonies,

119
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:12.110
which are really like sovereign nations.

120
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.070
They were loosely organized into a federation. That was about to go bankrupt,

121
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:17.540
so they had to do some things. They're like, okay,

122
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:22.400
let's bring them together into a union, but how do we do that without a king?

123
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.700
It was a crazy experiment. What do I mean? One thing,

124
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.280
you got to realize that at that time in American history,

125
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.170
the average person was born,

126
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.650
lived out his or her life and died within a 30 mile radius.

127
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.850
They don't have cell phones and they don't think about themselves as Americans.

128
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.600
They thought of themselves as Pennsylvanians, south Carolinians, Bostonians.

129
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.230
There is no real national ethos, so that's one problem. Second problem,

130
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.420
the founding fathers could not agree,

131
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.340
could not agree on the most basic question if there's not a king who's in

132
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:56.510
charge, right? The so-called sovereignty question,

133
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.470
and on the one hand you had a guy like Alexander Hamilton who got up there and

134
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:03.420
was like, why do we even need states? What's the state? All right,

135
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.950
what we need is a federal government that is big and strong and powerful.

136
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.490
That's Hamilton. Baby Hamilton wants a president elected for life.

137
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.460
Hamilton wants a senator elected for life. On the other hand,

138
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.180
you had the Thomas Jefferson School of thought, which is like, no, no,

139
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.360
we just got out of a monarchy for Christ sake and the only way we're not going

140
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:24.650
to get back in one is if we keep the government small restricted and all

141
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.160
domestic policy belongs in the hands of the states. Sound familiar?

142
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.730
Jefferson likes anything in which the government's not going to be doing much.

143
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.810
So you had these two very different philosophies and the way Joe sees it,

144
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.640
you let Jefferson have total power. We're end up at anarchy.

145
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:39.080
You could let Hamilton have total power.

146
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:42.560
You're going to end up with the totalitarian state at the convention.

147
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:46.940
The two sides went back and forth and any time a Hamiltonian type proposal hit

148
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:50.960
the floor, some of the states would say, oh no,

149
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.560
and they shoot it down because they did not want some big government telling

150
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:55.394
them what to,

151
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.580
especially when the 800 pound gorilla in the room was slavery.

152
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.680
So they couldn't agree at all. And into this mess walks our hero.

153
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.400
James Mattson. Madison. Yeah. Like Madison is five to one 20.

154
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.050
He's the kind of guy that stands in the corners during the dance.

155
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.740
He's you would call him a nerd or you might call him a pragmatist.

156
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.590
Madison wants a clear decision about sovereignty. Yeah.

157
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:29.790
Like for example on local matters who gets the final say the states or the

158
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.210
federal government, just give me some clarity and uh, he's not going to get it.

159
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.540
And he comes to that realization at the very end.

160
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.400
Cause at the end of the convention they have this document.

161
00:09:39.401 --> 00:09:42.580
I mean he wrote the original blueprint. Now there's this new document.

162
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:46.450
So riddled with compromises that according to Joe,

163
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.740
the basic question he wanted answered wasn't the WHO's in charge.

164
00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:55.210
Question was left kind of vague on all sorts of matters.

165
00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:58.210
I mean who regulates money in banks? Who gets to tax? What?

166
00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:01.690
Who decides whether new states will be slave states or free states? Who's vague?

167
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.940
And initially Gordon Joe in a letter that Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson,

168
00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:10.660
he's like, come on, he's very disappointed.

169
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.630
He thinks the document's going to fail and the country's going to fail.

170
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.540
He doesn't think this is going to last. But then Joe says in his writings,

171
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.940
you start to see a shift. He starts to think differently.

172
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.760
He starts to say, Oh yeah, wait a second. This,

173
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.090
this could work precisely because it's unclear.

174
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.470
And we found what he calls a middle station where everyone can see what they

175
00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:38.830
want to see. I mean, people come out of the convention, go back to their states,

176
00:10:38.831 --> 00:10:42.160
and the guy in South Carolina says, don't worry about slavery.

177
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.220
Lieutenant Amendment's going to tell us that they can't do that.

178
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.720
The guy in Pennsylvania and says,

179
00:10:46.721 --> 00:10:48.700
it's just a matter of time before we have slavery.

180
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.480
The constitution becomes successful because the people don't agree on what it

181
00:10:52.481 --> 00:10:53.314
means.

182
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.810
That according to Joe was Madison's epiphany with the constitution isn't a set

183
00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:01.840
of answers. It's a framework for argument.

184
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:07.470
This is a document which allows us to continue to discuss and debate the core

185
00:11:07.631 --> 00:11:11.470
issues that we faced, the powers of the presidency, the sovereignty question,

186
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.710
the real resolution of the sovereignty question is never is never achieved.

187
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.440
And um, and it eventually leads to the civil war.

188
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.980
I find kind of neat about this is that like that argument that happens in modern

189
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:31.070
politics all the time about states' rights or the size of the government,

190
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.080
which can feel like a random argument for me at times suddenly to know this.

191
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.320
I mean if you by what Joe's saying, it's not random at all.

192
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:43.220
This is an argument that was actually literally written into our founding

193
00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:47.960
document. In some sense. We as a country are the product of that argument.

194
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.090
Of course, not everybody agrees with Joseph Ellis.

195
00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:54.910
There are people who who think that the fathers had a very specific thing in

196
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:58.690
mind and if you just go back to their debates and to what they said to each

197
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:03.100
other, that you can find the real only deep logic for the constitution.

198
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.830
So the fact that they disagree with Joe in some sense,

199
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.800
doesn't that kind of make Joe's point? Okay,

200
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.210
I can do this document in 10 different ways. Yes.

201
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:13.810
Everyone always argues always just to pick up the thread.

202
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:16.870
I mean after the civil war, the argument changes, it gets centered,

203
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.980
but the union is still an experiment. Yeah.

204
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:24.490
Massachusetts can still do their business differently than Colorado,

205
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.930
differently than Vermont,

206
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.310
and the jostling between the federal government and the state government doesn't

207
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:33.700
end. It just gets a little quieter. Thank heavens, because you don't want,

208
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:37.480
unless you're a duck. And our next stop is,

209
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.850
and this one has everything to do with our poisoner.

210
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.840
<v 0>So it's spring of 1919 rural Missouri.</v>

211
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.710
You've got frank mcallister, the attorney general of Missouri.

212
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.590
He's out there with a bunch of friends and they're pointing their guns at the

213
00:12:52.591 --> 00:12:57.591
sky and shooting them one after another after another,

214
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.380
and they ended up shooting all in all 76 he knows he can do this because you

215
00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:10.740
know he's the attorney general of the state.

216
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:14.910
He knows all the laws of the state and he knows it's his right to shoot whatever

217
00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:19.260
duck is flying in the sky of Missouri is to state law. That's the state law.

218
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.370
You can shoot the ducks. So they're out there have,

219
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.180
they're having this great time, they're having this great hall.

220
00:13:24.181 --> 00:13:28.350
They'd gotten all these ducks. And then out of nowhere, Ray Holland,

221
00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:32.280
the federal game warden shows up and he says, no, you, you can't do this.

222
00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:36.740
You can't shoot these birds. They're not your property. MCALLISTER says you,

223
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.580
you're wrong. This is a matter for the state. You know, it's our sovereignty.

224
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:44.190
We never gave this over to the federal government. So you must have been like,

225
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.350
I don't think the federal government anything to say to be able to duck that it

226
00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:49.170
was born here. I leave the, I looked, I found it in the sky here.

227
00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:51.810
I shot it here, it died here and I'm going to eat it here.

228
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.490
So this is my duck that the game warden says, no, it's not your duck.

229
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.300
And he rest them all setting up a landmark confrontation.

230
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.860
Because here's what had happened two years earlier.

231
00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:08.010
The administration of Woodrow Wilson was sitting there wringing their hands

232
00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:11.970
thinking all these people are killing birds at like a nonstop pace.

233
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.420
And if this didn't stop, no.

234
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.110
There was some concern at this period that we were going to, you know,

235
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.290
we were going to hunt these things for extinction. You know,

236
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.210
we might not have any migratory birds at all.

237
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.910
Problem is the courts had already told the federal government,

238
00:14:23.911 --> 00:14:27.870
this is surely a local matter, you can't make federal hunting laws.

239
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.340
But then somebody in the administration has this really great idea or really

240
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:36.570
evil idea depending on how you look at it.

241
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.870
Maybe if we can get Canada to cooperate with us,

242
00:14:39.871 --> 00:14:44.400
we can do this by a treaty because there's this clause in the constitution that

243
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:46.470
says treaties are the supreme law of the land.

244
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.890
So maybe if we make it international treaty,

245
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.130
then the states will to go along. Frank mcellister,

246
00:14:53.131 --> 00:14:56.370
he sues and this goes all the way up to the supreme court.

247
00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.360
It lands before Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of the more famous, uh,

248
00:15:00.361 --> 00:15:04.320
justices of the supreme court. And he basically says,

249
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.530
the treaty power is something that was given to the federal government.

250
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.160
Don't limit this. This treaty is good. And, uh,

251
00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:15.150
the treaty and the legislation are upheld and score one for the federal

252
00:15:15.151 --> 00:15:18.280
government score, one for the federal government. And in there, um,

253
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.750
you actually have homes talking about what the constitution is. He, you know,

254
00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:22.590
he was this what,

255
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:27.570
thrice wounded civil war veteran and he actually invokes the language of,

256
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.510
of the civil war saying we, you know, we spent all this, um,

257
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.830
sweat and blood to figure out what kind of nation we were going to become for

258
00:15:34.831 --> 00:15:35.460
birds.

259
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:40.260
He invokes this language and basically says whatever we had debated in the past,

260
00:15:40.261 --> 00:15:44.190
you know, could the states regulate slavery without federal interference?

261
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.510
And home says, no. You know that the side who fought that argument, they lost

262
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:03.720
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

263
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.700
<v 0>all this talking about birds and you know,</v>

264
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.870
state versus federal has everything to do with our poisoner and bond.

265
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:14.250
This case is the precedent upon which the federal government says that they can

266
00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:18.600
prosecute Caroline lawn because Oliver Wendell Holmes said that treaties are the

267
00:16:18.601 --> 00:16:21.960
supreme law of the land. I don't know. I, I'm still,

268
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.080
I'm still of the mind that this is a sneaky bit of business by the,

269
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.170
by the federal government. I mean, it's not sneaky. If you're a duck,

270
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.110
I feel, I must speak on behalf of the dogs here, but no, forget your ducks.

271
00:16:37.111 --> 00:16:41.760
This is a Pennsylvania lady doing a Pennsylvania adultery in a Pennsylvania

272
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:45.060
mailbox with a Pennsylvania mood. I mean, there's nothing,

273
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.050
there's no birds flying overhead. This is an all Pennsylvania crime.

274
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.010
But you know, who wasn't doing it? God Damn thing about that. Pennsylvania eggs.

275
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.870
Oh, oh. But just to take your side for a second, Robert, um,

276
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.560
if you really think about it and you know,

277
00:17:01.561 --> 00:17:05.250
and the way that Nick Rosenkranz thinks about it, this is really troubling.

278
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.640
This decision seems to say that theoretically the federal government's power is

279
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.170
potentially infinite.

280
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.630
<v 5>No, no, no.</v>

281
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.940
<v 0>Cause like, say John Kerry, who's our secretary of state right now,</v>

282
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:20.930
he goes and makes treaties,

283
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.520
say he's talking to Zimbabwe and we agree that we want to have a treaty about

284
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.080
educational standards for children.

285
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.460
So we come home and we write a law that says all children must go to public

286
00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:34.970
schools, but then that would outlaw homeschooling for children,

287
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.000
which is a clear local state matter.

288
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.080
But now suddenly the federal government has a power to do that just seems odd.

289
00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:44.240
The idea that, uh, the president,

290
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:49.241
the Senate in Zimbabwe can increase Congress's legislative powers.

291
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.600
Here's how John Bellinger response.

292
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.440
Is it a theoretical possibility that the federal government might try to go and

293
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.870
do that? I suppose it's theoretically possible,

294
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.180
but there's no evidence that that happened here.

295
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.020
There's no evidence that that has happened in the a hundred years since Missouri

296
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.760
versus Holland. He would say, look,

297
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.970
consider the practical impact that it decision might have that would cut back on

298
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:12.480
the president's treaty power.

299
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.100
Other countries are already highly suspicious of the United States ability to

300
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:21.000
deliver on it's a tweedy commitments anyway. John would say,

301
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.860
why would any other country want to make it treaty with us if Kansas could back

302
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:29.940
out at any time and like how do you do deal with a question like global warming

303
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.870
if everybody is allowed to be left to their own devices? Well now that's a,

304
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.880
that's a tough one. I mean the reality is that stuck in Hollis, again,

305
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:43.590
we live in a globalized world. Whether it's, you know,

306
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.330
dealing with things like climate change, terrorism, shipwreck, cyber crime.

307
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:53.540
Increasingly these are things we can no longer regulate just within a particular

308
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:56.580
local community or a local society. And like on some level,

309
00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:59.880
if we now find ourselves in this world where like I can get on the Internet and

310
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.720
spend hours and hours playing world of Warcraft with people in Yugoslavia and

311
00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:06.150
yet, and I've never really talked to my neighbor that's just down the street,

312
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.530
like why wouldn't we all have the same laws? But you know,

313
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.200
I think the flip side of your question is find the world is very interconnected,

314
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:16.080
but are there still some things that are local?

315
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:21.450
Are there some things left where we could say the federal government doesn't

316
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:23.820
need to be able to reach this? And more than that,

317
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.480
nick says that having a bunch of different communities that are governed by

318
00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:30.870
different rules all under the same nation, actually

319
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.090
<v 6>it has a bunch of benefits. Um, competition. This,</v>

320
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:39.091
the idea of laboratories of democracy that the 50 states will all try different

321
00:19:39.281 --> 00:19:44.170
things as to regulating guns near schools, as to regulating whatever it is.

322
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.860
And maybe some state we'll hit on something brilliant. And if they do,

323
00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:51.670
then it will spread and be replicated and you know that theory has been born out

324
00:19:51.671 --> 00:19:53.020
in a lot of different areas.

325
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.070
When the feds decided that they're going to come up with a one size fits all

326
00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.830
national solution, that's the end of the experiment.

327
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.083
<v 8>Oh,</v>

328
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.730
<v 10>so by the way, wait, what happened to Carolyn [inaudible]? She went to,</v>

329
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.640
she's in jail. She's still in jail? No, she's out now. So she's,

330
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.660
she could go to court and find out whether this thing was high school.

331
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.670
She can show up. What about the, the, the poison. He what? What happened to her?

332
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.840
She changed her name. She moved away. She's uncertainty now.

333
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.990
I hope she moved to Zimbabwe. Is She's still living with the guy that gave,

334
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.000
gave her the baby or no, no, no, no. You see,

335
00:20:37.001 --> 00:20:39.700
you see Carol even though she went to jail for six years,

336
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.960
she stayed with her husband. Oh, no way. Really? Yeah.

337
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:47.890
She stayed with the man who had a baby with the other lady that she tried to

338
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:51.850
poison that lady about. She stayed with that guy. See, that's the thing.

339
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.310
Law is interesting, but love. That's complicated. Love is greed within treaties.

340
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.360
Thank you, Kelsey. Thank you Kelsey pageant, carver crawler, boom. Rod. Yeah,

341
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.080
that's all of us. I think you've mentioned all of us. Yeah, let's go.

342
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.280
So we'll use to say goodbye to all of you. Bye. Happy Christmas.
