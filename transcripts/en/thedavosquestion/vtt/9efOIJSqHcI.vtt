00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.380
&gt;&gt; Science and research are the corner stones
to bringing every country into the modern

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.380
world

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.010
&gt;&gt; I believe that there is a new opportunity
to provide education for all

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.990
&gt;&gt;Imagine a world where all the people work
together in harmony to complete an objective

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.670
geared to improving the quality of life for
millions of people.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.320
&gt;&gt;Clergy is one thing, one concept, that could
end all wars.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.890
[pause][music]

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.210
&gt;&gt;A world wide campaign against intolerance.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:45.620
&gt;&gt;People are so prejudice against race, religion,
sexuality, [pause] it's ridiculous.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.460
&gt;&gt;We need to produce power on a local level.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.579
&gt;&gt;You have to look beyond the earth. You have
to look to space and get serious about it.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.630
If you want to have a trillion human beings,
they aren't going to fit on the earth.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.630
&gt;&gt;Tolerance.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.819
&gt;&gt;When a man doesn't have a gun in his hand,
or a woman for the matter, he or she tries

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:32.210
harder to use his or her mind. A sense of
compassion and have intelligence to work out

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.829
a solution.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.639
