00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:01.900
G'day.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.130
I'm Duncan from the
Google Play Games team.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.740
Play Games is Google's game
network for Android, iOS

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.100
and the web, with user
experiences and services

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.870
designed to enhance game play.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.970
I'm here to tell you
about what's new,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.790
and why it's great for you.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.530
Three big things are
coming out-- game profiles,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.614
quests, and saved games.

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:21.030
These features
could significantly

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.590
boost engagement and
retention for your game.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.040
So listen closely to learn
how to level up your game.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.620
Speaking of leveling
up, that reminds

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.330
me-- one of our
huge updates to Play

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.710
Games is our game profile which
now enables players to level up

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.374
across the entire
Play Games ecosystem.

00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:37.790
They can check out
what activities

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.000
they've done to get there,
and compare themselves

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.840
against others.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.185
This may drive significant
levels of engagement

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:45.730
for any game that players love.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.350
So, leveling happens
based on points

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.900
earned from gaining achievements
in Play Games like yours.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.950
Each game you publish
has 1,000 points

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.680
to allocate to achievements.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.440
Why?

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.610
Because players
love to level up.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.150
Compelling achievements
give players

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.990
a reason to engage
with your title

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.690
for longer periods of time.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.410
You see, we've seen significant
user retention improvement

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.580
in games where high quality
achievements are available.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.131
And the leveling system
has the same potential.

00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:14.630
While players are checking out
their level in the Play Games

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.460
app, they can now also
compare themselves to others.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.360
Just tap on a
face, and check out

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.700
the comparison in
the Play Games app.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.072
Are you beating your friends?

00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:23.780
Have you checked?

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.988
You should probably go check.

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:26.837
They may have just beaten you.

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:29.170
On top of their level, players
are now assigned a title,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.586
based on the game
category they've

00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:33.170
earned the most XP or
experience points in.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.100
This means with just
a glance, players

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.760
can tell that a Level 20 Speed
Racer is a highly engaged

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.330
racing game expert, compared
to another player who

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.550
may be a Level One Rookie.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.400
With good achievement
point allocations,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.310
you'll set your
players on the path

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.522
to lots of fun and retention.

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:51.980
And while on the
path of retention,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.470
players can engage with another
one of our new features--

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.790
quests.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.340
With quests, you can create
time bound tasks and rewards

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.730
on top of events,
giving players a reason

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.080
to come back for
a new challenge.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.350
Quests drive both
deeper re-engagement

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.229
and increased
retention for players.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.850
For example, over
the last few weeks,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.570
I've been playing the extremely,
ironically named game,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.870
Questing Rocks.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.600
I'd been on a quest to
earn the axe of destiny.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.590
I fought dragons,
elves, and a rainbow

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.560
a few times, which was weird.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.420
But it was totally worth it.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.250
Now that I have
the axe of destiny,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.420
I can compete in the tournament
coming up next month.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.120
Now, normally this
kind of feature

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.580
would require a
significant live ops team

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.440
to manage regular
updates, without having

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.100
to push a new build.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.660
That is, until now.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.120
So how do quests work?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.590
Let's take a seafaring
game as an example.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.530
There are three things that
I care about in my game--

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.430
treasure found, crew
rescued, and miles sailed.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.620
So I jump into the
developer console and define

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.280
these three events.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.090
Next, I integrate events
that report these signals

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.390
back to Play Games.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.190
And I also integrate the
generic quest interfaces,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.640
so players can see my quests
as soon as I publish one.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.250
Next, I monitor the events.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.820
Oh, look-- people love finding
treasure, who would've thought?

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.740
So now, I go and create a quest.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.410
But uh, hm-- Talk Like a
Pirate Day is coming up.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.150
So I guess I'll create a
quest based around that.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.060
It will start on
September 19, which

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.240
is International Speak
Like a Pirate Day,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.010
and will require players to
find 50 treasures to earn

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.680
the reward of Blackbeard's
secret treasure map.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.550
I also add some images,
including a secret treasure map

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.010
to draw a player's attention.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.640
And then I hit publish.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.710
So players are out
there, finding treasures,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.980
and accepting my quests
and participating.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.270
When a player does
find 50 treasures,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.930
I add the secret treasure
map to their inventory.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.340
And what do they think about it?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.840
My community is abuzz with tales
of Blackbeard's treasure maps

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.740
and the secrets it reveals.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.350
So many players
enjoyed the quest,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.600
that it's time for me to go
back and look at my events

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.620
to determine what quest
I should create next.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.680
By designing a game to send
a broad spectrum of events,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.340
and defining quest
rewards in advance,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.760
you can run quests
whenever you'd

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.440
like without updating your
game, to build a better

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.770
relationship with
your user community.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.245
Players will also get to see
quests in the Play Games app

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:17.350
for all games they've
recently played.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.649
This is another great
way to reengage players,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.760
or to drive deeper engagement.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.530
Ensure that you make your
quests easy to understand,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.870
fun and rewarding.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.310
Speaking of fun
and rewarding, I'd

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.870
like to introduce our
new saved games feature.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.500
Saved games are the new
visual, cross platform,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.340
game save for Play Games on
Android, iOS, and the web.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.040
Saved games will mean
your players never

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.360
have to play a level
one again and allow

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.970
you to reengage your
players by reminding them

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.150
of the awesome things that
they are up to in your game.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.330
What is unique about
saved games is the ability

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.090
to store metadata that can
improve discoverability

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.000
through the Play Games
apps and increase usability

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.495
for your players.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:05:00.390
This metadata includes a
custom image, a description,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.910
and a timestamp
that are presented

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.360
to players within
your own game's UI,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.269
and within the Play Games app.

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:07.810
The latest saved
game for a Play will

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.370
appear on your game's detail
page in the Play Games app.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.510
It will also appear prominently
in the home screen of the app,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.160
reminding players why they
should come back to your game.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.950
So let's take a closer look.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.197
The custom image is set by you,
and should capture a screenshot

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.905
of the player's progress
in the game that

00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:26.430
will both remind the player of
where they're at in the game,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.910
but also entice
them to play more.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.480
Going above and
beyond may include

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.120
overlaying other art
elements, such as your logo,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.310
or their latest achievement,
or some particle

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.300
effects onto the game
screenshot to make

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.240
it even more compelling.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.850
The description field should
be short, but informative,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.140
to remind players where
they were in your game,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.020
and why they should return.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.720
Without it, your image
may not resonate as well.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.820
For example, fighting
the goblin king

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.045
in the dark woods, grand master
trainer, or the deep caves,

00:05:57.045 --> 00:06:00.240
are all a lot better
than level 12.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.110
So to learn how to
make awesome quests,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.750
engaging saved games,
setting achievement points

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.430
at the access code samples,
just visit our docs,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.642
by clicking one of the
links on the screen.

00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:11.100
Thanks for taking
the time to learn

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.430
about these awesome new
features for Play Games.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.290
I hope you have as much fun
making great engaging quests

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.900
and compelling saved games as
we had making these features.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.310
Cheers.
