00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.806
(cheers and applause)

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.914 line:0%
 
Ow! Ow! Spank me once,
shame at you.

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.883 line:0%
 
Spank me twice,
now we're talking.

Clinton and Trump
are at it again.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.054
The apple doesn't fall far
from the PC.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:24.858
And damn it, Janet,
Animal Planet.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:28.328
Holy moly, it's <i>@midnight!</i>

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.431
(applause and cheering)

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:34.801
I'm struggling actor
Kato Kaelin.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.870
And now, here's your host,

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:39.406
a man whose tips are so frosted,

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.942
you'd think they were flakes!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.746
Chris Hardwick!
Chris Hardwick!

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.081
(applause and cheering)

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:54.254
What's happening?

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.256
What's up? Yeah.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.125
(applause and cheering)

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.093
-All right!
-(Kaelin whoops)

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:02.229
HARDWICK:
Welcome.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.399
(cheers and applause)

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.302
All right.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.070
Thank you, Kato Kaelin.
All right.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.471
Welcome to <i>@midnight,</i> the show

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:14.808
(dramatically): that will
go down on you in a theater.

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.810
-(applause and cheering)
-Now,

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:19.346
let's see what's going on
in the chat room.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.748
-Chat room.
-(high-pitched modem beeps)

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:24.051
-(laughter)
-(static)

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.019
(beep, static)

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:32.693
(laughter)

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:33.994
-All right.
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.362
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:39.633
Now you get all of that.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.503
Well, Clinton and Trump
are at it again. Yeah.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.505
Donald "Second Marriage" Trump
is saying

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.974
the affair that President Bill
"Ruin Marriage" Clinton had

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.742
with Monica Lewinsky would pale
in comparison

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.145
to the multiple affairs he would
have if he were president.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.047
There he is.
The tangerine dreamboat

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:57.184
told CNBC
that he'd be even sleazier.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:00.053
Take a look!

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.928
-(laughter) -Yes!
-Did he just...?

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.865
-Yeah.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.267
(Kaelin whoops)

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.471
Hillary Clinton herself,
a woman, had this response.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.473
My mama always told me

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:23.110
the White House is like a box
of chocolates.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.345
It's pretty on the outside,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.349
but inside,
there's lots of nuts.

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:30.617
(laughter)

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.386
<i>-Hee Haw.</i> -Yeah.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:33.420
It's <i>Hee Haw.</i>

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.222
They got very excited
about that.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.723
KAELIN:
I... I...

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.993
She could be president some day,

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:42.963
maybe after,
like, a black guy. Uh...

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.432
-(laughter and groaning)
-KAELIN: No way. No way.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.434
Personal animus aside,

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.203
politicians and corporate
billionaires go together

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.537
like cigars and Oval Offices.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.573
I'm sure the Trumps and Clintons
run into each other

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:53.807
socially all the time.

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.342
So, comedians, what's a toast

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.711
Hillary Clinton might make
to Donald Trump?

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.279
Emo Philips.

00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:03.483
Roses are red.
Violets are blue.

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:06.386
You are so, so, so lucky

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.555
nothing rhymes with orange.

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:09.990
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yes.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.525
Very good.
Points to Emo Philips.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.427
(applause and cheering)

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.030
Wish we had a system to keep
track of that, but we don't.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:18.765
Uh, Margaret Cho.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.435
To Donald Trump,

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:24.838
the nicest, least racist man
I've ever met.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.840
HARDWICK:
Yes. Excellent. Points.

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.175
(applause and cheering)

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.043
Jaleel White.

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:33.747
Donald Trump,
here is to your daughter.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.416
Now she's pretty hot,
but just a reminder,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.985
just because she's 18,

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:39.486
it's still illegal
to (bleep) your daughter.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.821
HARDWICK:
All right.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:43.290
-Oh.
-(cheers and applause)

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.560
-You get points for that.
-Salud!

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:46.660
Points for that.
