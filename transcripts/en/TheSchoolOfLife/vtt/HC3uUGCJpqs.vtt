00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.200
One of the great problems of human beings
is that we’re far too good at keeping going.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.809
We’re experts at surrendering to the demands
of the external world, living up to what is

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.400
expected of us and getting on with the priorities
as others around us define them. We keep showing

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.980
up and being an excellent boy or girl – and
we can pull this magical feat off for up to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.630
decades at a time, without so much as an outward
twitch or crack. Until, suddenly, one day,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.520
much to everyone’s surprise, including our
own, we break. The rupture can take many forms.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.420
We can no longer get out bed. We fall into
a catatonic depression. We develop all-consuming

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.280
social anxiety. We refuse to eat. We babble
incoherently. We lose command over part of

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.000
our body. We are compelled to do something
extremely scandalous and entirely contrary

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.550
to our normal selves. We become wholly paranoid
in a given area. We refuse to play by the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.570
usual rules in our relationship, we have an
affair, ramp up the fighting – or otherwise

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.260
poke a very large stick in the wheels of day-to-day
life. Breakdowns are hugely inconvenient for

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.250
everyone and so, unsurprisingly, there is
an immediate rush to medicalise the problem

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.410
and attempt to excise it from the scene, so
that business as usual can restart. But this

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.280
is to misunderstand what is going on when
we break down. A breakdown is not merely a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.310
random piece of madness or malfunction, it
is a very real – albeit very inarticulate

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.390
– bid for health. It is an attempt by one
part of our minds to force the other into

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.409
a process of growth, self-understanding and
self-development which it has hitherto refused

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.030
to undertake. If we can put it paradoxically,
it is an attempt to jumpstart a process of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.340
getting well, properly well, through a stage
of falling very ill. The danger, therefore,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.821
if we merely medicalise a breakdown and attempt
to shift it away at once is that we will miss

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:17.250
the lesson embedded within our sickness. A
breakdown isn’t just a pain, though it is

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.890
that too of course; it is an extraordinary
opportunity to learn. The reason we break

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.180
down is that we have not, over years, flexed
very much. There were things we needed to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.950
hear inside our minds that we deftly put to
one side, there were messages we needed to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.660
heed, bits of emotional learning and communicating
we didn’t do – and now, after being patient

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.160
for so long, far too long, the emotional self
is attempting to make itself heard in the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.270
only way it now knows how. It has become entirely
desperate – and we should understand and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.030
even sympathise with its mute rage. What the
breakdown is telling us above anything else

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.970
is that it must no longer be business as usual
– that things have to change or (and this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.270
can be properly frightening to witness) that
death might be preferable. Why can’t we

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.670
simply listen to the emotional need calmly
and in good time – and avoid the melodrama

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.010
of a breakdown? Because the conscious mind
is inherently lazy and squeamish and so reluctant

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.590
to engage with what the breakdown eventually
has to tell it with brutality. For years,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.470
it refuses to listen to a particular sadness;
or there is a dysfunction in a relationship

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.920
it is in flight from or there are desires
it sweeps very far under the proverbial carpet.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.020
We can compare the process to a revolution.
For years, the people press the government

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.110
to listen to their demands and adjust. For
years, the government makes token gestures

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.040
but shuts its ears – until one day, it is
simply too much for the people, who storm

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.910
the palace gates, destroy the fine furnishings
and shoot randomly at the innocent and the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.540
guilty. Mostly, in revolutions, there is no
good outcome. The legitimate grievances and

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.239
needs of the people are not addressed or even
discovered. There is an ugly civil war – sometimes,

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.479
literally, suicide. The same is true of breakdowns.
Yet a good mental physician tries hard to

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:24.110
listen to rather than censor the illness.
They detect within its oddities a plea for

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.259
more time for ourselves, for a closer relationship,
for a more honest, fulfilled way of being,

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.509
for acceptance for who we really are sexually….
That is why we started to drink, or to become

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:41.789
reclusive or to grow entirely paranoid or
manically seductive. A crisis represents an

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.639
appetite for growth that hasn’t found another
way of expressing itself. Many people, after

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.270
a horrific few months or years of breakdown,
will say: ‘I don’t know how I’d ever

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.270
have gotten well if I hadn’t fallen ill’.
In the midst of a breakdown, we often wonder

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.740
whether we have gone mad. We have not. We’re
behaving oddly no doubt, but beneath the surface

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.460
agitation, we are on a hidden yet logical
search for health. We haven’t become ill;

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.439
we were ill already. Our crisis, if we can
get through it, is an attempt to dislodge

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:26.490
us from a toxic status quo and an insistent
call to rebuild our lives on a more authentic

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:36.639
and sincere basis. Thank you for commenting,
