an element that he talked about element
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.910
an element that he talked about element
115 I think it was called like a

element like a man created element you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
element like a man created element you
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700
element like a man created element you
know what this carbon right yeah well

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
know what this carbon right yeah well
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.830
know what this carbon right yeah well
there's an element that they created

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
there's an element that they created
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.080
there's an element that they created
that he talked about way before it was

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
that he talked about way before it was
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869
that he talked about way before it was
ever publicized and he talked about this

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
ever publicized and he talked about this
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.250
ever publicized and he talked about this
thing and then it turned out to be true

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
thing and then it turned out to be true
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.569
thing and then it turned out to be true
he talked about these there's these hand

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
he talked about these there's these hand
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.789
he talked about these there's these hand
monitors so you would put your hand on

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
monitors so you would put your hand on
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.370
monitors so you would put your hand on
this thing and these line these metal

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
this thing and these line these metal
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.969
this thing and these line these metal
lines would detect the distances in the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
lines would detect the distances in the
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.070
lines would detect the distances in the
bones of your fingers the exact

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
bones of your fingers the exact
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.240
bones of your fingers the exact
distances and every one is different

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
distances and every one is different
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280
distances and every one is different
it's like a signature thing yeah and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
it's like a signature thing yeah and
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.899
it's like a signature thing yeah and
that they could find out if it was you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
that they could find out if it was you
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.850
that they could find out if it was you
or not you it was trying to go through

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
or not you it was trying to go through
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.440
or not you it was trying to go through
so the way they would scan people that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
so the way they would scan people that
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749
so the way they would scan people that
bio scan would literally measure the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
bio scan would literally measure the
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.190
bio scan would literally measure the
bones and their fingers and people said

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
bones and their fingers and people said
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990
bones and their fingers and people said
that was horseshit why about this in the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
that was horseshit why about this in the
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.850
that was horseshit why about this in the
1980s people said it was horseshit but

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
1980s people said it was horseshit but
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.950
1980s people said it was horseshit but
then later on turned out no they did

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
then later on turned out no they did
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.410
then later on turned out no they did
have that in Los Alamos they did have

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
have that in Los Alamos they did have
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.080
have that in Los Alamos they did have
that in in area 51 and that this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
that in in area 51 and that this
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.760
that in in area 51 and that this
technology was very very advanced very

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
technology was very very advanced very
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.120
technology was very very advanced very
not just very advanced but very not it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
not just very advanced but very not it
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920
not just very advanced but very not it
was not well known at all like very few

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
was not well known at all like very few
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.389

this documentary was very difficult for
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.200
this documentary was very difficult for
them to get photos of this hand scanner

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
them to get photos of this hand scanner
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999
them to get photos of this hand scanner
but this hand scanner did exist and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
but this hand scanner did exist and
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.999
but this hand scanner did exist and
existed exactly as this guy described it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
existed exactly as this guy described it
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.590
existed exactly as this guy described it

you think no no I don't think it is but
 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.589
you think no no I don't think it is but
it is entirely possible um

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599
it is entirely possible um

I use that phrase too often it's
entirely possible you got to get a

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169
entirely possible you got to get a
 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.769

that could you know have beings like us

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699
that could you know have beings like us

basing it off of our own experience and

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.150
basing it off of our own experience and
 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.820
basing it off of our own experience and
perception of what we have been exposed

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830
perception of what we have been exposed

interesting scenario is that there are
 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:41.300
interesting scenario is that there are
time travelers

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310
time travelers
 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.870
time travelers
oh really and that's exciting what they

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880
oh really and that's exciting what they
 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.110
oh really and that's exciting what they
are is some being from the far distant

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120
are is some being from the far distant
 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.180
are is some being from the far distant
future that understands that it could

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.190
future that understands that it could
 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.360

come back and observe us and see like

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.370
come back and observe us and see like
 

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.040

where things went wrong where things
 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.080
where things went wrong where things
went right but do so in a way that's as

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.090
went right but do so in a way that's as
 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.700
went right but do so in a way that's as
minimally intrusive as possible and

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.710
minimally intrusive as possible and
 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.449
minimally intrusive as possible and
occasionally interfere that's things
