there's something about the cosmic

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890
there's something about the cosmic
 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.110
there's something about the cosmic
perspective which for some people is

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
perspective which for some people is
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.750
perspective which for some people is
enlightening and for other people it's

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
enlightening and for other people it's
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.499
enlightening and for other people it's
terrifying for those who are terrified

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
terrifying for those who are terrified
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.660
terrifying for those who are terrified
by it they're here on earth and they

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
by it they're here on earth and they
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.510
by it they're here on earth and they
have a certain self-identity and then

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
have a certain self-identity and then
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.840
have a certain self-identity and then
they learn that earth is tiny and we're

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
they learn that earth is tiny and we're
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.029
they learn that earth is tiny and we're
in this void of interplanetary space and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
in this void of interplanetary space and
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.519
in this void of interplanetary space and
then there's a star we call the Sun and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
then there's a star we call the Sun and
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769
then there's a star we call the Sun and
it's kind of average and there's a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
it's kind of average and there's a
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.519
it's kind of average and there's a
hundred billion other stars and a galaxy

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
hundred billion other stars and a galaxy
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.979
hundred billion other stars and a galaxy
and our galaxy the Milky Way is one of

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
and our galaxy the Milky Way is one of
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.780
and our galaxy the Milky Way is one of
fifty or a hundred billion other

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
fifty or a hundred billion other
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.389
fifty or a hundred billion other
galaxies in the universe and and they

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
galaxies in the universe and and they
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.930
galaxies in the universe and and they
with every step every window that modern

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
with every step every window that modern
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.709
with every step every window that modern
astrophysics has opened to our mind the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
astrophysics has opened to our mind the
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660
astrophysics has opened to our mind the
person who wants to feel like they are

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
person who wants to feel like they are
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.150
person who wants to feel like they are
the center of everything ends up

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
the center of everything ends up
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.660
the center of everything ends up
shrinking and for some people they might

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
shrinking and for some people they might
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090
shrinking and for some people they might
even find it depressing I assert that if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
even find it depressing I assert that if
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529
even find it depressing I assert that if
you were depressed after learning and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
you were depressed after learning and
 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959
you were depressed after learning and
being exposed to the cosmic perspective

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969
being exposed to the cosmic perspective
 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.389
being exposed to the cosmic perspective
you started your day with an

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
you started your day with an
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.990
you started your day with an
unjustifiably large ego you thought more

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
unjustifiably large ego you thought more
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.020
unjustifiably large ego you thought more
highly of yourself then in fact the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
highly of yourself then in fact the
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.260
highly of yourself then in fact the
circumstances deserved so here's what

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
circumstances deserved so here's what
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.710
circumstances deserved so here's what
you do

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
you do
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.280
you do
you say I have no ego at all let's start

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
you say I have no ego at all let's start
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.420
you say I have no ego at all let's start
that way I have no ego no no no no cause

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
that way I have no ego no no no no cause
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.170
that way I have no ego no no no no cause
to puff myself up now let's learn about

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
to puff myself up now let's learn about
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.070
to puff myself up now let's learn about
the cosmic perspective yeah we're on a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
the cosmic perspective yeah we're on a
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.270
the cosmic perspective yeah we're on a
planet that's orbiting a star and a star

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
planet that's orbiting a star and a star
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429
planet that's orbiting a star and a star
is an energy source and it's giving us

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
is an energy source and it's giving us
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.140
is an energy source and it's giving us
energy and we're feeling this energy and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
energy and we're feeling this energy and
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.960
energy and we're feeling this energy and
life is enabled by this energy in this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
life is enabled by this energy in this
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.090
life is enabled by this energy in this
star and by the way there's a hundred

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
star and by the way there's a hundred
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.770
star and by the way there's a hundred
billion other stars that have other

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
billion other stars that have other
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.630
billion other stars that have other
planets there might be other life out

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
planets there might be other life out
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.850
planets there might be other life out
there could be like us it's probably not

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
there could be like us it's probably not
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440
there could be like us it's probably not
like us or whatever it is it'd be

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
like us or whatever it is it'd be
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.960
like us or whatever it is it'd be
fascinating to find out who it is can we

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
fascinating to find out who it is can we
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.639
fascinating to find out who it is can we
talk to them can we not are they more

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
talk to them can we not are they more
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.679
talk to them can we not are they more
advanced are they less advanced by the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
advanced are they less advanced by the
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.319
advanced are they less advanced by the
way the atoms of our body are traceable

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
way the atoms of our body are traceable
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.160
way the atoms of our body are traceable
to what stars do and all you can do is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
to what stars do and all you can do is
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.340
to what stars do and all you can do is
sit back and bask in your relevance to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
sit back and bask in your relevance to
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.819
sit back and bask in your relevance to
the cosmos so those who see the cosmic

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829
the cosmos so those who see the cosmic
 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.340
the cosmos so those who see the cosmic
perspective as a depressing

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350
perspective as a depressing
 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.120
perspective as a depressing
outlook they really need to reassess how

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130
outlook they really need to reassess how
 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.940
outlook they really need to reassess how
they think about the world because when

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
they think about the world because when
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.250
they think about the world because when
I look up in the universe I know I'm

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260
I look up in the universe I know I'm
 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.130
I look up in the universe I know I'm
small but I'm also big I'm big because

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
small but I'm also big I'm big because
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.020
small but I'm also big I'm big because
I'm connected to the universe and the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030
I'm connected to the universe and the
 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.390
I'm connected to the universe and the
universe is connected to me
