00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.069
Hi You Tube, I'm Julia Gillard, I'm the Deputy
Prime Minister of Australia. I'm here at the

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.260
world economic forum and the big question
has been, can we deal with the global financial

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.619
crisis and the climate change challenge at
the same time? I believe, and the Australian

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.349
government believes, we gotta deal with both,
the challenge of climate change, quite right.
