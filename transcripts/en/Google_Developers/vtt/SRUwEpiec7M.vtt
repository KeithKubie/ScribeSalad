00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.950
Here's something that should
keep developers up at night.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.720
Governments trying
to weaken encryption.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.140
This audience
knows how important

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.130
encryption is to keeping
information safe and secure.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.770
Encryption stops snoopers from
viewing the contents of emails

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.570
and searches and
prevents hackers

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.140
from getting access to
your sensitive information.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.550
But there's been a growing
concern from some governments

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.440
that encryption is
getting too strong,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.940
hindering legitimate
criminal investigations.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.680
In fact, just this
summer, a hearing

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.470
was held in Congress
called, "Going

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.550
Dark-- Encryption, Technology,
and the Balance Between Public

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.330
Safety and Privacy."

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.440
And over the last year,
government officials

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.720
have thrown around
terms like golden keys,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.190
meaning that companies should
create a set of master keys

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.380
that allow government
agencies a backdoor

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.840
to decrypt any communication
when they need to decrypt it.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.220
And variants of this sort
of approach are spreading.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.550
For instance, France
recently passed a law

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.040
that requires that secret
code designed by the National

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.070
Intelligence Agency be injected
into service providers'

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.500
infrastructure.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.380
Now if this debate sounds
familiar, that's because it is.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.130
Back in the 1990s,
the White House

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.959
pushed the clipper chip,
a system of key escrow

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.480
in which a copy of each
chip's unique encryption key

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.120
would be stored
by the government.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.520
Encryption was even classified
as munitions in the United

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000
States with strict limits
on the type of encryption

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.210
that could be exported and
the maximum key length.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.180
So what changed?

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.634
Well for one,
there were concerns

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:21.550
about appropriate oversight
and accountability

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.410
for government
access to user data

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.210
and the harms to
commerce and innovation

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.380
if people couldn't trust
that their information was

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.940
safe and secure.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.645
Moreover, as security expert
Bruce Schneier has put it,

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:33.770
"You can't build a backdoor
that only the good guys

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.810
can walk through."

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.770
Encryption protects
against cybercriminals,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.320
industrial competitors,
the Chinese secret police,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.490
and the FBI.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.900
We are either vulnerable to
eavesdropping by any of them,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.410
or we're secure from
eavesdropping from all of them.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.210
That's as true today
as it was in the '90s.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.620
In fact, Schneier and a
group of computer scientists

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.920
recently released a paper
explaining in detail

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.440
why backdoors are a bad idea.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.690
Of course, law enforcement
needs tools to ferret out

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.730
illegal activity, and
governments have a duty

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.960
to protect their citizens.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.344
Flush it out, but through the
front door not a backdoor,

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:03.760
by getting permission
from a judge

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.500
and using traditional,
time-tested legal processes

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.262
like getting a warrant.

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:09.720
That's this edition
of "What Should

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.370
Keep Developers Up At Night."

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.170
Sleep soundly.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.520
