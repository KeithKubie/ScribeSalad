00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.650
So I'm here with Jessica Uelmen
who's the program manager for

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.660
the mobile Nanodegrees here at Udacity.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.150
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.490
Happy to be here.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.182
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So
first thing I wanted to ask about,

00:00:09.182 --> 00:00:11.908
was this is an ed-tech class and
many of our students might be looking

00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:14.585
at developing educational technology for
mobile devices.

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:16.635
So what are some of the unique
opportunities that take place on

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.535
mobile that we don't necessarily
have on more traditional computers.

00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:20.685
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:24.495
I mean, I think number one, your
phone is always glued to you, right?

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.640
I mean, when is there an opportunity
when you don't have your phone on you?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.940
So that also opens the opportunity
to learn at any time.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.900
So for example, if you're on the train,
if you're in a ridiculously long queue,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.820
just anywhere that you have time,
you can start learning.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.360
So I think then thinking
of a learning experience

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.330
to help students learn when
they just have the time.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.728
At any time instead of at home
on the couch making time for it.

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.225
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, so it sounds like
mobile technology is great for

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:56.430
developing some education applications.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.360
I'm guessing it's not a matter of
if you build it, they will come and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.090
there are some things we
can do wrong with it.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.880
So what are some of
the unique challenges or

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.470
obstacles to doing good mobile
technology for education?

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think, when I think of it,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.860
I think there's two real
ones that stick in my mind.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.013
For one,
there's programming challenges, right.

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:17.720
I mean, how do you do complex
programming challenges on a phone?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.970
And on most mobile devices
like the iPhone in particular,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.560
you can't compile anything.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.680
It's against Apple's terms of service.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.600
So how do you teach
programming in that regard?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.535
And then also how do you make it not so
gamey, right?

00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:33.863
I mean, how do you make people feel
like you're not just progressing through

00:01:33.863 --> 00:01:36.390
a level and it's like Math Blaster or
something, right?

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.090
I mean, how do you make it
a substantial learning experience.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.380
I think one company that does
that very well is Duolingo.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.420
I think that then learning a language,
it's great, I can fit small chunks in.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.380
At any time, learn words, come back and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.000
revisit things and
it doesn't feel gamey.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.980
It feels like I'm actually learning and
making progress each time.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.010
&gt;&gt; I imagine language is a particular
one where being able to learn on the go

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.790
is very valuable.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.180
Because it's something you use
everyday throughout your life.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.130
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; As opposed to programming,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.350
you're not usually actually
doing programming on a train,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.730
you're programming at home But

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.430
there are other skills we learn that
we would actually use in this context.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.100
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.000
&gt;&gt; So are there any new trends or

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.010
new emerging parts of mobile technology
that are emerging that will be

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.940
useful in developing future
educational technology?

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.590
&gt;&gt; So actually, I think one of
the most exciting things is the watch.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.990
I mean, so I have an Android watch and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.440
it's really surprised me
at how useful it's been.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.720
If for nothing else, just reminders.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.820
Hey, you've got a meeting,
or hey, you need to do this.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.360
So if for anything else,
helping students set those learning

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.010
habits to really make time for
education.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.210
Could be a really,
really great application moving forward.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.105
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very true.

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:49.594
I hadn't really thought about that, but
that could be very useful for things,

00:02:49.594 --> 00:02:51.620
like a guided tour of a museum or
something like that.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.120
It seems almost a silly little
difference to have the device be on your

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.930
wrist or in your pocket.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.470
Either way, they're always on you.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.507
But just that hands-free and

00:02:58.507 --> 00:03:00.426
always visible nature of it
can really change things.

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:01.850
&gt;&gt; No, absolutely.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.320
May be there's even bite-size
learning segments that you can get,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.210
where all of a sudden,
oh, your wrist vibrates.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.950
Here's a quick question or

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.330
learning snippet that you can quickly
look at, answer and then move on.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.129
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.006
And by the same token, so when we
think about these mobile devices for

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:19.178
education, I think we often think about
the fact that they have a screen that

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:20.290
can show us information.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.480
They're web-enabled,
it's pretty much it.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.895
But they have a lot of other things
like cameras and GPS and microphones and

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:26.785
things like that.

00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:29.355
Can those also be used for
education some ways?

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:31.225
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely in certain ways.

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:34.155
So one of the examples that
I first think about is

00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:35.375
I'm really interested in hardware.

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:39.205
I come from an Electrical Engineering
background and learning experiences for

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:42.125
hardware becomes inherently
a lot more challenging.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:46.205
So devices like the camera for example,
if you're building a printed circuit

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:49.330
board or building a circuit and
maybe it's not working properly.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.550
And you don't know what's going wrong.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.590
It's not like you can send an email to
your professor and say, here's a digital

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.650
version of my printed circuit board or
my circuit, what's going wrong?

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.800
Maybe taking a picture or video and
then being able to easily send it.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.564
Provides a lot more opportunity for
faster feedback and

00:04:05.564 --> 00:04:07.695
then even assessment
at the end of the day.

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:09.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.150
So we might have students in this class
who are looking at developing their

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.830
project, their class project
using a mobile device.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.576
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Do you have any suggestions,

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:19.430
just as we sign off for
them if they're looking to do that?

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.220
&gt;&gt; I think in a lot of ways,
keep it simple.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.650
I think that comes up a lot.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.090
People get entranced by
the phone as a medium and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.370
tend to want to throw a lot of features
and a lot of different things into it.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.070
So really get to basics and
try not to let feature creep come in so

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.842
much, so that it becomes this giant
app that no one can navigate.

00:04:42.842 --> 00:04:45.668
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I think that's a big thing and

00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:48.490
then also just avoid gamification.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.406
If you can.
It's just such an easy thing to slip

00:04:51.406 --> 00:04:54.549
into and
such an easy thing to not do, right?

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:57.390
So to try to avoid
that whenever possible.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.640
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And now you see why I
wanted to talk to Jessica as well.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.090
Because as you probably know by now,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.890
I am not a particularly big
fan of gamification either.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.712
Thank you so much for talking to us.

00:05:05.712 --> 00:05:06.385
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my pleasure.

00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:06.885
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
