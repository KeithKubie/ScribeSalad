00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.120
MALE SPEAKER: You're here
because of asteroids and

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.585
Jason, who comes out of NASA's
headquarters in DC, at 300

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:10.025
East Street, I understand.

00:00:10.025 --> 00:00:10.300
JASON KESSLER: Southwest.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.430
MALE SPEAKER: Southwest.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.460
Anyway, so Jason's come here to
speak with us about finding

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.150
and planning for asteroids that
may squash us like bugs

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.650
or like other species who have
been squashed in the past.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.040
JASON KESSLER: And thanks
for the invite.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.140
What a great opportunity.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.640
We announced the Asteroid Grand
Challenge back in June,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.760
and it's a new way of thinking
and doing business at NASA.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.880
So it's a great privilege.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.150
This will be the first public
audience since the

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.020
announcement that I've gotten
the chance to speak to.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.030
So, thank you.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.620
Space for a long time has
captivated our imagination.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.970
And through space exploration,
we have the ability to

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:12.040
radically change our future
and, at the same time, do

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.310
things for the benefit
of all of humankind.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.590
About a little over 65 million
years ago, there was a very

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.730
bad day here on planet Earth.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.820
And these poor folks didn't
really have any ability to do

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.650
anything about it.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.220
And really what I'm here to
talk about is a natural

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.230
disaster that we actually
have the ability to

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.070
do something about.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670
We can change our fate.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.340
And it really only requires
the will to do so.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.240
This is not new.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.290
It happened over 65
million years ago.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.020
But it happens more often than
I think people ever realized.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.960
Earlier this year, in February,
the 15th of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.580
February, we were anxiously
watching DA14 pass by--

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.120
very close asteroid
pass of the Earth.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.410
And then lo and behold,
out of the sun,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.730
comes a 17 meter asteroid.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.610
It hits in Chelyabinsk,
Russia.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.050
You can see here a crater from
a 50 meter asteroid, the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.200
remains of which are in
Northern Arizona--

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.055
the equivalent of 10
megatons of TNT.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.840
So this stuff happens.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.310
One need only look at the
surface of the moon.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.870
We're in a very, very active
neighborhood, statistically.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.230
Folks might say the likelihood
is small.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.150
But the reality is that we don't
know where that many of

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.530
these smaller asteroids
are located.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.980
So NASA announced with the
FY14 budget an Asteroid

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.720
Initiative.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.470
So to give you a sense of how
this fits into the overall

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.450
NASA program, NASA
has an overall

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.520
strategy to study asteroids.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.770
They're very interesting
for lots of reasons--

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.450
origins of life, origins of the
solar system, planetary

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.440
defense, resources for here
on Earth or exploration.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.610
And so NASA's had a whole
lot going on in

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.710
the asteroid realm.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.130
But in '14, we announced two
aspects of an Asteroid

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.650
Initiative.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.620
The first, which you've probably
heard quite a bit

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.800
about, is the idea that we would
find a 7 to 10-meter

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.920
non-threatening asteroid, send
a spacecraft through a solar

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.260
electric propulsion system out
to this asteroid, capture that

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.100
asteroid, redirect it around
the moon in a trans-lunar

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.100
orbit, and then send humans on
the SLS Orion program that we

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.580
are currently building at NASA
to go explore it and bring

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.400
samples back.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.800
It got a lot of press
early in the year--

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.210
the excitement of sending humans
to go and explore a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.960
body that hasn't been
touched before.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.030
The other aspect, though, and
the one I'm going to focus on

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.430
today is the Asteroid
Grand Challenge.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.890
And that is focusing on the
potentially hazardous threats

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.060
that every single human being
and every life form on this

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.410
planet ought to have
some interest in.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.320
So digging down a little bit
more deeply into the Asteroid

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.530
Initiative, we see that there
are a couple of areas of

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.150
overlap between the Grand
Challenge and the mission.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.030
In terms of detection--

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.170
absolutely have to
find a target for

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.470
humans to go and explore.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.020
While at the same time, we
have to find what is

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.650
threatening out there
and might impact us.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.670
So there's overlap between the
two aspects in detection.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.740
And then the second, maybe not
as obvious to folks, is that

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.610
when you go out and explore,
you're going to have to have

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.990
proximity operations.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.410
You're going to have to learn
how to operate around this

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.530
foreign object.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.830
The same type of knowledge might
be useful in terms of a

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.070
mitigation solution.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.270
Are you dealing with an asteroid
that a gravity

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.050
tractor might work, where you
have a mass that helps pull,

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.860
slowly nudge, this threatening
asteroid off of its course and

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.070
thereby saving the planet
from getting impacted?

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.490
So there's some obvious
areas of overlap.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.910
Additionally, the Grand
Challenges is focusing on

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.630
engaging a community that we
don't normally talk with.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.930
NASA has a tradition of getting
a mission, having

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.470
requirements for that mission,
executing to those

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.690
requirements through either
grants and contracts that are

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.790
let with a community
that we typically

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.280
work pretty well with.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.010
The twist here, and one that I
can say, thanks to Ames, the

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.770
neighbor just down the road from
here and the NASA Center

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.190
that really does push the
envelope in terms of

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.770
partnership and participatory
engagement, is that we have an

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.120
opportunity to speak with folks
that we don't normally

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.570
talk with about these kinds of
things and start to pull in

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.830
ideas that we wouldn't
have before.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.100
And I'll give some examples
of what that looks like.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.480
In a scale this bigger
that's new for NASA.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.200
So here we are with the actual
challenge statement.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.650
And you can see that
it is grand.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.400
It's bigger than NASA's ability
to handle on its own.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.620
Finding all asteroid threats
to human populations and

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.360
knowing what to do about
them, that's even

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.290
really beyond our mission.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.150
In terms of mitigation
and deflecting,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.310
that's not our bailiwick.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.940
But what the Grand Challenge
enables us to do is take an

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.400
area that we do a lot of work
in and start a conversation

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.030
broadly, a global conversation
at that, and invite others

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.850
into help with this effort,
because as I said, this is an

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:09.290
issue that every life form on
the planet should have some

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.000
interest in.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.230
So the way we're addressing this
Grand Challenges is in

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.670
five areas.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.390
Detection--

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.490
we have to find where
they are.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.280
Tracking--

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.280
we've got to know what their
orbits are so that, once you

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.340
find it, you need to
know, is it on a

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.010
path to hit the planet?

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.330
Characterization--

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.300
what's its spin rate?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.594
What's its size?

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.000
What's it shape?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.650
And then, as you start to move
into some of the other

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.230
interesting aspects of
asteroids, what's it made of?

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.630
What kind of materials
might be there?

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.830
Is there water, a fuel
source for deeper

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.720
exploration, minerals?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.160
And then finally--

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.520
mitigation.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.840
Once we find something that's on
its way, we need to figure

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.820
out, out of the multiple choices
that we have now, how

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.060
do we deflect it and mitigate
its impact?

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.900
And then woven throughout
all four aspects is a

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.040
communication piece, because
thanks to Hollywood, there are

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.110
some wild ideas on how one
might solve this problem.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.390
And part of this effort is to
communicate clearly what is

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.530
factual and what solutions
might work.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.800
So to dig in a little bit more
deeply, if you look at that

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.000
circle, there is a chunk
of the circle

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.970
that's not filled in.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.450
The rest of that circle, those
are slices of people that are

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.810
already doing work.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.130
NASA's doing a lot
of work to find

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.310
potentially hazardous asteroids.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.850
Starting in '98, we've had
a very serious program.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.840
The Near-Earth Object
Observation Program has found

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.940
over 95% of the 1-kilometer
or larger asteroids.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.470
Those are the planet killers.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.420
The challenge is that we're only
finding about a thousand

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.510
a year, and there are
potentially a million out

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.530
there, down to 30 meters
or larger.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.830
And as I said earlier,
Chelyabinsk that hit in

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.640
Russia, that was 17 meters--

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.180
about a thousand people
seriously hurt, windows blown

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.240
out, millions of dollars
worth of damage.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.380
So we're looking for roughly
twice that size, because that

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.190
could really devastate a city.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.130
So there's opportunity here to
build upon the work that we're

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.050
already doing.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.520
We recognize there's a need.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.800
So beyond just external
contributors to this effort,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.840
there are potential
contributors.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.920
And in fact, the third listed
there is Maker Community.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.830
It's a new one for NASA
to think about.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.200
I'm off to Maker Faire in New
York City this weekend.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.250
And I know that Ames has had
a big presence at the Maker

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.130
Faire here and have been
engaging with folks about a

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.680
conversation--

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.340
are there ways that we can
improve mirror grinding?

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.350
Are there ways that
we can improve

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.490
telescope mount builds?

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.915
Can we redesign, re-engineer?

00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:32.160
Can we lower the cost of
what it takes to build

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.410
ground-based detection?

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.950
I mentioned Hollywood
earlier as well.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.970
I'm very pleased to say that
there's some serious interest

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:50.970
in focusing on a very
factually-based asteroid film.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.700
And so in terms of the
communication piece, to be

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.280
able to explain to folks what's
really at stake here

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.050
and what really do we have the
ability to do at this point

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.950
and what is that gap that we
need to start filling--

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.410
an interesting opportunity to
partner there, to bring

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.860
science fiction and
science fact a

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.110
little bit closer together.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.680
An example of partnership
potential here--

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.100
light curve analysis is
really hard to do.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.860
You need to be patient, and
you need to have telescope

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.770
time with the equipment to be
able to track a quickly-moving

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.300
asteroid through the night sky
throughout the night, because,

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.240
basically, what you're
doing here is

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.640
you've got your telescope.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.530
And you've got a CCD
taking images.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.520
And over time, you're
determining the change in the

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.310
reflected light.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.370
The albedo changes over time.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.640
You can start to get a sense
of what the spin rate is.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.110
Eventually, you can figure
out what the shape of the

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.630
asteroid may be.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.580
Mathematically difficult--

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.650
it takes, again, a lot
of telescope time.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.930
And so as we focused our energy
into detection, because

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.720
that's the first problem we need
to solve, it's expensive

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.280
to spend time on those
telescopes tracking and

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.880
characterizing.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.920
So there are about 50 to 100
amateur astronomers that are

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.000
doing near-Earth asteroid
light curve analysis.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.900
So as I stepped into this
program, I saw this is an

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:43.960
immediate place that we can
change the conversation.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.670
You can get a published paper
out of the work that you do on

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.590
a light curve analysis.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.370
So by broadening this
conversation and saying to

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.430
folks, we've got a
serious problem.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.630
We'd like your help
addressing.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.560
we'll collaborate with you to
figure out how to make light

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.050
curve analysis either easier
or more accessible, and you

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.180
can contribute meaningfully to
this cause and potentially get

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.690
a published paper out of it.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.220
So as a first step to build off
of the momentum that we're

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.550
creating, engaging university
students is one of the first

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.860
things that we are
looking at doing.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.200
Shape model--

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.260
I mentioned characterization.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.500
Shape models are also tough.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.140
It's not an easy problem.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.820
And so, is there a way to throw
a challenge out to a

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.670
community and say, here's
our requirement.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.200
Here is the state of
the art right now.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.620
Can you help us?

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.870
A technique of using the prize
and challenge authority that

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:59.490
NASA has to engage folks with
the potential of getting some

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:04.120
prize money if not great
recognition.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.210
And then finally, as an obvious
next step, would be

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.810
space-based observation.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:17.235
I believe Ed Lu from the B612
Foundation was here previously

00:15:17.235 --> 00:15:19.805
and is coming back
later this month.

00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:20.810
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
November 4.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.810
JASON KESSLER: November 4--

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.890
come see Ed.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.260
B612 has got a plan to send an
infrared telescope up into a

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.080
Venus-trailing orbit and
radically improve the number

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.930
of asteroids that we can
discover each year.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:42.290
And so space-based observation
really would enable us to get

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.140
to a place where we can increase
our detection rate

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.190
and enable us to find those that
are getting smaller, down

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.530
to the 30-meter size, because
30 meters is tough.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:16:00.680
I said we've found 95% of the
1 kilometer or larger, and

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.110
we've had an amateur
help with that.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.140
The difficulty, though now, is
that as you get smaller,

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.110
they're fainter.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.220
They're moving fast.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.710
And to expect the amateur
community to help us with

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.990
detection is really not very
realistic at this point.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.520
And so that's why we focused on
light curve analysis as a

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.030
way to engage the amateur
community to help here.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.470
But it's really getting into
space that will enable us

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.290
24-hour viewing.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:39.140
It'll get us away from the sun
and keep that blind spot from

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.240
impacting our ability
to search.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.385
Does that mean that there might
be small sat solutions?

00:16:44.385 --> 00:16:46.900
We were talking a little bit
earlier at Ames with some of

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.300
the folks there about small sat
solutions for observation.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.900
And in fact, just had somebody
pop up with an idea of using

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.150
space station as a
platform as well.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.870
So space-based observation is
really the next phase for us

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.859
to get serious about our
detection effort.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.589
I mentioned Ed and the
B612 foundation.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:17.980
This is one example that we
anticipate using at NASA to

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.920
engage the community.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.990
Here's a public-private
partnership.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.970
We have an unfunded Space Act
Agreement that's a legal

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.480
agreement between NASA
and private entity.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.960
In this case, it's a nonprofit
whose mission is very well

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.795
aligned with NASA's.

00:17:34.795 --> 00:17:38.050
And the idea is that, through a
Space Act Agreement, through

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.550
this partnership mechanism, you
have a shared future that

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:48.420
you'd like to see become real,
and you align your expertise

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.150
and contribute accordingly.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.020
And so NASA provides some
science and engineering

00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:01.090
support as well as the use of
the Deep Space Network to

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:05.280
receive data from the
mission that they

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.930
have proposed to fly.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.900
So the Space Act agreement is
a great mechanism for us to

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:15.620
look to other organizations to
partner with and enable a

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:20.470
collaboration that's beneficial
for both.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.800
I mentioned briefly prizes.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.060
So NASA has prize authority, a
pretty special opportunity for

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.330
us to have no-year money.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.060
For those that aren't familiar
with the government budget

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:45.370
cycle, it usually has
two-year life.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.930
But prizes can take
quite a long time.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.370
And so we have the ability
to have some funds

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.560
that wouldn't expire.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.270
And so here you see an
image a Centennial

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.590
Challenge prize winner.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.960
This was the Green
Flight Challenge.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:07.660
And the challenge it was to fly
200 miles in less than two

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:13.860
hours and less than a gallon
of gas per person.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:21.250
And Pipistrel, pictured here,
won $1.3 million and flew over

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:27.190
400 miles in that in that
two-hour period.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:36.010
So here's an opportunity
leverage a need that we have

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:41.580
with funding that we have to
enable innovation in the

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.765
marketplace.

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:49.670
There was another entry that
broke the 200-mile barrier,

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.760
but they didn't break the 400
and a number of others that

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.480
didn't win.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.760
But here's an example of
individuals, whether they're

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.870
partnered teams or individuals
themselves, because of the

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.530
opportunity are willing to spend
their time and their own

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:13.070
resources to come up with
solutions to a technological

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:18.230
problem that we have and hadn't
really focused on and

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.250
have a payday where,
eventually, a

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.540
company can come out.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.110
In fact, there is a Centennial
Challenge winner for an

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.590
astronaut glove--

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.710
very difficult technology
challenge to enable an

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.760
effective glove when you're in
zero G and you've got a vacuum

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.180
that you're fighting against
and a pressurized suit.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:44.600
To be able to have the ability
to grasp and use tools--

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.665
really tough.

00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:48.420
So there was a Centennial
Challenge for that.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.620
And now there's a company.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.065
The winner of that Centennial
Challenge has a company that

00:20:52.065 --> 00:20:54.740
is building suits.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:59.100
So the idea here is, are there
technological challenges that

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.460
we can identify in this Grand
Challenge that we can spark

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:09.250
some innovation from folks that
may be not thinking about

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.400
this right now but would be
willing to spend their time

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.635
and energy for the
contribution?

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.740
Another mechanism for us in
the Grand Challenge is

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.400
crowdsourcing.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.550
And you guys are probably
quite familiar with it.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:32.410
The idea here is that you
leverage the crowd to help

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.280
with a problem.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.840
The Zooniverse platform through
Galaxy Zoo radically

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.490
cut the time it took to
characterize and define types

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.590
of galaxies out there.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:53.970
And so we have lots of data
through our asteroid search.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:59.960
Planetary Resources, a mining
company, wants to exploit the

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:05.390
resources of asteroids, had a
Kickstarter campaign, raised

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.210
almost $2 million.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:11.430
And because they raised so much,
they announced they were

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.600
going to be able to do
an Asteroid Zoo.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.800
And so, through a partnership
with the Catalina Sky Survey--

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:24.260
that's a survey out of Arizona
that has years worth of data--

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.850
the thinking is, by opening up
that data to the crowd, we can

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:33.010
have eyeballs on that that the
algorithms might have missed,

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:37.060
some potentially hazardous
asteroids there.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:43.390
Are there other ways that we can
use the benefit of a crowd

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.620
to help with this
data problem?

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.370
And finally, really, the fourth
area, it's related to

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.230
the light curve analysis
piece.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.330
But it's citizen science.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:04.570
And this image here
predates NASA.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:11.150
I think this image
is '55 or '56.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.560
And you're looking at
Biloxi, Mississippi,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.140
Operation Moon Watch.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.790
The idea was a brainchild of a
gentleman at the Smithsonian

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:25.910
Astrophysical Observatory and
had tremendous battles with

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.830
the science community back
then because his idea was

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.690
there are going to be all sorts
of human-made object

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.030
circling the earth, and we're
going to need to know where

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.460
they are, what they are.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.880
And we don't have any ability
to do that right now.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.620
So I want to go out and train
the citizenry to be able to do

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.430
to help with this effort.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.880
And so they did that
very thing.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.450
Here you see a training in
Biloxi where they're showing

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.870
folks how to look at
how to contribute.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:59.330
And if you do a search on Moon
Watch, you'll find images--

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:04.490
Boy Scouts in the Philippines ,
gentlemen in suit and tie in

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:09.150
South Africa looking
through telescopes.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.500
And what they'd do is they'd
find something in the sky, and

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.430
they'd let the people
in Boston know.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.800
And they'd get the cameras out
and be able to take images.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.300
And so before NASA was even
around, citizen science was

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:27.610
proving its value in
contributing to a cause.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.930
And the essence here of the
Grand Challenge is this is

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.790
bigger than NASA's ability
to do on its own.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.910
We don't want to do
it on our own.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:43.470
The excitement of engaging
communities that we don't

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:48.140
normally talk with to help solve
problems that we can't

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.280
do on our own, that's the
opportunity here.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.270
An example of how this type
of innovation can work--

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.300
we had a dark matter problem.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:06.440
And through a challenge that
was thrown out to a broad

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.750
community, turns out that a
glaciologist noticed what we

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:18.970
were looking for and said, aha,
the edge detection and

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.320
the change for glaciers is
very similar to this dark

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.700
matter problem.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.910
And so what happened is he
came with a solution--

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.900
would have never been involved
in a dark matter

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.310
conversation before.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:35.840
And that challenge sparked
innovation from a totally

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.300
different field.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.830
He didn't end up winning the
prize, because you ended up

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:44.120
having an astrophysicist that
saw the improvement and was

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.910
able to then tweak that
improvement for an even

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.720
greater improvement.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.110
But you had breakthrough because
of a broad engagement.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.310
And so that's really what we're
looking to do here, is

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:04.300
to start this global
conversation and engage in a

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:10.950
dialogue with citizenry of the
Earth and our national

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.050
partners around the globe.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:21.470
And really, what it does is it
allows us to prove that we are

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.680
smarter than the dinosaurs.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.700
This is, again, the one natural
disaster that we have

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.140
the ability to do
something about.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.790
We have the science.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.960
We have the technology.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.310
We could have great
breakthroughs to

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.620
improve all of that.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.900
But what a great legacy for us
to focus on in the next 10 or

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.310
15 years and potentially do it
sooner and be able to share

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.440
with our kids and our grandkids
that this is a

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.910
problem they don't have
to worry about.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.760
There are going to
be plenty others.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.060
But this is one that we took
ownership of and decided we

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.010
would solve together.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:08.170
And so with that, I will gladly
take any questions and

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.160
hopefully spark some solutions
in the room today.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.850
AUDIENCE: How do you know you
found 95% if you don't know

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.180
the last 5%?

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:23.370
JASON KESSLER: It's modeling
and statistics, so it's a

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.640
best-guess right now.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.190
But we don't know for sure.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:31.440
And so that's where I will say,
statistically, somebody

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.450
might say, it looks like the
planet killer happens every

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.080
100 million years.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.550
It happened within
66 million years.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:48.970
But that doesn't mean that we're
going to wait 30 more

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.770
million years until
it happens again.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.660
We can only look to the way the
climate is changing and

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.650
seeing that the 500-year flood
is no longer every 500 years.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:05.260
And so while we feel confident
we've got 95%, we don't know

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.100
that for sure.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.890
And we certainly need to
increase the number that we're

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.490
finding each year.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.250
So it's a best guess
at this point, that

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.570
we feel good about.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.360
AUDIENCE: What your estimate
of the fraction of the

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.238
30-meter asteroids that
have been found?

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.170
JASON KESSLER: In
the 1% range.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:33.600
So when you look at the models
that say there's down to 30

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.490
meters, they'll say the
population is so big.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.250
And what we've discovered
of that estimated

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.650
population is about 1%.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:52.500
So I won't quote the numbers on
that, but the frequency of

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.050
the smaller are going to
be much higher than

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.120
the 1 in 100 million.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:03.810
And the other interesting thing,
because we're growing

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:10.920
our population so rapidly, the
numbers are going to increase

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.040
because there are going to be
more populated areas for

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.020
people to be impacted
by these.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.700
So that's a piece, in terms of
the numbers, that folks I

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.770
don't think often consider.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.910
AUDIENCE: Ballpark, how many
asteroids are you actually

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.340
tracking right now?

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.160
How may does 95% account for?

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:37.850
JASON KESSLER: We have about
10,000 that we have track of.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:43.170
But one of the difficulties
with it is that

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.550
you can find it--

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.850
you might find one--

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.160
but you've got to get more glass
on it pretty quickly

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.960
because they're moving
by fast.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.500
And so if you don't track it
well enough to understand its

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.040
orbit, it'll be gone, and you
won't know when it's coming

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.900
back or where it's
coming from.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.240
And so there really needs to
be a concerted effort.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.410
And I think that's where we have
an exciting opportunity

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.620
to really build a
global network.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.450
So we've got a strong US
detection, ground-based

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.700
network currently.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.690
Europeans are doing
great work.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:24.650
There's a great opportunity in
Africa, a great opportunity to

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.680
improve Southern Hemisphere
coverage.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:35.050
And so having a network when
somebody's dark versus daytime

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.960
or somebody's cloud-covered and
can't see is really where

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.260
we need to be so that we can
find them and then get

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.360
tracking on them quickly,
before they're gone.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.670
AUDIENCE: With the one earlier
this year in Russia, did we

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:49.960
have any warning that
that was going to

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.160
happen, or it was a surprise?

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.230
JASON KESSLER: No.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:57.930
And the difficulty there, the
attraction of a space-based

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.620
telescope that's in a Venus
orbit, is that asteroid was

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.950
coming from the sun, the
direction of the sun.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:09.900
And so even if we had some
warning or ability, we would

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.320
have been blinded and not be
able to pick it up, because 17

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.970
meters is pretty small.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.720
Yeah, so no warning.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.680
AUDIENCE: You have the
crowd-sourced efforts like the

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.020
DNA folding and Galaxy
Zoo and all that.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.290
What future ones do you
envision coming?

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.010
And maybe it involved asteroids,
but what other

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.130
crowd-source efforts
do you picture?

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.215
JASON KESSLER: I'll tell
you a pretty fun--

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.820
I think it gets in semantics
whether it's crowdsourcing or

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:43.840
citizen science, and I won't go
into the details of that--

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.510
but we had a challenge.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.160
The longerons are the structures
on the space

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.030
station that hold the
solar arrays.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:58.040
Now, the station is circling the
Earth, and it's in night

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.960
and day every 90 minutes.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.920
And so there's a great
temperature variation.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.890
And so are we're starting to
notice some limitations in our

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:14.930
ability to maximize the sunlight
that we're getting on

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:21.560
the solar arrays because we
don't want these longerons to

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.980
get too brittle.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.570
And so there was a challenge
that was thrown out.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.020
And the interesting thing about
this challenge is the

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.680
first step in the challenge
was to build a model that

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:39.100
would enable a full-up 3D
model of the system.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.580
That was challenge
one, solve that.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.450
Second challenge was to then
figure out, how do you

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:50.910
maximize the sunlight hitting
the arrays without

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:52.980
threatening--

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.200
there are a couple of particular
joints that were

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.280
areas of concern.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.080
Crowd--

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.330
if you want to call it the
crowd, maybe expert crowd--

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.140
solved it in days.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:11.560
And the solution is not yet
being implemented, but we

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.820
expect as this life of
the station continues

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.130
that it will be.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:24.060
And so we're just starting to
play with this concept of the

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.570
crowd-enabling solution to
problems that we have.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:34.560
And so part of the pressure that
I feel as owner of this

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.840
Grand Challenge for NASA is to
show the agency that this is a

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:45.630
culture change shift, that there
are smart people out

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:50.400
there in other fields that can
contribute to the mission and

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.560
impact and benefit the mission
just by having a conversation

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.700
and, in this and other
instances, using a challenge

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.940
to incentivize people.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.160
But there are a lot of
mechanisms that I think I

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.429
really see this as contributing
not just at NASA

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:13.989
but, whether it's the aerospace
industry or industry

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.660
at large, there's an opportunity
here to see that

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.760
you can really help through
this method.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.850
AUDIENCE: Do we think that the
asteroid that caused the K-T

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:28.120
event and the asteroid that
hit in Russia, were these

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.110
asteroids in near Earth
orbit that we

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.290
just didn't know about?

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:35.980
Or were they asteroids in highly
elliptical orbits,

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:40.380
trans-Neptunian objects that
this was their first time

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.210
approaching the earth in 5,000,
10,000 years, and

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.060
there's no way we could know
about them in advance?

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:50.239
JASON KESSLER: Had we had the
systems in place, we would

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:57.000
have known that these are
crossing our path and that

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.410
there's about a million of them
like that out there down

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:01.720
to 30 meters.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.791
So it's a very active
neighborhood.

00:35:05.791 --> 00:35:07.650
But that's not to say--

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.960
somebody brought up the
issue of comets.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.870
Right now, the Asteroid
Grand Challenge

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.480
is focused on asteroids.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:20.250
But comets also pose
hazard as well.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:20.870
AUDIENCE: Russia, 1970.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.570
JASON KESSLER: So it might be
worth expanding the focus.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.590
And so that's where I would
say that some of the

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:34.180
discomfort is that we've got
some plan right now, but

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.430
having a conversation leads us
into saying, oh, yeah, what

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.120
about that?

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.170
We need to add that.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:45.440
And that's not habitual
for us at the agency.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.140
So this is fun to
be playing in.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.310
AUDIENCE: So that's a perfect
prelude into my question.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:54.640
I think that this is a great
example, and I think the comet

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.250
one would be another
great example.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.860
But there are very few people
qualified to take a lot of

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.620
these problems end to end.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.810
How much work is being done to
take the base problem, the

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.960
fundamental problem, and get
them in the hands of kids or

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.920
people that aren't as qualified,
getting them to

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.590
where the experts can focus
on the last mile?

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.910
JASON KESSLER: Sure.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.340
And this one in particular, as
NASA's first Grand Challenge--

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.610
so the White House sees Grand
Challenges and as a means of

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.550
innovation.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.550
This is a strategic method
of innovation.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.080
So DOE has a couple of
Grand Challenges.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.770
USAID has a couple of
Grand Challenges.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.010
The Brain Initiative that was
recently announced this year

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:36.740
is also a Grand.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.720
Challenge

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.920
The Asteroid Grand Challenge
is scientifically and

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.160
technically tough.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.890
There's no doubt.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.020
We issued a request for
information back on the 18th

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.620
in June when we announced
the Grand Challenge.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.880
And that request for information
was open for 30

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:00.160
days, and as things are, this
was released through Fed Biz

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.760
Ops and the traditional
NASA methods.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.950
We got over 402 responses, a lot
of which were from folks

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.120
we don't normally talk with.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:16.110
We had 96 of those responses
that we are gathering the

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.530
proposers, either virtually or
in person in Houston at the

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.070
end of the month-- and I'll
invite you to watch, because

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.750
we'll be broadcasting live--

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.860
to bring together those ideas.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:38.370
And in some of those ideas,
there is the opportunity to

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.270
have telescope farms.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:45.060
So I was in a conversation
last week.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.190
And I'd lived in Manhattan for
seven years, and it didn't

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.290
even dawn on me.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.900
One of the opportunities here
is you're talking about

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:56.620
getting into the hands
of everybody.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.690
People in the city
aren't going to

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.540
get a backyard telescope.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.330
They're not even going to spend
$10,000, $15,000 to get

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.200
a system that would enable them
to do light curve work

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.560
let alone have the time and
the willingness to dig in.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:16.320
But could you imagine a
crowd-funded or crowd-shared

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.040
set of telescopes in ideal
places all over the world

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:30.840
where that student or that
mom chooses to spend a

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.950
subscription fee and participate
that way, either

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:40.520
buying the time so that she can
look or donating that time

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.540
to others so that
they can look?

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.630
And so that's an initial
reaction.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:50.000
Just out of the first request
in June, we're getting ideas

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.560
on how to enable the citizenry
to engage.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.980
I would say that the biggest
hurdle is going to be in

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.930
mitigation.

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:04.010
Detection, tracking,
characterization, it's a

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:08.050
little easier to get one's arms
around how people would

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:08.690
contribute there.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:09.940
But mitigation's tough.

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.770
You don't have to move it a
whole lot, but you've still

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:16.580
got to move it.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.330
And technically, that's
not an easy task.

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:22.930
And so that's where I think
there will be less opportunity

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:27.390
for most folks to be
able to contribute.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:33.470
But whether it's looking
through a Galaxy Zoo or

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.540
whether it's contributing
through a

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.190
crowd-funded effort--

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:40.690
the other thing from my
perspective and why I'm happy

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.240
to talk to anybody about this
is that who knows what

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.280
network they have?

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.350
So you speak to somebody.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:51.290
Now they go home and talk to
their spouse, their friends.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:55.030
And somebody gets turned on by
the ideas, and they have a

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.390
whole network that they can
bring into this conversation.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:02.900
So even if it's just talking
about it, from my perspective,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.590
that's a contribution.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.630
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:10.140
JASON KESSLER: Well, thank you
so very much for having me.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.270
And I invite you to watch
through the Asteroid

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.610
Initiative page--

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:20.150
we're having the workshop at
the end of the month, 96

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:24.130
fantastic ideas from folks that
are wanting to go explore

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.700
asteroids and protect the
planet from them--

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.270
and encourage you to talk
amongst your networks and

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.830
friends about this very issue.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.880
So, thank you.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.580
Take good care.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:42.080
[APPLAUSE]
