"This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the Toyota Corolla.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:04.310
Let’s lead the way."

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.190
This week, NASA’s released an awesome, closeup
image of Ceres, the body the Dawn ===spacecraft

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.450
is on its way to visit.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.210
But what exactly is Ceres?

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.580
Hey guys, Amy here on DNews.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.210
If you aren’t sure what exactly Ceres is,
you’re definitely not alone.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.619
Ceres is a dwarf planet that scientists also
refer to as an embryonic planet.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.640
When the planets in our solar system formed
from the swirling cloud of gas and dust, Ceres

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.850
wanted to be a planet, too, but Jupiter had
other ideas.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.800
The gas giant is so massive that its gravitational
pull was enough to stop Ceres from accumulating

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.019
enough material to be a fully formed planet
in its own right.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.729
Instead, it joined all the other leftover
debris that makes up the asteroid belt.

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.729
But Ceres wasn’t always considered an embryonic
planet, because it wasn’t always obviously

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.210
one of thousands of bodies in the asteroid
belt.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.890
Ceres was discovered in 1801 by Sicilian astronomer
Father Giuseppe Piazzi.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.180
This small body between Mars and Jupiter’s
orbits solved a major astronomical quandary:

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.750
why there was no planet in an orbit where
astronomers predicted there should be one?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.870
Now there was one.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.049
Piazzi named it Ceres after the Roman goddess
of corn and harvests, and it was entered into

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.369
textbooks, which were admittedly few in the
early 1800s.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.369
-

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.710
But as more objects were found in the vicinity
of Ceres -- Vesta, Juno, and Pallas -- that

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.140
first body became less unique and special.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.289
Taken together, these small bodies were collectively
called asteroids or minor planets, but they

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:25.790
were still considered planets.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.299
They even had symbols like the major planets
do.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.250
But as more and more small bodies were found,
the scene became a little too crowded.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.700
In the 1850s, American astronomer, B.A. Gould
suggested doing away with the small bodies’

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.950
symbols and replacing them with a new standard
shorthand notation: a circle with a number

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.460
inside, the number correlating to the order
in which the bodies were discovered.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.700
The system was really simple and was adopted
pretty quickly.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.579
Ceres’ designation varied between publications
in the mid 1800s, called a little planet,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.520
an asteroid, a planet, and sometimes multiple
names at once.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.140
By the 1860s Ceres was folded into the group
of bodies that lies between Mars and Jupiter,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.469
all of which were called asteroids.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.810
Until 2006 when Ceres’ planet-like qualities
earned it a reclassification as a dwarf planet

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.170
along with Pluto.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.960
But like Pluto, Ceres being a dwarf planet
doesn’t make it any less incredible.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.080
It’s about 590 miles across, large enough
that it makes up for 25 percent of the mass

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.040
in the asteroid belt but is still 14 times
less massive than Pluto.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.530
And there are signs that Ceres contains large
amounts of water ice beneath its surface and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.180
water vapor perhaps rooted in sublimating
ice.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.870
If Ceres turns out to be just 25 percent water,
it will have more fresh water than the Earth.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.580
NASA’s Dawn spacecraft is going into orbit
around the dwarf planet on March 6 this year,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.670
so we’ll have some answers soon!

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.680
Are you excited to see what we’re going
to learn about this little planet turned asteroid

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680
turned dwarf planet?
