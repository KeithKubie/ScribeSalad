00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.820
the questioning, modeling and validating process of model building.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.361
Hopefully, you followed along and were inspired by the lessons to

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:19.575
continue learning about the various methods of model building.

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:23.189
