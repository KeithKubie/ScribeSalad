00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.580
United States Park Police shot and killed

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.740
an unarmed 25-year-old man during a traffic stop 
in Fairfax County.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.740
There are so many questions in this case.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.500
One of the only things we know 
for certain is that a Northern Virginia

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.980
family is now left without a son.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.060
[gunshots]

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.340
It is over 31 million seconds ago that this happened.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.820
It's just a number. Sounds so far away or so distant.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.920
But at the same time, the memory is so alive, 
I can feel the shots.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.780
The last time I checked, 
we live in the United States of America

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.280
and it is not appropriate to not give any information 
for an entire year

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.160
when someone's life is taken, by anyone.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.480
We were notified that there was a shootout.
We were told to go to the Fairfax hospital.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.140
They said that his body was evidence 
and that he was under arrest,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.540
which to this day we have no idea
why and no one has explained that to us.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.020
Bijan was the pride that I carried
in my heart.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.680
I think everywhere we go now, 
it's a little bit quieter and a little less fun.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.340
Bijan was hit from behind by an Uber driver while he was on the George Washington Memorial Parkway.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.860
From what we know, either the Uber driver
or the passenger or both called 911

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.050
which was rerouted, and the Park
Police picked it up and they found him

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.520
minutes later and actually started
pursuing him then.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.400
Before I saw this video, I thought maybe
one guy panicked and just fired off

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.520
his gun and it just kept going off. 
But that's not what happened.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.220
He was stopped three times.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.200
Every single instance of it they're aggressively approaching him with their guns drawn.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.700
I think in that moment, 
when someone walked out of their vehicle

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.400
and pointed a gun at his head and 
tried to yank his door open,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.360
that he was in fear for his life, rightfully so.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.700
As far as driving away from the officers,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.740
if anyone walked up to my car with their
gun drawn, civilian or law enforcement officer,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.140
after a minor traffic violation,
I would be freaking out.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.280
The third time that Bijan stopped at the
corner of Fort Hunt and Alexandria Avenue,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.320
the Park Police drove in front of
his car and they were perpendicular to him.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.040
The two officers jumped out of their cars
and approached directly to his vehicle

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.100
and he slowly, I guess, took his foot off the brake

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.960
and it looked like he was moving around the officers.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.620
[gunshots]

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.840
Clearly my brother was unconscious
careening into a ditch and someone felt the need

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.560
to take his gun back out, 
walk up to his window,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.660
as he was unconscious, going into a ditch
and shoot him in the head again.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.380
[gunshots]

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.060
We want answers for every single one of
those nine shots fired at him,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:16.520
particularly the last two, directly at
his driver's side window, execution-style.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.040
There's nothing in the tape that in any way,
shape or form, suggests that he was a threat.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.440
He wasn't driving particularly fast. 
He did stop,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.600
unfortunately, he kept on driving on 
a few occasions as well

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.760
but he's not veering towards the officers.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.300
In the U.S., police shoot to kill, right?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.840
They're not shooting to wound
anyone.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.100
It really adds insult to the family 
who has not only lost their loved one

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.880
but in a way that desecrates the body
and the person that they loved.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.720
We have someone that has been
essentially executed by the Park Police.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.460
We don't know who did it,
the name has not been released

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.240
and no answers have been given.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.400
Our treatment in the hospital was
extremely egregious

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.280
and it was extremely uncomfortable for all of us.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.520
They set up all these weird rules for us
while we were at the hospital, the Park Police.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.660
There were two Park Police officers at a time 
outside of his door.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.100
The rule was that one person could go in between 
me, my husband and my parents,

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.860
at a time, at the top of every hour for 10 minutes.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.520
If we were late by one minute, if they were
changing any dressings or anything like that,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.680
the nurses, we would lose like a couple of minutes.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.540
We could not touch him at all;
no body part, nowhere, under any circumstances.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.680
He was in a coma, 
his body was decaying.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.900
At some point, he would either have a heart attack, 
which we didn't want him to die twice,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.120
that just seemed cruel,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.500
or his organs would start shutting down
which is what was happening.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.800
November 17, Bijan was shot.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.720
And November 27, ten days later, 
Bijan left this world.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.080
My son, Bijan, was a manifestation
of American dream.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.740
Our parents were extremely supportive
and they really were big on making sure

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.480
that we understood our roots of being
Iranian but also being

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.020
extremely proud and patriotic and
understanding our American side too.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.280
He was a die-hard football lover.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.300
While he was in college, he was in fraternity

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.400
and his fellow brothers, they called him, 
"Brother of the Year."

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.740
Bij was the loudest person in the room.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.660
He had this presence that was like larger than life.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.640
He was very giggly, he was very witty.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:28.140
When something like this happens, your whole world that you build, falls apart.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.640
Everything you believe in falls apart.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.840
Living is a challenge now. 
It's a whole lot more difficult than dying.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.900
You wake up and try to make some sense out of this,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.980
which I still haven't been able to make 
any sense out of it.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.180
When you see Park Police, 
you should not feel threatened.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.260
And unfortunately, what the Park Police
has done, not just by murdering Bijan,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.940
but also by their cover up and their
silence, has actually left many people

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.300
with a fear of the Park Police rather
than seeing them as their protectors.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.540
There is, in my opinion, absolutely no
justification for taking someone's life

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.900
over a traffic incident, ever, 
under any circumstance.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:32.300
There's an over-representation of, especially men, black men who are impacted by police killings.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.360
Eric Garner was killed over four years ago,
and just now the officer who's responsible

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.620
for putting him in a chokehold is only being 
considered for disciplinary actions.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.880
Not enough people are outraged about it
and people don't become outraged about it

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.400
until it happens to someone that they
care about, and that's a real problem.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.500
We want names.
We want names.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.500
We want justice.
We want justice.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.640
We are Bijan.
We are Bijan.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.580
He loved the Patriots, he was 25-years-old, 
he just graduated from undergraduate

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.940
he was part of a fraternity.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.980
A lot of the things we know about Bijan are things we know

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.180
about people that we know and
love, as well.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.100
And that's true of almost all of the
people impacted by these killings, to be clear.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.980
They're important members of their community, 
they're loved by their family

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.520
and nobody sees it coming and one
day they're just not there.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.280
This cannot stand. 
There needs to be justice for Bijan

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.520
and there needs to be measures to make sure that this never, ever, ever happens again.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.760
We want police to wear body cameras and dash cameras.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.340
We want answers.
We want justice for Bijan.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.440
you
