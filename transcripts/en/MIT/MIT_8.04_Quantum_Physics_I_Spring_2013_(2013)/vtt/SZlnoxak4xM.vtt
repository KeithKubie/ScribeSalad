00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000
PROFESSOR: OK, so,
we're going to pick up

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.564
on our study of
periodic potentials

00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:29.980
and our search for
the explanation

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.280
of the physics of solids.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.950
And I want to quickly
remind you of the logic

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.390
we went through last time.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.470
This is one of the more subtle
bits of logic in the semester,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.884
so I'm gonna do it
again, a little faster.

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:45.050
I'm mostly gonna do it in
a slightly different form.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.504
I want to think for a moment
about just a free particle,

00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:49.920
but I want to use
all the language

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.710
and formalism we used for the
periodic potential last time--

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.430
translation operators, the
block wave functions-- I want

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.360
to use all of that for
just a free particle.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.901
So, first let's just
remind ourselves

00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:01.280
how the free
particle story goes.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.490
So, for a free
particle, by which

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.440
I mean the energy
operator is p squared

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.690
upon 2m, and no
potential, plus 0.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.977
We have a very important
consequence of being free--

00:01:18.977 --> 00:01:21.310
that the energy can be written
as just p squared-- which

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.680
is that the energy commutes
with the momentum operator.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.440
And what this
tells us is that we

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.050
can find a basis of
eigenfunctions which

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.580
are common eigenfunctions
of E and p, right?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.330
We can expand
every wave function

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.980
at any arbitrary-- fantastic.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.690
Thank you, sir.

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:40.470
Oh!

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.170
Brilliant!

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.551
GUEST: Plan A, Plan B.

00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:45.550
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.760
That's an awful huge straw.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.760
Pay no attention to the
device beneath the table.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.660
So, 'cause you know, it's
quantum mechanics, right?

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.220
Bowl of water--

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.780
So, the energy and
momentum commute.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.450
And as a consequence, we can
find a basis of eigenfunctions

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.460
exists which are common
eigenfunction of E, E on phi E,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.840
and I'll label k, by
the eigenvalue of k,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.490
is equal to E phi Ek.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:28.527
And p on phi Ek is
equal to h bar k phi Ek.

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:30.485
You'll notice, of course,
that I don't label it

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:31.510
by the eigenvalue,
but I label it

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.700
by something that's determined
by the label, the eigenvalue's

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.160
determined by the
labels, h bar k.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.150
Now, here's the thing,
can we allow E and k

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.100
to be any values we
want independently?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.290
Can I make E, 3, and k, 47?

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.650
No.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.280
There's a consistency
relation, which

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.451
involves satisfying the
energy eigenvalue equation.

00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:52.700
We actually have to find
solutions of these equations.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.120
And once we find the
solutions are those equations,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.270
we'll find relations
between k and E.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.000
And in particular,
for a free particle,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.210
we find that the relation that
we need is E is equal to--

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.200
and I will write E sub k--
is equal to h bar squared

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.560
k squared upon 2m.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.040
This is also known as
omega is equal to h

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.500
bar k squared upon 2m.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.630
Just to remind you,
the [INAUDIBLE] E

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.660
is h bar omega, omega sub k.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.680
That's not the thing
I wanted to look at.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.630
This is.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.340
And when we work
this way, we find

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.470
that the energy eigenvalues,
E, as a function of k,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.650
take a determined form.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.066
And that determined form is
quite simple, it's a parabola.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.750
Everyone cool with that?

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.370
So, if you know k, you
know E. But if you know E,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.260
it turns out it's
doubly degenerate.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.520
So, if you know E,
you're one of two k's.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.170
You could be either
the ikx-- oh, sorry,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.720
and I needed to say-- that
the function, so, from solving

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.520
the equation, gave us that
the energy eigenfunctions,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.600
phi Ek are equal to some
normalization 1 over 2

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.165
pi as conventional,
e to the ikx.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.760
OK.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.920
So, if I tell you
the energy, you

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.004
don't know which momentum
state I'm talking about.

00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:22.170
But if I tell you the
momentum, you know the energy.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.503
So, there's a little degeneracy.

00:04:23.503 --> 00:04:26.240
That degeneracy is coming
from the parity symmetry,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.580
the system, right?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.080
And note that what
we've done here,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.080
did we have to write the
wave functions in terms

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.140
of these, the ikxes.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.677
Is there another
basis we could've

00:04:35.677 --> 00:04:37.010
used for the energy eigenstates?

00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:40.410
Yeah.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.600
Because these are
degenerate, we could've

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.724
taken any linear combinations
of E to the ikx and E

00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:45.280
to the minus ikx,
and we could have

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.005
got, for example,
sine and cosine.

00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:48.380
That would have
had the advantage

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.390
that the energy eigenfunctions
would have been pure real,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.889
which is one we
proved was possible.

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.580
You can always choose pure
real energy eigenfunctions.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.480
However, it would have had the
disadvantage that these states

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.021
would not-- sine
and cosine-- are not

00:04:58.021 --> 00:05:00.330
eigenstates of momentum, right?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.940
It's convenient to work with
common eigenstates of momentum

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.140
and energy, so we give up on
having a real wave function

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.350
and that's the cost of finding
shared eigenfunctions of energy

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.375
and momentum.

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:12.830
Everyone cool?

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.791
Any questions?

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:14.290
OK.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.062
So, this is the usual story
for the free particle.

00:05:17.062 --> 00:05:19.270
But we learn a couple of
things about it immediately.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.310
Just by eyeballing
the wave function

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.310
we see some things to note.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.760
Note, all states-- all
eigenfunctions-- phi sub

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.914
E, which are of the
form E to the ikxx--

00:05:35.914 --> 00:05:37.830
and I'm gonna add the
time dependence in now--

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.935
minus omega sum
kt, are extended.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.652
They have equal probability
density everywhere,

00:05:48.652 --> 00:05:50.360
and the probability
distribution does not

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.324
fall off to 0 as we go far away.

00:05:52.324 --> 00:05:53.990
And so, what this
tells us we have to do

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.620
is we have to build-- if we
want to study real localized

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.760
states that are normalizable--
we have to build

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:09.610
wave packets of the form psi
is equal to integral dk sum

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:18.110
overall momentum modes f of k E
to the ikx minus omega t sub k.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.630
Where this f we will generally
take-- although we don't have

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.680
to take, to be a real function--
but, is peaked at some k0.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:31.580
So, this is what we did when we
studied the evolution of a wave

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.120
packet of this form.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.875
But in particular,
such wave packets

00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:38.250
have a couple of
nice properties.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.849
The first property
we've studied.

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.390
And if you're not
totally comfortable

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.610
with the idea of group
velocity, you really

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.545
need to go over it again.

00:06:43.545 --> 00:06:45.711
It's be an excellent thing
to show up in recitation,

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.080
for example, stationary phase.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.090
So, the group velocity
of such a wave packet--

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.080
as long as it's of this form and
peaked around a single momentum

00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:00.970
value, k0-- the group velocity
is d omega dk evaluated at k0,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.830
at the peak value
of the distribution.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.750
And note, I wanna
just quickly note

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.960
that this is equal
for the free particle.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.976
Omega is h bar k
squared upon 2m,

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:13.100
take a derivative with
respect to k, the 2 cancels.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.465
We get h bar k upon m.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.500
Which notably, is equal
to the expectation

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.730
value of the momentum
over the mass.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.860
Everyone cool with that?

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.770
So, this gives us a
nice way to, by the way,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.370
if you didn't know the mass, but
you could measure the system,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.950
for example, you can compute
on average the momentum,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.616
and you could compute
the group velocity

00:07:33.616 --> 00:07:35.170
by watching wave
packets move, this

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.020
is a nifty way to
compute the mass.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.610
The mass can be given by,
well, put the mass up here,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.090
and divide by the
group velocity.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.390
Measure the momentum and
divide by the group velocity.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.970
OK, so, I can take
this, and notice,

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.950
that this just exactly
gives me the mass.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.780
So, this is a way
to, given a system

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.760
with a momentum and
a group velocity,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.750
I can compute an effective mass.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.761
Which for the free
particle, is just the mass.

00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:01.260
Cool?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.922
Just a side observation.

00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:04.630
But this is all a
consequence of the fact

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.240
that we have wave
packets of this form.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.150
Their plane waves, or
at least things that

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.090
have a phase, times what could
be a real-- though it could

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.790
but an overall phase on the
whole thing-- a real function,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.370
which is peaked at a
particular value of k0.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.170
Usual wave packet story.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.651
Any questions?

00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:23.150
Good.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.270
So, this should all
be pretty familiar.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.824
Now, here's the
thing, when we talk

00:08:25.824 --> 00:08:27.240
about a periodic
potential, what I

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.656
want to do next
is, I want to talk

00:08:28.656 --> 00:08:29.800
about a periodic potential.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.190
So, now, we have a system
that has maybe steps,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:38.304
and it's periodic,
with period l, OK?

00:08:38.304 --> 00:08:38.970
And then, ditto.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.987
It's gonna be periodic.

00:08:43.987 --> 00:08:45.820
And I want to run through
the same analysis.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.528
I want to find the
energy eigenfunctions.

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:49.721
I want to organize
them in a nice way.

00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:51.720
And in particular, I want
to know the following,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.320
if this is equal to
v of x, and v of x,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.670
and I call the
energy operator E sub

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:06.570
g is equal to p squared upon
2m plus a coefficient, g,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.482
times-- let me call
it g sub 0, just

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:12.090
to make it unambiguous--
times v of x.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.130
Notice that when g0 is 0, this
is just the free particle.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.860
I added a periodic
potential times 0.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.330
That is stupid, but doable.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.570
But as I slowly turn on
g0, what's going to happen?

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.900
The energy eigenfunctions
are going to slowly change.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.280
And the energy eigenvalues
are going to slowly change.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.821
And the actual system we care
about has some actual value of,

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.380
you know, like 7,
or e, or whatever.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.680
But this is a way to
connect the free particle

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.194
to the particle in a
periodic potential.

00:09:39.194 --> 00:09:41.610
You know, and if you just turn
on a little weak potential,

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.609
you don't expect the
system to radically change.

00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:46.292
So, one way to organize the
question of periodic potentials

00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:47.750
is, what happens
as you slowly turn

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.170
on this periodic potential?

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.290
But here's the first
thing I want to notice,

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.748
the first thing I
want to notice is

00:09:53.748 --> 00:09:56.620
that it's no longer true
that the energy commutes

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.370
with the momentum.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.050
So, it would be silly to
try to organize our wave

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.620
functions in terms of energy
eigenfunctions, which are also

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.840
momentum eigenfunctions.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.589
Because that will only
be a sensible thing

00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:11.400
to do when this
interaction term--

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.490
when this potential--
is 0, right?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.940
So, instead, I want
to organize them

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.110
in terms of energy eigenvalues
and any other operator that

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.560
commutes with the
energy eigenfunction.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.420
In particular, this
is not invariant

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.090
under arbitrarily
translations, which

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.320
it would have to be to be
invariant to conserve momentum.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.760
But it is invariant
under translations by L.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.970
And as a consequence, we
have that the energy operator

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.130
commutes with translations by
L. Where translations by L.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.890
Takes a function and
shifts it over by L.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.401
And so, because translations
by L as we showed in a problem

00:10:45.401 --> 00:10:47.817
set long ago commutes with p
squared, because this is just

00:10:47.817 --> 00:10:50.720
an exponential of Lp, with
coefficients, with an i

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.580
and an h bar.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.940
And because the potential is
invariant under shifting by l,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.170
and so it commutes
with TL, this is 0.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.180
So, what this tells us is we
can find common eigenfunctions.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:13.760
In fact, a common
eigenbasis of E and TL.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.640
And here's the thing
that's nice about this,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.015
I could've made this argument
whether the potential was 0

00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:18.830
or not.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.480
For the free particle,
it's also true

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.270
that the system commutes
with translations by l.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.651
It's free, there
is no potential.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.150
It sort of silly,
because I could've

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.340
just used the momentum.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.180
But let's see what
happens if we use

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.400
the translate by l operator.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.821
Everyone cool with that?

00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:33.570
So, we want to find
common eigenfunctions.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.570
So, as you guys showed
on a problem set,

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.760
the eigenfunctions of TL--
so, in order to do this,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.260
what are the
eigenfunctions of TL?--

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.420
you showed that the
eigenfunctions of TL must take

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:54.760
the form-- sorry-- phi sub q
of x is equal to E to the iqx

00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.800
times u of x, for some
q where q is-- where u--

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.982
is a real periodic-- I
don't really need the real,

00:12:04.982 --> 00:12:06.440
but it's going to
simplify my life,

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.190
so I'll take it to be
real-- periodic function.

00:12:13.297 --> 00:12:14.880
Well, let's just
drop real altogether,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.120
because we don't need that.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.440
We'll use a periodic function,
and phi of q is this phase.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.890
It times the periodic function.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.780
So in particular,
phi is not periodic.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.890
And as a consequence, TL
on phi q is equal to E

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.480
to the iqL phi q,
because this guy shifts,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.569
and this is invariant periodic.

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:39.110
So, this is the
form-- general form--

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.776
of the eigenfunctions
of translate by l.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.462
And periodic means that u of
x plus l is equal to u of x,

00:12:49.462 --> 00:12:51.330
just be to explicit.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.050
OK.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:00.810
So, what this tells us is that
the energy eigenfunctions can

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:11.130
be put in a form-- can be
organized-- as phi sub Eq,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:16.240
such that E acting on phi sub
Eq is equal to E phi sub Eq.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.150
Just like this line, phi sub Eq.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:31.585
And TL phi Eq is equal
to E to the iqL phi Eq.

00:13:31.585 --> 00:13:32.960
And it's just
saying then we have

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.180
common eigenfunctions,
yeah, with energy E

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.632
and TL eigenvalue, q.

00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:37.548
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.020
PROFESSOR: No, because
under translation by l,

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.590
this x goes to x plus l.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.325
Oh, I've slightly
changed notation

00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:48.450
from earlier in the course.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:48.991
You're right.

00:13:48.991 --> 00:13:49.960
I've slightly switched.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.370
So, ah!

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:51.870
Good.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.790
So, yes.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.130
So, thank you.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.490
So, let's fix notation.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:01.040
TL takes f of x
to f of x minus l,

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.630
is what we've used
previously, right?

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.880
But I'm going to just switch
notation, and call this x

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.420
plus l.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.860
So, for all the
notes in here, this

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.959
is x plus L. Yeah, it doesn't
really make a difference,

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:13.250
you just have to be consistent.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.420
And you're right, I
switched between lecture--

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.990
what was it?--
eight, and this one.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.050
Sorry about that.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:20.870
Yeah, good catch.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.240
Thank you for pointing that out.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.000
So, in which case, this
shifts by x to x plus l.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.370
And we get E to the iqL.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:27.910
Good catch.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.920
Good.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.670
So, again, we have
this property that we

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.961
can find common eigenfunctions.

00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:39.350
However, can E and q be
specified independently?

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.350
We know on general
grounds that it's

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.900
possible to find
eigenfunctions which

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.377
are common eigenfunctions,
because these guys commute--

00:14:45.377 --> 00:14:47.710
E and TL commute-- so we can
find common eigenfunctions.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.270
And here they are.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.811
And, meanwhile, we know that
the form of these eigenfunctions

00:14:50.811 --> 00:14:51.830
is of this form.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.430
Because any
eigenfunction of TL is of

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.047
this form, a phase times
a periodic functions.

00:14:57.047 --> 00:14:58.880
Does that, by itself,
tell us a relationship

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.600
between the eigenvalues E and q?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.420
No, right?

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.190
Just like E and k
were independent,

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.240
until we solved the actual
eigenvalue equations, right?

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.580
And it required things
like regularity,

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.540
and no similarities.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.570
So, what we have to
do at this point,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:23.580
is solve the differential
equations for continuity,

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.087
periodicity, and solving the
energy eigenvalue equations.

00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:28.670
And when we solve
the equations, we'll

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:36.650
get a relationship
between E and q.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.810
And in particular,
if we do that,

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:52.420
here-- do I want
to do it this way?

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.830
Yes.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:01.290
So, in particular for--
write this in the following

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:08.390
way-- for g equals 0-- g0 equls
0, which is a free particle--

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:16.230
we find E is equal
to h bar squared

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:21.270
q squared E sub q is equal to h
bar squared q squared upon 2m.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:26.880
And yeah, and the wave
functions are of the form phi

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.880
sub qE are equal to some
normalization, 1 over 2 pi,

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.400
times E to the iqx.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.940
And the coefficient
function, u, is

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.400
just constant, which is nice.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.210
So, times constant.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.810
And so, this is reassuring
because it's exactly

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.550
the same form of
the wave functions,

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.602
with exactly the same
form of the energy.

00:16:54.602 --> 00:16:56.310
But where here, the
label-- the value-- q

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:03.620
is representing the
possible value of-- it's

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.880
controlling the
eigenvalue of TL.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.547
So, there was a question?

00:17:07.547 --> 00:17:08.130
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.079
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:12.452
AUDIENCE: So, for the
translation operator--

00:17:12.452 --> 00:17:13.416
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:17:13.416 --> 00:17:15.826
AUDIENCE: --that
E iqx equal to x

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:20.342
will work for any complex q in
any u with period [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:20.342 --> 00:17:21.800
Or any periodic u
with [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
although, if q is complex,

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.619
then this is badly
non-normalizable.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.792
Because if q has
an imaginary part,

00:17:28.792 --> 00:17:30.250
then that function
is gonna diverge

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.500
in one direction or the other.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.090
So, q had better be real.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.370
But, that's correct.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.160
This works for--
this expression--

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.070
A function of this form, a
periodic function-- periodic,

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.660
with period L-- times
an E to the iqx,

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.420
for any real value q,
and any periodic u,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.898
will be an eigenfunction
of TL, translation.

00:17:47.898 --> 00:17:50.007
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:50.590
PROFESSOR: No.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.560
It's not just non-hermitian.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.200
It's, in fact, unitary.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.950
I mean, what exactly
is your question?

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.116
Sorry, I'm misunderstanding.

00:17:57.116 --> 00:18:00.366
AUDIENCE: So, I mean, just
the translation operator

00:18:00.366 --> 00:18:05.400
has a really, really large
number of eigenfunctions?

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.010
PROFESSOR: Indeed, it does.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.370
And that number is
the same as the number

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.420
of momentum eigenfunctions.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.160
Because they can be
both used as a basis.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.290
They're both operators whose
eigenfunctions form a basis.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.024
That's exactly right.

00:18:22.024 --> 00:18:23.440
So, I think the
difficult thing is

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.030
to think that--
we have a tendency

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.192
to think that there
aren't very many momentum

00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:29.150
functions, for example.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.900
But there's enough
momentum eigenfunctions

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.950
to be complete basis.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:39.424
So, if this seems like a
vastly larger set, then yeah.

00:18:39.424 --> 00:18:40.420
Indeed.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.040
OK.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.821
So, when we do our analysis for
the free particle of this form,

00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:47.070
we get exactly the same story.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.486
And I want to point out a
couple of consequences for this.

00:18:49.486 --> 00:18:52.090
Working with this TL
operation-- or working with TL

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.880
eigenfunctions--- we have
exactly the same properties.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.670
Our eigenfunctions
are, again, extended.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.917
We have to use wave packets.

00:18:57.917 --> 00:19:00.000
And those wave packets
move with a group velocity,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.970
which is given by d omega dk.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.890
On the other hand, here, when
we write super positions,

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.223
our general wave function--
our general wave pack, which

00:19:10.223 --> 00:19:12.480
I'm gonna write
here-- psi, is gonna

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.834
be of the form integral
dq of E to the iqx

00:19:18.834 --> 00:19:26.751
u of x times some f of x--
or sorry, f of q-- u sub q.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:34.250
So, as long as this is a
periodic function, then

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.742
the-- oh, and I should
say minus omega sub qt,

00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:40.950
to get the time dependence
in there-- as long as this

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.110
is a nice periodic function,
especially for this case

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.568
was, when it's real, and this
is a sharply peaked function,

00:19:45.568 --> 00:19:47.960
which is sharply
peaked around some q0,

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:55.230
then we will find that the group
velocity is, again, the omega,

00:19:55.230 --> 00:20:00.149
now dq, evaluated at
the peak value, q0.

00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:01.690
And that's just a
general consequence

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.880
of this form of our wave packet.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.120
As I encourage the
recitation searchers

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:14.290
to review by stationary
phase in recitation.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.000
And secondly, again, we
can find this nice notion

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.230
of a mass, which
is the expectation

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.922
value of the momentum divided
by the group velocity.

00:20:24.922 --> 00:20:26.880
And, again, this, for
our simple free particle,

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.796
this is just a nice way
of measuring the mass,

00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:35.350
if you happen to want to do
so for your free particle.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.860
No one told you the mass.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.660
Everyone cool with that?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.860
OK.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.952
Questions?

00:20:41.952 --> 00:20:42.452
Yeah?

00:20:42.452 --> 00:20:46.120
AUDIENCE: Is that still the
momentum when we have g0

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.060
is not equal to 0?

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.310
PROFESSOR: Excellent question!

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.071
So, now, let's study the
case with g0 not equal to 0.

00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:51.570
OK?

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.105
So, so far we looked at for g0
no equal to-- or g not equal

00:20:54.105 --> 00:20:55.820
to 0-- that was just this line.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.990
But everything else,
was for general case

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.020
of studying common
eigenfunctions of E and TL.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.210
So, now, let's
study the case for

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.890
an actual periodic potential.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:11.440
So, in particular, repeat
for g0 not equal to 0.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.420
And this is the analysis
we did last time.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.059
We did exactly this analysis.

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:16.850
And we looked for the
common eigenfunctions

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.679
of E and translate by L, right?

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.470
And we found that the
common eigenfunctions

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:28.580
took the form Eq is
equal to E to the iq of x

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.330
times some u of x.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.596
And now, we need to find what's
the relationship between E

00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:36.096
and q?

00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:37.739
Are any E and any q allowed?

00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:39.280
And do those give
you eigenfunctions?

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.752
From the free
particle, we expect

00:21:40.752 --> 00:21:42.210
that that's certainly
not the case.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.130
On the other hand,
we have a guess

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.710
as to what it should look like.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.620
The energy eigenfunction
for-- let me, actually,

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:56.650
write this here-- the energy
eigenfunctions and energy

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:02.520
eigenvalues, more importantly,
of the free particle organized

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.880
in terms of q, we
just immediately

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.310
see the energy is just h bar
squared q squared upon 2m.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.644
So, the potential-- or sorry,
the energy as a function of q--

00:22:13.644 --> 00:22:14.560
is, again, a parabola.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.200
OK, so, here's q, and
here's the energy.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.540
And this is for a
free particle, right?

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.320
Free particle.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.877
E equals h bar squared
q squared upon 2m.

00:22:27.877 --> 00:22:29.710
Now, I want to ask what
happens as we slowly

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.160
turn on the potential?

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.280
As we take g0 not equal 0.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.836
So, we did this last time.

00:22:35.836 --> 00:22:36.960
We turned on the potential.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.110
We turned on the
a potential, which

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.519
is, in fact, delta functions.

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:42.810
So, now , in order to solve
the differential equations,

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.875
we have to actually know
what the potential is.

00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:46.340
There's no getting around it.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.090
And so, we took a bunch
of delta functions

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:53.030
with dimensionless strength
g0, and spaced by L.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.460
And what we found was
an equation relating

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.920
E and L, which
took the following

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.550
form-- and for simplicity, I'm
gonna write E is equal to, this

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.780
has nothing to do with
momentum, although it looks

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.821
like momentum, I'm just
going to write E formally

00:23:05.821 --> 00:23:10.430
as h bar squared Scripty
k squared upon 2m-- so, k,

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.442
here, should just be
understood as root 2m

00:23:12.442 --> 00:23:14.900
over h bar squared, which I
hate writing out over, and over

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.460
again.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.940
So, let me, actually, write
that the other way around.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:24.260
Scripty k is equal to the square
root of 2mE upon h bar squared.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:32.270
So, when you see k think E.
When you see lions, think lions.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.090
OK.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.625
So, we found that
the condition--

00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:37.750
in order that we solve the
differential equations--

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.520
the condition, in order that E
and q label energy eigenstates

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.270
which actually are
energy eigenfunctions--

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.367
common energy
eigenfunctions-- of the energy

00:23:45.367 --> 00:23:47.700
and the translation by operator,
we found that there was

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.450
a relation, which
was cosine of qL--

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.520
AUDIENCE: [SNEEZE}

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:56.230
PROFESSOR: --is equal to--
Bless you-- cosine of kL plus g0

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:05.070
upon 2kL sine kL, right?

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.830
So, first off, let's
make sure that this

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.077
agrees with what we found
when g0 was equal to 0.

00:24:10.077 --> 00:24:11.660
When g0 was equal
to 0 we found that E

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.801
was equal to h bar squared
q squared for any q.

00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:18.050
And, well, when g0 is equal
to 0, this term goes away.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.580
And we get cosine of qL
is equal to cosine of kL.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.060
And an example of a solution
for that is qL is equal to kL.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.700
Or q is equal to k.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.380
In which case, E is equal to h
bar squared k squared upon 2m,

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.150
by plugging in that expression.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:31.690
Cool?

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.559
So, this reproduces the
free particle result

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:34.350
when we need it to.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.240
But in general,
it's not the same.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.510
So, what does it look like?

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.620
So, let's take a look at that.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:53.250
So, here, first off,
what I'm plotting here

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.650
is the plot that we
draw on the board

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:57.900
last time, only here I'm
plotting it here horizontally

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.400
is the energy, E, and
vertically is cosine of qL.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.210
Now, for q a real
number, cosine of qL

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:09.620
goes between 1 and negative 1.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.870
And so, any value
in here corresponds

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.385
to a valid value of
cosine-- or of q-- sorry.

00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:17.890
So, any value, any point,
between 1 and minus 1

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.820
is an allowable value of q.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.380
So, for example, this
point, right here,

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.940
corresponds to this
value is q, OK?

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.880
Just horizontal lines.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.780
Meanwhile, this curve
is the right hand side

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.800
of that expression.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.360
It's cosine of kL plus--
or sorry-- in this case,

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.730
it's cosine of root
2mE upon h bar squared

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.630
L. This right-hand
side plugged in here,

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.480
and I'm plotting it as
a function of energy.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.690
Just to be explicit, so this is
energy-- or energy-- and the q.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.070
And here's that curve.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.350
So, for g equals 0-- which is
what I've set it to here-- g

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.490
is equal to 0--
that didn't work,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.110
there we go-- when
g is equal to 0,

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.490
we see that it goes
between 0, and this is just

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.629
cosine of root E. And
there's cosine of root E.

00:26:01.629 --> 00:26:03.670
It gets spread out because
it's square root of E,

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:07.040
rather than E. Everyone
cool with that?

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.328
And so, here's my question,
what pairs of E and q

00:26:11.328 --> 00:26:13.161
correspond to allowed
energy eigenfunctions?

00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:17.250
How do you look at
this diagram and decide

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.220
which values of E and q are
good energy eigenfunctions?

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.428
AUDIENCE: Well, the fact
that the boundary conditions

00:26:23.428 --> 00:26:28.170
of the q is such that cosine of
qL is between negative 1 and 1?

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.080
PROFESSOR: Good

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.880
AUDIENCE: Or all
values are allowed?

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.240
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.010
So, let me be explicit.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.540
So, how would I find?

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.155
That's exactly right.

00:26:33.155 --> 00:26:35.280
Let me rephrase that and
be a little more explicit.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.514
So, what we need is we need
a solution of cosine qL

00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:40.430
is equal to the right
hand side, in this case,

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.592
cosine of root
energy, L. So, that

00:26:43.592 --> 00:26:45.800
means we need to find a
horizontal line corresponding

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.883
to a particular value of
q-- or a particular value

00:26:47.883 --> 00:26:51.680
of cosine qL-- and a
point on the curve, cosine

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.640
of root EL, which is this guy.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.160
So, at any point where
we are inside these two

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.760
extreme values, and this
E, will give us a value.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.720
So, for example,
for this point-- ah,

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.000
I wish I could draw-- for
this point, that corresponds

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.110
to a particular
value of q, right?

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.360
Where the cosine of q is
equal to that vertical value.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.060
And it corresponds to a
particular value of E.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.785
So, each point, here,
corresponds to a value of E--

00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:18.890
an allowed value of
E-- on the horizontal,

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.005
and an allowed value of
q, such that cosine qL

00:27:22.005 --> 00:27:24.120
is the vertical value.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.280
Everyone cool with that?

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.215
So, what val-- Yeah?

00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:31.015
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] p
degeneracy for values of q.

00:27:31.015 --> 00:27:32.677
Like for a specific
q, we're going

00:27:32.677 --> 00:27:36.215
to find a lot of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:36.215 --> 00:27:38.781
PROFESSOR: For specific
values of q, why does it--

00:27:38.781 --> 00:27:40.689
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
horizontal line.

00:27:40.689 --> 00:27:42.572
You'll have a lot of
intersections, right?

00:27:42.572 --> 00:27:44.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's, excellent.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:44.240
OK.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:44.940
So, good.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.144
So, there are two ways
of answering that.

00:27:47.144 --> 00:27:48.310
That's a very good question.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.770
So, the question
is, look, this is

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.160
slightly funny state of affairs.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.880
If we plot-- if we take a
horizontal line-- corresponding

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.540
to a particular value q, it
hits at various different values

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.900
of the energy.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.817
Excellent observation.

00:27:58.817 --> 00:28:00.400
So, let me make two
points about that.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.970
The first point is that when we
defined q, how did we define q?

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:11.920
We said the translate be
L on phi Eq was equal to E

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.690
to the iqL phi eq.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:23.160
But now, suppose we take q
to q plus 2pi upon L, OK?

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.710
OK, so if we take q
to q plus 2pi upon L,

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.980
we don't do anything
to the eigenvalue.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.980
So, that's not enough
to specify which

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.714
function we're talking about.

00:28:31.714 --> 00:28:33.130
Because we changed
the value of q,

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:33.900
and it doesn't change
the eigenvalue.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.691
So, you can't just
focus on the eigenvalue.

00:28:35.691 --> 00:28:38.240
There are two ways of
thinking about that.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.470
One is, look, since q
and q plus 2 pi upon L

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.420
give you the same
eigenvalue of TL,

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.250
we should just think
of them as equivalent.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.480
So, one, we should just--
look, any time you have q,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:56.449
and you add plus 2pi upon L,
you just think of this as q.

00:28:56.449 --> 00:28:57.240
It's not different.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.230
There's just, you know,
q now is valued periodic.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.090
If you shift q by 2 pi,
you're actually back

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.839
at the same point.

00:29:02.839 --> 00:29:05.650
So, q is now a
periodic variable.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.395
And but, that's not enough.

00:29:07.395 --> 00:29:09.520
Different values of these
q correspond to different

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.580
values-- the same eigenvalue.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.890
So, you're getting multiple
solutions as a consequence.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.590
But there's another way
to think about this.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.990
Which is just in
terms of this graph.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:25.560
In terms of this graph,
if what we're specifying

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.490
is cosine of qL, but we're not
specifying the value for q,

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.140
yeah?

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:42.300
So, if we instead plotted
this as a function of q,

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:50.610
without assuming q is
equivalent to 2pi q plus 2pi

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.210
upon L-- which we can do,
we're perfectly entitled

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.490
to do that-- what do we get?

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.960
What do you think you get?

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.000
For the free particle,
we know exactly what

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.320
we get for the free particle.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.900
The parabola.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.275
And if you just take this,
and I'm going to give you guys

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.066
the Mathematica files
for all these things.

00:30:12.066 --> 00:30:15.310
Yeah, if you just take
this, and open it up,

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.310
instead of plotting it
in terms of cosine of qL,

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.150
plot it in terms of q,
that's exactly where you get.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.144
The satisfying thing.

00:30:22.144 --> 00:30:24.310
And I'm going to come back
to that in just a minute,

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.685
but it was a really
good question

00:30:25.685 --> 00:30:27.870
and we'll come back to it.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.050
Other questions?

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:35.380
OK, now, let's ask what
happens as we turn on g0.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.730
As we turn on g0, the
solutions to this equation

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.355
are going to be
different, because it's

00:30:39.355 --> 00:30:40.830
going to be a
difference equation.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:41.410
So, let's do it.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.035
So, here it is.

00:30:42.035 --> 00:30:43.930
We have g0, we can tune it.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.380
And I'm going to
slowly turn on g0.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.020
And watch what happens
to these curves.

00:30:50.914 --> 00:30:52.330
So, now we see
that the right hand

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:57.480
side of the yellowish curve
is now exceeding 1 and minus 1

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.040
in various places, right?

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.530
And why is it doing that?

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.476
Let's get some
reasonable down here.

00:31:05.476 --> 00:31:06.600
So, why is it doing that's?

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.300
It's doing that because this
can now be greater than 1.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.840
Cosine is bounded between 1
and minus 1, but this is not.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.180
And so, we overshoot
in some places.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.480
And what does this tell us?

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.620
What does this
really telling us?

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.470
What its really telling
us is that-- there we

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.536
go-- how do we find
allowed values of E and q

00:31:27.536 --> 00:31:29.660
such that we have a good
energy eigenfunction which

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.830
is simultaneously and
eigenfunction of E and of TL?

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.880
We need to find points where
a horizontal line between 1

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.010
and minus 1 intersects
the right hand side curve.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.320
But for the energies
between here--

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.700
this value of the energy, and
this value of the energy---

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.390
there is no such point.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.802
The energies in
here-- any energy

00:31:48.802 --> 00:31:51.010
in here-- in order for those
lines to intersect, line

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.350
must be greater than 1, or
less than minus 1 down here,

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.480
or here.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.404
So, there's no
allowed value of q,

00:31:59.404 --> 00:32:01.820
such that there's a solution
with energy between these two

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.220
points.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.310
Everyone cool with that?

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:11.290
So, that's telling us that
there are values of energy where

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.850
there are no energy eigenvalues
with that corresponding energy.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.450
Because there simply
aren't solutions

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.440
of this equation for any
value of q with that energy.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.350
On the other hand, when
the right hand side

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.430
is between 1 and minus 1, we
have allowed values of energy.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.327
We have a value of
q, and a value of E

00:32:29.327 --> 00:32:31.410
that correspond to each
other, and they correspond

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.860
to a solution of the energy
eigenvalue equation and the TL

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.340
eigenvalue equation.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:43.436
So, let's see what that looks
like in this presentation.

00:32:43.436 --> 00:32:47.500
Oh, before I do, I want to say
one other thing about this.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.150
Let's take this plot, and
let's use this periodicity.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.970
So, this periodicity is going
to say that-- So, here's

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:59.475
pi upon L, here's minus pi
upon L-- let's see, yeah,

00:32:59.475 --> 00:33:06.450
good-- there's minus pi
upon L, there's 2pi upon L,

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.060
and 2pi upon L. If
these guys are periodic,

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.180
than I could've just said,
look, at this point--

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.832
this is pi upon L,
and minus pi upon L--

00:33:14.832 --> 00:33:17.040
I could've said this point
is the same as this point.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.081
So, I could've taken this
whole bit of the curve,

00:33:19.081 --> 00:33:21.290
and I could've
moved it over here.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.520
Everyone cool with that?

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.100
Because this value of q, is
the same as this value, q.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.329
This value of q, is the same
as this value of q, right?

00:33:28.329 --> 00:33:30.870
So, I could have written this,
and if we just take this over,

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.030
you can see it's,
you know, symmetric.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:41.850
As a consequence,
we get-- And so, we

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:46.610
can write-- we can draw--
this entire parabola folded up

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.640
into one region, using the
periodicity with q as 2pi

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.020
upon L. And when you fold
it up into one region,

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.122
just using q as periodic
with period 2pi over L,

00:33:55.122 --> 00:33:57.080
and now noting that there
are several solutions

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.860
for every value q--
corresponding to how far out

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.374
on the parabola
you went-- now we

00:34:01.374 --> 00:34:03.790
have a much simpler way of
presenting this, where we don't

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.400
need to see the whole parabola.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.980
This is a real advantage.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.310
When we plot things in
this way, the structure

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.530
of the energy bands
and energy gaps

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.100
becomes considerably
more simple.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.420
So, let me do that.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.600
First let me set the g to 0.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.493
OK, so, here is
our free particle.

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:23.659
And let's look at that plot.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.659
So, here's the plot that
I was just describing.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:31.120
What you see here,
is the parabola.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.310
And I've use a
periodicity to box it up

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:36.280
into one fundamental period
between pi and minus pi

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.020
upon L, OK?

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.980
And so, the blue
line corresponds

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.155
to the energy as
a function of q--

00:34:42.155 --> 00:34:43.780
the allowed energy
as a function of q--

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.540
and what the green
background represents

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.880
is I'm going to put the
horizontal section in green

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.139
anytime there's an
allowed energy with that.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.954
So, energy, here,
is vertical, and q

00:34:51.954 --> 00:34:54.370
is on the horizontal, going
between minus pi over L and pi

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.294
over L. Yeah?

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:58.679
AUDIENCE: I might be
getting this just out,

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:04.950
but is there a reason that as
the energy increases the bands

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.270
get broader and broader?

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.425
Is that just an
artifact of the math,

00:35:07.425 --> 00:35:08.900
or is there a good
physical reason for that?

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.191
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there're both.

00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:15.700
So, one way to think about it,
so just purely mathematically,

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.510
this is saying that cosine
of qL is cosine of root EL.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.270
So, as we make the energy
larger, and larger,

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.780
some small variation
in q is going

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.550
to correspond to a
quadratic variation in E.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.330
And that's what's
making it stretched out.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:31.560
If we plotted this as a
function of kL, instead of E,

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.390
then it would have looked
much more constant period, OK?

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.120
So, that's the
mathematical answer.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.487
The physical answer is this,
if we have some potential,

00:35:40.487 --> 00:35:42.570
if I put you in a finite
well-- So, there you are.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.234
You're in a finite well.

00:35:43.234 --> 00:35:45.317
And you look at the ceiling,
you're like, damn it!

00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:47.130
And so, that's
frustrating, right?

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.350
And it's deeply frustrating
if it's a deep well,

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.724
but if it's a shallow well,
it's not all that big a deal,

00:35:51.724 --> 00:35:53.560
you climb out.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.170
Being in a deep potential--
being at low energy,

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.000
compared to the
potential-- means

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.640
that you're tightly
bound, right?

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.350
Takes a huge amount
of energy to get out.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.810
And as a consequence, what
you saw in your problem

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.396
set is that the
bands are quite thin.

00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:06.270
But as you get closer,
and closer to the top,

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.650
or as you go to higher energy,
the thickness of that band

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:10.710
grows as a measure of
the fact that you're

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.920
less tightly constrained
by the potential.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.340
OK?

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:15.840
Good.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.256
So, that's the
physical intuition.

00:36:17.256 --> 00:36:18.490
Did that make sense?

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.460
Good.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.010
OK, so, yeah?

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
g0 different from 0,

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.912
do you ever get to the point
where the solution is always

00:36:27.912 --> 00:36:30.804
inside the [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:30.804 --> 00:36:32.732
So, like the bumps [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:38.516 --> 00:36:39.470
PROFESSOR: Ah!

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.970
Good.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:40.470
Let's look.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.760
Let's look.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.190
So, let's answer
that by looking.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.961
So, the question is, basically,
look, as you crank up g0,

00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:47.460
do you ever lose
the bands entirely,

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.940
or do the bands just disappear?

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.114
Is that the question?

00:36:50.114 --> 00:36:51.780
AUDIENCE: As you get
to higher energies.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, as you
go to higher energies.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:53.570
Good.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.760
So, we can answer that.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.142
Let me do that in two ways.

00:36:56.142 --> 00:36:57.600
So, the first thing
I want to do is

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.760
I want to ask the first
of that question, which

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.594
is what happens as we
turn on the potential?

00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:04.093
Here we have the free particle,
let's turn on the potential.

00:37:04.093 --> 00:37:05.529
We know what
happens down here, I

00:37:05.529 --> 00:37:08.070
want to ask what happens to the
picture of the allowed values

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.650
of q and the allowed
value-- sorry,

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.191
the allowed values of energy--
and their corresponding values

00:37:12.191 --> 00:37:12.720
of q.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.553
So, here, it's easy.

00:37:13.553 --> 00:37:15.180
This particular point
on the blue line

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.602
corresponds to a value of
the energy, and a value of q.

00:37:19.602 --> 00:37:21.060
What happens to
those allowed pairs

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.375
as we increase the potential?

00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:24.750
And as we increase
the potential,

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.580
you can see on the left
that the right hand

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.340
side is exceeding 1 and minus 1.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.810
And correspondingly,
on the right,

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.630
here the red dot is what was
the free particle-- parabola--

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.890
and the blue line is
the actual solutions.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:42.360
What you find is when you
turn on the potential,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.900
the actual solution moves
away from the free particle

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.500
line in a very particular way.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.980
In particular, for this value
of energy-- around 100--

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.192
there are absolutely no
allowed energy eigenstates.

00:37:52.192 --> 00:37:53.150
There are no solutions.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.524
And so as correspondingly,
that area is not shaded green.

00:37:55.524 --> 00:37:58.720
There are only solutions
where you have this blue line.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.150
Everyone see that?

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.190
So, we get these gaps.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.860
And we get bands of
continuously allowed energies.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.630
And then gaps between
those allowed bands.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:12.930
And I'm going to post this-- the
guy-- to play with on Stellar.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.940
So, now, let's go up to
very, very large values

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.902
of the interaction.

00:38:15.902 --> 00:38:17.360
OK, and let's see
what happens when

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.437
you go to large of interaction.

00:38:19.437 --> 00:38:21.770
Well, one thing that happens
it that Mathematica sort of

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.000
panics down here, so it
lost an entire band, which

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.034
shouldn't happen.

00:38:25.034 --> 00:38:26.200
Let's try this, there we go.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:32.670
That's better There's
a wonderful book

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.580
on spectral methods in
solving differential equations

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.980
by a guy named Boyd.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.450
And he's pithy, if
somewhat degenerate,

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.520
and he says at one point,
the definition of an idiot

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.570
is-- or he says,
idiot definition,

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.470
someone who doesn't reproduce
their numerics twice

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.910
with different parameter values.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.560
And so, we could have just lost
this band and written a paper,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.490
oh, band's disappear!

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:57.747
This is great!

00:38:57.747 --> 00:38:59.830
Never believe Mathematica
until you've checked it.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:03.407
So, anyway, here you see a band,
and another band, and another.

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:05.490
But what's happened is the
bands become very thin.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.060
But that makes sense from
the earlier intuition.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.768
We're making the
potential much stronger.

00:39:08.768 --> 00:39:11.430
We're more tightly binding
particles into wells.

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:14.085
And as a consequence, the bands
are very tightly restricted.

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.460
And that fits very
much with what

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.589
we saw on your phet simulations.

00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:19.380
OK, but-- hold on for
one sec-- coming back

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.916
to the question over
here-- yours-- coming back

00:39:21.916 --> 00:39:24.540
to that question, if you look at
higher and higher energy, what

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.390
you're going to find is that
the bands get wider and wider,

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.367
and the gaps get
thinner and thinner,

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.700
as you go to high-- well,
it's a little more complicated

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.825
than that, it depends on
exactly what you're doing,

00:39:34.825 --> 00:39:37.130
but-- the bands get
wider, the gaps get wider,

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.299
but both of them don't get
wider at the same rate.

00:39:40.299 --> 00:39:41.840
So, this is actually
something you'll

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.070
look at on your problem set.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.550
But the important
thing you will find

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.950
is that the bands
never disappear.

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:52.400
Like a band in 1D doesn't just
close and disappear altogether,

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.201
and the bands don't overlap.

00:39:54.201 --> 00:39:55.700
And here's an easy
way to understand

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.640
why the bands don't overlap.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.994
Let's look at what
these states are.

00:39:59.994 --> 00:40:01.910
So in particular, I want
to look at the states

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.830
at the bottom of each
loud energy band.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.890
So, let's go back down
to small value of g0.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.930
So, we have these
big thick bands

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.447
with a weak little potential.

00:40:11.447 --> 00:40:13.280
We have big, thick
bands, little, tiny gaps,

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.696
and I want to look at the
states at the bottom of the gap.

00:40:15.696 --> 00:40:17.830
Let's make it maybe
a little bit bigger.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.080
So, we'll look at the states
at the bottom of the gap.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.204
And there's an optional
problem in your problem set

00:40:22.204 --> 00:40:23.960
that works through
the mechanics of this.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.340
But I want to look
through it in some detail.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:34.345
So, what we're plotting
here-- Did that work?

00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:41.520
Crap.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:54.230
Unfortunately,
this is-- OK, good.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.610
So, here what we have
is the ground state

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.240
of the lowest band
at zero interaction.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.100
So, here, is g0.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.750
And it's 0.001,
it's basically 0.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.900
As I turn on the delta
function potentials,

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.233
what's going to happen to the
lowest energy state, which

00:41:07.233 --> 00:41:09.400
is just the constant,
has momentum 0.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.140
What's going to
happen to this guy?

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.830
Well, we saw from this guy,
that the lowest energy state

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:16.925
got a little bit of a gap there.

00:41:16.925 --> 00:41:18.730
There is no state
at 0 energy anymore.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.296
There's now a state only at
slightly positive energy.

00:41:21.296 --> 00:41:23.920
A wave from what would have been
the zero energy, zero momentum

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.820
state.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.147
Everyone see that?

00:41:26.147 --> 00:41:28.230
There's this little gap
between 0, and the bottom.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.816
And if we make the
interaction bigger,

00:41:29.816 --> 00:41:31.440
we'll see that a
little more obviously.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.670
Here's the red is
the zero energy,

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:38.220
and it goes up to finite energy.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.470
But has that lowest state
developed any nodes?

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.150
Does the lowest state in
a 1D potential have nodes?

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.659
No, right?

00:41:48.659 --> 00:41:49.450
There's nodes here.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.940
0 nodes, then one, then two.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.350
And do they ever switch orders?

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.080
Does it ever go zero, two, one?

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:54.580
No.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.180
There's the node theory.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.400
So, what happens to
these wave functions

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.983
is all the wave
functions continuously

00:41:57.983 --> 00:41:59.550
change as we turn
on the potential,

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.800
but they don't switch order.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.900
Their ordering is completely
fixed by the number of nodes.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.679
So, let's watch what happens
to the actual wave functions.

00:42:07.679 --> 00:42:09.220
So, here's that
lowest state, and I'm

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.030
going to turn on the potential.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.320
What's going to happen?

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.750
Well, we're going to see the
effect of the delta function.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.910
And there, you see the effect of
the delta function turning on.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.224
And as we crank
up the potential,

00:42:18.224 --> 00:42:19.890
you see that the wave
function generates

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.340
a kink where there
is a delta function.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.800
And that state has zero nodes.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.930
That's the ground state.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.530
Everyone cool with that?

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:27.200
OK.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.770
Similarly, let's go to 0.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:30.910
Whoops.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:32.790
Oh, shoot.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:36.020
Don't give me
infinite expressions.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.520
You're not allowed
to divide by 0.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.190
Oh, shoot!

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.274
OK, here's the second
excited state, this guy.

00:42:47.274 --> 00:42:49.690
And let's look at what happens
as we turn up the potential

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:50.192
now.

00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:51.150
Exactly the same thing.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.025
We see a little kink.

00:42:52.025 --> 00:42:53.850
We don't get new nodes.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:55.860
But what we do get are
kinks at the potential.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.401
This is for the special case of
the delta function potential,

00:42:58.401 --> 00:43:00.720
but it's illustrative
of everything else.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.075
So, going back to the
bands, what's going on here

00:43:03.075 --> 00:43:04.950
is that these states
are getting compressed--

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.450
they're getting
pushed up together--

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.850
but they're not getting
swapped in their order.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.066
OK?

00:43:10.066 --> 00:43:12.440
And this was in the service
of a question that was asked.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.564
What was the last question?

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.535
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:19.535 --> 00:43:21.160
PROFESSOR: OK, I
don't remember exactly

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.201
which questions I was
answering, I'm sorry, but--

00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:24.172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:24.172 --> 00:43:24.880
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.621
AUDIENCE: I think it was
if you lose the bands.

00:43:26.621 --> 00:43:27.040
PROFESSOR: Ah, yeah.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.550
If you lose the bands.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.050
So, you know by the node theorem
that you never lose states.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:32.326
States with three
nodes can't disappear.

00:43:32.326 --> 00:43:33.700
That same with
three nodes always

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.760
has to be between
the state with two--

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.634
thank you-- between the
state with two nodes,

00:43:36.634 --> 00:43:37.970
and the state with four nodes.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.059
And they can't just disappear.

00:43:40.059 --> 00:43:41.350
So, those gaps never disappear.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:42.670
And they never overlap,
because they never

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.600
cross each other, again,
by the node theorem.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.080
All you get is things
separating into bands

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.910
and squishing together,
or spreading back apart

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:49.215
and becoming the free particle.

00:43:49.215 --> 00:43:51.394
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:51.394 --> 00:43:52.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.052
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] strange
periodic potential and you'll

00:43:56.052 --> 00:43:57.410
get the [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.160
PROFESSOR: Indeed.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:58.660
Indeed.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.910
So, that's exactly right.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.210
So, the observation is, look,
this was for the delta function

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.010
potential, but we didn't have
to use delta function barriers.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.210
We could have use
little square barriers,

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.790
I could have used little, you
know, goat-shaped barriers.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:07.914
I could have used whatever.

00:44:07.914 --> 00:44:09.502
And there's going
to be some answer.

00:44:09.502 --> 00:44:10.710
And how's it going to change?

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.760
Well, the way it's going to
change is where the bands are,

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.511
how wide they are, and
how wide the gaps are.

00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:20.010
But the rest of the story goes
over in exactly the same way.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.718
The energy eigenfunctions
take the form E

00:44:21.718 --> 00:44:24.240
to the iqx times the
periodic function.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:24.744
Cool?

00:44:24.744 --> 00:44:26.160
OK, and on your
problem set, where

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.860
you're gonna show-- one of
the things you're gonna show--

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.939
and I love this result,
because it encapsulates

00:44:29.939 --> 00:44:31.480
so much physics,
you're going to show

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.650
that if you have a potential--
a single potential barrier--

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.414
and you know the
reflection amplitude,

00:44:36.414 --> 00:44:38.580
and the transmission
amplitude-- or really, you just

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.530
need to know one-- if
you know the reflection

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.740
amplitude-- if it's
parity symmetric-- then

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.290
you can write down the
band structure entirely

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:47.340
in terms of-- you can
write down an equation

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.890
for the allowed energies
as a function of q--

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.350
entirely in terms
of the reflection

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.690
amplitude and the phase shift.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:53.920
Which is an amazing fact.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.240
So, you know about reflection
off of one barrier,

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.790
you make an infinite
lattice of those barriers,

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:01.345
and you deduce the structure
of the allowed energy bands

00:45:01.345 --> 00:45:03.141
and gaps, which is cool.

00:45:03.141 --> 00:45:05.390
So, the scattering information--
as I kept promising--

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:09.135
contains a huge amount of
the physics of your system.

00:45:09.135 --> 00:45:11.100
So, we saw that it
contains bound energies,

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.370
but it also contains
these band gaps.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:15.170
OK, questions.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.919
Yeah?

00:45:15.919 --> 00:45:19.202
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] If we
make the g0 go to infinity,

00:45:19.202 --> 00:45:22.020
would that approach
a single [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:23.660
Excellent.

00:45:29.334 --> 00:45:31.750
So, the question was, what
happens as g0 goes to infinity,

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.200
is it like getting single wells?

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:33.820
So, let's look at that.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.750
It's a very good observation.

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.060
So, here's a band
between-- I really

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.420
should put a line
here-- but between here,

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.850
and here, we have this band.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:42.580
And that corresponds to
between here, and here.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.022
As we make g0 stronger, the
derivation from simple cosine

00:45:47.022 --> 00:45:47.980
gets larger and larger.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.521
The amplitude gets
larger and larger,

00:45:49.521 --> 00:45:51.800
and those bands get steeper,
and steeper, and steeper.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.940
And the allowed energy bands
get thinner, and thinner,

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:54.400
and thinner.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.400
And, in fact, they get
so thin, that Mathematica

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.390
loses track of some of them,
which is the annoyance.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.750
So, here we have
very, very thin bands.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:04.340
What happens is we take
g0 very, very large.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.310
So, let's make it 400.

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:08.310
And, you can see, Mathematica
doesn't like that.

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.434
It's totally lost the band.

00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:11.970
So, let's try something
a little less extreme.

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.910
Oh, no, still too
big for Mathematica.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.715
Eight, you can do
it, little buddy.

00:46:16.715 --> 00:46:17.570
Ah, there we go!

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:18.700
We can keep tack of one.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.960
So, what's happening
is these bands

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.900
are getting extremely thin.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.540
And what's happening,
you're erecting

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.040
infinitely high barriers between
each period in the lattice.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.105
And if you have
infinitely high barriers,

00:46:28.105 --> 00:46:29.480
what are the
allowed eigenvalues?

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.390
It's the same as the energy
eigenvalues of the infinite

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.680
well, because it has to be 0 at
those infinite barriers, right?

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.200
So, all of those states-- all
of the states in the band--

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.491
become degenerate, and have
the same energy, the energy

00:46:42.491 --> 00:46:44.990
of the periodic well,
or of the infinite well.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.360
Very good question.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.090
OK.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:51.630
So, let's let Mathematica
relax a little bit again.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.160
Well done.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.360
OK.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.240
And so, I want to
quickly ask why do we

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.540
have bands in the first place?

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.807
Why do we have gaps?

00:46:59.807 --> 00:47:00.640
So, what's going on?

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.264
Why do we have gaps
in the first place?

00:47:07.088 --> 00:47:09.050
AUDIENCE: Because our
math told us we had to?

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.660
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.159
Good.

00:47:10.159 --> 00:47:12.060
This is an excellent answer.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.310
Not the one I was looking for.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:15.726
The answer is a good answer
because we did the calculation

00:47:15.726 --> 00:47:18.020
and that's what the
calculation tells us.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.900
And that is a completely valid
answer for a theorist, right?

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.005
At this stage of writing
down what your theory is

00:47:24.005 --> 00:47:24.710
and making a prediction.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.300
But before you can write that
paper, publish it, and say,

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:27.800
aha!

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.890
I've discovered bands!

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:31.485
You must have an explanation
to the following question, why?

00:47:31.485 --> 00:47:33.360
How do you know your
calculation was correct,

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.430
before you've done
the experiment?

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:35.850
So, one answer is, of course,
you do the experiment,

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.510
and it fits like a champ.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.385
But that's not a very
illuminating experiment

00:47:38.385 --> 00:47:41.104
as you know you're going to find
departures from your theory,

00:47:41.104 --> 00:47:42.520
you want to improve
the situation.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.330
You want some intuition
about why this works.

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:47.880
And you actually all know
the physics behind this.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.680
And we did it on the
first problem set.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.170
Remember the experiment that
we studied on a problem set,

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.270
the Davis and Germer Experiment,
where you send plane waves

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.430
onto a crystal, and due
to interference effects,

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:06.120
the transmission amplitude
changes-- the transition

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.250
probability changes-- as
a function of the angle.

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:10.750
And the reason it changes as a
function of the angle was you

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.990
had a crystal plane, right?

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:15.860
So, atom, atom, atom, atom,
atom, atom, atom, atom,

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.100
and a plane wave sent
in could scatter off

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.730
of any of these
scatterers, right?

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:24.240
Or it could transmit and
scatter off a further one down.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.530
And if you look
at the scattering

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:30.550
off different scatterers, if the
effect of those scatterings--

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.570
so one down, and then one
much deeper down-- if those

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:36.530
interfere destructively,
then that's

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:38.260
going to suppress
the reflection.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.130
And if they interfere
constructively,

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:43.381
it's gonna enhance
the reflection.

00:48:43.381 --> 00:48:45.880
So, usually we think about that
Davis and Germer Experiment,

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.296
we think about it as a function
of the angle of incidence,

00:48:48.296 --> 00:48:50.545
either straight at, or
as a function of angle.

00:48:50.545 --> 00:48:53.250
And we ask, how does
the transmission

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.040
depend on those angles?

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.650
But there's another
way to phrase

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:58.940
that question, you can
ask, look, on average,

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.740
how deep does that wave go?

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.600
Does the wave propagate
through the crystal?

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.640
Or if it doesn't propagate
through the crystal,

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.080
it's gonna exponentially
decay with some wavelength,

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.830
with some decay-length.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:18.612
And what you find is that
whether the wave propagates in,

00:49:18.612 --> 00:49:20.070
or whether it decays
exponentially,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.990
depends on the energy
and the lattice

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.870
spacing of that crystal.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:26.720
And this is exactly
the same thing,

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.534
only we have a crystal
in both directions.

00:49:28.534 --> 00:49:30.950
We don't have empty air and
we're sending in a plane wave.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.224
Now we have a plane wave,
can it propagate through?

00:49:33.224 --> 00:49:34.890
Well, for some energies,
it'll propagate

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:37.411
with continuous energy, or
it'll propagate continuously.

00:49:37.411 --> 00:49:39.660
And for some energies, it
will damp out exponentially.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:40.700
But if it damps
out exponentially,

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.840
and it damps out exponentially
in the other direction too,

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.464
then you don't get
any solution at all.

00:49:44.464 --> 00:49:45.940
It just completely dies.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.340
So, what's really
going on here is

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.940
the fact that all of these
scatterers in this lattice

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.554
are scattering centers.

00:49:55.554 --> 00:49:57.970
And if you send a little wave
packet in-- which you should

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.380
think of as a superposition
of energy eigenstates--

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.131
if you send a wave
packet in, the probably

00:50:02.131 --> 00:50:03.546
to get-- the
probability amplitude

00:50:03.546 --> 00:50:05.970
to get from here to here--
is the probability amplitude

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:09.350
to go from here to here,
plus to scatter through--

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:12.200
to transmit through and reflect
back-- plus to transmit,

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.890
transmit, reflect, reflect--
or sorry, transmit, transmit,

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.840
reflect, transmit-- plus all
the other crazy things you

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.340
could do.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:23.334
And you have to sum up
over all those terms.

00:50:23.334 --> 00:50:25.000
You have to sum the
effect of how do you

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.042
get from here to here?

00:50:26.042 --> 00:50:27.500
Every possible way
to get from here

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.250
to there, a la the
two slit experiment.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:30.935
Sum of over all
possible paths where

00:50:30.935 --> 00:50:32.730
you bounce around scattering
off each of these scattering

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:33.360
centers.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.220
And that's why the
band structure's

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.179
encoded in the
reflection amplitudes

00:50:38.179 --> 00:50:39.720
from an individual
scattering center.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.210
Because now, it's just a
common [INAUDIBLE] problems

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:43.418
of how many different paths,
and summing up the phase

00:50:43.418 --> 00:50:44.570
that you get.

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:45.070
OK?

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:51.370
So, it's just about coherent
and incoherent scattering.

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:52.588
Yeah?

00:50:52.588 --> 00:50:54.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] crystal
and I have an electron.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:54.564
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:54.564 --> 00:50:56.144
AUDIENCE: If I sent the electron
through the crystal in just

00:50:56.144 --> 00:50:57.894
the right way, with
just the right energy,

00:50:57.894 --> 00:51:00.690
won't it just go through in
some states, without seeing it?

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.160
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:01.660
Excellent.

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.952
So, the question is under
what conditions can you

00:51:03.952 --> 00:51:05.910
send an electron and
it'll just cruise right on

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:07.180
through the potential?

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.520
So, let's answer that question.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.260
That's exactly the
right question.

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:15.140
So, let's pick up from here.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.300
And I want to ask,
what have we learned?

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:21.490
So, what are the lessons
for g0 equal to 0?

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:30.410
So, the first lesson is
that the energy eigenvalues,

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:41.440
E eigenvalues, are
restricted to lie

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.500
within a band-- this
bands-- and the bands

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.460
are separated by gaps.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.550
Two, the energy
eigenstates-- so this

00:51:53.550 --> 00:52:01.720
was eigenvalues-- the energy
eigenstates are all extended.

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:09.120
And we didn't even need
to find the full solution

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.370
of this equation to know that.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.150
All we needed to know is
that it was a solution.

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:15.460
That the energy eigenfunction
are eigenfunctions

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.822
of the translation
operator as well.

00:52:17.822 --> 00:52:19.780
And that tells us the
probability of that form.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.670
And that tells us what the
probability distribution is,

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.750
which is the norm squared
of that guy, is independent,

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:24.333
it's periodic.

00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:26.180
And if it's periodic,
it can't fall off

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.794
exponentially one
direction or the other.

00:52:28.794 --> 00:52:30.710
So, we've seen that the
eigenfunctions are all

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.450
extended, and so
as a consequence,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.580
we have to build wave packets.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:39.785
So, therefore, we must
build wave packets.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:47.960
And, again, the form of
the wave packets, psi

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:54.120
is equal to the integral
dq f of q-- sorry,

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.440
I'll say fq0-- sharply peaked
around the point q0 of q.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.420
And then the wave
function's E to the iqz

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:08.680
minus omega t times
ru of x sub q.

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.640
OK.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.170
So, we have to
build wave packets.

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.450
So, three, this tells us
that those wave packets

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.720
move with group velocity,
by the same logic

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.510
as for the free
particle, V group is

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:24.247
equal to d omega dk--
or dq-- evaluated at q0.

00:53:24.247 --> 00:53:26.580
OK, where q0 is where our
wave packet is sharply peaked.

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:35.850
So, that's already telling
you something really cool.

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:38.880
Look at this lowest band.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.920
Let's make this a
little more reasonable.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.456
So, let's look at
this lowest band.

00:53:42.456 --> 00:53:46.596
And in particular, I'm
going to make this big.

00:53:46.596 --> 00:53:48.470
So, focus in on the
lowest energy band, here.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:49.710
So, there's the
lowest energy band.

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.420
It goes from the top of the
band to the bottom of the band.

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.180
It's just a little bit away
from the free particle,

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.721
because we're looking
at a relatively

00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:57.070
weakly, perturbed system.

00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:58.442
I chose a small value of q0.

00:53:58.442 --> 00:54:00.525
Actually, let's make it a
little more exaggerated.

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.040
OK, so there's the free
particle curve, the red one,

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.540
and the blue one
is our actual band.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.991
So, that's the energy
as a function of q.

00:54:14.991 --> 00:54:18.587
And let's make it even bigger.

00:54:18.587 --> 00:54:19.420
This one goes to 11.

00:54:22.576 --> 00:54:23.290
Let's see.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:26.350
OK.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.980
And so what you can see is
the following, it looks,

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.313
again, it's looks sort of
like a parabola at the bottom.

00:54:30.313 --> 00:54:32.360
And at the top, it curves
over, and, actually,

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:33.170
goes to zero derivative.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:35.128
And it has to, because
it's got to be periodic.

00:54:35.128 --> 00:54:38.119
Because q is periodic with
period 2pi over L. So,

00:54:38.119 --> 00:54:39.910
what does that tell
you about the velocity?

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:41.380
Well, let's look
at the velocity.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:46.610
V group velocity, of wave
packet with-- whoops,

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:55.220
say, here's 0-- as a function
of q between minus 2pi over L,

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:58.275
and 2pi over L.

00:54:58.275 --> 00:54:59.400
What is the group velocity?

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.358
And here's what I mean.

00:55:00.358 --> 00:55:02.730
What I mean is let's
build a wave packet which

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:04.930
has a reasonably
well-localized momentum,

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:05.930
say, at this value of q.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:09.260
So, I built a little wave
packet it has a peak here,

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.500
and what does that
wave function do?

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.850
Well, it has a group velocity.

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:15.550
And the group velocity
is given by d omega dq.

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.010
And now, we can't solve
that equation analytically,

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:19.051
because it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:21.400
But we can see, just by
eyeball, what this does.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.225
When q is equal to 0,
what's the group velocity?

00:55:30.371 --> 00:55:30.870
Yeah.

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:32.085
It's the slope, right?

00:55:32.085 --> 00:55:32.640
D omega dq.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.090
So, what's d omega
dq at the origin?

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:36.890
0, right? 'Cause
it's just horizontal.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:38.490
So, it's 0.

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:39.280
Good.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.630
What about a little
bit to the right of 0?

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:45.040
What about if I give it
a small positive q-- wave

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.170
packet localized with
a small positive q?

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:49.550
It's got a little bit
of a slope now, right?

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:51.420
Little bit of a positive slope.

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.950
So, it increases.

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:55.150
But then, it reaches a
maximum slope, halfway

00:55:55.150 --> 00:56:00.770
through the domain.

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:02.952
So, here, it hits
a maximum value,

00:56:02.952 --> 00:56:04.410
and then the slope
comes back down.

00:56:06.816 --> 00:56:08.440
And if we'd went the
other way, if we'd

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:12.250
made q a little bit negative,
the slope becomes negative.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:15.400
And that's the velocity.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.360
So, that's a slightly
strange thing.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.170
As we increase q, it
increases the velocity.

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:22.170
Increasing q increases
the velocity for a while.

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.750
That's just like k and momentum.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:24.947
Momentum is h bar k.

00:56:24.947 --> 00:56:26.530
So, that would be
increasing the group

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:27.870
velocity for a free particle.

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:30.400
But now, as we increase the q
to a reasonably large value,

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:38.400
to 2pi upon L-- oh, sorry, this
is pi upon L, and pi upon L--

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:43.200
so, if we do this to pi upon
2L, or roughly, to the middle,

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.580
we get to a maximum value.

00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:48.130
And if we increase q
further, what happens?

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:49.867
The velocity goes down, right?

00:56:49.867 --> 00:56:51.700
If we increase q further,
the velocity goes.

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.410
This is strange.

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.531
For a free particle, if
you had momentum h bar k,

00:56:54.531 --> 00:56:56.780
and you increased k, what
happens to the expectation-?

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.738
What happens to
the group velocity?

00:56:59.738 --> 00:57:01.237
If you increase
the momentum, what

00:57:01.237 --> 00:57:03.320
happens to the group
velocity for a free particle?

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.030
AUDIENCE: [MURMURS]

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:05.613
PROFESSOR: It's gonna
increase, right?

00:57:05.613 --> 00:57:08.410
But not for a particle in
the periodic potential.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:10.740
The wave packet, as you
increase the crystal momentum,

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:15.430
q, past this maximum, as you
increase the crystal momentum,

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:17.560
you actually decrease
the velocity.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.190
And, in fact, if you
keep increasing q,

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:21.090
eventually the
velocity goes to 0.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:22.630
And you increase
q a little more,

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:25.190
and it actually goes negative.

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:26.674
So, this is a funny
thing, it's not

00:57:26.674 --> 00:57:28.840
behaving like normally you'd
think of as a momentum.

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.340
And, indeed, is there momentum
conservation in this system?

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:32.840
No.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.048
We have a periodic potential.

00:57:34.048 --> 00:57:35.380
There are forces at work.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.950
Is momentum conserved?

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:38.480
No.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.190
This is not a system that
conserves a momentum.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:42.106
Momentum can be exchanged
between the particle

00:57:42.106 --> 00:57:43.910
and the potential.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.010
Q is a good quantity.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:48.210
It's the eigenfunction of
TL, and that does commute

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:49.300
with the energy operator.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.008
So, it's a perfectly
reasonable quantity.

00:57:51.008 --> 00:57:54.770
But the momentum itself,
p, is not conserved.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:56.920
So, this crystal
momentum, q, is not

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.090
the momentum, for
all these reasons.

00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:00.590
But it plays a lot
of the same role,

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:03.291
especially near the
bottom of the band.

00:58:03.291 --> 00:58:05.599
Near the top of the band,
it's a little bit funnier,

00:58:05.599 --> 00:58:07.890
because if you increase q,
you get a negative velocity.

00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:10.280
If you decrease q, you
get a positive velocity.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.230
It's exactly the opposite of
what you'd normally expect.

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:17.520
But let's hold on to that
thought for a second.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.120
So, there's another sense in
which the crystal momentum

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.070
is like a momentum.

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:23.804
And you're gonna show
this on your problem set.

00:58:23.804 --> 00:58:26.220
But it's very important in
giving you some understanding--

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.160
some intuition-- about what
the crystal momentum is.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.470
On your problem set,
you'll show the following.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.114
Suppose I induce
a constant force.

00:58:31.114 --> 00:58:32.530
For example, imagine
this particle

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:34.113
in my periodic
potential had a charge,

00:58:34.113 --> 00:58:36.490
and I turn on a constant,
uniform electric field.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:39.020
Then that particle experiences
a constant, uniform driving

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:42.301
force, which I can write as a
linearly increasing potential,

00:58:42.301 --> 00:58:44.534
right?

00:58:44.534 --> 00:58:45.950
So, what you showed
on the problem

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:48.600
set is that the force--
the expectation value

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.310
of the force-- is equal to--
for a wave packet-- sharply

00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:56.410
localized around some
value, q0, the force,

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:58.980
it gives the time
rate of change, d dt,

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.624
of the expectation value of q.

00:59:02.624 --> 00:59:04.290
So, if you turn on a
force, what happens

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.840
is q increases linearly.

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.450
Thank you.

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:12.650
It's so hard.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:14.020
It's just so obviously 1.

00:59:17.424 --> 00:59:18.840
So, if the force
is constant, then

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.810
h bar q increases constantly.

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:25.500
So, q just increases
linearly in time, yeah?

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:26.765
But that's funny.

00:59:26.765 --> 00:59:28.390
Well, we'll come back
to that, just how

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:32.133
funny that is in just a-- yeah?

00:59:32.133 --> 00:59:33.119
Question?

00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:34.221
No, OK.

00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:35.970
Well, let's think about
how funny that it.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.860
Let's tackle this, right now.

00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.620
So, imagine we start
with a wave packet, which

00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:44.760
is well localized around
zero crystal momentum,

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.634
around q equals 0.

00:59:45.634 --> 00:59:47.550
Then what is that wave
function doing in time?

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.841
How does that wave packet move?

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.240
What's its group velocity?

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:55.740
0.

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.000
So, it's just sitting there.

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.145
It's just little wave
packets slowly dispersing,

00:59:59.145 --> 01:00:00.270
quantum mechanically, yeah?

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:02.710
But if we don't make it too
tightly constrained, and p

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:03.535
and 2 too tightly constrained.

01:00:03.535 --> 01:00:05.370
And the dispersion could
be made quite slow.

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:06.828
So, it's just a
little wave packet,

01:00:06.828 --> 01:00:08.930
localized around a
particular position.

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.490
And localized around
zero momentum,

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.850
and it's just sitting there.

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:12.550
Cool?

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:14.450
Now, let's apply a force.

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:15.710
What happens?

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.000
As we apply a force, a constant,
force with a positive sign.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.950
Q is gonna increase.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.980
So, the central value--
I should say, yeah-- so,

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.480
the central value
of our wave packet

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.160
is gonna go from 0 to
something slightly positive.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160
Because q is increasing.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.785
What that means is
that the velocity is

01:00:28.785 --> 01:00:29.712
increasing at first.

01:00:29.712 --> 01:00:31.170
So, the velocity
is gonna increase,

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:32.711
and in equal units
of time it's gonna

01:00:32.711 --> 01:00:34.280
march linearly along this way.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.710
So, the particle is going
faster, and faster, and faster,

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:37.426
and faster.

01:00:37.426 --> 01:00:38.300
And that makes sense.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.675
You're driving the system by
putting on a constant force.

01:00:40.675 --> 01:00:42.574
Of course it accelerates.

01:00:42.574 --> 01:00:43.990
The velocity
accelerates linearly,

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:46.410
so the position
accelerates quadratically.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:49.380
So, let's plot the
position-- expectation

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.840
value of the position--
as a function of time.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.300
At zero time-- it's
at the origin--

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.780
it's at some trivial
position, x0.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.880
As we increase time, velocity's
increasing linearly for awhile,

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.980
and the position is gonna
increase quadratically.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.650
Everyone cool with that?

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:05.369
But eventually, at some point in
time, the velocity-- or the q--

01:01:05.369 --> 01:01:06.910
is gonna get to the
point where we're

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:08.980
at the maximum allowed velocity.

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:13.030
And at that point, what is the
curve for x gonna look like?

01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:15.140
It's gonna have an
inflection point.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.870
And as we increase--
as we wait longer-- q

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:20.790
is gonna continue
linearly increasing, which

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:23.740
means the velocity is
going to slow down.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.079
So, the thing slows down,
so its slope decreases,

01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:27.870
until finally it's got
zero velocity again.

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.870
There we go-- zero
velocity-- dx dt.

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:32.260
And then what happens?

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.320
We keep forcing it.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.760
It's a constant driving force.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.800
But this is this,
by periodicity of q,

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.580
and the thing is, we increase
q further linearly in time.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.180
As we increased q further,
the velocity becomes negative.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.220
So, instead of continuing
to accelerate--

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.740
instead of continuing to move--
in a positive x direction,

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.750
it starts going backwards!

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:53.440
That's weird.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.148
You're putting a force
in this direction,

01:01:55.148 --> 01:01:58.120
and it's accelerating
in that direction.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.675
That's a strange effect.

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:01.050
And as we continue,
eventually we

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.390
get to maximum
negative velocity.

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:03.530
Again, an inflection point.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.565
And, at which
point, the velocity

01:02:08.565 --> 01:02:11.106
starts getting less, and less
negative, or closer, and closer

01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:11.640
to 0.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.100
And we return.

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.000
And so, in some
period, capital T,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.850
which is determined by how big
this constant driving force is,

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:21.270
the particle returns to
its original position.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:23.841
Everyone see that?

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:24.340
Yeah?

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.320
AUDIENCE: Is it
starting at q equals 0?

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.600
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.270
At q0 equals 0.

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:28.769
Exactly.

01:02:28.769 --> 01:02:34.680
So, at first point, so this is
q equals 0, this is-- sorry,

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.730
q equals 0-- is
the initial point.

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:39.790
And x is equal to x0.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.820
So, under this
process, the particle

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.640
goes through an oscillation,
called a Bloch Oscillation.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.790
It's named after the guy
who invented the wave

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:49.335
functions, the Bloch
Wave Functions.

01:02:49.335 --> 01:02:51.590
And this is a
deeply weird thing.

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:55.070
Normally, you think, well, look,
if I take a charged particle,

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:57.240
and I just put it in an
empty space, or in a box,

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.350
or whatever, and I turn
on an electric field,

01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.600
what happens to it?

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.630
It accelerates.

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:03.650
But if you put that charged
particle in a periodic lattice,

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:10.000
like copper-- idealized copper,
here, perfect uniform lattice--

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.660
and you turn on an
electric field--

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.300
or you put a capacitor
plate across the thing--

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.499
that electron, at
first, wants to behave

01:03:16.499 --> 01:03:17.790
like an electron in free space.

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:19.060
It wants to accelerate.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.630
But then it finds out
it's in a lattice.

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:23.770
And it goes backwards.

01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:26.120
And it just oscillates back
and forth, [INAUDIBLE]-like,

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:26.721
you know?

01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:28.220
I really want to
get there, oh crap.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:28.925
I really want to get there.

01:03:28.925 --> 01:03:30.440
Oh no, I'm in a
periodic potential.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.880
And it just oscillates
back and forth.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.530
Is there any conductions
in this system

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:36.880
due to the electromagnetic
field that we've induced?

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.040
None.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.360
That is a strange little beasty.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.870
That is a strange,
strange property.

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:44.240
And yet, copper conducts.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.740
Copper, which is
a uniform lattice

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.570
of ions-- of
potentials-- to which

01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:51.820
electrons are stuck in bands.

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.900
Copper conducts!

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.040
The electrons don't do
this Bloch Oscillation.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.670
How come?

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:00.510
Yeah.

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:01.130
It's not perfect.

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.213
And it's not perfect for
a whole bunch of reasons.

01:04:03.213 --> 01:04:07.680
So, one reason it's not
perfect is that, so, first off,

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.770
in a lattice of, say,
copper, or whatever,

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:12.660
the ions have a finite mass.

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.240
So, what that means is
they're not stuck in place,

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.030
they also wiggle.

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:18.060
When the electron moves,
one of the ions move.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.560
So, the whole thing
you should think

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.320
of as a little wiggling
piece of jello.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.210
And as a consequence, they're
not perfectly periodic.

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:25.690
This does a bunch of things.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:27.780
One is these are no longer the
exact energy eigenfunctions.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.935
You now have to deal
with the oscillations

01:04:28.935 --> 01:04:30.480
and wiggling of the lattice.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.480
But more importantly,
here's something

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.470
that can happen-- and
electron can move along,

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:36.967
and it can kick one of these
ions-- it can bounce off

01:04:36.967 --> 01:04:39.050
one of the ions-- and
scatter some of its momentum

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:40.410
into the ion.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.552
Not into the rigid
lattice, but it

01:04:42.552 --> 01:04:44.260
could just make one
of those ions wiggle.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.870
So, it's changed the
structure of the lattice.

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:47.760
OK?

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.525
And what you can do then, is
you can have an electron that

01:04:49.525 --> 01:04:51.780
is accelerating, and it hits
something, and it stops.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.820
And it accelerates.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.587
And it stops.

01:04:53.587 --> 01:04:55.670
Accelerates, and it hits
something, then it stops.

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:56.390
OK?

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:58.920
So, when you have lots of
disorder in your system--

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.000
or when you allow the
electron to bounce off

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.780
things in the lattice-- you get
this effective conductivity.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.467
Things start their
Bloch Oscillation,

01:05:05.467 --> 01:05:07.550
then they collide, and
scatter off their momentum,

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:09.140
and go back to zero
momentum, but they've

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.348
moved over a little bit in
their oscillation already.

01:05:11.348 --> 01:05:12.520
They move up, and they move.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.696
So, what that picture looks
like is, you accelerate,

01:05:14.696 --> 01:05:16.820
and then, boom, you scatter,
and you fall back down

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.236
to zero momentum
by scattering off

01:05:18.236 --> 01:05:19.990
your momentum into
something else.

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:22.359
Same thing, you move
up, and then, now, you

01:05:22.359 --> 01:05:23.400
have zero momentum again.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.660
You move up, you have
zero momentum again.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:25.890
You move up, you
have zero momentum.

01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:27.890
You move up, you have
zero momentum, again.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.870
And so, you get this
effective drifting

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:34.730
of the electrons, pointed
out by a guy named Drude.

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:37.335
That gives you, effectively,
a conductivity and a solid.

01:05:37.335 --> 01:05:38.960
Now, there are a
bunch of other effects

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.060
that are important
for conductivity.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.600
Normally, we think of disorder
as something that, you know,

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.200
if you make things
messy, they're

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.950
probably gonna transmit
less well, right?

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:49.215
But disorder is absolutely
essential for conductivity

01:05:49.215 --> 01:05:50.590
in real solids.

01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.600
Both for this reason,
because you scatter off

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.260
of fluctuations, but also, when
you have a chunk of copper,

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.485
it's not a chunk of copper.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.026
It's a chunk of
copper, but it's got,

01:05:58.026 --> 01:06:00.067
you know, here and there,
there's a little carbon

01:06:00.067 --> 01:06:02.710
atom that got stuck, and
maybe there's a bit of nickel,

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:05.530
and, you know,
palladium, or, you know,

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:08.116
Berkelium-- pretty unlikely,
but could be there-- so,

01:06:08.116 --> 01:06:10.490
you have all sorts of schmutz
sort of distributed around.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:11.500
And, again, those
are things that

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.150
make the potential not periodic.

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:16.920
And, so, will change the
conservation of this q.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.120
OK?

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.032
Yeah?

01:06:19.032 --> 01:06:20.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but if you actually

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.660
managed to put a
alternating current--

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.534
or an alternating voltage--
at the right frequency,

01:06:25.534 --> 01:06:27.700
you could actually drive
the electrons from one side

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.280
to the other in this fashion?

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:29.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so, I--

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:30.768
AUDIENCE: --even though
the conventional way

01:06:30.768 --> 01:06:31.890
of thinking about
alternating currents

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:33.520
is that the electrons
really don't move at all.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.270
PROFESSOR: That's a
very good observation.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.266
It's a little subtle, so
come to my office hours

01:06:37.266 --> 01:06:37.830
and ask me about that.

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:40.163
But there's an interesting--
For a very specific reason,

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:41.820
because it's easy
and unambiguous,

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.670
I chose look the DC.

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:43.580
But you're right,
looking at the AC,

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.250
is really a very
entertaining example.

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:46.862
So, yeah, I'm not
gonna get into it.

01:06:46.862 --> 01:06:48.820
There's a cool story with
parametric resonance.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.200
And yeah, there's a
very nice story there.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.880
Come to my office
hours, because that

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.230
is a particularly fun story.

01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:55.600
OK, but I want to do
one last thing on this

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.650
before we move on.

01:06:56.650 --> 01:07:01.340
So, in this process, something
very strange happened.

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.590
When we got to the top of
the potential, what we found

01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:06.270
was as we increase--
as we continue

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:11.576
constant, positive force--
the velocity decreased.

01:07:11.576 --> 01:07:12.540
Yeah?

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.030
That is weird.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.030
Normally, when I take
a force, and I take

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.280
some object with some
mass, and I take a force

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.570
and I apply it to the mass,
and then the acceleration

01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:20.570
is the force
divided by the mass.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.528
In particular, mass is
always a positive thing,

01:07:22.528 --> 01:07:25.176
so if I take my force, and I
divide it by the positive mass,

01:07:25.176 --> 01:07:27.550
I get an acceleration in the
same direction as the force.

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.400
But here, we have
an applied force,

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.520
and we get an acceleration
in the opposite direction.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.160
I thought our particle
had a positive mass.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.010
Didn't it have a positive mass?

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.640
We started off with
a positive mass.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.181
We should still have
a positive mass.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.330
So, what's going on here?

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:45.330
Well, we have a rule for
calculating what the mass is.

01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:47.340
We take the expectation
value of the momentum

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:50.589
and divide by the
group velocity.

01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:52.630
So, let's find out what
the mass is for this guy.

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:57.670
And I'll do that here.

01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:01.570
So, this is a slightly
surreal moment

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:02.855
with a nice little codon.

01:08:02.855 --> 01:08:04.980
So, I'm going to write that
expression for the mass

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.854
slightly differently.

01:08:05.854 --> 01:08:09.407
And you're gonna show in
your problem set-- PSet--

01:08:09.407 --> 01:08:11.865
you're gonna show that that
definition of the mass-- M star

01:08:11.865 --> 01:08:13.960
is p upon the group
velocity-- leads

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.880
to the following expression, you
can write that as-- you can use

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.470
that to derive-- that the mass
can be written as 1 upon h bar

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:28.660
squared d squared E dq squared.

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.680
So, the group velocity
is the first derivative

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.837
of the energy with respect to q.

01:08:34.837 --> 01:08:36.420
The mass-- or really
q over the mass--

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.840
is proportional to the second
derivative, the curvature.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.640
Everyone see that?

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.431
So, this should not be
an obvious equation,

01:08:42.431 --> 01:08:45.779
unless you're breathtakingly
good at calculus in your head.

01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:47.260
It's just chain
rule, but it does

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.340
take a little bit
of careful thinking,

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.290
because it's a
physical argument,

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.040
it's not a rigorous
mathematical argument.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.717
You're gonna do it
on your problem set.

01:08:52.717 --> 01:08:54.550
So, let's take this
expression and let's see

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:55.710
what the effective mass is.

01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.270
What is the mass
of our particle?

01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:59.600
Now, here, when I see what
is the mass of our particle?

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.439
I mean a very precise thing.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:03.910
What is the mass of
the object moving

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:05.750
in this periodic potential?

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:06.580
That's what I mean.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:07.680
What is the mass of this thing?

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.720
And we have a definition for it.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.410
Here it is.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:13.170
And let's plot this 1 over mass.

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:14.778
So, let's plot this 1 over mass.

01:09:14.778 --> 01:09:16.402
Oh, that's not the
way I wanna draw it.

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.729
Yeah.

01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:24.000
Yeah, OK, good.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.630
So, here-- oh, shoot--
so, let's do it this way.

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:33.170
So, I want to plot 1 over
mass, in the vertical,

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.960
as a function of q.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.290
And here is q is equal
to 0, and here is 1

01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:40.640
upon mass is equal to 0.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.390
So, at the bottom of the
band-- and this is pi upon L,

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:49.000
and minus pi upon L. At the
bottom of at the band, at q

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.660
equals 0, what is the mass?

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.140
Well, here's the velocity,
and there's the band.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.560
So, what's the mass at
the bottom of the band?

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:02.230
Tell me properties about it.

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:02.780
Is it 0?

01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.810
Yeah.

01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:09.018
There's still some curvature.

01:10:09.018 --> 01:10:14.160
It's approximated by
some parabola, right?

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.525
It's even.

01:10:15.525 --> 01:10:18.920
And, in fact, you can take that
equation and derive properties

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.420
about it.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.540
But it's some curvy thing.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.562
You can see that.

01:10:21.562 --> 01:10:23.770
It's more obvious if we look
at a higher energy band.

01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:25.260
So, here's the minimum.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.100
Here's what it would
have been if we

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.430
didn't have a potential, right?

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.390
But here's the minimum, and it's
nice and curvy, and at the top,

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:30.590
again, it's nice and curvy.

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:32.923
But it's got a second derivative
there, that's non-zero.

01:10:32.923 --> 01:10:34.450
Everyone agree with that?

01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:39.400
Now, here's the thing I want to
ask, is that second derivative

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:44.945
the same as it would have been
if we had g arbitrarily small?

01:10:44.945 --> 01:10:46.024
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:46.024 --> 01:10:46.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.394
Not so much.

01:10:47.394 --> 01:10:49.310
No, if g was much lower,
the second derivative

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:51.270
would be a bit different.

01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.940
OK.

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.774
So, in particular, this
is some funny value.

01:10:53.774 --> 01:10:55.190
And I'm just gonna
give it a name.

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:56.630
It's gonna have some value at 0.

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.379
And, in particular,
it is positive.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:10:59.420
Everyone agree with that?

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.970
But there's a point here--
there's an inflection point--

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.429
where this thing has
zero second derivative.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.220
And that inflection
point is the same point

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.761
where the velocity
becomes a maximum,

01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:12.550
because the velocity's
a first derivative.

01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:14.160
So, when the velocity's
at a maximum,

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.290
the second derivative has a 0.

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:20.140
It's the derivative of the
first velocity, zero slope.

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:21.880
And so, at that
inflection point,

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.950
the velocity is 0--
or sorry, the velocity

01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:29.770
is a maximum-- and 1
upon the mass, goes to 0.

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:35.240
And then, if we increase
q further, what happens?

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.030
1 over m star goes negative.

01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:43.660
And it reaches a minimum
at pi over L, come back,

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:44.790
and, again, repeats.

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.260
So, it's periodic.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.870
I'm just artistically
challenged.

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:49.971
So, how can this possibly be?

01:11:49.971 --> 01:11:50.470
Right?

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:51.928
So, first off, what
this is telling

01:11:51.928 --> 01:11:53.887
us is that we have a
point where the mass is 0.

01:11:53.887 --> 01:11:56.136
It's positive around the
origin, where things normally

01:11:56.136 --> 01:11:57.080
behave intuitively.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.930
It goes to 0-- 1
over the mass-- goes

01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:01.595
to 0, which tells me
that the mass, m star,

01:12:01.595 --> 01:12:02.470
is going to infinity.

01:12:05.636 --> 01:12:06.760
1 over the mass going to 0?

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.920
Mass must be going to infinity.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.690
What does that mean?

01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:09.500
Well, what does it
mean for something

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.541
to be infinitely massive?

01:12:10.541 --> 01:12:14.230
It mean f equals ma, if it's
infinitely massive-- then let's

01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:17.390
write that as acceleration
is force over m star-- then

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:19.100
that tells you that
if you apply a force,

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.450
you get no acceleration.

01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:21.850
But that's exactly what we saw.

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:24.130
We get to this point, we
keep applying our force,

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:25.920
and the velocity stays constant.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.020
There's no acceleration.

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:27.520
Yeah?

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in this equation,

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:30.770
that's an external force, right?

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:31.515
PROFESSOR: That's
an external force.

01:12:31.515 --> 01:12:31.790
AUDIENCE: So, only--

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:32.180
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:32.420
Yeah.

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:33.336
Purely external force.

01:12:33.336 --> 01:12:35.563
I put a capacitor plate
across my piece of metal.

01:12:35.563 --> 01:12:37.351
AUDIENCE: So, my
next question would

01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:39.515
be is it all that insane then?

01:12:39.515 --> 01:12:41.640
Because, like, you haven't
calculated the net force

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.196
on the object, so to speak,
and so there is the potential.

01:12:45.196 --> 01:12:47.130
And so, yeah, the net
force is zero, sure,

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:49.255
you're applying force, but
it's not going anywhere.

01:12:49.255 --> 01:12:52.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's not
a complete answer to what's

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.560
going on here, but it's
a very good observation.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.010
So, let me rephrase
that slightly.

01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:00.230
So, look, I'm doing a
slightly strange thing.

01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:02.170
I'm applying an external
force, and I'm not

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:03.100
treating it quantum
mechanically,

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.670
I'm treating this particle
quantum mechanically.

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:05.860
That's clearly stupid.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.330
We should treat everything
quantum mechanically,

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:08.990
and derive the results
in that fashion.

01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:11.489
It turns out, in this case,
that the negative effective mass

01:13:11.489 --> 01:13:14.380
doesn't go away if we treat the
electromagnetic field quantum

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.010
mechanically.

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:16.801
So, you're absolutely
correct, but it's not

01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:19.170
enough to sort of make us
comfortable with the result.

01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:20.940
It doesn't change this result.

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.440
But you're absolutely correct
that that's an important thing

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.600
to do if we want to be honest.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.810
But this is a perfectly good
approximation for our purposes.

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:33.364
So, the mass goes infinite,
and then it goes a negative!

01:13:33.364 --> 01:13:35.530
1 over the mass goes negative,
so that's ridiculous,

01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:36.630
but that's exactly
what we wanted.

01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:38.630
The acceleration is the
force divided by the mass,

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:40.740
but we found that when we apply
a force in this direction,

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.577
we get an acceleration
in this direction.

01:13:42.577 --> 01:13:44.910
That's a negative coefficient,
so, in particular, here's

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:46.034
what I want to think about.

01:13:46.034 --> 01:13:48.110
I want to ask the following
question, this value

01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:49.651
of the mass-- even
around the bottom,

01:13:49.651 --> 01:13:51.810
this should already be
disturbing observation--

01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:53.420
because this value
of the mass is not

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.880
the same as the mass of
our original particle.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.463
And the way you can
see that is if you

01:13:57.463 --> 01:14:00.130
go to various strong coupling,
then this band shrinks down.

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:02.440
It becomes very thin,
and the second derivative

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.400
becomes arbitrarily
small, which means

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.652
the mass becomes
arbitrarily large.

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:09.360
So, the mass is getting
larger and larger

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.634
as we crank up the potential--
the effective mass--

01:14:11.634 --> 01:14:13.300
of whatever this thing
is that's moving.

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:14.460
But this is strange.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.126
The thing that's
moving is our particle.

01:14:16.126 --> 01:14:17.220
It has mass, m.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.660
Everyone agree with that?

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.890
What is going on here?

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:25.670
And here, I want to
do an experiment.

01:14:28.109 --> 01:14:28.900
And my experiment--

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:32.600
AUDIENCE: [MURMURING]

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.110
PROFESSOR: So, yeah, the
seamless pong ball company,

01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:40.080
in recognition of my
contributions to physics

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.640
and $3, has given me a series
of ping pong balls, with which,

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.390
I'm going to do the
following experiment.

01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:49.110
OK.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:52.556
Here's the calculation
I want to do.

01:14:52.556 --> 01:14:54.430
The lesson I want you
to take away from this,

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:56.430
is that you've got to
be very careful what

01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:58.805
you mean by, "the
mass" of an object.

01:15:02.204 --> 01:15:03.620
Take one of these
ping pong balls,

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.630
I'm not gonna do the
whole experiment for you,

01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:06.940
but I'll tell you the set up.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.360
Take a ping pong ball, and
the first thing I want to do

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.300
is, I want to measure it's mass.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.320
Well, what do you mean
by measure its mass?

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.130
Well, I'm gonna take it, and
I'm gonna put it in a vacuum,

01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:14.296
you know, we could take it
to France to were they do

01:15:14.296 --> 01:15:16.010
the-- And take the
ping pong ball--

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:17.510
ANNOUNCEMENT: One,
two, three, four.

01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:21.310
One, two, three, four.

01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:24.740
One, two.

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:29.150
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:32.774
PROFESSOR: We're just
gonna turn that down.

01:15:32.774 --> 01:15:33.274
OK.

01:15:33.274 --> 01:15:35.238
ANNOUNCEMENT: One,
two, three, four.

01:15:35.238 --> 01:15:39.670
One, two, three, four.

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:41.980
PROFESSOR: Can we kill that?

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:43.155
OK, so.

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:49.730
So, we take our ping pong ball,
and we put some mass over here,

01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:51.620
with a known mass, and
we put it on a scale,

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:54.030
and we wait until this
goes to the vertical,

01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:55.030
and we declare the mass.

01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:56.580
And what we find is that
the mass of our ping pong

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:59.079
ball-- this is, you know, not
the greatest ping pong balls--

01:15:59.079 --> 01:16:01.904
but by legislation, this is
supposed to be about 2.7 grams,

01:16:01.904 --> 01:16:03.070
or people get in fistfights.

01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:04.486
So, the mass of
the ping pong ball

01:16:04.486 --> 01:16:05.790
needs to be about 2.7 grams.

01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:07.740
And, meanwhile, the
radius of this guy

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:12.020
is about 20 millimeters,
so 2 centimeters.

01:16:14.984 --> 01:16:16.130
Yeah, that's about right.

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:18.932
And yeah.

01:16:18.932 --> 01:16:20.390
So, this is supposed
to-- morally--

01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:21.710
it's supposed to
be 2 centimeters.

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:24.180
And so, if you go through this
and you compute the density

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.260
from these guys-- so,
this gives you a volume--

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:29.262
and if you compute the density,
the density is about 12.4

01:16:29.262 --> 01:16:29.845
by regulation.

01:16:29.845 --> 01:16:32.100
Now, I've done this experiment,
and I've done this measurement.

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.600
And I must've used
very cheap balls,

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.720
because I got a very,
very low density.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.420
I got-- oh sorry, this is
the wrong way to do it--

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:42.550
the density is equal to
1, in usual CGS units,

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:45.380
is 1 upon 12.4.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.930
And I can write that as 1
upon 12.4 times the density

01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:49.090
of water.

01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:49.670
OK?

01:16:49.670 --> 01:16:52.330
Now, when I did this
experiment, I got 1 over 20.

01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:54.650
So, I was probably using
very cheap ping pong balls.

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:56.649
But if you look at the
regulations on Wikipedia,

01:16:56.649 --> 01:16:59.570
this is what you're
supposed to get.

01:16:59.570 --> 01:17:01.010
Let's assume these are perfect.

01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:02.152
So, you do this.

01:17:02.152 --> 01:17:02.860
There's the mass.

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:03.569
That is the mass.

01:17:03.569 --> 01:17:04.860
That's what I mean by the mass.

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.536
You take a scale,
you weigh the thing!

01:17:06.536 --> 01:17:07.036
Right?

01:17:07.036 --> 01:17:09.620
Does anyone object to my
definition of the mass?

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.809
It's an observational,
empirical process

01:17:11.809 --> 01:17:12.850
for determining the mass.

01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:14.380
If I take my mass, OK?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.439
And now I ask the following
question, if I take some water,

01:17:17.439 --> 01:17:19.730
and I pull my ping pong ball,
and I put it under water,

01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:21.760
and I put a spring
scale here, and they

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.840
measure the force
on this ping pong

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.150
ball, what will the force be?

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:28.850
Well, the force will
be-- and let's just call

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:30.580
this ten, because the
calculation's going

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.400
to be horrible otherwise-- well,
whatever, let's call it 12.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:36.220
So, the force-- and
another way to write this

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:39.975
is that rho water is
equal to 12 rho ping pong

01:17:39.975 --> 01:17:44.510
ball-- I did math there.

01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:48.020
So, the force-- we know this
from Archimedes-- the force

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:50.140
is a combination of the
weight of the ping pong

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.270
ball down, so, it's going to be
the density times the volume.

01:17:55.270 --> 01:18:01.800
So, the volume times rho ping
pong ball down, so, minus.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.920
Plus the volume
times rho water up,

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.697
because that's the weight of
the water displaced, right?

01:18:08.697 --> 01:18:11.280
So, your weight down, minus the
weight of the water displaced.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.279
Everyone cool with that?

01:18:12.279 --> 01:18:12.929
Archimedes.

01:18:12.929 --> 01:18:14.470
It's pretty well
known at this point.

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:17.990
So, this is equal to
the volume times rho

01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:21.540
water minus rho ping pong ball.

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.250
And I can write this
as the volume times

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:25.180
rho water is 12 rho
ping pong balls,

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.510
so that's 12 minus 1
rho ping pong ball.

01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:31.550
That's 11 rho ping pong ball.

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:35.350
But this is equal to 11
times the weight of the ping

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:39.450
pong ball-- oh sorry-- 11 times
the mass of the ping pong ball.

01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:40.700
The volume times the density.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.630
So, mass ping pong ball.

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:45.160
Now, there's an important thing
that I forgot to add here,

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.270
what did I forget to add?

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:48.000
G. Right?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.726
It's the force is
the mass times g.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:54.470
OK, g, g, and g.

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:58.399
So, we get that the force is
equal to 11 m ping pong ball g.

01:18:58.399 --> 01:18:59.440
Everyone agree with that?

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.030
I haven't done anything sneaky.

01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:02.920
And so, as a consequence,
what this predicts

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.190
is that if I take the
force and I divide it

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:07.100
by the mass of the
ping pong ball,

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.040
I get 11 times the
acceleration of gravity.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.590
And here's what that predicts,
that predicts that when I let

01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:16.710
go of this thing,
what should happen?

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:19.410
It should accelerate
upward through the water

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:22.360
at 11 times the acceleration
of gravity, which

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.100
is roughly 10 meters
per second squared.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.920
So, 110 meters per
second squared.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.450
Does that sound right?

01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:31.600
Just intuitively,
does that sound right?

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.640
If you pull something
like a ping pong

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.556
ball, or a beach ball
or something underwater,

01:19:35.556 --> 01:19:38.250
what happens when
you let go of it?

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:40.350
Well, at this point,
I'm going to remind you

01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:42.760
that physics is an
empirical science.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.014
So, let's see if we can do this.

01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:47.430
OK, now, what's
supposed to happen

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:51.321
is this thing is supposed to
shoot out at nine times-- or 11

01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:52.820
times-- the
acceleration of gravity.

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:55.660
So, it just shoots through
this thing much faster

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.220
than equivalently.

01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.698
So which one's
going to hit first?

01:19:59.698 --> 01:20:01.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:02.020
PROFESSOR: Should it
come out, or should it

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:02.895
hit the ground first?

01:20:02.895 --> 01:20:03.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
the ping pong ball.

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:06.734
Great, that's helpful.

01:20:06.734 --> 01:20:07.640
Uh-huh.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.550
So, what's gonna happen first?

01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:10.670
Is the ping pong ball
gonna hit the surface,

01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:12.503
or is it gonna come
flying out of the water?

01:20:12.503 --> 01:20:15.070
This is accelerating with
the acceleration of gravity.

01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:17.569
And this it's accelerating up
with 11 times the acceleration

01:20:17.569 --> 01:20:18.820
of gravity.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.200
So, let's do the experiment.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.041
And this is what
they pay me for.

01:20:22.041 --> 01:20:22.540
Oh.

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:23.956
This would be much
more satisfying

01:20:23.956 --> 01:20:33.120
if we had a nice long-- how do I
want to phrase this-- cylinder.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:33.680
Oh, shoot!

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:34.180
Stop.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.470
So, it's best done with
a nice, long cylinder,

01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:41.380
but let's do this.

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:42.210
So, which one wins?

01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:43.569
AUDIENCE: [MURMURS]

01:20:43.569 --> 01:20:44.860
PROFESSOR: Gravity wins, right?

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:45.720
And why?

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.630
Intuitively, why does this work?

01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:50.139
AUDIENCE: [MURMURING]

01:20:50.139 --> 01:20:51.930
PROFESSOR: I am neglecting
the drag effect,

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:53.660
but I'm not really heating
up the water all that much.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.160
I mean, it's not
like the dissipation

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.160
is all that significant.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.090
The dissipation of the momentum,
which is drag-- the friction--

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:01.362
is not the most important
thing for our purposes here.

01:21:01.362 --> 01:21:02.820
That water hasn't
heated up at all.

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:05.054
So, what's going on?

01:21:05.054 --> 01:21:07.747
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:07.747 --> 01:21:09.330
PROFESSOR: OK, so
here's the question.

01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:11.788
Has a mass of the ping pong
ball, my empty little ping pong

01:21:11.788 --> 01:21:13.620
ball changed?

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.324
So, something like
that has to be true.

01:21:16.324 --> 01:21:17.490
But what's the right answer?

01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:21.330
The right answer is this,
the thing that's moving,

01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:23.970
is not the ping pong ball.

01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:26.100
The ping pong ball is
interacting with the fluid.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.020
And as a ping pong
ball accelerates,

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.190
it drags the fluid
along with it.

01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:31.810
And as it goes
faster, and faster,

01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:34.239
it drags more and more of
the fluid along with it.

01:21:34.239 --> 01:21:36.280
And as it's dragging more
and more of that fluid,

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.241
the effective mass
of the entire object

01:21:38.241 --> 01:21:39.990
that's moving-- which
is now the ping pong

01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:44.300
ball, and all of its associated
water-- is increasing.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.040
And now, if you take that force,
which was constant, and divide

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.010
by this growing
effective mass, you

01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:51.777
find that the acceleration
rapidly falls off.

01:21:51.777 --> 01:21:53.110
And you get a terminal velocity.

01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:54.050
And you know this
works, because if you

01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:56.150
blow a bubble under water,
it doesn't shoot upwards

01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:57.400
with an infinite acceleration.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.020
It goes glurg, glurg, glurg.

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:02.930
And this idea, this idea
of the effective mass

01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:05.640
of a particle changing
with its state of motion,

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.070
is an idea called
renormalization.

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:10.690
And it plays an essential role,
not just in particle physics,

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:13.140
but in all of modern
condensed matter physics.

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.080
And we'll pick up at
this point next time.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.630
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
