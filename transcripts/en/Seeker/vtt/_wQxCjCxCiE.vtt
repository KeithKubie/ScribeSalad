00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.870
Remember when Inside the Magic Schoolbus shrank
down and flew into Arnold?

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.910
Yeah, science is actually doing that.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:15.340
THE FUTURE IS NOW.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.680
Giant feats of engineering like space vehicles,
dams, skyscrapers and massive airplanes are

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.990
complex, to be sure… but at least the engineers
working on them can SEE what they're working

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.990
on.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.820
Imagine engineering a pump which is only a
single molecule in size.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.820
Yeah.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.620
It's REALLY HARD, but a team from Northwestern
University did it earlier this year.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.999
In nature, molecules are constantly moving
around in our bodies, transporting energy,

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.640
oxygen, and even information from one place
to another; this molecular pump is a rudimentary

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.790
synthetic copy of something nature does all
the time.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.920
This pump uses a dumbbell-shaped molecule,
and a set of positively charged molecular

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.920
rings.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.210
Sort of like two magnets repelling each other,
the rings provide tiny amounts of energy that

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.409
the synthetic molecule can use to make the
pump ratchet at a predictable rate!

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.810
The problem with nanotechnology, has always
been powering itty-bitty things; and realizing

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.009
they can harvest energy from nano-scale rings
is enough is pretty huge… or… small…

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.560
I mean…

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.539
They're hoping if they can improve the tech
and capture MORE rings they'd have enough

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.960
energy to power artificial muscles, or even
whole nanomachines!

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.370
The development of nanotechnology has been
steadily climbing over the last 40 years and

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.829
with leaps like this, things are starting
to get crazy.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.969
In 2004, scientists at New York University
created a nanobot that bipedally "walks" on

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.899
legs 10 nanometers long by adding a molecule
called psoralen found in the seeds of celery,

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.340
parsley, citrus fruits and the common fig.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.039
A few years later, a study on the future of
nanomaterials said we're only 10 to 20 years

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.369
from a nanosized factory.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.749
This psoralen molecule lets the nanobot "walk"
along a DNA strand; the researchers envision

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:02.859
this as the beginnings of a nanobot conveyor
belt for nanoassembly… think about the coolness

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:09.400
of a nano-sized car factory… assembling
nanobots for any imaginable purpose.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.580
The NIH says nanocomputers and nanobots could
revolutionize the medical industry by creating

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.430
nanobots which could mechanically reverse
plaque buildup in arteries, or prepare tissues

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.360
for cryonic storage, repair spinal damage,
rewrite individual bases in our DNA, improve

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.010
the efficiency of our cells, or map the complicated
connections of the mammalian brain.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.750
Things are moving real fast in this y'all.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.570
In 1998, researchers (hypothetically) designed
a red blood cell 200 times more efficient

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.440
than our own.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.680
It was, in essence, an atomic-sized oxygen
tank that could fill up in the lungs and distribute

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.010
oxygen to the tissues way better than our
own cells can.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.590
If that sounds far fetched, take this for
a spin.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.590
Papers in the journal ACS Nano and Physics
Today (among many others) from the last couple

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.480
of years use what researchers are calling
"DNA origami," to carry medication directly

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.690
to cancer cells.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.180
DNA origami is essentially a nano-engineered
"barrel" that can carry drugs or information

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.090
to a specific place, and release it!

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.430
Nanotechnology is getting better and better
and better…You know what else is getting

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.430
better?

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.430
Toyota!

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.510
Toyota has been doing some tinkering of their
own with the TRD line of Toyota Trucks.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.070
Enhanced to rule the off-road!
