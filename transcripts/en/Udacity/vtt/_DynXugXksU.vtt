00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.140
So we're going to define a special
kind of operator called a contraction

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.140
mapping, and we're going to say
an operator's a contraction mapping

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.470
if it has this property.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.510
So B is some operator, and it's mapping
value functions to value functions.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.910
If it's the case that for all value
functions, so all value functions F and

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.020
G, and some multiplicative factor
gamma which is less than 1.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.920
If it's the case that the distance
between B applied to F and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.750
B applied to G has to be smaller than or
equal to gamma times the original

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.600
distance between F and G, then we
say that B is a contraction mapping.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.910
It's causing things to get closer
together, tighter together.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.670
So this notation here is sometimes
called the infinity norm, the max norm,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.510
and all it's doing is saying,
this is a function of states and

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.730
actions, so which is the largest?

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.010
What's the largest state action
pair in terms of absolute value?

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's just saying,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.590
what's the maximum value that
the function Q can have?

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.420
&gt;&gt; Or that it currently has,
yeah that's right.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.790
So when we write F- G max
norm really what it's saying,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.430
what's the biggest difference
in Q values between F and G?

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.785
And this is corresponding Q values.

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:15.022
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:17.540
&gt;&gt; So F- G is saying what's the biggest

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.130
difference between these two Q
functions at any state action pair?

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.740
Whatever that largest difference is,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.890
we're going to multiply it by
something that makes it even smaller.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.870
And we're going to say that, for
it to be a contraction mapping,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.850
is has to be the case that,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.770
if you apply that mapping to F and you
apply that mapping to G, the distance

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.350
between the resulting functions is even
closer together than they started.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.370
&gt;&gt; And
that makes it a contraction map, okay.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah this is how we're going to
define contraction mapping, and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.860
this is going to give us all sorts of
nice properties, and it's also going to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.260
happen a lot in the kinds of operators
we get in reinforcement learning.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.120
&gt;&gt; So
just to make sure I have this right,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.310
since the infinity norm
finds the biggest value and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.030
here you define the difference between
two functions, at least the infinity

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.940
difference between two functions, being
wherever their greatest distance is.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.930
It's certainly the case that over time
as we apply this operator over and

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.430
over again, the point where their
maximum is, the state action pair where

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.690
their maximum is,
might change every time, right?

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.300
&gt;&gt; Right.
That's right.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.750
So this max norm is computing for
the specific

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.040
value function that it's given where
the biggest absolute value is.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.570
And that could be different on
this side of the equation from

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.370
this side of the equation.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.340
There is no reason that it needs to
be the same over and over again.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.060
And in fact when we're using B

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.330
to be a value iteration operator
it does tend to move around a lot.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.040
So you would expect it
to move around a bit,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.680
at least as you're going
through value space.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.202
However, let's not worry
about that quite yet,

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:50.040
let's actually do some
contraction mapping examples on

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.130
just scalar values where it's
really easy to reason about them.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.590
&gt;&gt; Okay,
yeah I think that would be cool.
