00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So congratulations.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You just made it through the Kalman filter class and the second homework assignment.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You've implemented Kalman filters,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
you learned a lot about Gaussians,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and you wrote your first vehicle tracking software. Congratulations.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That's actually really, really cool.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Next week, we'll talk about particle filters as yet another method for state estimation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It is very interesting and very fascinating.

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We're going to implement our first. See you next week in class.
