DAN GALPIN: I'm Dan
Galpin, here at GDD Europe

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.110
2017 for the Developer
Show, with Clare Bayley.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.970
Now, she's the
global Codelabs lead

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.770
for Google Developer Relations.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.096
Tell us about these Codelabs.

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:27.720
CLARE BAYLEY: Well,
Codelabs, the thing

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.920
you have to understand is that
they are the hands-on learning

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.040
component for all
of Google's content.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.580
So these labs were chosen
to specifically accompany

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.080
all of the sessions that
are happening here at GDD.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.929
They're a great way
for people on-site

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.220
to get inspired about something
and then go try it out.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.095
And they're also a really
good way for people

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:47.120
at home, or even
after the conference,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.370
to go and try something
out for themselves,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.410
because there's no better
way to learn something

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.550
than to actually do it.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.070
DAN GALPIN: What's the most
gratifying part about working

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.270
on this whole Codelab project?

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.410
CLARE BAYLEY: Seeing people
who come up at other events

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.660
and tell me that they learned
something from a Codelab

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.782
that they used.

00:01:03.782 --> 00:01:05.990
Or having people come up at
an event and tell me they

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.615
learned something
that blew their mind.

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:08.985
That's also really gratifying.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.610
DAN GALPIN: And if
you want to find out

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.070
more about all the great
Codelabs that we've had here,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.756
you can go to this
fabulous URL and try them

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:17.630
all out for yourself.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.243
There's some amazing,
amazing stuff to learn.

00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:23.415
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.240
DAN GALPIN: Tell us about PWAs
and what's going on with that.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.357
SAM DUTTON: OK, two
things with PWAs.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.440
I think we're getting these
great new capabilities

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.280
on the web.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.440
The combination of that
with the reach of the web,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.550
the low friction for users,
is really, really powerful.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.930
And with that, we're seeing
these beautiful experiences,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.470
stuff like Twitter Live,
which is fantastic.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.550
Incredible sites.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.701
And these really, really
small install sizes.

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:51.950
DAN GALPIN: So where do you
see the future of all this

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.926
at the moment?

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:53.800
SAM DUTTON: Well, OK.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.810
Some favorites of mine.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.040
I love the stuff that's to
do with media and images.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.160
So we've got a bunch
of really great media

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.330
APIs coming to the web.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.820
And then stuff
like image capture,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.620
for taking photographs and
controlling camera hard drives.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.256
It's like that tight integration
with the platform, the device,

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:10.130
the operating system.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.267
I love it.

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:14.676
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.590
DAN GALPIN: I'm here
with Sara Robinson,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.350
and Sara is a
developer advocate who

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.390
works with big data and machine
learning on Google Cloud

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.280
platform.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.789
What is your favorite of
their pre-trained APIs?

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.330
SARA ROBINSON: My
favorite would have

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.610
to be the Video Intelligence
API, which is actually

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.500
our newest of the
machine learning APIs.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.990
And what you can do with
that is you pass it a video,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.730
and it gives you
granular data on what's

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.771
happening in each scene
of your video along with,

00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:41.604
at a high level, it tells
you what the video is about.

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:43.590
SARAH CLARK: We did
a search of 10,000

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.520
jobs for senior and
intermediate-level developers

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.694
and analyzed them to figure
out all the core skills

00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:51.360
that the market's
looking for, and there

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.568
were some surprises in there.

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:55.227
DAN GALPIN: What are the
kinds of skills that you get?

00:02:55.227 --> 00:02:57.060
Give me some examples
of the kinds of skills

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.460
you would learn in order
to get the certification.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.570
SARAH CLARK: So a
lot of developers

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.611
tend to ignore accessibility,
but that turned out

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:04.140
to be very important.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.660
A lot of fundamental skills,
actually, are in there, too,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.720
because most of the hiring
managers these days are saying,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.640
well, I want you to
work without jQuery

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.740
or other supporting libraries.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.200
And so developers really had
to build a strong foundation

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.950
to do that.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.970
But we do go all the way up
into progressive web apps.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.440
DAN GALPIN: I hear that
there are some scholarships

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.420
that students can
get here in Europe.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.165
Tell me a little
bit more about that.

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:27.540
SARAH CLARK: So
Udacity is really

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.750
60,000 scholarships for
Europe, 30,000 for Android,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.990
30,000 for Web, and
the best way to get

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.954
that is to go to our website and
look at the certification page,

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:38.870
and we'll have the link
and the details there.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.195
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:43.454 --> 00:03:45.870
DANIELLE OSLER: People imagine
that tech and public policy

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.780
are kind of separate, and
public policy doesn't really

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.610
necessarily
influence technology.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.410
But policy makers are thinking
about this all the time.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.250
So we wanted to let them
know about, for example,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.320
the evolution of the
internet of things

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.624
and that space, and also
about Android fragmentation

00:04:00.624 --> 00:04:02.040
and how policy
makers are thinking

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.960
about that around the world.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.600
DAN GALPIN: Tell me about the
policy issues that are going

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.560
around the Internet of Things.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.101
I mean, I don't even feel like
there is any policy around it.

00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:11.405
Do you--

00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:13.530
DANIELLE OSLER: Well, it's
one of those spaces that

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.390
is really quickly evolving.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.490
And this is particularly
a good place

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.899
for developers to engage because
the space moves so fast that we

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.690
don't think that law will be
telling developers what they

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.190
should do, but
that developers are

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.400
going to be setting the norms
that policymakers will follow.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.514
And then what can we do
for security, generally?

00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:33.180
How do we think about
security, and what

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.060
should be put in place for
the plethora of IoT devices

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.340
that we don't even know where
they're going to go yet?

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.680
And how do we think
about security

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.550
if there are so many
different diverse devices that

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.360
are out there?
