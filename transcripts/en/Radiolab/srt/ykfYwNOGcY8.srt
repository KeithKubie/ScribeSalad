1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,160
Listening to radio lab radio from

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,070
W. N. Y. S. T. Yup. N.
N. P. R. Okay. Hello.

3
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:15,790
Hello? Hello. Hello. How are you?

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,440
We are super, super excited to
talk with you. Oh, same. And me,

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:23,690
I'm sorry about the delay and so, oh,
it's fine. No, it wasn't busy days.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,120
Life is crazy. Life is crazy. I know.
But uh, you were so enthusiastic,

7
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:32,320
so I just, I need to talk to
these guys. They really mean it.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,630
This is Alex Alexandre. Gemar Gundam.
Are you Norwegian all the way back?

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,120
Yeah. Typical Norwegian, you know,

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,150
if typical includes things like biking
in Sahara and climbing Everest and things

11
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:49,750
like that. He's kind of a,
a professional adventurer.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,740
And we got him into the studio because
he made a video last year on one of his

13
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:55,270
trips. I tell you this video,

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,410
it's maybe the most amazing
Internet video I have ever seen.

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,763
I think so too.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,430
So let me just set the
scene for you. Okay.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,060
What you see in the video is this
Guy Alex kind of moving along this,

18
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,920
he's on skis, this snowy snow
scape. Hmm. He's filming himself.

19
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,340
He's got the camera in his right hand.
Where is he exactly? Antarctica. Oh,

20
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:22,240
he's on a three month track to the
South Pole and back by himself.

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,570
And what he'd been doing is every
couple of days on his trip, you know,

22
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:29,110
every 200 kilometers. And so he
would bury stuff in the snow, some,

23
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,280
some fuel and uh, and sometimes a
little bit of gear that I didn't use.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,950
Was that just to lighten
your load? Yeah. You know,

25
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,820
cause every ounce of unneeded
weight has to go. So in this video,

26
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,390
it's date 86, almost
three months since I left.

27
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,770
That's three months of walking 10
hours a day and I lost almost 25 kilos.

28
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,840
55 pounds. He's exhausted.

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,973
Oh,

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,970
he's come upon his last cash.

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,390
So on the last cash where
this video is captured,

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,000
what you see is Alex Neil in the
snow start to dig about lockdown.

33
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm telling you that I'm quite hungry.

34
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,880
Whatever's in this last cash and the snow,

35
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,410
it's been three months since he buried it.

36
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:19,780
So I didn't really recall what was there.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,930
[inaudible] he helps it sound good.

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,760
So he digs up this bag of stuff,
starts rifling through it.

39
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,080
There's a it and [inaudible].
It's gasoline, some zinc ointment.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,930
It's just a mess.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,500
Nothing. It's pretty much all press.

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,640
Excuse me. [inaudible]

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,730
okay, but then, Yup.

44
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,500
Yeah,

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,570
yeah.

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,153
[inaudible]

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,250
he holds up.

48
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,530
She struggles devil back
of cheese doodles. Yeah.

49
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,880
Yeah. [inaudible]

50
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,330
then he throws it up in the air. Yeah.

51
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,670
[inaudible]

52
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,680
and then this is, this
is my favorite part.

53
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:24,450
He just freezes and he's staring
off into the distance. Almost like,

54
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,500
did that happen on red color?

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,750
Is it real? So he starts to dig some more

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,983
and then

57
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,723
bye bye.

58
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,370
[inaudible]

59
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,860
look, look. This time huge chocolate bar.

60
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:51,160
It's milk chocolate and then it's
just like he finds the mentos.

61
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,270
I find [inaudible]

62
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,680
more and more and more.

63
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,000
Have you ever been that happy in your
life? Well, I've been thinking about that.

64
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,090
How? When did you shout
last time you were so happy.

65
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,010
I think that's why we've been watching
this video over and over again because

66
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,060
none of us can remember.

67
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,660
It's like what stands between you and
that feeling is a really interesting

68
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:20,720
question. Yeah. It's a
free mounts with hunger.

69
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,151
Actually,

70
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:25,790
I think the reason I liked this video
so much is not just because he's happy.

71
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,100
He said he somehow stumbled
into this moment of perfection.

72
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,310
It's just like a perfect situation by
being so tired and so hungry and finding

73
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:41,240
such a stash of candy that he
had forgotten that he left.

74
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,860
He created a moment of just
absolute complete bliss.

75
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,953
[inaudible]

76
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,730
in this hour on Radiolab,

77
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,950
we're going to be searching for
moments like Alex had up in Antarctica.

78
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,710
We're going to be searching for
bliss, bliss of all different sorts,

79
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,480
perfect moments,

80
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,440
perfect worlds kind of blistered slips
right through your fingers and the kind

81
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:14,700
of bliss that just might last and last.

82
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,970
All right, we're going to
begin with a story that, uh,

83
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,980
kind of inspired this show.

84
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:28,320
We would have never done a
show about the word bliss,

85
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,420
where it not for the following
story, which is about a bliss. A,

86
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,610
what do you mean a battle? That'll
make sense in just a second.

87
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,010
A story comes from our producer Tim
Howard, and it begins with a box of tapes.

88
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,620
Uh, alright, so check it
out. This is in my office.

89
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:44,830
And you've got a rectangular
package here. What is,

90
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,660
what is a very old looking box?

91
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,050
Doesn't look like much. It's just about
like 15 cassettes. Tip Number six,

92
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,170
singing and playing to
friends in America. No, Yo.

93
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,010
Uh, okay. So this is Charles
Charles Casey yield bliss,

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,820
an amazing character. And
that's Richard Richard Juror.

95
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,960
He's a fellow who gave me the cassettes.
You as a friend of Charles. Yeah.

96
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,710
So these were just like sitting
in his attic or something, garage.

97
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,500
He looked like, I suppose a little gnome,

98
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,210
a little leprechaun almost
to live. He was short,

99
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,970
bald and laughter the whole time.

100
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,650
He was a lovable character. Simple
as that. This is my favorite one.

101
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,230
[inaudible] Nicholas. Yet we just like,

102
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,680
just explain why we're
talking about this guy. Sure.

103
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,810
Because these tapes tell an amazing
story about a guy who really embodied his

104
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:42,644
name

105
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,380
and he tried to save the world,

106
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,860
but ultimately just tried too hard

107
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,290
the donor would follow to avoid
to my life. Kay. [inaudible]

108
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,210
Hey, we can start the story here.

109
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,800
This is from a lecture that he gave
decades later. So the story goes,

110
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:04,780
it's 1908 and he's a little kid living
in what's now the Ukraine. Okay.

111
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,670
And His name is Carl blitz, not
terrace buss, not Charles Bliss,

112
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,390
Carl Blitz, B. L. I. T. Z.
That's his original name.

113
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,600
And a little Carl was fascinated by
a tales of discovering adventure.

114
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,910
My name is Erica Okrent.

115
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,270
Erica wrote about Charles Bliss in
this great book called in the land of

116
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:28,180
invented languages. Getting back
to the story one day, she says,

117
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,680
when Carl was 11,

118
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,740
a lecture came through town about some
polar expedition Kohler expedition to

119
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,830
explorers talking about their
track across the North Pole.

120
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,820
And he was so inspired by what he saw
and heard at that lecture that even

121
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:44,730
decades later he couldn't talk about it.

122
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,940
Um, my father took me
through this. I, she was me

123
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,930
without getting choked up.

124
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,790
[inaudible] my father took me to this
lecture and then I show ne who like warm

125
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,403
rose

126
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,700
[inaudible] and when all the people
got a kick into the ice and snow in on

127
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:12,170
almost [inaudible] this
full walk for a walk,

128
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,380
for in search of
knowledge. [inaudible] idea

129
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,850
as he tells it on those tapes. That
was the beginning of his big idea.

130
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,750
That was gonna change the
world. Fast forward a few years,

131
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,440
they came to Ghana after
the first girl. Wow.

132
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,650
Did end up going to the
Technical University of Vienna.

133
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,060
I was suddenly discovered to be the best
mandolin player in Australia and one

134
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,700
time I played with a full opera orchestra,

135
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,710
[inaudible] composer Francesca.
So those were the days

136
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,420
and then everything changed. In 1938

137
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,610
[inaudible] artist came to
town, Nazis came to town,

138
00:08:56,611 --> 00:09:01,611
he was sent to Depauw and then Buchenwald
you know the concentration camps,

139
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,860
one of those feelings
will be showing desire.

140
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,990
No, I mean go on. All around him.

141
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:12,200
People were being worked to
death or outright exterminated,

142
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,790
but his wife Claire was a
German Catholic with connections

143
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,640
and clear my goodbye, sluggish,

144
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,290
my mandolin and my guitar and into
the concentration came [inaudible].

145
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,210
I became so famous among the
notches. That's, for instance,

146
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:28,990
I block fear would come
into our, but I can say rich

147
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,470
[inaudible] and you could
say that it was [inaudible]

148
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,490
here in Buchenwald that Carl started
to develop his ideas about language,

149
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,940
about the ways that you can
manipulate words. For instance,

150
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,620
there was this one song that
all the prisoners saying, Yep,

151
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,220
Oh, who buys leads? One of the
status songs I can ever mean pad

152
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,970
the saddest lyrics in the
world. At a certain point,

153
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,220
Carl started to play around
with this song. You know,

154
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:55,710
he'd swap out some of the
sad lyrics for some jokes,

155
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,660
sing it for his fellow prisoners

156
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,790
and then laughed and laughed and laughed
and forgot for a few minutes that the

157
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:06,550
orange, the darkest and the
most terrible homes on air.

158
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,740
And on the flip side,

159
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,490
every evening the guards would
march all the prisoners outside,

160
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,490
force them to stand there in the
cold, in front of these loudspeakers,

161
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,870
make them listen to these speeches,

162
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,623
no

163
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,410
speeches of Hitler and
Gerbils screaming Nazi slogan.

164
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:25,960
[inaudible]

165
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,790
which means Germany above all.

166
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,570
No, no, no. Starting the race
back last year we weren't,

167
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,700
which [inaudible] which judge you mean?

168
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,230
But after about a year,

169
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,290
his wife somehow wrangled a British
visa for him and he gets out

170
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,020
and Kevin's shows dreadful times are
gone and now I can play here for you and

171
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:52,270
improvisation as it comes
into my mind. [inaudible]

172
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,070
in 1939 he went to Britain

173
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,430
and then got a job as
a manager of a factory,

174
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,260
but he arrived in England just as

175
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,360
[inaudible].

176
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,350
The blitz begins, the Germans start
to bomb every major city in England.

177
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,490
The noise that you hear at the moment
is the sound of the air raid siren.

178
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,150
And every time he'd introduce himself
to somebody new they they'd shutter.

179
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,050
That can't be your name. Yeah, because
of like blitzkrieg add that associate.

180
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,903
Yes.

181
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,050
Yeah, go ahead. I'll get a good bid.

182
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,820
There's name like blitz and so I
changed from the war, like [inaudible]

183
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,560
to the piece [inaudible]

184
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,660
that was how he became Charles Bliss.
Bliss has all the right associations,

185
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:41,100
so he went forward with the feeling of
that he was now bliss and would bring

186
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,220
happiness to the world.

187
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,230
And a year later he and his wife ended
up in China in Shanghai where there was a

188
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,630
big population of Xcel, Jews.

189
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,010
Shanghai was the only place
that would take them at that

190
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,560
time

191
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,530
and they're in China and that in China,

192
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,590
I got the opportunity of my lifetime
and now we come to his big idea.

193
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,970
I realized what I did not know that the
Chinese have a different way of writing.

194
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,370
He became enraptured by the
Chinese writing that he saw

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,080
the Chinese use symbols and each symbol
is a word and he writes about having

196
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:22,240
this epiphany when he saw
the Chinese symbol for man,

197
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,320
he saw that the Chinese written form
of man sort of looks like a man.

198
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,400
It looks like a sick freaking
man and it means man,

199
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,920
he doesn't even know what
the Chinese word for man is.

200
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,140
He doesn't know how to say
man, but that doesn't matter.

201
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,180
He is skipping the word and
going directly into the meaning.

202
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,030
So here was a way of
getting beyond language.

203
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,690
You could think of the word in any
language if you see it in the symbol.

204
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,210
And that was a revelation. Why? Well,

205
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,491
I mean,

206
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,510
think back to the concentration camps
when they were outside in front of those

207
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,210
loudspeakers listening to
Hitler's saying stuff like

208
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,790
Deutschland,

209
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,690
Uber, Alice, you know, Germany
above all that phrase [inaudible]

210
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,130
Charles knew that it
actually predated the Nazi.

211
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,360
That was cool a hundred
years earlier in 1848

212
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,030
and originally it was meant as a rallying
cry to bring together all of these

213
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,590
separate principalities.

214
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,240
You see the robot barrier,
the Kingdom of structure

215
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,150
that spoke German, but
these were not one country.

216
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,240
So when they said Deutschland
numerology, it meant university

217
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,250
unified Germany,

218
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,620
the nation above the states. Oh, suit
wasn't necessarily an aggressive thing.

219
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:34,920
Yeah,

220
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,680
no, but that's good to turn this around.

221
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,700
Hitler changed the meaning instead
of the nation above all states.

222
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,350
He changed it to the nation.

223
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,180
Never seen conventional. The word bubble,

224
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,660
all other nations. So
you see what happened,

225
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:53,230
this phrase that started meaning
one thing. Unification. Yeah.

226
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,470
Became the opposite. Yeah.
This is what the Nazis did.

227
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,040
Tools works nice.

228
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:05,070
It would bend words to obscure the truth
of what they were doing. Extermination.

229
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,030
They'd call it solution. By
doing that. As he saw it,

230
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,270
they were able to convince
good, same people,

231
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:15,570
his neighbors to go along
with the genocide. [inaudible]

232
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,430
then I realized that trenching must
be done to make language more to it,

233
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:22,230
to nature.

234
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,030
Words were the problem. Words made people
do cruel things to each other. Okay.

235
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,690
Then I society apart, words
were dangerous instruments.

236
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,000
They caused violence. They cause wars.

237
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,770
So when he saw the Chinese symbol for
man, he thought this might be the answer,

238
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,930
and the idea came up to me that I would
should invent symbols like the Chinese

239
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:43,480
symbols,

240
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,370
but even clearer [inaudible] simple and
pictorial that even children can read

241
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:48,680
them.

242
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,660
If he could sit down and work it out.

243
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,830
You look at the symbol and
know what it meant instantly,

244
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,480
regardless of what language you spoke,

245
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,780
you wouldn't even need words which
he felt could be manipulated.

246
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,340
You could just have the symbol and get
straight to the truth of the manner and

247
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:07,950
the way he saw it. Right off the bat,
you'd have all of these benefits. Wrench,

248
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,380
Mindan, Finnish, English.

249
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,530
When an Estonian language
barriers would be out the window.

250
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,570
Everything from traffic accidents
to health problems could be avoided.

251
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,120
He thought if his symbol
system would just be adopted.

252
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,950
He had this vision that
high level political and
commercial negotiations would

253
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:26,210
be done in symbols.

254
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Did he say anything as grand as like or
wouldn't happen constantly and even of

255
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:32,234
course

256
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,920
he reckon Hitler wouldn't have happened
basically that if the German people had

257
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:41,420
understood the symbols, they wouldn't
have copped gerbils propaganda. Yeah.

258
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,480
That's a pretty tall order, but
it did seem to be what he thought.

259
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,520
Everything could be cured by this system.

260
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,640
He's the biggest dreamer ever. Yeah.
How did he go about doing this?

261
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,620
He started working out with the
basic lines and shapes would be,

262
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,280
he also wanted to make sure you
could produce it with a typewriter,

263
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:02,330
so it had to be a limited set of
shapes out of which everything could be

264
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,223
created.

265
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,120
Okay. So he works on it for
seven years, seven years,

266
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,530
and he comes up with that.
Wow. That is a big way.

267
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,570
This massive book called list
symbolics, semantic Ology,

268
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,200
illogical writing for an
illogical world that says it all,

269
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,650
where he explains the logic of
his system. For example here,

270
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:25,520
here's a symbol for sword, which
looks exactly like a sword.

271
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,500
And then the sword plus a forward
Arrow means attack. I buy it.

272
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,500
And then if you see a symbol for sword
and another symbol for sword and they're

273
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:35,790
cross, that means war.

274
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,500
So that's the idea that you take these
basic elemental symbols and combine them.

275
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,270
Exactly. All right. Here's another one.

276
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,760
This symbol here is like the top half
of a circle, like a little rainbow,

277
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:51,200
but just one line that means mind, mind,
it looks like the top of his skull. Ah.

278
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Now if I were to take that symbol from
mind and I were to go like this or to put

279
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,790
inside it, the question
mark, that means, um,

280
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,230
I don't know or I have no doubt.
And, and there are also, you know,

281
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:10,730
ways to indicate verbs and adjectives
and first person, second person,

282
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,350
the past, the future.

283
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,530
But kind of the one thing that it did
that no other language or symbol system or

284
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:20,290
anything has attempted to do,
at least as far as I know,

285
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,090
is that it would make clear
when something was, um, well,

286
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,850
he called the human evaluation,
you know, basically an opinion.

287
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,430
And what you would do
is you put this little,

288
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,600
this Little v symbol and you put it
above this symbol and y, y v. Well,

289
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:37,321
because you know,

290
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:41,400
a v is balanced on a point and
it's unstable at wobbles to him.

291
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:44,100
That represents opinion's
human evaluations.

292
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:47,580
Anything that comes out in
the mind or take metaphors

293
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,190
[inaudible]

294
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,960
four as he says, you must put up
[inaudible] to alert the reader.

295
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,060
Do not take this. Literally stop at that
for a head. Not exactly bulletproof,

296
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:03,000
but I can, I can see
the, the thinking there.

297
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,080
I actually think it's pretty impressive
and okay, so what happens next?

298
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,830
Well after he finishes this and he and
his wife are living in Australia at the

299
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:15,750
time, they spent all their savings on
producing this book and sent it out to

300
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,790
professors, government officials, heads
of state, something like 6,000 people.

301
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,530
And they waited for the orders
to start rolling in and um,

302
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,090
no response from anybody.

303
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,490
And then they had nothing. [inaudible]

304
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,100
I can't say. I didn't
see that coming. Yeah.

305
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,980
And with great disappointment,

306
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,750
Charles went to work as a welder and yeah,

307
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,730
factory, the General Motors.

308
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:52,930
Holden's he was working on the
production line almost as a robot.

309
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,380
And a year later his wife died. You know,

310
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,390
he had fought in world war one. He
had been in a concentration camp.

311
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:04,650
He had lived in exile, but he says
this was the lowest point of his life

312
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,440
until one day, 1971 this, as he said,

313
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,990
this letter floated onto his desk.

314
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,910
Yeah.

315
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,660
With this picture of this
beautiful dimpled child,

316
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,920
proudly using his symbols. Yeah.

317
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:30,010
It was a poster, a poster,
a poster. This is Shirley,

318
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:35,011
Shirley McNaughton and at the time she
was a nurse at a place called D o c c c

319
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,380
the Ontario crippled children's center
and named that we were very happy to

320
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:44,110
leave behind us and they've
since changed in the name.

321
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:49,111
I started there in 1968 and surely was
part of this group of teachers and nurses

322
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,040
who worked with these kids who
suffered from cerebral palsy.

323
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,360
If you have cerebral palsy,

324
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,080
it's the motor control from
the brain that's been affected,

325
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,580
which meant that they had trouble moving
their arms or legs and even in some

326
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:06,010
cases they couldn't speak.

327
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,420
They couldn't form words and then
a film that was made of this class.

328
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,460
Ah, you see these young kids,

329
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,420
children from five to seven all sitting
in wheelchairs and they're watching the

330
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:23,100
teacher. Oh,

331
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,060
she talks to them and you
hear them try to talk to her,

332
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,830
but they can't. These kids
had no way to communicate

333
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,140
and they learn how to read.

334
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,070
They could if you knew what they were
understanding and they have no way to

335
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,690
communicate that to you.

336
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,530
The only thing all these kids had were
pictures that they could point at.

337
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,850
They had a picture of a toilet
picture of food, a picture of a drink,

338
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,430
a of a bad, they were limited
to that kind of communication.

339
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,080
But I knew they were bright. But if they
couldn't move and they couldn't speak,

340
00:20:56,081 --> 00:21:01,000
how would you know? My uh, insight on
that was the twinkle in their eyes.

341
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,890
But she says a lot of doctors and nurses
at the time thought I was crazy that

342
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,650
there really wasn't much going on
inside these kids' heads. You know,

343
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:12,160
they thought I was projecting
into the children what she needed.

344
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,050
She said was a way to get through to them.

345
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,080
And so one day she was at the library
with a colleague and they come across this

346
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,590
dusty old volume that had
never been checked out. Called,

347
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,370
you guessed it with symbol likes. And
what did you first think when you saw it?

348
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,440
Oh boy, can I get back to the group?

349
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:33,430
How fast can I get back to the group
with this exactly what we need.

350
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,440
So do you remember what the first
symbols were? I think it was, I you,

351
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,490
I looked kind of like a
standing person. Upright line,

352
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,030
small horizontal line at the base.
Yeah, next to it, the number one,

353
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,770
which means first person you is the same
symbol but with a number two for second

354
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:51,160
person.

355
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,140
And then they had to have a verb and
it was lung heart with an air threat.

356
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,320
So now they've got a sentence. I love you.

357
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:01,670
Uh,

358
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,120
one of our mothers as the happiest moment
she's ever had with her child was when

359
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,290
her child came home and said,
I love you. You know, so

360
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,250
surely. And her staff
started to add more symbol.

361
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,990
They caught on and pretty soon they'd
created this giant laminated chart.

362
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,400
It had I and you and he, she, we and they,

363
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,870
then it had mother, father,
grandma, grandpa, doctor,
nurse, teacher, therapist,

364
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,760
postman, environment, library, dentist.
Eventually they added adjectives, happy,

365
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:37,590
sad and frustrated. All the verbs
who had loved and like, and hey,

366
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:39,960
launch ne understand.

367
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Pretty soon the kids started to do
amazing things with simple combinations.

368
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:50,430
They started to improvise. Surely
remembers asking one kid, Terry Martin,

369
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:53,220
what did you want to be refer Halloween?

370
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,660
Terry pointed first at the symbol for
creature, a creature, not a person.

371
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,690
Then he pointed it assemble for drinks
than blood ned night creature who drinks

372
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:07,090
blood at night. Right. You
want it to be of empire. Ah,

373
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,970
he spelled a new word.

374
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,700
It sounds like an explosion
with these kids. It was.

375
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,010
It was for the first time.

376
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:21,011
She says she could actually talk
to them like know who they were.

377
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,800
Yeah. You've got to know who the
leaders were in the classroom.

378
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,640
Those who wanted to help
others, those who copied others.

379
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,140
And it was around then that she and the
other teachers decided to send Charles

380
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,980
Bliss. That letter.

381
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,690
We were sharing our excitement for
this gift he'd given to the children.

382
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,360
You know, he was in Australia,
he was an elderly man.

383
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:45,020
We had no thought that he would
come and visit us, you know,

384
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,100
didn't enter our mind. But
Charles Bliss, he was delighted.

385
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,600
Very, very good.

386
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,290
He had battled for so long for
recognition and now he had it.

387
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:57,850
[inaudible]

388
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,100
mortgages his house and flies over,

389
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,590
paid my mandoline and told him jokes and
only dances around and kisses everybody

390
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:10,480
a few passively than
laughter. I love that. Hello?

391
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,280
You had long conversations
with the kids in symbols,

392
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,990
right? He was very happy
about the children. Joy,

393
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,623
joy,

394
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,150
okay. But somewhere along
the way, he notices something

395
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,150
surely, surely, and the
teachers had begun to

396
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,790
[inaudible]

397
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,350
augment the system.

398
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,030
They'd be going to add their own
symbols such as the opposite,

399
00:24:39,031 --> 00:24:43,590
meaning symbol. This allowed the kids to
take one of blitzes, standard symbols,

400
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:48,530
and just invert the meaning, opposite
of happy, sad, opposite of up, down,

401
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,170
opposite of [inaudible] to her.

402
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,940
This would effectively double the number
of adjectives which would be great for

403
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:58,530
the kids and we developed rules for how
to combine symbols for how to be more

404
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:02,280
precise with the symbols. She threw in
some new pronouns that were missing.

405
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:06,300
The difference between he
and him and his. In short,

406
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,890
I would make the adaptations I needed
to make from the very beginning.

407
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:14,190
We were using it to meet
the children's needs,

408
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,630
their specific needs. And of course
that is not what he had in his mind.

409
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,030
He wanted a system that was universal.

410
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,230
Every change that she made
created like a separate dialect,

411
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,740
he would get very emotional about
it. So when he got back to Australia,

412
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,770
he started writing all these
letters basically taking
issue with her changes and

413
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,560
her failure to understand how
his system works. Meanwhile,

414
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,660
thanks to surely worried about blesses
symbols had spread way beyond Canada too.

415
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,220
France, Sweden, Israel,

416
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,190
Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe. Yeah.
And then Argentina, Brazil,

417
00:25:56,191 --> 00:26:00,060
Finland, Iceland, Italy, Bermuda, Guam,
Japan, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands,

418
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:02,910
Hungary, Switzerland, Venezuela,
Madagascar, Yugoslavia.

419
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,860
It's spread to all these places. Yeah.

420
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,980
And in each place,

421
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,120
the symbols when inevitably get tweaked
to suit that country, for example,

422
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:14,270
in Israel because the writing
goes from right to left. Yeah.

423
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,290
The bliss symbols went
from right to left. Uh,

424
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,230
but what really pained him the most,

425
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,260
what really got him was that these
teachers were using his symbols as a step

426
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:27,140
toward English or French or
German or Hebrew or whatever.

427
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,580
It was just a way to get the
kids to their native languages.

428
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,890
The teachers always saw
it the way they saw it.

429
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:37,240
You start the kids on bliss and then
you introduce reading and letters and

430
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:38,830
eventually they're fully literate.

431
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,590
At which point you don't
need the bliss symbols.

432
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,460
This was the ultimate insult him.

433
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,970
They were using his system to bring
these kids back to the very thing that he

434
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:55,290
was trying to get everyone
away from evil words. Yeah,

435
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,180
why not? Why not?

436
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,410
If I tried to explain it to them, they
don't want donation to me, then look,

437
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:06,720
show me. What should I do?
I do that. I don't know.

438
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,870
I don't know

439
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,640
and it's right about this point in the
story that you start to hear a different

440
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,980
Charles Place.

441
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,670
Shannon, if Norton has

442
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,770
[inaudible] has been
better than [inaudible].

443
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,510
Is he saying perverted? Yeah,

444
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,300
she smiles. She be guys. She she lies.

445
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,540
He kept sending Shirley and the other
teachers letters and the letters got

446
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:33,140
angrier and angrier. This was
not what the language was for.

447
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:37,100
This was a universal language that had
nothing to do with spoken language.

448
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,980
You are ruining my system,
you are abusing it.

449
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,850
And eventually he decided to take matters
into his own hands and he traveled

450
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:48,440
back to Canada and he started going to
the various centers where the kids were

451
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:52,320
using his symbols and saying
horrible things about me. Uh,

452
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,430
and getting them very upset.
That's when I got upset.

453
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:59,780
I got upset when he got them upset. Not
long after Shirley receives a summer

454
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,630
I have taken to court.
Oh she, she in the beach?

455
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,340
He sued them. Yup.

456
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,970
I added two war dependents.
Mrs Chilling, ignored

457
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,290
on the tapes. Even suggest that
he's going to have Shirley put away,

458
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,860
put a whole life for life. Wow.

459
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,320
Why was he so upset with
her in particular? Well,

460
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:22,310
because by this time she'd started
the international organization,

461
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,400
B C Bliss Symbol,

462
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:29,410
communications international and she
felt like this was a total unique and

463
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,670
powerful tool which could,

464
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:36,230
could and should transform lives around
the world and more teachers needed to

465
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:39,140
adopt it. Definitely.
What was he asking for?

466
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:42,470
Did he wanted us to use
the symbols in his way?

467
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,710
So in 1975 the BCI won a license agreement
to use the symbols in the workbooks

468
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:50,870
for the kids. But Charles Bliss,

469
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,840
they should all be part, didn't
give up, they should all be powered.

470
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,940
He published endless tirades and sent
them out to anybody who is listening

471
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,930
and hopefully to educate
or oppose you to patients.

472
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,290
Or is the British chambers just all in all

473
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:12,510
this went on for over a decade and the
administration of the program or surely

474
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,190
was working was desperate
to make him go away.

475
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,530
He had basically destroyed the program.

476
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,740
And so in 1982 he and the BCI
finally come to an agreement.

477
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,550
Okay.

478
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,630
It was a financial settlement
that satisfied him.

479
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,740
What was the financial
settlement? $160,000.

480
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:33,983
Wow.

481
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,131
You know,

482
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:40,210
we were a little program in the basement
of the Ontario cripple children's

483
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,810
center. We were, you
know, just a classroom.

484
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,410
Wow. That,

485
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,320
so a guy who wanted to save the world
ends up robbing a bunch of disabled kids.

486
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,300
I mean, that's kind of putting it crudely,

487
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:59,380
but that's how this how it
feels basically. That's the,

488
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,773
yeah,

489
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:02,520
no.

490
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,920
Did the symbols ever go anywhere? Well,

491
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,380
there was a lot of excitement
about it in the beginning,

492
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,480
but it never spread very far.

493
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,130
It's used now at a few
schools in Canada and Sweden,

494
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:16,060
a couple other places. Uh,

495
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,550
but it never went very far because he
was constantly taking it down at every

496
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:21,384
turn.

497
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:23,910
[inaudible]

498
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,630
but here's what I find
most surprising. When I,

499
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,490
when I talked to Shirley, she didn't
have any bitterness toward him.

500
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:38,290
Not even in the worst moments when
we were having the final legal,

501
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,010
um, action.

502
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,360
We'd go through that in the morning
and as the layers were packing up their

503
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:47,930
papers, Charles Bliss would reach
across the table and he'd say,

504
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:52,790
surely will you help me? And so she'd
go to lunch with him, sit with him,

505
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,480
and then he asked me if I would come
to his hotel that night and put the

506
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,810
eardrops in his ears. And
I did that every night.

507
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,530
He was involved with this thing.
That's just the way it was.

508
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,400
And it wasn't just that she takes care
of people for a living, you know, she,

509
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:12,550
she felt and still feels that Charles
Bliss had created something really new in

510
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:18,440
the world. She even told me that
when she uses blessed symbols,

511
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,360
she actually thinks differently.
Yes, definitely. Really, definitely.

512
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,650
What's different? Oh, I just think
so much more about what a word means.

513
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,570
And it, it's, it's like
poetry in its purest form.

514
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,060
Um, I'm playing with stained glass
down here in my retirement and you can,

515
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,391
you know,

516
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:46,391
you can just take the symbols and put
them into one composite and they say

517
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:53,240
things that only art
can say. It's beautiful.

518
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,190
They transmit a meaning
that is beyond any words.

519
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,873

Bliss is one day in which I do not have
to interact with another human being.

527
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,070
Bliss is political ignorance.

We are back this spring with an
all new season of our hit podcast.

558
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,230
Tuto Queen's from WWE
NYC studio. It's comedy.

It's conversation with your fave celeb.

560

It's me and Jeff telling tribe stories
about my bought up session. Gross. Dude,

561
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:00,960
why are you even bringing
that up right now? Anyway,

562
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,780
this season you'll hear from John Ham.
Drew Bronson did. Kitaro gave her union.

563
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,590
Oh my pits are sweating. Just
thinking about damn girl.

Wait, wait, wait. Don't
shoot. Let me just hit record.

567
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,880
Okay. And now, what were you saying
spontaneously a moment ago? Hey,

568
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,610
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab, and today bliss.

569
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,850
And in our last segment,

570
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:34,900
we met a guy who dreamt of a perfect world
where words can never muck things up.

571
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,450
It got a little carried away.
Yeah. So let's forget about dreams.

572
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,650
Now we're going to look for perfection
right here in the physical world. Okay.

573
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,110
So, so, so this story, and we're
going to do it with a perfect person.

574
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,990
Latif Nasser, it begins with
a, with a birthday present.

575
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,140
It's February 9th,

576
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,970
1886 miles outside the tiny town of
Jericho, Vermont. And we're on a farm,

577
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,710
a family farm, uh,

578
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,830
the Bentley family farm and the scrawny
15 year old kid named Wilson gets a

579
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:08,280
microscope from his mother. So
it's February and it's Vermont.

580
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:12,360
And so naturally, the first thing this
kid does is he grabs a handful of snow,

581
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:18,040
picks out a single flake, and he
puts it under the microscope. And

582
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,600
what he sees is, is the most
beautiful thing he's ever seen.

583
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,180
It's is ethereal and, and perfect.

584
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,760
He calls them masterpieces
as as if they're these, you
know, great works of art.

585
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,300
He calls him that in his 15
year old diary. Looking back,

586
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:37,510
he talked about that moment and
what he was thinking when he,

587
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,570
when he sort of first saw
it, but obviously, you know,

588
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:43,240
within minutes or maybe even seconds,

589
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,960
these masterpieces just disappeared

590
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,310
without leaving any evidence that
they, that they ever existed.

591
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,270
They just sort of evaporate.
Huh. And as he remembers it, he,

592
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:59,060
he sort of decides then in there that
he's going to dedicate his whole life to,

593
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,660
to documenting these masterpieces.

594
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,870
Otherwise no one will ever
know they even existed.

595
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,790
He's gonna spend his whole
life documenting snowflakes.
Yeah. It's a good life,

596
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,270
Jed. And it pays well. Right.
That's exactly what his father said.

597
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:14,530
His father thought he was, you know,

598
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,220
he was just was lazy and didn't want
to do the farming chores as far as his

599
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,740
milk, the goats. And he goes, now
the beauty, the beauty. Right, right.

600
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,530
And apparently he was a real, he
was really good at digging potatoes,

601
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,270
but he just sort of was so busy futzing
around with his microscope that he,

602
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,550
you know, I don't like this kid,
I don't like him. The friends,

603
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,930
your work ethic so fed up it's neck. So,

604
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,790
so he takes his microscope and he,

605
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:42,350
he moves it to this unheated
woodshed behind the house. Um, and,

606
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:47,320
and he starts sketching
these snowflakes, right?

607
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,160
And while he's sketching,

608
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,460
you can't even breathe because he was
worried that his breath would melt his

609
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,780
specimen. So he's sort of
holding his breath and, and, and,

610
00:37:58,781 --> 00:38:00,100
and drawing these, you know,

611
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:03,340
these extremely complex crystals
that can take you maybe, you know,

612
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,850
maybe an hour to draw, but, but depending
on the temperature, the humidity,

613
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,800
the size of the crystal he had at
most, he had five minutes, right

614
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,450
at the end of that, he, he looks
at the mall and he's not satisfied.

615
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,120
He just felt like he
wasn't doing it justice.

616
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:22,000
You know what he calls these
like miracles of beauty.

617
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,680
So Bentley persuades his mother who
persuades his father to buy him a camera.

618
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,820
Whey is I go, wait, wait, wait,
wait. 1880, we're in February,

619
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,830
1880 have we entered into,

620
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,490
in the era of picture taking just
just and for a farming family,

621
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:40,690
this was like a lot of money, but
they buy it for him and he gets it.

622
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,880
Any sort of Jerry rigs it to
the microscope. And at age 19,

623
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,970
Wilson Bentley is the first person ever
in history to photograph a snowflake.

624
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,320
Okay. I'm going to cue the snowflake
celebration in secure, right

625
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,450
[inaudible]

626
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,280
from then on, basically for the
next 46 winters until he died.

627
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,890
Every, every snowfall,

628
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,450
every blizzard is a Bentley would stand
in the doorway of his little shack, uh,

629
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,550
holding out a wooden tray, uh, with,

630
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,710
with thick mittens cause
you would wear these,

631
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,470
they're almost like oven mitts
to, to, to make sure that his,

632
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,500
none of his body heat
would kind of leak out and,

633
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:23,690
and inadvertently melt any of the snow.

634
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,320
So He'd sort of stand there and sort
of give it a once over with his eye.

635
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,500
If nothing was promising.
He, he basically had a,

636
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,290
a Turkey feather and he would sort of
just wipe it clean with this Turkey

637
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,770
feather until he did find something
you liked. And then he would,

638
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,790
he would take this tiny little wooden
rod and he would just certain really

639
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:44,900
delicately tap the center of the
crystal and like really, really,

640
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:47,970
really gently lifted off and
then transfer it onto the,

641
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,070
onto a glass slide so that he could put
it under the microscope and he could

642
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,490
photograph it. Over
the course of his life.

643
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,310
He'd basically photographed about
5,000 snow crystals for his whole life.

644
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:03,230
He was just a farmer doing
this kind of as a hobby. Uh,

645
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,750
but he sold copies of these photos for
5 cents a pop to places like Harvard and

646
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:11,380
the British Museum and the u s
weather bureau, research journals,

647
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:14,800
magazines like nature and
national geographic. And I mean,

648
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,490
you've already seen the photos, like
you've gotten them on a Christmas card,

649
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,040
they're on your like ugly Christmas
sweater in your closet somewhere. Um,

650
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,210
we're throwing a shirt with
them on right now. Yeah.

651
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,170
Um, they're, they're, they're,
they're everywhere. They're beautiful,

652
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:33,350
symmetrical, really clean. And Complex.

653
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,790
A lot of the greatest scientists who
ever lived like Descartes and Kepler and

654
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:38,180
Hook,

655
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:43,180
they all tried to sketch and draw and
kind of capture the essence of snowflakes.

656
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:48,341
But none of them could do it as well as
this one obsessive loaner from Jericho,

657
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:52,670
Vermont, whose photos were perceived to
be kind of more faithful to nature than,

658
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,090
than, than anybody else.
But that was until, um,

659
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,123
this,

660
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,910
the guy came on the scene,

661
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,380
this German guy who the other
Guy Germanic theme music. Yes.

662
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,103
Yes.

663
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,640
[inaudible] he was a German
meteorologist named Gustaf helmet stuff.

664
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,740
Hell man. Not of the mayonnaise
fame, I don't believe. Um,

665
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:22,370
I haven't even thought of that
actually. It's a helmet. Is this a,

666
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:25,050
is he a contemporary of
Bentley? Yeah, he is.

667
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,800
And he's working on his own book
about weather and so he hires a,

668
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:33,801
a kind of a micro photographer who's
another German guy named Newhouse.

669
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,040
Mike Grace is a very teeny
photographer who he kept on his desk.

670
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,330
He's a microscopic himself and he
just takes normal size photographs.

671
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,610
Anyhow,

672
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,180
he hires this guy in and they take a
bunch of photos using basically similar

673
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,700
technology camera and I'm
like, are scope essentially.

674
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,230
But what they find is totally different.

675
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,040
They do not find the, the,

676
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,250
the elegance and metrical ideal snow
crystals that Bentley found that the

677
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:06,890
crystals they found were like flawed,

678
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,660
lopsided, usually like broken.
And the way I think of it,

679
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,090
it was like a Martian who had only ever
seen like glossy fashion magazines had

680
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:21,200
just been given some like random family
photo album and it was like, Oh wow,

681
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,880
this is, they're not so pretty. Like
these are kind of ugly, you know,

682
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,460
humans, humans, they're not
all symmetrical. These Germans,

683
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,870
they, they basically
called them out. They,

684
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,810
they basically thought
Bentley was a fraud.

685
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,500
There was a particular way that
Bentley prepared his photographs.

686
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:44,000
What he would do is he would use a pen
knife to scrape the negative around the

687
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:44,721
snow crystal,

688
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:48,290
which is what gave it that kind of Nice
black background because he thought it

689
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,620
would kind of put it in maybe
starker relief. Um, and, and,

690
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,880
and the German guys said that's it's,

691
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,280
it's misleading that it kind of
mutilates the snowflakes, um, away.

692
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:03,281
So he's photographing these snowflakes
and then significantly messing with the

693
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:06,170
photograph. Exactly right. Exactly right.

694
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,760
So here's a quote from the photographer
who said, quote a, in many images,

695
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:14,060
Bentley did not limit himself
to improving the outlines.

696
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,260
He let his knife play deep inside the
heart of the crystals so that fully

697
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:22,610
arbitrary figures emerged.
So he said, oh, I don't know.

698
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:26,360
That doesn't seem so no longer a
candidate, is it? Well, that's,

699
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,040
that's the question. So then, but then,

700
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,740
so they basically lobbed this and
that this is kind of going into these

701
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,850
journals, but Bentley basically
launches a counter attack.

702
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,820
And what he says is that in
fact those guys are wrong,

703
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,170
that not correcting
your photographs was an,

704
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,280
he used this word like perverse to him.

705
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,490
Why wouldn't you remove specks
of dust or other imperfections?

706
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:53,690
Why photograph of a broken snowflake
when you could photograph a complete one?

707
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,640
So this is a quote from Bentley. He said
a true scientist, which is above all,

708
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:02,270
to have his photographs as
true to nature as possible.

709
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:07,070
And if retouching will help in this
respect than it is fully justified.

710
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,160
So he thought his retouched snowflakes
were truer than the normal ones.

711
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,180
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

712
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,570
That the scientist is supposed to
be kind of this very experienced,

713
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,310
almost like a sage who is seen every
different variation on a snowflake,

714
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,870
but can sort of bring that
all together in one drawing,

715
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:30,530
one sketch, one photograph,
and that's the true snowflake.

716
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,560
So if I brought him a slightly
gloppy snowflake and said,

717
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,030
look,

718
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,830
this is what fell on my nose and this
is a true snowflake because it actually

719
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,820
fell from the sky and it's, you
know, it was an [inaudible] enhanced

720
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,370
you. He would say that Robert, you're,
you're an amateur. Like this is,

721
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,110
this is not good work. You know, this is
an aberration. This is an abnormality.

722
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:58,650
Why would you choose to kind of highlight
an abnormality as opposed to kind of

723
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:03,330
this, this true ideal snowflake,
you know, and does that one exist?

724
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,790
I mean, that's the key question for me.

725
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:08,700
Like does the ideal
snowflake exist in nature?

726
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,310
You think there are such
things I exquisitely beautiful.

727
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:13,240
I would like to think that there are no,

728
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,740
so I think if my facts are right,

729
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,120
the world's snowflake expert is
actually in, in Pasadena. Califia

730
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:26,490
all right. Check, check,
check, check, check in.

731
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,740
Can Sunny Southern California.
Yeah, I'm wearing a tee shirt.

732
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,800
I have sunscreen lathered and I am going
to talk to the world authority on snow.

733
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,460
How are you? His name is Ken Lee Brecht.

734
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:48,680
He's up a professor of physics
at cal tech. He is in a way,

735
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:52,490
he's like the modern day Wilson Bentley
because he takes a ton of of snowflake

736
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:56,750
pictures taken about 10,000 now. And uh,

737
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,180
and he actually makes snowflakes.
Oh yeah. Artificially. Okay.

738
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,090
Wow. So this is a giant tank. This
is a nitrogen here. Nevermind that.

739
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,440
And to get to your question about
the ideal snowflake, a few things.

740
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:16,580
So number one, they're a
bajillion different kinds,

741
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,700
dendritic crystal, stellar dendrites,

742
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:22,990
needles and columns and hollow
columns and a sector of plates.

743
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,380
That's one thing. The second thing
is that snowflakes are never static.

744
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,220
They're never one thing. So what every
single moment as it falls to the earth,

745
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,630
it's either growing or shrinking depending
on the kind of trajectory through the

746
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:38,060
different pockets of
weather as it's moving down.

747
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,890
So there is no real platonic ideal
form of a snowflake because it's,

748
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,890
it's, it's so influx.

749
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,350
I mean there's no such thing
as a perfect snowflake,

750
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,880
but that doesn't stop only brag
from, from looking, you know,

751
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:55,280
I tried up in Tahoe and Japan, Vermont,

752
00:46:55,281 --> 00:46:59,720
Michigan travels all over the world
looking for Bentley's perfect flakes.

753
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,760
I'll ask, I've been to Alaska, Sweden,

754
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:05,930
but my favorite spot is northern Ontario
little town called Cochran population

755
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:10,040
5,487. So where do you go in
Cochran? Do you just, just anywhere.

756
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,050
They're just falling all over the
place. Mostly it's the, it's the uh,

757
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,060
parking lot of my, my hotel besides,
there's a lot of waiting involved.

758
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,420
It only really snows
well about once a week.

759
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:24,110
Even then things have to be goldilocks
perfect. If the clouds are too high,

760
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,860
then they evaporate a
little on the way down.

761
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:31,330
They look pretty or if the clouds too
light or too heavy, that's about two.

762
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,460
And a lot of times the temperature is
wrong. If you want those Christmas cards,

763
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,080
supermodel snowflakes, uh,

764
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,400
you need to have exactly minus 15
that's five degrees Fahrenheit.

765
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,700
You need to have high humidity,

766
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:47,080
not so much wind so that they'll putter
down slowly and have more time to grow.

767
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,290
But every once in awhile, I mean,
when the conditions are right,

768
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:55,390
you'd go outside all hopeful and
dissipating and it's like, oh crap,

769
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:56,830
there's nothing garbage at here.

770
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:01,180
So you back go back inside and read some
more email and you come back a half an

771
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,710
hour later, nope, still lousy and half
hour later, nope, still allows it.

772
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:06,121
And you know,

773
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:08,770
you do this for hours and then all
of a sudden they'll get really good

774
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:14,410
[inaudible] just start there
and frantically trying to
collect as many as I can.

775
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,800
Well, one of the things I like
to think about this is, you know,

776
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:22,801
here I am with my little piece of
cardboard in the middle of a continent is

777
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,940
snowing on time.

778
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:30,100
And so I am catching some incredibly
small number of these things for a brief

779
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:33,100
period and, and getting
some really cool pictures.

780
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:34,540
And so you kind of wonder what the,

781
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,340
what else is out there
and what are you missing?

782
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,350
I mean imagine just all the beautiful
little works of art that are just falling

783
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:45,070
down totally unnoticed and
then they just disappear.

784
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,010
I mean stuff that is far
prettier than, you know,

785
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,260
the pictures I have cause
they're out there, you know,

786
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,710
they're out there statistically
they are out there and so you know,

787
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:58,570
there's just an awful lot
of really gorgeous things.
It's just are like you say,

788
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:02,260
they're just totally a femoral and
you'll never see them and they're falling

789
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,790
constantly. So you sort of want to
just stop the world and you know,

790
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,653
go look at them.

791

North Carolina and bliss is this sound.

797
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,640
That's the sound of my seven month year
old daughter reacting to my puppy dog

00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:51,690
licking her feet. Hi,

Pastrami at Katz's Deli in the
lower east side of New York City.

804
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:15,260
We live, we're five hours away from New
York and don't get there very often.

805
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:20,290
So I spend a lot of time in between
visits thinking about that first taste hot

806
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,090
pastrami. So for me,

807
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,380
that's plus I get to think about
some kind of almost unattainable

808
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,150
except that it is attainable.
I just show up in there it is.

809

This is radio lab and we're
talking about bliss so far.

832
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,360
I'm going to say we're not doing so
great. I mean we had a fleeting moment,

833
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:01,910
a dream that crumbled snowflakes
and evaporate in your hand,

834
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,450
but in the next story we're going
to shoot for bliss that lasts.

Hello, this is Mike in a Mike speak
up. Andy comes to us from our producer,

836
00:52:12,181 --> 00:52:14,910
Andy Mills. Can you hear me? I can
hear Ya. All right, so set this up.

837
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:16,950
Who is this guy? His name
is Mike Young. Right?

838
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,120
I called him up because of something that
happened to him a little over 50 years

839
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:21,721
ago. Let's see,

840
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:26,721
this was 1962 is something that he still
thinks about all these years later.

841
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,870
I was in my early twenties
22 something like that.

842
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:35,871
21 he was an undergraduate
at a theological school
in Boston and one day he

843
00:52:37,411 --> 00:52:41,760
received a very different
kind of religious education,

844
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:46,820
a very different kind of [inaudible]
though he event occurred on Good Friday

845
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,490
and it happened at the Boston
University Marsh Chapel.

846
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,730
He was sitting, not up in the main chapel,

847
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,860
but down in the little basement chapel,

848
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,850
and he was sitting with about
19 of his fellow classmates.

849
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,920
The Meditation Service was being piped
down to us from the chapel above.

850
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,110
They have speakers in the front of this
little chapel in the basement with organ

851
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:17,880
music and an excellent choir
and the voice of the preacher

852
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:24,243
[inaudible]

853
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:29,220
is this kind of famous guy named
Howard Thurman and we relaxed.

854
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,420
We're all good

855
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,780
and interesting ideas began
going off in my head. Wow.

856
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,810
Sometimes it was hard to pay attention
to what was going on in the room.

857
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:47,850
The things that resist than defy

858
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,720
and to,

859
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,860
we slid jet a right into the
silicide been experienced

860
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:59,450
what we did, he said silicide
yes. Was in magic mushrooms,

861
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,270
SRE, shrooms. You're gonna
have to explain that one.

862
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,140
This was actually something called
the Marsh Chapel experiment,

863
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,010
the Marsh Chapel experiment. And
it was run by this guy and let me,

864
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:15,290
his name was Walter Panky.
Very briefly summarize the man,

865
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:20,291
he was a graduate student at Harvard at
this time and he was studying religious

866
00:54:20,811 --> 00:54:21,644
experience.

867
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,760
No, this has also been
called the cosmic experience.

868
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,830
The transcendental experience
or the mystical. Which brands,

869
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:31,010
what exactly was he looking at? You know,
like, um, Christians, Muslims, Jews,

870
00:54:31,011 --> 00:54:34,070
mystics. Like what kind of things
do they all have in common?

871
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:39,370
So he did a bunch of research
and interviews and he came
up with a basic catalog

872
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:42,080
of the ingredients in
a religious experience.

873
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,500
And one day he's at
Harvard and he bumps into

874
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,990
turn on [inaudible] and drop out

875
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:54,170
that guy, Timothy Leary, he was actually
a teacher at Harvard at the time.

876
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,880
And he was famously giving
psychedelic drugs to undergrads.

877
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:03,090
They're teaching people how to
use very head. Yeah. Point is,

878
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,270
and in order to use your head,
you have to go out of your mind.

879
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,280
And when Panky got a chance to talk
to these students who had tripped,

880
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:16,430
he noticed pretty quick that they used
really similar language to the people

881
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,020
that he'd been studying.
And he started to wonder,

882
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,520
if you put people into the right
situation and you give them this drug,

883
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:28,290
could you induce actually
induce a religious experience?

884
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,980
So on that day in 1962 pinky
put 20 theological school
students into this church

885
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:38,670
basement. You know, during
this Good Friday service,

886
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
10 of them got a placebo and then 10
of them got a hefty dose of Psilocybin,

887
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,290
things in the room morphing,

888
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,770
which brings us back to Mike Young.

889
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:54,510
You would move your head and there'd
be an after image from the lights.

890
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:59,400
One point the visual effect
was especially powerful

891
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,250
and he had this one moment that
has just stuck with him ever since.

892
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,590
He's in the middle of a technicolor.

893
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,760
See there were bars of color and I was
floating through them and they were

894
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:14,750
floating through me, uh,
and it was just glorious.

895
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:19,810
And the bars of color then
resolved I into a wheel.

896
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:28,380
I was at the center and there was a
different color going out from me in every

897
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:32,800
possible direction. At first,

898
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:34,930
this was quite nice. Uh,

899
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:40,260
and then I realized that I had to
swim out one of those color bars

900
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,583
I had to.

901
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,270
And each of those different color
bars would be a whole different life

902
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:52,860
experience. And I could
choose anyone of those,

903
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,190
a la life experience
color bars that I wanted,

904
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:01,610
but I had to choose one
and I couldn't choose one.

905
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:07,570
It was very painful. It felt like my
insides were being ripped out of me

906
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,390
and I died.

907
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,680
And at that moment that I died, uh,

908
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,650
I heard Howard Thurman say,

909
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,380
I shall die,

910
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:30,440
but that is all that I shall do for death.

911
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,280
And I stopped dying.

912
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:40,160
Wow. Wow.

913
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,530
What are we supposed to make of that?
It is, it is strange. Yeah. And in fact,

914
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:50,360
this is actually right around the time
that there's this huge cultural backlash

915
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:51,410
against this drug.

916
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,500
By the end of 1962 you've got Harvard
making the decision that these experiments

917
00:57:57,261 --> 00:58:02,090
are not going to be done at their
university anymore. 63 evil man,

918
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,120
they fire Timothy Leary, empathy,
leery. He's out of there.

919
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:09,430
1970 congress outlaws, psychedelics, 1971

920
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,310
nearly every country in the world,
including the United States,

921
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,870
bans them from research is their
signatory to an international law.

922
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,900
Banning the use sail cultivation and
possession of dangerous drugs that have no

923
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:25,130
useful place in medicine.

924
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,730
I mean, on some level,

925
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:31,731
like I get that because like what
could you learn from a bunch of people

926
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:33,380
tripping like scientific. I mean,

927
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,620
I think that there actually is something
that we can learn from this. What?

928
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,480
Well, if you look at Mike Young on the
day that he walked into that chapel,

929
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:46,130
I was still a theological school
student. He was, you know,

930
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:50,060
he's experiencing doubts
without any real confidence.

931
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,090
That ministry was something
I was going to stay in.

932
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,360
But after this experiment at the chapel,

933
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,080
he went home to his wife
and uh, when I walked in,

934
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:05,081
my wife was very much aware that something
rather unusual had occurred to this

935
00:59:05,961 --> 00:59:10,050
guy she was married to. Did she
just, you carry yourself differently?

936
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:13,940
You should never been that explicit
about it. She just said she knew that,

937
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,410
that I had had some kind of
a major experience at first.

938
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:22,040
He just kind of wrote the whole
thing off, but time passed.

939
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:25,850
He couldn't stop thinking about the
death and the rebirth experience.

940
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,970
And to make a long story
short, if you fast forward,

941
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:33,350
I'm a unitarian universalist minister, um,

942
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,790
as a result of partly a result
of that drug experience.

943
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,550
I want to share with you
this morning, a little exit.

944
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,490
Jesus of the New Testament.
That's him. Yeah.

945
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,380
Story of the Good Samaritan.

946
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:53,000
He has been preaching for 45 years here.

947
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,520
Here's the thing that I
think it is really strange.

948
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:59,280
All of the people who took the drug that
day, those 10 who got the silicide but,

949
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:04,010
and not the placebo,
all but one that came.

950
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:09,080
Ministers really. So nine out
of 10 went into the mystery.

951
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:13,050
Nine out of 10 what about the others?
The Placebo Group? Yeah. None.

952
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:18,180
None according to Mike. Absolutely
none. Wow. That is interesting.

953
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,790
That was the first thing I was
like, wow, that's, that's crazy.

954
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:23,820
But at the same time, you know
it's really small sample set.

955
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,540
Who knows why anyone becomes a minister.
I'm sure it wasn't just the drugs.

956
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:30,180
You know, maybe they didn't even play
that big of a role for everyone else,

957
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:34,190
but this did make me, you
know, like more curious

958
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,280
what exactly is happening to people when
they take this drug and I was surprised

959
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:44,840
to find out that like right now there
are actually a few laboratories who are

960
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:48,890
starting to experiment with these
drugs. Again, we thought, well why not?

961
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,940
This is Roland, Roland
Griffis psychopharmacologist.

962
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,820
I studied the effects
of drugs on behavior.

963
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:59,000
He's at Johns Hopkins and
Hopkins for 40 years now.

964
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,990
He's really well known for
studying nicotine and Ritalin,

965
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:08,000
but he tells me that back in 2000 he
was reading about the old psilocybin

966
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:13,001
studies from the 60s and this is right
around the time when the Drug Enforcement

967
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,960
Administration and the FDA were starting
to loosen their rules on experimenting

968
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:22,940
with psychedelics so he applies and he
gets approval study of that Short had not

969
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:27,320
been approved for 30 years and I can
tell you that I've never had a protocol

970
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:32,321
that was as rigorously and carefully
reviewed and scrutinized from every angle

971
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,870
since no one had studied this
drug for like three decades.

972
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,420
He started with some
really basic questions.

973
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,360
How does this affect behavior
after people have taken this drug?

974
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:45,470
Like did they feel confused or
afraid? Is it habit forming?

975
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:50,400
And how we did this test was he has this
lab room at Johns Hopkins that he's,

976
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:52,870
he's made like really
nice and cozy. It's a,

977
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,580
it's an aesthetic living
room like environment.

978
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:59,240
There's a couch and the stereo
system. Then one at a time,

979
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:03,920
volunteers brought in and given a
hefty dose of psilocybin blindfolded,

980
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:07,850
and then they're asked to lay down
and direct their attention inward.

981
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:15,080
We were bringing people in two months
after sessions and asking them so, well,

982
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,470
you know, what was the session like?
And they filled out some questionnaires.

983
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:19,980
And the thing

984
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,980
that I really wasn't prepared for
was how salient and important these

985
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,530
experiences were said to
be on follow up. You know,

986
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:34,530
they were saying, well, it was really
important, you know, and I would say,

987
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:36,390
well, how important? And
they would say, oh, well,

988
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:40,780
it was the most important experience
in my life. And I'd go, what?

989
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:46,520
And they would say, yeah, you
know, it's like, um, you know,

990
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:50,520
like when my daughter was born,
that changed my world forever.

991
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:56,370
I recently lost my father and,
um, and I'll never forget that.

992
01:02:56,371 --> 01:02:58,410
And they'll say, you know,
it's Kinda like that.

993
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,340
And that's a totally
improbable. So we didn't,

994
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,690
we didn't have any metric that
could even assess that. So,

995
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:08,890
and what made things even weirder
for Rollin is that when he gave these

996
01:03:08,891 --> 01:03:10,180
volunteers a questionnaire,

997
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:15,210
about 75% of people are saying it's in
the top five most personally meaningful

998
01:03:16,691 --> 01:03:21,280
and spiritually significant experiences
that there lie a vast majority.

999
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:25,140
We're talking about like it's a
spiritual experience, huh? So rollin,

1000
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:30,160
he went back to look at Pankey's
studies from the 1960s about the basic

1001
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:32,860
ingredients that make up
a religious experience.

1002
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:36,190
Let me look at the characteristic,
a very summary list first,

1003
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,200
the characteristics of awe and wonder.

1004
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:41,370
Everyone would report that they felt like
they were in the presence of something

1005
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:42,310
great and enormous. Yeah.

1006
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,300
The second characteristic is
transcendence of time and space.

1007
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:49,630
People describe time slowing
down or space getting weird.

1008
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:54,310
The third characteristic have to do with
mood very deeply felt positive. Mood.

1009
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:57,310
Fourth, and I'm skipping over a few here.

1010
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:00,010
Unity. This is a sense of cosmic oneness,

1011
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:04,130
this feeling which basically intense
connection to everything around you.

1012
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,450
The part of everything that is the whole
universe and even every blade of grass

1013
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:08,590
and grain of sand and so forth.

1014
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,900
These are words that people
use in describing in any way.

1015
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:15,210
So based on this one guys, research
and keep in mind, you know,

1016
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:16,980
a lot of people have
different opinions about this.

1017
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:22,010
Roland believes that you can actually
take this little drug and for a majority

1018
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:26,010
of people you can induce
a religious experience.

1019
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,850
But I you don't, you, I don't know,

1020
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:31,640
soon as you call it that then
I'm starting to think, hmm,

1021
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:36,100
don't know [inaudible]
this is a real, a real,

1022
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:38,290
I mean I don't know you guys,

1023
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,200
but for someone who has to
take this very seriously,

1024
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:46,370
because to say that you can pop a
pill and then in some shortcut fashion

1025
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,960
suddenly get this experience that
hitherto had been very rare and had been

1026
01:04:52,721 --> 01:04:57,721
assigned the values of grace to say
that is to say any enormous thing.

1027
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,130
Well it sounds like, it
sounds like you're not, I,

1028
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,770
I'm guessing how you're taking it, Robert,
is to say that a d values the thing.

1029
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:07,400
Yeah, I do value that. It kind of does
the opposite for me. Well, really,

1030
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,650
I mean [inaudible]

1031
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:13,200
when I hear these stories from, from
like all the people in these studies,

1032
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,250
it reminds me like I've,

1033
01:05:15,251 --> 01:05:20,251
I've had these like very meaningful
experiences that I didn't think would last

1034
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:26,220
on a pill. Did you have little or no,
not, not a pill. No drugs. So what,

1035
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:29,160
so what happened? What, what
are you talking about? Well,

1036
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:31,770
it goes back to like
when I was a Christian,

1037
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:36,860
I used to be an evangelical Christian
and when I was about 15 I was at a church

1038
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:43,741
camp and me and some of my best friends
were all gathered around a campfire.

1039
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:48,430
He was hot and the stars
were all bright and shiny.

1040
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:52,280
I remember they were playing
the song that I really liked.

1041
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,400
And you know that feeling that you get
when when you in a crowd of people are

1042
01:05:57,621 --> 01:06:02,060
all singing like really loud some
song that you all really love. Yeah,

1043
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,490
sure. And as we're all singing the song,

1044
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:09,240
I remember my friend who wasn't raised
in the faith like me leaning over to me

1045
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,460
and saying that like, he wanted to
accept Jesus and be a Christian.

1046
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:18,900
And he asked, what am I supposed to
do? And I remember that being like,

1047
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,400
great, great. It's not
even the word for it.

1048
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:27,570
Like in this one moment I got caught up
in something that just felt so enormous.

1049
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,650
It's hard for me to
explain how it's felt like.

1050
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:37,240
It's hard to describe how I
felt like we were all one.

1051
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:40,750
Like there was something
powerful that was,

1052
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,560
that was like both over
us but also inside of us.

1053
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:50,830
And so much has changed since then
that sometimes I look back and I think,

1054
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:53,450
did that happen?

1055
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:59,110
Like did I hallucinate like some dude
on drugs because that friend who,

1056
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,710
uh, reached over to me, he's dead now.

1057
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,640
That faith that I was a part of, I left it

1058
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:12,870
like all I have is this weird feeling

1059
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:16,780
that I can remember. That's good.

1060
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,680
And even though you're not
a Christian anymore, you,

1061
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,670
you still have that feeling. Oh yeah.

1062
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,870
But what is it about the
idea that, that feeling,

1063
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:28,680
that campfire feeling could be triggered
by a pill and that maybe that's what

1064
01:07:28,681 --> 01:07:31,050
was happening to those
folks in Rollins study?

1065
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,470
What is it about that idea
that helps you? For me,

1066
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:38,730
like I see something concrete,
you know, like I see,

1067
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:44,120
I see. I see something that's
harder to write off. How so? Well,

1068
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,260
if I can go back into reporter mode,

1069
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:51,320
I will introduce you to one more guy who
I think is going to help you understand

1070
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:55,380
what I'm talking about. Hello,
this is Charlie. Charlie Busan.

1071
01:07:55,470 --> 01:08:00,330
He's a longtime smoker. No, let's
start at 17 smoked for 40 years.

1072
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,810
Pack a day. Breakfast, coffee,
talking on the phone. Wait.

1073
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:07,440
Why are we talking about smoking? How
Roland's new study's doing right now?

1074
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:09,960
His pilot program that he's
just started a few years ago.

1075
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:15,000
[inaudible] is trying to see if there's
something in the transformation that you

1076
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:19,280
have in, in the siliciden experience
that can help smokers quit smoking.

1077
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,810
Really stick with me. They
gave me a pill, blue capsule,

1078
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,260
and he closed his eyes and like Mike,

1079
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:30,710
he says he had a hallucination
that changed him.

1080
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:33,890
The thing that I found so amazing,

1081
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:38,891
the one thing that was more amazing than
anything else was when I was on those

1082
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:44,270
saw mountain. This is a
mountain in his head. Yes.

1083
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:49,370
When I had traveled to
the very top, uh, I was,

1084
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,950
uh, looking out over this greatness,

1085
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:00,160
this vista of everything he says he
was just this microscopic thing he was,

1086
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,480
he was so small and it was so big.

1087
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:07,540
But my experience at this one place was
so exalted because he was struck by this

1088
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:14,594
feeling,

1089
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:19,640
this deep feeling that
we were the same thing.

1090
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,300
We were the same.

1091
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:28,550
This right here is another
hallmark of these experiences.

1092
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You're somehow confronted with this
radical shift in scale and things that

1093
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:38,210
formerly felt like too big for
you to deal with. They suddenly,

1094
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,490
they suddenly look different.

1095
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:45,520
We had one person involved
in her cigarette smoking
study who had had a dose of

1096
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:50,390
Psilocybin and in the
course of that session,

1097
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:55,070
the idea of smoking came up
to him and he said, you know,

1098
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:00,071
it was like a fly that had landed on his
arm and he just took his finger and he

1099
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:06,010
flicked it off and he said he was
done with it. Done, done. [inaudible]

1100
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,900
and that's exactly how it was for
Charlie. No morning afterwards.

1101
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:13,230
He says he just didn't
want cigarettes anymore.

1102
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:19,680
They just weren't an issue anymore.
Huh. And how long has he been off of it?

1103
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:25,170
Three years. Wow. Now this
is just a tiny pilot program.

1104
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,540
I don't think that we should
make too much out of it yet,

1105
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:30,780
but the insight I feel
like is like, because,

1106
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:34,920
because like Charlie has this
real experience, like it's not,

1107
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:37,680
it's not a question of like
something invisible like faith,

1108
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,530
but it's like a tangible reality for me.

1109
01:10:40,531 --> 01:10:44,700
It's like the closest thing I can come
to having some kind of real evidence that

1110
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:48,150
what happened to me was real
with the campfire. Right. To me,

1111
01:10:48,151 --> 01:10:53,151
the mystery is you've done this occasional
thing with an artificial stimulus,

1112
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,680
had a extraordinary with temporary
feeling and then mysteriously it isn't

1113
01:10:58,681 --> 01:11:01,770
temporary. He just goes on and on. Yeah.

1114
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:06,360
Do we have any idea why it persists?
Well, Roland has a very educated hunch.

1115
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:11,010
I asked him about this and he's looking
right now at getting in there and doing

1116
01:11:11,011 --> 01:11:12,810
research with some new SMRI machines.

1117
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:16,770
But his hunch is that the
siliciden drug experience,

1118
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:19,740
it somehow rewires the brain.

1119
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:24,770
We're talking about rewiring a personality
and a fundamental machine programming

1120
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:29,760
level. Like he calls this
experience a rearranging experience.

1121
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:34,180
Huh? You know, maybe,
maybe one day science,

1122
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:38,560
we'll figure out what's happening in the
brain of a person that's experiencing

1123
01:11:38,561 --> 01:11:39,400
something like this.

1124
01:11:39,401 --> 01:11:44,401
But one of the things about this that
troubles me like as a reporter and then

1125
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,700
even like personally is that
going back to Walter Panky,

1126
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,720
like remember his list of ingredients
from earlier, his final characteristic.

1127
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:52,830
Yeah.

1128
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,590
The final characteristic that
I'd like to mention here,

1129
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,890
final ingredient was

1130
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:57,820
the characteristic of
alleged enough ability,

1131
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:01,330
which means that the people who have
such an experience claim that it can't be

1132
01:12:01,331 --> 01:12:04,600
described in words, that it's
nonverbal, basically indescribable.

1133
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:07,390
And that's one of the main things that
I'm going to take away from all this.

1134
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:07,571
I mean,

1135
01:12:07,571 --> 01:12:12,571
talking to Roland and Mike and Charlie
is just how hard it is to talk about the

1136
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:17,160
thing that I've just spent
the last 20 minutes trying

1137
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:21,650
to talk about. I understood something,

1138
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:26,390
some, um,

1139
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,230
life, uh,

1140
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,480
suddenly eternal truth.

1141
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,060
These words really don't match
the thing. I was at the top,

1142
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:43,990
I was feeling divine source of,

1143
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:47,270
um, of, um,

1144
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:54,850
self awareness that I'm sorry,

1145
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:57,500
said trick of words. I guess it's a

1146
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,003
got

1147
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:07,020
larger thanks to producer Andy Mills.
Thanks to you guys for listening.
