00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.951
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Factoring this just gives us x plus 6 times x plus 2 equals 0. We know that

00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:10.075
we'll make this equation true if either x plus 6 is equal to 0 or if x plus 2 is

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:15.002
equal to 0. So we can solve for x in both of those cases. So x can either be

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.356
negative 6 or it can be negative 2.
