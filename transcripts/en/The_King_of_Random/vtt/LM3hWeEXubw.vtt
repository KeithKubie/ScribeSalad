00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
In today's video,
we're going to take a look

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.800
at the relationship
between dry ice and Coke,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.682
how they react,

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.500
and how big
of a reaction we can get.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.920
[Music]

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.700
You've probably seen
some cool videos,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.500
or played around
with the reaction

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.660
between Diet Coke and Mentos.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.360
This is a cool
little experiment.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.052
The mint surface on these Mentos
has tons of tiny tiny points

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.360
that work as nucleation sites
inside of the soda.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.640
The nucleation sites
pull the carbon dioxide

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:31.797
out of the soda
where it's dissolved,

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.268
and it suddenly increases

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:35.900
in size massively erupting up
out of the bottle.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.900
Lots of people have done
experiments with this,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.700
and it's really fun
to try at home as

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.100
long as you're safe about it.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.600
Well, we want to
try something else,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500
and that's the relationship
between these carbonated sodas

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.660
and dry ice.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.200
The dry ice can act much
the same as the Mentos with lots

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.000
of tiny little nucleation sites.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.452
It pulls carbon dioxide
out of the soda quickly,

00:00:54.452 --> 00:00:55.600
with the added benefit

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.029
that the dry ice
itself starts to sublimate,

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:59.386
and that expands as well,

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:02.209
adding even more carbon dioxide
into the mixture.

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.700
Hopefully, giving us
an even bigger reaction.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.800
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.585
We're going to see

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:08.200
what it takes to get
the best reaction

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.300
between dry ice and Coke,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.380
and then we're going to try

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.300
and scale that up
to something really impressive.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.200
Here we go.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.472
We're going to do side-by-side
tests of Coke Zero, Diet Coke,

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:17.400
and regular Coke.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.790
One at a time though.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.900
Here goes Coke Zero
with 3 Mentos.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.180
[Music]

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.700
Right about there, I'd say.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.315
Not bad.

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:29.047
Not bad.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.400
Decent little reaction.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.220
There it goes.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.900
Little mushroom fountain.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.700
That's fine if it
goes out of screen,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.000
it's just to show
it reacting is the fun part.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.620
First was Coke Zero,
now is Diet Coke.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.100
3, 2, 1.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.140
[Music]

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.040
It may be went just
a smidge higher,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.180
but the most part, the Diet Coke
and the Coke Zero reacted

00:01:57.188 --> 00:01:59.000
almost exactly the same way.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.260
[Music]

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.400
I would call that a noticeably
smaller reaction.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.560
The Coke Zero and the diet Coke
both got to about here.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.700
The regular Coke, I'd say,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.300
only six to eight inches
above the bottle.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.860
[Music]

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.940
We got a pretty good launch,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.300
but of course, we want more
out of it than that.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.000
So, this time,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.500
we're going to see
what happens if we

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.900
constrict the opening
a little bit more.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.400
This funnel here has

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.300
a much smaller opening
on it than our Coke bottle.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.448
So we're going to try

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:42.400
and attach the funnel on
to the top of the Coke bottle,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.700
and then drop
the Mentos in afterward.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.379
Now this is going to be
a little bit tricky.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.200
So here's my thought.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.500
We'll have three Mentos taped
together just on the outside.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.905
That tape will be attached
to a piece of string,

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:54.800
which will come up
through the funnel,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.000
and then we can let go,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.800
and that should drop
the Mentos down in.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.400
That point, shooting
our little geyser up

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.800
through our much
constricted funnel nozzle.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:26.840
[Music]

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.740
The drop.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.220
3, oh-- 1.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.100
That probably went
eight to ten feet up in the air.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.700
This little nozzle here,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.600
the opening is probably
1/5 to 1/8 the area

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600
of the regular
Coke bottle opening.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.341
So it does have
to go a lot faster,

00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.800
and when it's going faster,
it goes a lot higher.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.200
Let's move onto dry ice.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.640
Now, we're moving onto dry ice,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.500
and we're going to do
two little test.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.880
We're going to do single lumps
that are just barely small

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.957
that they can fit through
the nozzle of the bottle,

00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:00.021
and then we're going to try

00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:01.672
a crushing up a bunch
of dry ice powder,

00:04:01.672 --> 00:04:02.900
and dropping that in as well.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900
So first up, single lumps.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.200
Coke Zero and single
lump of dry ice.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.280
Here it goes.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.580
[Music]

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.251
A very quick foamy reaction in
this state with a single lump.

00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.700
It wasn't more volume,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.550
and it didn't go higher than it
did with the three Mentos,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.368
but we still,

00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:25.685
as you saw,
got a very quick reaction.

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:26.373
Same thing.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.420
Diet Coke.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.660
[Music]

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.820
Once again, quick reaction,
lots of volume.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.353
A lot of soda was pushed out,

00:04:37.353 --> 00:04:40.720
but it didn't go as high as it
did with the Mentos.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.200
It wasn't as fast.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.020
All right, regular Coke,
dry ice, single lump.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.640
[Music]

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.920
As expected.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.300
I got a lot more of the smell

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.543
of the Coca-Cola
with the regular,

00:04:54.543 --> 00:04:56.820
as opposed to either
of the diet versions.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.500
And I think we actually lost
more total volume

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:01.700
with the dry ice.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.260
It just took longer.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.500
All right, let's try
powdered dry ice.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:14.500
[Music]

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.040
My goal with the powder dry ice
is to have approximately

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.960
the same volume as three Mentos.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.120
So I think that should give
us the best comparison

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120
of the reactions.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.900
I'm going to take the powdered
dry ice from this funnel,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.660
and pour it down through
this funnel into the soda.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.500
We'll see what kind
of reaction we get.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.180
[Music]

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.030
It didn't sink.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.200
Oh, it didn't all go in either.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.000
It got frozen.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.199
All right, we're going to try
adding a little bit more.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.149
Some of it didn't quite
make it through.

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:47.710
The funnel got a little clogged.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.300
Funnel likes to get
a little bit clogged.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.100
So this is kind of interesting.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.300
We're getting a very
very quick reaction

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.100
with the dust with the really
fine powdered stuff.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.129
It's actually reacting

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.000
so quickly that it
just hits the surface,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.200
and then there's so
much bubbles and foam

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.183
that the rest of the ice powder
isn't actually sinking

00:06:06.183 --> 00:06:07.007
into the cola.

00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:08.760
So with these larger pieces,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.400
we're getting more
of a reaction.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.384
We just have to be able
to get them all in at once.

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:14.825
So I'm going to try going more
of those slightly larger pieces

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:15.685
into this bottle,

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:17.000
and pouring it in this one

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.500
without any of the small stuff
to cause foam that will stop it.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.420
We've got a bunch

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.620
of pebble sized pieces
of dry ice, and hopefully,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.300
those will flow in
and actually sink a little bit.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.760
Here it goes.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.420
[Music]

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.440
Yeah, kind of like that.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.560
That was a much faster reaction.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.000
Still didn't have a ton
of sinking so I don't think

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.300
our height was any better
than with the Mentos,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.600
but the speed of the reaction
was quite impressive.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.400
That got me...

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.900
This is one of the reasons
we like using Diet Coke,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.157
is it doesn't have sugar in it

00:06:49.157 --> 00:06:51.279
so it doesn't get sticky
when you get coated in it.

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.429
Still gonna want to wash,

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:53.900
but I won't be
sticky until then.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.900
I actually think
that from here,

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.400
we just want to scale this up.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.000
I want to go big,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and rather than using one
of these little Coke bottles,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.100
we're going way up.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.800
We're gonna use
a 5 gallon bucket.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.600
For this larger bucket,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.517
we're going to use
our larger funnel

00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:11.400
that still has a pretty
small opening right there.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.438
So here's the plan.

00:07:12.438 --> 00:07:15.500
Much like with our mementos
that we dropped into the coke

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.000
through the funnel
on the string,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.100
we are going to attach
our dry ice to a mesh surface.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.300
We're going to sort of
make a bag out of it.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.440
The bag will be suspended
underneath the lid,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.133
and we're going
to lower it all down.

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:29.077
We're going to clip this lid on.

00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:30.136
They're already be

00:07:30.136 --> 00:07:32.400
several gallons of
Coca-Cola inside this.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.847
I think we're gonna
use the Diet Coke.

00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:35.100
I like the reaction of that one.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.000
So, Diet Coke, several gallons.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.400
Dry ice, 10 pounds at least.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.800
Whatever we can fit in

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.600
between the Coke
and the surface.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.000
We're going to seal this down.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.844
We're going to actually
add some additional tape

00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:47.100
to make sure it's really strong,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.700
and we're going to let go
of the string, and hopefully,

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.300
we will get an almighty launched
through the sky.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:08:22.900

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.240
Up to where the dry ice
is will be full of Coke,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.600
and then, by letting go
of the strings,

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.920
all of that dry ice will drop
down into the Coke all at once.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.900
Hopefully, we get just
an absolutely insane reaction.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.940
Okay, here we go.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.460
Whole lot of Diet Coke.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.300
Hopefully, we don't lose too
much of the fizz by pouring it

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.600
into this separate bucket.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.200
This is the last we're
gonna able to pour in

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.900
before it's too high up.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:55.860
[Music]

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.140
Okay, I'm ready when you are.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.410
I'm ready.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.320
3, 2, 1.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.520
[Music]

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.380
Well, in terms of volume...

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.760
[Music]

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.900
We had a lot.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.180
[Music]

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.360
I'm going to tip it.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:28.160
[Music]

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.900
It's a little strong
for the bucket seal.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.000
I think I can get another
another shot out of this.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.560
[Music]

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.820
That's a weird kind
of Coca-Cola gun right there.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.960
Refill a little bit,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.400
put another chunk
of dry ice into that.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.920
[Music]

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.280
I'm trying this again.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.360
Might help the lid
stay on better.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.800
Might just make it louder
when the lid pops off.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:17.580
[Music]

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.940
There's the louder
when the bucket pops open.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.800
That was, thinking might happen.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:28.520
[Music]

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.480
And that wire mesh,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.640
which I'm sure
is so healthy.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:46.520
[Music]

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.900
Oh, it's leaking.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.140
Oh, it popped.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.900
Definitely leaked
before popping.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.760
[Music]

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160
Slushy.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.600
Guys, that's not all.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.999
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:11:02.999 --> 00:11:05.372
That box up at the top is going
to take you to our last video.

00:11:05.372 --> 00:11:06.434
You should go check that out.

00:11:06.434 --> 00:11:07.282
The other box shows you

00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:09.018
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:10.508
And if you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:11:10.508 --> 00:11:11.756
you'll be subscribed
to the channel.

00:11:11.756 --> 00:11:13.967
That way, you never gonna miss
out on one of our cool videos.

00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:15.025
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:15.025 --> 00:11:16.219
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.340
Talk to you then.
