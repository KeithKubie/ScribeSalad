00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.880
We've all done it.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.260
We are so close to achieving a goal, and then...

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.220
Excuse me, where do you think you're going?

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.200
There they are. Getting in our own way.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.840
Over there.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.380
You're not.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Can you just-

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.140
No! Just turn around!

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.740
But I like-

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.240
*Hiss*

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.340
*Hiss*

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.600
Okay.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.240
There are many ways that self-sabotaging can manifest itself, some of the more obvious ones being procrastination,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.860
okay, let's do a video...

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.220
Write a vi-de-o...

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.020
I'll just look at Instagram for some

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.320
inspiration

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.380
*wailing*

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840
OH my god, how she do dat?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.840
Ewwww...

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.020
My god, UGH.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.000
Yeah, video.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.600
Okay.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.620
Yeah, okay.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940
Okay, I got it. Yeah.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.440
Yeah, okay.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.300
Okay,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.760
just write it, I'll write it, its gonna be great.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.960
self-medicating with alcohol and drugs,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.960
There's so beautiful, please don't tell me Jerome gon' die

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.440
Or my personal favorite

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.570
comfort eating.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:19.860
"Hi I have your post mates order? Four pies, right?" and of course there are more subtle ways that self-sabotaging can exist like having

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.680
aspirations that you never moved toward or having such a fear of abandonment that you cut ties once anything gets too

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.780
emotional or too serious or even just practicing alienating behavior that pushes people away

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.120
There are many reasons why we engage in self-destructive behavior, and for me after my sister died

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.059
I felt like I didn't deserve to have a good life when she was sitting in an urn in my parents living room, and so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.419
subconsciously, I would make all these very small choices that over time led to me having a miserable miserable life.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.370
I would choose partners poorly

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.649
I would have substance abuse problems

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.019
And I would run away from anything that made me happy

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.009
It took years of therapy to realize that I was even doing this and even years longer to actually

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.150
Stop doing it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.100
But once we realized that the underlying cause of my self-sabotage behavior was feelings of unworthiness

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.979
And guilt we were actually able to work

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.169
Towards stopping that my therapist and I worked to create a dialogue that I could have with myself each time

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.800
I noticed that I was being destructive, so I would have to ask myself. "Why am I doing this?"

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.419
 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.200
well

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.390
"I think I'm doing this because it makes me really happy and that makes me scared because I don't think I deserve to be happy"

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.879
"Why don't you deserve to be happy?" "Because I feel really guilty that my sister's never gonna have any emotions again."

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.079
"But is it your fault that she's never gonna have any emotions again?" "Technically, no.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.109
I mean suicide was totally her decision if it were up to me

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.269
I would have said 'please don't do that'" and I would have to have this very logical Q&amp;A with myself until it would

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.900
Emotionally resonate with me that it was all coming from an illogical place of fear if you engage in

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.130
self-sabotaging behavior

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.400
I really urge you to figure out why you're doing it and when

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.820
Because the more you actually notice it the easier it is to stop you just requires you

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.389
Challenging this negative thought process again and again and again because on some level you'll intellectually understand it

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.880
But it takes a while for it to actually sink in but before you know it years and years of hard work later

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.770
you'll eventually stop - yay!
