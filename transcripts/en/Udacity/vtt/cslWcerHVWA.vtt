00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
It's a bit ironic that although theoretical computer science

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.600
is very precise, there are sometimes very confusing naming conventions,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.660
and since many students,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.200
at least those I have had have been confused by this,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.780
I just quickly wanted to clear one thing up.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.030
You will sometimes read that the Halting Problem

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.030
is semi-decidable

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.560
and we have to say that it's un-decidable,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.420
so which one of these 2 is it?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.500
Is it undecidable or is it half-way decidable?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.580
And paradoxically,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.800
it's both, and let me explain why.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.200
So assume that we have a program, P,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.570
and we want to determine if it halts,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.130
so we want to know, does the program stop at a certain point in time,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.220
and the answer to that, as you know,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.570
can either be yes or no.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.870
Now let's think about the 2 cases that are possible.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.510
So the first one of those 2 cases is that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.550
P stops, and my question for you is,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.220
if P does stop,

00:00:54.220 --> 99:59:59.000
can we a yes after a finite amount of time?
